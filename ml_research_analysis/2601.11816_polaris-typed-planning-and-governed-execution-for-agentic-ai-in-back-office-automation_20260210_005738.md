core_contribution: POLARIS introduces a governed orchestration framework for enterprise
  back-office automation that enforces typed planning, policy-aware selection, and
  validator-gated execution over LLM agents. By treating workflows as typed DAGs with
  structured plan diversity and compliance-aware reasoning, it achieves micro-F1 of
  0.81 on SROIE and 0.95-1.00 precision on anomaly routing while producing auditable
  execution traces.

# POLARIS: Typed Planning and Governed Execution for Agentic AI in Back-Office Automation

## Quick Facts

- POLARIS introduces a governed orchestration framework for enterprise back-office automation that enforces typed planning, policy-aware selection, and validator-gated execution over LLM agents

## Executive Summary
POLARIS presents a comprehensive framework for governing agentic AI in enterprise back-office automation through typed planning and policy-aware execution. The system treats workflows as typed directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with structured plan diversity and compliance-aware reasoning. By implementing validator-gated execution and compiled policy guardrails, POLARIS achieves high precision in document processing tasks while maintaining auditable execution traces. The framework demonstrates micro-F1 of 0.81 on SROIE and 0.95-1.00 precision on anomaly routing, establishing a benchmark for policy-aligned agentic AI in regulated settings.

## Method Summary
POLARIS implements a governed orchestration framework that enforces typed planning and policy-aware execution for LLM agents in enterprise back-office automation. The system treats workflows as typed DAGs, enabling structured plan diversity and compliance-aware reasoning. Key components include typed task decomposition, policy compilation for guardrail enforcement, and validator-gated execution with bounded repair loops. The framework integrates LLM agents with structured policy enforcement mechanisms to prevent side effects before they occur, producing auditable execution traces throughout the automation process.

## Key Results
- Achieves micro-F1 of 0.81 on SROIE document processing benchmark
- Demonstrates 0.95-1.00 precision on anomaly routing tasks
- Reduces human intervention through bounded repair loops and policy guardrails that block side effects before occurrence

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
POLARIS works by treating workflows as typed DAGs with structured plan diversity and compliance-aware reasoning. The framework enforces policy-aware selection through compiled policy guardrails that prevent side effects before they occur. Validator-gated execution ensures that each step meets compliance requirements before proceeding, while bounded repair loops handle failures within defined constraints. This approach creates auditable execution traces that maintain accountability in regulated environments, addressing the critical need for governance in enterprise agentic AI systems.

## Foundational Learning
- **Typed DAG Representations**: Needed for structured workflow modeling; quick check: verify DAG consistency and type safety
- **Policy Compilation Mechanisms**: Required for automated guardrail enforcement; quick check: test policy coverage and edge case handling
- **Validator-Gated Execution**: Essential for compliance enforcement; quick check: validate execution traces against policy requirements
- **Bounded Repair Loops**: Critical for failure recovery within constraints; quick check: measure repair success rates and intervention frequency
- **LLM Agent Integration**: Necessary for intelligent task execution; quick check: evaluate agent performance on representative tasks

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Policy Compiler -> Typed Planner -> Validator Gate -> LLM Agent -> Execution Trace
**Critical Path**: User Request → Policy Compilation → Typed Planning → Execution → Validation → Audit Trail
**Design Tradeoffs**: Prioritizes policy compliance over execution flexibility, accepts potential performance overhead for auditability
**Failure Signatures**: Policy violations, type mismatches, validation failures, repair loop exhaustion
**First Experiments**: 1) Single-task execution with simple policies, 2) Multi-step workflow with complex dependencies, 3) Policy violation scenarios testing guardrail effectiveness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses primarily on document processing and anomaly routing, limiting generalization assessment to other enterprise domains
- Typed DAG representations may constrain flexibility in dynamic environments with rapidly evolving task structures
- Policy compilation effectiveness depends heavily on completeness and accuracy of initial policy specifications

## Confidence
**High**: Framework's ability to produce auditable execution traces and achieve strong precision on SROIE and anomaly routing tasks
**Medium**: Claims about reduced human intervention and practical effectiveness of bounded repair loops in real-world deployments
**Low**: Scalability claims regarding performance under heavy concurrent workloads or with very large policy sets

## Next Checks
1. Deploy POLARIS in a multi-domain enterprise environment to assess generalization beyond document processing and anomaly routing
2. Conduct longitudinal studies measuring policy maintenance overhead and evolution as business requirements change
3. Benchmark POLARIS performance under concurrent execution scenarios with varying policy complexity and task volume
