# An Agile Method for Implementing Retrieval Augmented Generation Tools in Industrial SMEs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.21024
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21024
- Reference count: 0
- 86% correct answers, zero incorrect responses, high user adoption

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces EASI-RAG, a structured, agile method for deploying Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tools in industrial SMEs. Based on method engineering principles, EASI-RAG defines roles, activities, and techniques to facilitate RAG adoption in resource-constrained environments. The method was validated through a real-world case in an environmental testing laboratory, where a RAG tool was implemented to answer operator queries using operational procedures. The system was deployed in under a month by a team with no prior RAG experience and iteratively improved based on user feedback.

## Method Summary
EASI-RAG is an agile methodology that combines method engineering principles with practical implementation guidance for RAG deployment in SMEs. The method defines specific roles, activities, and techniques that enable teams without prior RAG experience to successfully implement and deploy RAG tools within constrained timeframes. The approach emphasizes iterative development, user feedback integration, and practical considerations for industrial environments.

## Key Results
- Successfully deployed RAG tool in under one month with no prior RAG experience
- Achieved 86% correct answers with zero incorrect responses
- Demonstrated high user adoption and satisfaction in industrial testing environment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by providing a structured framework that reduces complexity and risk for SME teams implementing RAG solutions. By defining clear roles, activities, and techniques, EASI-RAG eliminates ambiguity and enables focused execution. The agile approach allows for rapid iteration and user feedback incorporation, ensuring the tool meets actual user needs while maintaining quality standards.

## Foundational Learning
- **Method Engineering Principles**: Provides systematic approach to designing implementation methods - needed for reproducibility across different contexts; quick check: verify method components align with established engineering practices
- **RAG Architecture Fundamentals**: Understanding of retrieval and generation components - needed for effective implementation and troubleshooting; quick check: confirm understanding of vector databases and language model integration
- **Agile Implementation Practices**: Iterative development and user feedback cycles - needed for rapid adaptation and quality improvement; quick check: validate sprint planning and review processes

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: User Interface -> RAG Pipeline -> Vector Database -> Operational Procedures -> Language Model

**Critical Path**: User query → Document retrieval → Context generation → Answer synthesis → Response delivery

**Design Tradeoffs**: Speed vs. accuracy in retrieval, cost vs. performance in language model selection, simplicity vs. feature richness in user interface

**Failure Signatures**: Poor retrieval precision, irrelevant context inclusion, hallucination in generated responses, slow query response times

**First Experiments**:
1. Implement basic retrieval with small document set to validate indexing pipeline
2. Test language model with controlled context to verify generation quality
3. Deploy minimal viable interface with simulated user queries for end-to-end testing

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Single case study limits generalizability across different industrial sectors
- Rapid deployment timeline raises questions about long-term sustainability and maintenance
- Evaluation lacks comparison baselines with alternative approaches or industry standards

## Confidence
- High confidence in feasibility of structured RAG implementation in SMEs
- Medium confidence in method's generalizability across diverse industrial sectors
- Low confidence in long-term system performance and scalability

## Next Checks
1. Conduct multi-site case studies across different industrial sectors (manufacturing, healthcare, logistics) to assess method transferability and identify sector-specific adaptations needed
2. Implement longitudinal evaluation tracking system performance, user satisfaction, and maintenance effort over 6-12 months to understand sustainability and evolution requirements
3. Compare EASI-RAG outcomes against baseline approaches (rule-based systems, standard RAG implementations) using standardized evaluation metrics across multiple use cases to establish relative effectiveness
