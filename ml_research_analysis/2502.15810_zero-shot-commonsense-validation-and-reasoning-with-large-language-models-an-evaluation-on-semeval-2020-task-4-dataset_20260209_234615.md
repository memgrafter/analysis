# Zero-Shot Commonsense Validation and Reasoning with Large Language Models: An Evaluation on SemEval-2020 Task 4 Dataset

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.15810
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15810
- Reference count: 8
- LLaMA3-70B achieved 98.40% accuracy on commonsense validation (Task A)

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates Large Language Models (LLMs) on commonsense reasoning tasks from the SemEval-2020 Task 4 dataset using zero-shot prompting without fine-tuning. The study tests LLaMA3-70B, Gemma2-9B, and Mixtral-8x7B on two tasks: commonsense validation (identifying implausible statements) and commonsense explanation (selecting the best reasoning for implausibility). Results show that larger LLMs outperform previous fine-tuned models in validation but struggle with explanation selection, highlighting limitations in inferential reasoning. The study concludes that while LLMs excel at commonsense validation, they require further adaptation to improve explanation generation.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates LLMs using zero-shot prompting on the SemEval-2020 Task 4 dataset with two subtasks: Task A (Commonsense Validation - identify which of two statements is against common sense) and Task B (Commonsense Explanation - select the best reason from three options explaining why a statement is implausible). Models tested include LLaMA3-70B, LLaMA3-8B, Gemma2-9B, and Mixtral-8x7B via GroqCloud API with no fine-tuning. The test set contains 1,000 entries per task. Accuracy is measured for both tasks and compared against fine-tuned baselines and human performance.

## Key Results
- LLaMA3-70B achieved highest accuracy of 98.40% in Task A (commonsense validation)
- Mixtral-8x7B showed weakest performance at 66.00% in Task A due to output format inconsistencies
- For Task B, LLaMA3-70B scored 93.40% while Mixtral-8x7B scored only 50.90%, indicating challenges in causal reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Scale-dependent reasoning emergence enables commonsense validation without task-specific training
- Mechanism: Larger parameter count correlates with improved validation accuracy, suggesting commonsense knowledge distributes across representations during pre-training
- Core assumption: Pre-training corpora contain sufficient commonsense patterns that scale-dependent architectures can internalize
- Evidence anchors: LLaMA3-70B achieved 98.40% vs LLaMA3-8B at 84.4% in Task A; HellaSwag-Pro notes LLMs may "memorize expression patterns" vs. truly understanding commonsense

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Recognition and explanation engage different capabilities with measurable performance gap
- Mechanism: Task A requires binary classification of surface-level plausibility; Task B requires evaluating multiple justifications against real-world causal structures
- Core assumption: The Task A→Task B performance drop reflects genuine reasoning limitations rather than task design artifacts
- Evidence anchors: Models effectively identify implausible statements but face challenges in selecting most relevant explanation; Task B demands deeper understanding of reasoning patterns and cause-effect relationships

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Zero-shot prompting leverages implicit knowledge representations but remains sensitive to output format constraints
- Mechanism: Models generate responses based on instruction following without gradient updates; inconsistent formatting degrades measured accuracy
- Core assumption: Model's internal reasoning is sound but externalization via structured output fails
- Evidence anchors: Mixtral's lower accuracy attributed to output inconsistencies requiring more post-processing steps

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Zero-shot prompting**
  - Why needed here: Core evaluation methodology—models receive task instructions without fine-tuning or examples
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why zero-shot differs from few-shot and fine-tuning paradigms?

- Concept: **Classification vs. multiple-choice reasoning**
  - Why needed here: Task A (binary validation) and Task B (select from 3 explanations) have different cognitive demands and error modes
  - Quick check question: Why might a model correctly identify an implausible statement but select the wrong explanation?

- Concept: **Output format consistency in evaluation**
  - Why needed here: Mixtral's measured performance conflates reasoning failure with formatting failure; evaluation pipelines must disentangle these
  - Quick check question: What post-processing strategies could normalize varied model outputs for fair comparison?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Prompt template -> LLM API call -> Response parsing -> Accuracy computation -> Benchmark comparison
- Critical path: Prompt template design → API call reliability → Output parsing robustness → Accuracy aggregation per model per task
- Design tradeoffs: Larger models yield higher accuracy but increase inference cost; zero-shot eliminates fine-tuning overhead but sacrifices task-specific optimization; structured prompts improve format compliance but may bias responses
- Failure signatures: Mixtral returning explanations alongside labels; models selecting plausible-but-not-best explanations in Task B; size-dependent accuracy cliffs
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Format enforcement test: Add explicit output constraints to Mixtral; measure accuracy recovery
  2. Cross-task correlation: Analyze whether Task A errors predict Task B errors for same instances
  3. Prompt sensitivity sweep: Test 3–5 prompt variants per task; quantify variance in model responses

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Can integrating commonsense knowledge graphs with LLMs bridge the performance gap between statement validation and explanation selection?**
  - Basis in paper: Authors explicitly suggest exploring Commonsense knowledge-graph LLMs to enhance inferential reasoning capabilities identified as lacking in Task B
  - Why unresolved: Current study isolated models' internal reasoning using zero-shot prompting without external knowledge retrieval mechanisms
  - What evidence would resolve it: Comparative study showing KG-augmented LLMs achieve significantly higher accuracy on Task B than zero-shot LLaMA3-70B baseline

- **To what extent do fine-tuning or retrieval-augmented generation strategies improve explanation selection compared to zero-shot approaches?**
  - Basis in paper: Authors identify fine-tuning strategies, retrieval-augmented approaches, and structured prompting as necessary future work to address limitations in inferential reasoning
  - Why unresolved: Paper demonstrates zero-shot LLMs lag behind fine-tuned transformers in Task B but doesn't test if applying these techniques to LLMs would reverse this trend
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing Task B performance of same LLMs using RAG versus zero-shot baselines

- **How does strict output formatting adherence affect accurate measurement of reasoning capabilities in mixture-of-experts models?**
  - Basis in paper: Mixtral-8x7B's poor performance (50.90% on Task B) attributed to "inconsistencies in output format" rather than pure reasoning failure
  - Why unresolved: Unclear if model failed reasoning task or simply failed to map reasoning to required template, suggesting current evaluation metrics may confound instruction-following with logic
  - What evidence would resolve it: Re-evaluation of Mixtral using constrained decoding or post-processing to separate formatting errors from logical errors

## Limitations

- Prompt template sensitivity: Results may reflect prompt engineering choices rather than model capabilities, particularly for Task B
- Output format ambiguity: Mixtral's degraded performance stems from output inconsistencies, but parsing methods and unparseable response percentages are unspecified
- Scale-effect interpretation: Claims about "emergent reasoning" from scale are speculative without controlled experiments on out-of-distribution commonsense scenarios

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Task A validation results (98.40% LLaMA3-70B) are robust as they rely on binary classification
- **Medium confidence**: Task B explanation selection results (93.40% LLaMA3-70B) reflect genuine reasoning challenges but interpretation is limited by unspecified prompt variations
- **Low confidence**: Claims about "emergent reasoning" from scale are speculative without ablation studies distinguishing pattern matching from reasoning

## Next Checks

1. Implement explicit output constraints in prompts for all models, particularly Mixtral-8x7B, and measure whether accuracy improves to match LLaMA3-8B performance levels
2. Systematically test 3-5 different prompt templates per task varying in instruction specificity, context length, and output formatting requirements
3. Analyze whether Task A errors predict Task B errors for identical instances by examining cases where models correctly identify implausible statements but select incorrect explanations
