# MAESTRO : Adaptive Sparse Attention and Robust Learning for Multimodal Dynamic Time Series

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.25278
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25278

- MAESTRO achieves average relative improvements of 4% over best multimodal baselines and 8% over best multivariate approaches under complete observations, and 9% under up to 40% missing modalities

## Executive Summary
MAESTRO introduces a novel multimodal learning framework designed to handle heterogeneous time-series sensor data with arbitrary missing modalities. The approach employs symbolic tokenization with reserved symbols for missing data, adaptive attention budgeting guided by modality relevance and availability, and sparse cross-modal attention to efficiently model long multimodal sequences. A sparse Mixture-of-Experts routing mechanism enables dynamic specialization under varying modality combinations. Evaluated across four diverse datasets spanning three applications, MAESTRO demonstrates robust performance and computational efficiency, effectively addressing key limitations in existing multimodal learning frameworks.

## Method Summary
The MAESTRO framework processes multimodal time-series data through a symbolic tokenization layer that represents missing modalities with dedicated tokens. Adaptive attention budgeting dynamically allocates computational resources based on modality relevance and availability, while sparse cross-modal attention mechanisms model interactions between modalities efficiently. The sparse Mixture-of-Experts routing enables dynamic specialization for different modality combinations. The architecture is evaluated on four datasets covering EEG seizure detection, sleep staging, human activity recognition, and sensor-based motion analysis, demonstrating significant performance improvements under both complete and incomplete observation scenarios.

## Key Results
- Achieves average relative improvements of 4% over best multimodal baselines under complete observations
- Demonstrates 9% performance gains under up to 40% missing modality rates
- Shows consistent improvements across diverse applications including medical and activity recognition domains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MAESTRO's effectiveness stems from its integrated approach to handling missing modalities through symbolic representation, combined with adaptive attention mechanisms that focus computational resources where they are most needed. The sparse attention and MoE routing allow the model to efficiently process long sequences while maintaining flexibility across different modality combinations. The framework's ability to dynamically adjust to varying levels of modality availability without requiring retraining or architectural modifications enables robust performance in real-world scenarios where sensor failures or missing data are common.

## Foundational Learning

**Symbolic Tokenization**: Representing missing modalities with dedicated tokens allows the model to explicitly learn patterns associated with absent data, rather than treating missing values as zeros or imputing them. This approach preserves information about data availability patterns.

*Why needed*: Traditional approaches either drop missing modalities or impute values, losing information about data quality and availability patterns.

*Quick check*: Verify that reserved tokens are properly learned and distinguishable from actual data representations.

**Adaptive Attention Budgeting**: Dynamically allocating attention based on modality relevance and availability ensures computational resources focus on informative signals while maintaining flexibility across different input configurations.

*Why needed*: Fixed attention mechanisms waste resources on uninformative or missing modalities and cannot adapt to varying input patterns.

*Quick check*: Monitor attention allocation patterns across different modality availability scenarios.

**Sparse Cross-Modal Attention**: Modeling interactions between modalities through sparse attention mechanisms reduces computational complexity while preserving essential cross-modal relationships.

*Why needed*: Dense attention across all modalities becomes computationally prohibitive for long sequences and many modalities.

*Quick check*: Compare performance and computational cost between sparse and dense attention variants.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Sensors -> Symbolic Tokenizer -> Adaptive Attention Layer -> Sparse Cross-Modal Attention -> Sparse MoE Router -> Output Layer

**Critical Path**: The symbolic tokenizer initializes the processing pipeline, feeding into adaptive attention mechanisms that dynamically adjust based on input characteristics. Sparse cross-modal attention then models inter-modality relationships, with the sparse MoE router providing final specialization before output generation.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades some representational capacity for computational efficiency through sparse mechanisms, while accepting the complexity of symbolic tokenization to handle missing data robustly. The adaptive attention approach balances between thorough modeling and practical runtime constraints.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation may occur when missing modality patterns are highly correlated or temporally structured in ways not captured by the symbolic representation. Computational benefits may diminish for very short sequences or small numbers of modalities.

**First Experiments**: 1) Test symbolic tokenization with varying missing rates on simple sequence tasks. 2) Evaluate adaptive attention performance against fixed attention baselines. 3) Compare sparse versus dense cross-modal attention on representative multimodal datasets.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Computational efficiency claims lack comprehensive runtime comparisons with baseline approaches across different hardware configurations
- The symbolic tokenization approach may have limitations in scaling to extremely high-dimensional multimodal inputs
- Evaluation focuses on specific missing patterns that may not fully represent complex real-world scenarios with temporally correlated missing data

## Confidence
- Performance improvements under complete observations: High confidence
- Robustness to missing modalities: Medium confidence
- Computational efficiency: Low confidence

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of symbolic tokenization, adaptive attention budgeting, and sparse cross-modal attention to overall performance.

2. Evaluate performance on datasets with more complex missing patterns, including temporally correlated missing modalities and partial observations within individual modalities.

3. Perform runtime and memory consumption benchmarking against baseline approaches across different hardware configurations to validate computational efficiency claims.
