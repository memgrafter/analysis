core_contribution: BatonVoice is a new framework for controllable speech synthesis
  that leverages the linguistic intelligence of LLMs by decoupling instruction understanding
  from speech generation. Inspired by "operationalism," the framework uses an LLM
  as a "conductor" to interpret text instructions into explicit vocal features (e.g.,
  pitch, energy), which are then fed into a specialized TTS model ("orchestra") to
  synthesize the final speech.

# BatonVoice: An Operationalist Framework for Enhancing Controllable Speech Synthesis with Linguistic Intelligence from LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.26514
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26514
- Reference count: 16
- Key outcome: Operationalist framework achieving 57.6% emotion accuracy vs 48.6% for best closed-source baseline

## Executive Summary
BatonVoice introduces a novel operationalist framework that separates instruction understanding from speech generation by leveraging LLM linguistic intelligence. The framework uses an LLM as a "conductor" to interpret text instructions into explicit vocal features (pitch, energy), which are then fed to a specialized TTS model ("orchestra") for synthesis. Through a three-stage training pipeline (pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and preference optimization) using automatically generated data, BatonVoice achieves state-of-the-art performance in emotional speech synthesis while demonstrating remarkable zero-shot cross-lingual generalization capabilities.

## Method Summary
The framework decouples instruction understanding from speech generation, using an LLM to parse text instructions into explicit vocal features like pitch and energy. These features are then fed to a specialized TTS model for synthesis. The core model, BatonTTS, is trained through a three-stage pipeline: pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and preference optimization, all using automatically generated data without manual instruction annotations. This approach objectifies speech into textual vocal features, effectively unlocking LLM linguistic intelligence for speech synthesis tasks.

## Key Results
- Achieved 57.6% emotion accuracy on English benchmarks, outperforming best closed-source model (48.6%)
- Demonstrated zero-shot cross-lingual generalization, accurately applying feature control to unseen languages like Chinese
- Performance scales with LLM capability, validating the framework's effectiveness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its operationalist approach that objectifies speech into explicit textual vocal features. By decoupling instruction understanding from speech generation, the LLM can focus on linguistic intelligence and interpretation while the specialized TTS model handles the actual synthesis. This separation allows for better generalization and scalability, as improvements in LLM capability directly translate to better performance. The automatic data generation pipeline eliminates dependency on manual instruction annotations, enabling more diverse and scalable training.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Operationalism in AI** - Treating abstract concepts as measurable variables; needed for precise control over speech attributes
   - Quick check: Verify vocal features are consistently interpretable across different contexts

2. **Instruction-to-Feature Mapping** - Converting natural language instructions into numerical vocal parameters
   - Quick check: Test mapping accuracy with diverse instruction phrasings

3. **Zero-shot Cross-lingual Transfer** - Applying learned control to unseen languages without additional training
   - Quick check: Validate performance across language families with different phonologies

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
LLM Conductor -> Feature Parser -> Vocal Feature Generator -> BatonTTS Orchestrator -> Speech Synthesizer

**Critical Path:**
Instruction input → LLM interpretation → Feature extraction → TTS processing → Audio output

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Decoupling enables flexibility but adds processing overhead
- Automatic data generation reduces cost but may limit instruction diversity
- LLM dependency ensures quality but increases computational requirements

**Failure Signatures:**
- Inconsistent feature extraction leading to unnatural speech
- Cross-lingual generalization failures on typologically distant languages
- Performance degradation with complex multi-attribute instructions

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test instruction parsing accuracy across 50 diverse emotional descriptions
2. Validate zero-shot performance on 5 unseen languages with different scripts
3. Benchmark feature extraction consistency across varying speech rates

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions, but implicit questions remain about scalability across diverse languages, performance on non-emotional speech attributes, and the framework's behavior with increasingly complex instruction sets.

## Limitations
- Performance heavily dependent on LLM capability, raising scalability concerns
- Zero-shot cross-lingual generalization needs validation across more diverse language families
- Framework tested primarily on emotional speech synthesis, limiting understanding of broader applicability

## Confidence
- **High**: Framework's architectural design and three-stage training pipeline are well-defined and reproducible
- **Medium**: Performance claims on English benchmarks are supported by comparative results, though testing conditions are not fully detailed
- **Low**: Cross-lingual generalization claims need more extensive validation across diverse language families

## Next Checks
1. Conduct comprehensive testing across 10+ diverse languages, including low-resource languages, to validate cross-lingual generalization claims
2. Implement human evaluation studies to assess the quality and naturalness of synthesized speech beyond automated metrics
3. Test the framework's performance on non-emotional speech attributes (e.g., speaking rate, emphasis patterns) to establish broader applicability
