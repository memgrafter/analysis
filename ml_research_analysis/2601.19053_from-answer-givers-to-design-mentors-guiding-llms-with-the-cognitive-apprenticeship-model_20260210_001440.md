# From Answer Givers to Design Mentors: Guiding LLMs with the Cognitive Apprenticeship Model

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Structured Cognitive Apprenticeship prompting (DesignMentor) significantly improved design reasoning and feedback completeness versus baseline LLM in visualization design tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates transforming LLMs from answer-givers to design mentors by operationalizing the Cognitive Apprenticeship Model through structured prompting. The authors created DesignMentor, implementing six instructional methods (modeling, coaching, scaffolding, articulation, reflection, exploration) in a three-phase guided feedback loop. A within-subjects study with 24 visualization practitioners showed DesignMentor significantly improved design reasoning, provided more complete feedback loops, and enhanced metacognitive awareness compared to a baseline LLM. Participants found the approach more engaging and context-aware, though it required more cognitive effort. Preferences varied by design phase, with DesignMentor preferred during exploration and development, while the baseline was favored for evaluation.

## Method Summary
The study used OpenAI's Custom GPT framework to implement DesignMentor with seven design guidelines operationalizing CAM methods. Participants (N=24 visualization practitioners) completed within-subjects comparisons between DesignMentor and ChatGPT-4o baseline across 10-minute sessions. The three-phase approach included: Phase 1 (Articulation, Bounding, Scoping), Phase 2 (Coaching, Scaffolding, Modeling), and Phase 3 (Exploring, Reflecting). Evaluation metrics included feedback completeness (Feed Up/Back/Forward), self-regulation levels, delivery quality, and conversation dynamics measured through DAMSL discourse acts. The study iterated through pilot tests with 5 practitioners before the main evaluation.

## Key Results
- DesignMentor drove a 12-fold increase in Answer acts, indicating active user reasoning articulation
- Participants found DesignMentor more engaging and context-aware, though requiring more cognitive effort
- Strong phase-dependent preferences: DesignMentor strongly preferred in exploration/development phases, baseline favored in evaluation phases (χ²(4) = 14.51, p = .006)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Graduated Release of Responsibility via Sequencing
Shifting from direct answers to a graduated sequence (Coaching → Scaffolding → Modeling) forces users into active reasoning rather than passive consumption. By enforcing "Coaching" (diagnosis) and "Scaffolding" (hints) first, the system creates a productive impasse where users must articulate their own logic before receiving solutions.

### Mechanism 2: Articulation-Induced Context Grounding
Mandatory "Articulation" and "Bounding" phases ground the LLM's context window, reducing generic feedback. Forcing users to verbalize goals and constraints serves as a retrieval anchor for the LLM, constraining output to the user's specific intent.

### Mechanism 3: Phase-Dependent Preference Modulation
Preference for mentorship-style interaction depends on design phase. In exploratory phases with large solution spaces, scaffolding helps bound the problem. In evaluation phases with narrow solution spaces, scaffolding feels like friction rather than help.

## Foundational Learning

**Cognitive Apprenticeship Model (CAM)**
- Why needed: Theoretical backbone explaining why shifting from "Modeling" (showing how) to "Scaffolding" (supporting doing) works
- Quick check: Does the system explain the solution immediately (Modeling), or ask the user to diagnose the issue first (Coaching/Scaffolding)?

**System 1 vs. System 2 Thinking**
- Why needed: Frames the trade-off between baseline (fast, intuitive System 1) and DesignMentor (slow, deliberate System 2)
- Quick check: Is the user looking for quick validation (System 1) or deep restructuring of design logic (System 2)?

**DAMSL (Dialog Act Markup in Several Layers)**
- Why needed: Framework used to quantify differences between "Information Seeking" (Baseline) and "Reasoning Articulation" (DesignMentor)
- Quick check: Are users predominantly asking "How do I do this?" (Info-Request) or answering "Why did you choose this?" (Statement/Answer)?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
Custom GPT wrapper → Instructions (7 Design Guidelines + 3-Phase Flow) → Knowledge Base (Codebook + examples) → Conversation Starters

**Critical path:**
1. Upload & Verify: User uploads visualization; System executes DG6 (Visual Verification: "What I see is...")
2. Phase 1 (Articulation): System executes DG2, prompting for goals and bounding the problem
3. Phase 2 (Intervention): System iterates through Coaching → Scaffolding → Modeling for each question
4. Phase 3 (Reflection): System executes Reflection prompts to check understanding

**Design tradeoffs:**
- Cognitive Load vs. Depth: More turns improve reasoning but require more user effort
- Generality vs. Specificity: Fixed Codebook ensures consistency but may fail on niche domains

**Failure signatures:**
- "Just Fix It" Loop: User repeatedly asks for direct solutions; System repeatedly offers scaffolding hints
- Context Drift: LLM forgets initial "Bounding" constraints and reverts to generic advice
- Hallucinated Verification: "Visual Verification" step incorrectly identifies chart elements

**First 3 experiments:**
1. Phase Skip Test: Allow users to toggle "Direct Feedback" mode to test phase-dependent preference hypothesis
2. Context Retention Analysis: Measure accuracy of LLM's advice relative to initial "Articulation" constraints over conversation lengths
3. Blind Comparison of "Modeling" vs "Scaffolding": Isolate whether coaching-only (without modeling) actually helps users

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1: Cognitive Mode Switching**
Can an AI system automate "cognitive mode switching" by detecting user's design phase to alternate between scaffolding (mentor mode) and direct feedback (answer-giver mode)? The study found strong baseline preference during evaluation phases but static implementation can't capture these shifts. What evidence would resolve it: A study comparing adaptive agents that automatically switch modes based on dialogue cues against static DesignMentor.

**Open Question 2: Internalization of Design Reasoning**
Does sustained use of scaffolding-based AI mentorship lead to internalization of design reasoning skills and reduced need for support over time? Current study only captures single-session interactions. What evidence would resolve it: A longitudinal experiment tracking users over several weeks to assess if independent design reasoning improves and reliance on AI decreases.

**Open Question 3: Multimodal Integration**
How does integrating generative visual mockups affect cognitive load and satisfaction? Participants explicitly requested visual mockups but current system is text-only. What evidence would resolve it: A comparative evaluation of text-only vs multimodal mentorship interfaces measuring cognitive load and iteration speed.

**Open Question 4: Hybrid Human-AI Mentorship**
How does prior AI mentor interaction affect subsequent sessions with human mentors? Study evaluated AI as standalone tool without assessing its utility as preparatory step. What evidence would resolve it: An experiment measuring depth of technical discussion and mentor satisfaction when mentee first completes "articulation and bounding" session with AI.

## Limitations
- Findings constrained by visualization domain specificity and small sample size (N=24)
- Mechanism explaining phase-dependent preferences remains theoretical with limited empirical validation across task types
- Prompt architecture assumes users can accurately articulate design goals upfront without systematic quality measurement

## Confidence
- High confidence: Operationalization of CAM methods through prompting is technically sound
- Medium confidence: Quantitative metrics demonstrate clear differences between conditions
- Low confidence: Theoretical mechanism for phase-dependent preferences is plausible but under-specified

## Next Checks
1. Conduct longitudinal study tracking whether DesignMentor users show sustained improvement in design reasoning across multiple sessions
2. Implement A/B test where users can dynamically switch between "Direct Feedback" and "Scaffolding" modes mid-session
3. Perform think-aloud protocols during DesignMentor interactions to directly observe whether users are genuinely engaging in reasoning articulation or responding mechanically to prompts
