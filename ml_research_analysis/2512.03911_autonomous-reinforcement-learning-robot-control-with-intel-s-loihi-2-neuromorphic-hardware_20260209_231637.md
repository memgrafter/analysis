# Autonomous Reinforcement Learning Robot Control with Intel's Loihi 2 Neuromorphic Hardware

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.03911
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03911
- Reference count: 34
- Key outcome: End-to-end pipeline for deploying RL-trained ANN policies on Intel's Loihi 2 neuromorphic hardware by converting them to spiking neural networks, achieving 20x better energy efficiency and 2x higher throughput compared to GPU baseline.

## Executive Summary
This work demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline for deploying RL-trained ANN policies on neuromorphic hardware by converting them into SDNNs compatible with Intel's Loihi 2. A ReLU-based PPO-trained ANN controller for a 6-DOF Astrobee free-flying robot is converted into an SDNN and evaluated in NVIDIA's Isaac Lab simulation environment. The SDNN on Loihi 2 shows 5% of the energy-delay product (EDP) of the GPU baseline, achieving 20x better energy efficiency and over 2x higher throughput. While the SDNN exhibits higher final position and orientation errors compared to the GPU (e.g., 0.225 m vs 0.142 m RMSE in position for random tasks), it remains stable and close to target. The results validate the feasibility of neuromorphic control for energy-constrained robotic applications, particularly in space and naval robotics, while highlighting performance vs efficiency tradeoffs and future optimization opportunities.

## Method Summary
The method involves training a PPO Actor-Critic network (12×64×64×6 ReLU layers) for 6-DOF Astrobee control in NVIDIA Omniverse Isaac Lab, then converting the Actor to an SDNN using Delta input encoding, Sigma-Delta-ReLU hidden layers with 0.1 threshold, and Sigma output. The SDNN uses int24 graded spikes and quantized observations. The converted network is deployed on Loihi 2 Kapoho Point N3C1 via NxKernel for closed-loop simulation. Two test maneuvers are evaluated: undock (0.5m X-axis) and random goals (±0.5m position, ±60° orientation). Performance is measured against GPU baseline across 10 seeds × 200 timesteps for each task.

## Key Results
- SDNN achieves 20x better energy efficiency (5% EDP of GPU baseline)
- SDNN shows 2x higher throughput (inf/s) compared to GPU
- Position RMSE increases from 0.142 m (GPU) to 0.225 m (SDNN) for random tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The conversion from ReLU ANN to SDNN preserves the learned policy while enabling event-driven, low-power computation on neuromorphic hardware. The Delta input encoder and Sigma-Delta-ReLU layers translate continuous activation patterns into sparse spiking events that match Loihi 2's computational model. Graded spike quantization (int24) maintains precision while reducing communication overhead. The threshold-based activation in Sigma-Delta-ReLU layers enables temporal sparsity that improves energy efficiency. Closed-loop deployment demonstrates that the converted SDNN can maintain stable control despite modest performance degradation, validating the approach for real-time robotic applications where energy efficiency is critical.

## Foundational Learning
- **PPO with clipped objective and GAE**: Needed for stable RL training; quick check: verify training curves show convergence without catastrophic forgetting
- **ReLU to spiking conversion**: Required for ANN-to-SDNN transformation; quick check: ensure activation thresholds preserve policy behavior
- **Loihi 2 NxKernel programming**: Essential for hardware deployment; quick check: confirm network mapping fits on single chip
- **Graded spike quantization**: Critical for precision-energy tradeoff; quick check: verify quantization error doesn't exceed 10% of original performance
- **Isaac Lab simulation framework**: Provides validated robot dynamics; quick check: reproduce GPU baseline performance before SDNN conversion

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Omniverse Isaac Lab -> PPO training -> ANN Actor -> SDNN conversion -> Loihi 2 deployment -> closed-loop evaluation
- **Critical path**: Observation quantization → Delta encoding → SDNN inference → force/torque output → robot dynamics → new observation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Energy efficiency vs accuracy (20x efficiency gain at cost of 0.083 m higher RMSE); throughput vs precision (graded spikes reduce bandwidth but add quantization noise)
- **Failure signatures**: Higher RMSE indicates threshold tuning needed; low throughput suggests communication overhead dominates; unstable control points to quantization or conversion errors
- **3 first experiments**: 1) Train PPO baseline and verify convergence, 2) Convert to SDNN and test open-loop inference accuracy, 3) Deploy on Loihi 2 with simulated robot and measure closed-loop performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Performance degradation: 0.083 m higher position RMSE and 8.55° higher orientation RMSE compared to GPU baseline
- Communication overhead: SSH host-to-Loihi 2 communication may impact throughput measurements
- Hyperparameter sensitivity: Unknown PPO parameters and quantization scaling factors could affect reproducibility

## Confidence
- Energy efficiency claims: High confidence given clear methodology and 20x improvement measurement
- Performance equivalence: Medium confidence due to accepted 10% accuracy degradation as tradeoff
- Reproducibility: Medium confidence limited by unspecified hyperparameters and quantization details

## Next Checks
1. Verify quantization scaling preserves SDNN accuracy within 10% of ANN performance
2. Benchmark SSH host-to-Loihi 2 communication overhead impact on throughput
3. Test curriculum robustness by training with different random seeds and measuring controller stability
