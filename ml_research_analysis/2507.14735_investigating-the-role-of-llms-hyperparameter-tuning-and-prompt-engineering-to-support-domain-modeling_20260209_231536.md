# Investigating the Role of LLMs Hyperparameter Tuning and Prompt Engineering to Support Domain Modeling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.14735
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14735
- Reference count: 40
- This paper investigates the effectiveness of hyperparameter tuning and prompt engineering in improving large language models (LLMs) for domain modeling tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the effectiveness of hyperparameter tuning and prompt engineering in improving large language models (LLMs) for domain modeling tasks. The study uses the Llama 3.1 model to generate domain models from textual descriptions, focusing on optimizing hyperparameters for a medical domain model and testing across ten diverse domains. The research combines NSGA-II for initial hyperparameter search with grid search refinement, achieving a notable quality improvement over the baseline LLM. While hyperparameter tuning alone was insufficient for universal application across domains, combining it with prompt engineering techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) significantly enhanced results in most examined domain models.

The study demonstrates that hyperparameter tuning is a valuable alternative to fine-tuning when high-quality datasets are unavailable, and that prompt engineering strategies can further improve LLM performance in domain modeling tasks. The findings highlight the importance of a multi-faceted approach to optimizing LLM performance, particularly in specialized domains where data quality and quantity may be limited.

## Method Summary
The study employed Llama 3.1 as the base model for domain model generation from textual descriptions. The research methodology combined multi-objective optimization using NSGA-II for initial hyperparameter search with subsequent grid search refinement. The process focused on optimizing hyperparameters for a medical domain model, then tested the approach across ten diverse domains. The study evaluated multiple prompt engineering strategies including zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting, comparing their effectiveness when combined with hyperparameter tuning.

## Key Results
- Hyperparameter tuning using NSGA-II and grid search achieved a notable quality improvement over the baseline LLM for domain modeling tasks
- Hyperparameter tuning alone was insufficient for universal application across all ten diverse domains tested
- Combining hyperparameter tuning with prompt engineering techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) significantly enhanced results in most examined domain models
- The study demonstrated that hyperparameter tuning is a valuable alternative to fine-tuning when high-quality datasets are unavailable

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
None

## Foundational Learning
- **NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II)**: A multi-objective optimization algorithm used for initial hyperparameter search
  - *Why needed*: To efficiently explore the hyperparameter space and identify promising configurations
  - *Quick check*: Can NSGA-II identify better hyperparameter combinations than random search in this domain modeling context?

- **Hyperparameter tuning for LLMs**: Adjusting model parameters like temperature, top-p, max tokens, and repetition penalty
  - *Why needed*: To optimize model output quality for specific domain modeling tasks
  - *Quick check*: Does adjusting temperature and top-p values significantly impact domain model generation quality?

- **Prompt engineering strategies**: Zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting techniques
  - *Why needed*: To guide model behavior and improve output quality for domain modeling tasks
  - *Quick check*: Which prompt engineering strategy provides the most consistent improvements across different domains?

- **Domain modeling quality evaluation**: Expert assessment of generated domain models
  - *Why needed*: To measure the effectiveness of optimization approaches
  - *Quick check*: How do different evaluation metrics correlate with expert assessments of domain model quality?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Text Description -> Llama 3.1 Model -> Domain Model Generation -> Quality Evaluation

**Critical Path**: Text Description → Prompt Engineering → Hyperparameter Configuration → LLM Generation → Quality Assessment

**Design Tradeoffs**: The study balances computational cost of hyperparameter optimization against quality improvements, choosing between fine-tuning (data-intensive) and hyperparameter tuning (computation-intensive). The multi-objective optimization approach trades exploration time for finding optimal configurations across multiple quality metrics.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Poor quality domain models despite hyperparameter optimization may indicate insufficient prompt engineering
- Limited improvement across domains suggests the need for domain-specific fine-tuning rather than general optimization
- High computational costs without proportional quality gains indicate suboptimal hyperparameter search strategy

**First Experiments**:
1. Baseline evaluation: Run Llama 3.1 with default hyperparameters on medical domain text to establish baseline quality
2. Single-parameter optimization: Systematically vary temperature values to observe impact on domain model coherence
3. Prompt engineering comparison: Test all three prompt strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) on the same domain to identify which yields best initial results

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The study focuses on Llama 3.1 as the base model, constraining generalizability to other LLM architectures
- Dataset validation comes from a single medical domain with testing across only ten diverse domains
- Hyperparameter search space was relatively constrained, potentially missing optimal configurations
- Evaluation relies on expert assessments that introduce subjectivity
- Computational costs associated with hyperparameter optimization were not addressed

## Confidence

**High**: The effectiveness of hyperparameter tuning for domain-specific applications when high-quality datasets are unavailable
**Medium**: The combined approach of hyperparameter tuning with prompt engineering across multiple domains
**Low**: The generalizability of findings to other LLM architectures or domains due to limited testing scope

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the study with multiple LLM architectures (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) to assess cross-model generalizability
2. Expand testing to include at least 50 diverse domains with varying complexity levels
3. Conduct a cost-benefit analysis comparing computational requirements of hyperparameter optimization versus fine-tuning approaches across different dataset sizes
