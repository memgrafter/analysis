- Introduces HueManity benchmark revealing MLLMs' critical weakness in fine-grained visual perception

## Executive Summary
HueManity is a large-scale benchmark (83,850 images) designed to evaluate fine-grained visual perception in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) using Ishihara-style dot patterns. The benchmark embeds alphanumeric characters within dot patterns to test models' ability to recognize subtle visual cues. When nine state-of-the-art MLLMs were evaluated, they showed significant performance deficits: only 33.6% accuracy on simple numeric tasks and 3% on harder alphanumeric tasks, compared to near-ceiling human performance (99.38%, 93.25%) and a fine-tuned ResNet-50 (96.5%, 94.5%). These findings expose a critical weakness in MLLMs' perceptual grounding that remains obscured by conventional benchmarks emphasizing high-level semantics.

## Method Summary
The HueManity benchmark uses Ishihara-style dot patterns to embed alphanumeric characters, creating controlled visual stimuli that test fine-grained pattern recognition. The benchmark consists of 83,850 images organized into tasks of varying difficulty, from simple numeric recognition to complex alphanumeric identification. Nine state-of-the-art MLLMs were evaluated on this benchmark, with their performance compared against human subjects and a fine-tuned ResNet-50 CNN. The methodology focuses on isolating perceptual abilities by using minimal visual cues, allowing researchers to probe whether MLLMs can recognize patterns from subtle visual information.

## Key Results
- MLLMs achieved only 33.6% accuracy on simple numeric tasks versus 99.38% for humans
- MLLMs scored just 3% on harder alphanumeric tasks compared to 93.25% human performance
- A fine-tuned ResNet-50 outperformed MLLMs significantly (96.5% and 94.5% respectively)
- The benchmark exposes perceptual limitations in MLLMs not revealed by conventional high-level semantic benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Ishihara-style dot patterns create controlled visual stimuli where target characters are embedded within distracting elements, forcing models to focus on fine-grained visual details rather than semantic context. This design isolates pure perceptual abilities from higher-level reasoning, revealing whether models can recognize patterns from minimal visual cues. The methodology works because it creates a stark contrast between what humans can easily perceive (pattern recognition from subtle cues) and what current MLLMs struggle with, exposing a fundamental gap in their visual grounding.

## Foundational Learning
- **Ishihara-style dot patterns**: Visual stimuli where target characters are embedded within dot patterns, used for color vision testing and now adapted for AI evaluation. Needed to create controlled perceptual challenges. Quick check: Can the model identify embedded characters when dots are carefully arranged to obscure them?
- **Fine-grained visual perception**: The ability to recognize subtle visual details and patterns. Needed to evaluate low-level visual processing capabilities. Quick check: Does the model detect minute differences in dot arrangements that form different characters?
- **Perceptual grounding**: The connection between visual input and conceptual understanding. Needed to assess whether models truly "see" or just process high-level features. Quick check: Can the model map visual patterns to alphanumeric symbols accurately?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Ishihara image generation -> Visual encoder (CNN) -> Pattern recognition module -> Text decoder (LLM)
- **Critical Path**: Image input → Visual feature extraction → Fine-grained pattern analysis → Alphanumeric classification
- **Design Tradeoffs**: The benchmark prioritizes controlled stimuli over ecological validity, sacrificing real-world complexity to isolate perceptual abilities. This reveals fundamental weaknesses but may not represent all visual recognition scenarios.
- **Failure Signatures**: MLLMs show catastrophic failure on tasks requiring subtle visual discrimination, with performance dropping from near-human levels on high-level semantic tasks to single-digit accuracy on fine-grained perception.
- **3 First Experiments**: 1) Test MLLMs on varying dot densities to find perceptual thresholds. 2) Evaluate whether image resolution affects performance. 3) Compare MLLM performance when integrated with specialized vision models for initial perception.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Specialized evaluation paradigm using Ishihara-style patterns may not represent real-world visual recognition diversity
- Focus on minimal visual cues may not capture full spectrum of practical visual understanding requirements
- Results based on nine specific MLLMs may not generalize to all architectures

## Confidence
**High confidence**: The performance gap between MLLMs and traditional vision approaches is robust and reproducible.
**Medium confidence**: Interpretation that this gap indicates fundamental perceptual grounding deficiencies rather than paradigm-specific limitations.
**Medium confidence**: Claim that conventional benchmarks fail to expose these perceptual limitations.

## Next Checks
1. Test model performance on additional datasets requiring fine-grained visual discrimination using different visual paradigms to verify generalizability.
2. Evaluate whether specialized visual pre-training or architectural modifications can improve MLLM performance on these tasks.
3. Conduct ablation studies comparing MLLM performance with different image resolutions and preprocessing techniques.
