## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a hierarchical spiking neural network architecture for lifelong network intrusion detection that combines static detection with dynamic classification using adaptive learning rules. The system addresses the critical challenge of adapting to new cybersecurity threats without forgetting previously learned patterns through a novel Adaptive STDP (Ad-STDP) rule and structural plasticity inspired by Grow When Required networks. The approach demonstrates reduced catastrophic forgetting compared to static baselines while maintaining high operational sparsity suitable for energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware deployment.

## Method Summary
The proposed system uses a hierarchical SNN architecture that integrates both static and dynamic classification layers. Static detection handles known threats using pre-trained weights, while dynamic classification adapts to new threats through the Ad-STDP learning rule. Structural plasticity allows the network to grow when encountering novel patterns, inspired by biological neural networks. The architecture operates on the UNSW-NB15 dataset in a continual learning setting, where the system must learn from sequential batches of data without access to previous training samples.

## Key Results
- Achieves 85.3% overall accuracy on UNSW-NB15 dataset in continual learning setting
- Demonstrates reduced catastrophic forgetting compared to static baseline approaches
- Shows high operational sparsity indicating potential for energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware deployment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system leverages neuromorphic computing principles to create an adaptive cybersecurity solution that can evolve with emerging threats. The hierarchical architecture separates known threat detection (static) from novel threat identification (dynamic), allowing efficient processing while maintaining adaptability. The Ad-STDP rule modifies synaptic plasticity based on prediction confidence and temporal correlation, preventing over-adaptation to new threats while still learning meaningful patterns. Structural plasticity enables network growth when encountering truly novel threats, expanding representational capacity without catastrophic interference with existing knowledge.

## Foundational Learning
- Spiking Neural Networks: Why needed - biological plausibility and energy efficiency for edge deployment; Quick check - verify spike timing precision and membrane potential dynamics
- Continual Learning: Why needed - cybersecurity threats evolve continuously requiring adaptive detection; Quick check - measure forgetting metrics across learning phases
- Structural Plasticity: Why needed - enables network growth for novel threats without catastrophic forgetting; Quick check - monitor network size changes and representational capacity
- Adaptive STDP: Why needed - balances learning new threats while preserving old knowledge; Quick check - analyze weight update patterns and stability across learning epochs

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input Layer -> Feature Extraction -> Static Detection Layer -> Dynamic Classification Layer -> Output Layer

Critical path: Input features → Feature extraction → Static detection (for known threats) OR Dynamic classification (for novel threats) → Classification output

Design tradeoffs: The hierarchical structure trades computational complexity for improved adaptability, while Ad-STDP balances learning speed against stability. Structural plasticity increases model capacity but requires careful resource management.

Failure signatures: Catastrophic forgetting indicates insufficient regularization in Ad-STDP; high false positives suggest static detection layer overfitting; network bloat indicates overly aggressive structural plasticity.

First experiments:
1. Test static detection layer alone on known threats to establish baseline performance
2. Evaluate dynamic classification layer with synthetic novel threats to verify adaptation capability
3. Measure catastrophic forgetting by testing on previously seen threats after learning new ones

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Accuracy of 85.3% lacks comparison with state-of-the-art traditional ML approaches on identical setup
- Evaluation methodology unclear regarding realistic time-ordered threat evolution versus random sampling
- Ad-STDP hyperparameters stability and robustness across different threat scenarios remain untested
- Structural plasticity scalability to larger threat landscapes is not demonstrated
- No quantitative comparison metrics for catastrophic forgetting against established continual learning benchmarks

## Confidence
- Architecture design and implementation: High confidence
- Dataset usage and preprocessing: Medium confidence
- Continual learning evaluation methodology: Medium confidence
- Energy efficiency claims for neuromorphic deployment: Low confidence
- Comparison with traditional cybersecurity approaches: Low confidence

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies removing Ad-STDP and structural plasticity to quantify their individual contributions to performance and forgetting reduction
2. Test the system on a time-ordered threat evolution dataset to validate real-world applicability of continual learning capabilities
3. Perform adversarial testing with synthetic attacks specifically designed to exploit neuromorphic system vulnerabilities and adaptive learning mechanisms
