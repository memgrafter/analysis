# LD-LAudio-V1: Video-to-Long-Form-Audio Generation Extension with Dual Lightweight Adapters

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.11074
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11074
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: Dual lightweight adapters reduce splicing artifacts and improve audio quality metrics by 12-66% compared to direct fine-tuning

## Executive Summary
LD-LAudio-V1 extends video-to-audio generation models to handle long-form content through a dual lightweight adapter architecture. The system introduces frame-level and clip-level adapters that enable efficient processing of extended video sequences while maintaining audio quality and temporal synchronization. The authors also release a clean dataset of human-annotated video-to-audio pairs focused on pure sound effects, addressing limitations in existing noisy or artifact-laden datasets.

## Method Summary
The approach employs two specialized adapters to extend short-form video-to-audio models for long-form generation. The frame-level adapter handles temporal consistency at fine granularity while the clip-level adapter manages longer-term dependencies and transitions. This dual architecture reduces computational overhead compared to full model fine-tuning while minimizing artifacts that typically occur when concatenating short audio segments. The system is trained on a curated dataset containing pure sound effects without background noise or artifacts.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dual lightweight adapter architecture enables long-form audio generation by maintaining temporal coherence across extended durations while minimizing computational overhead. Frame-level adapters handle fine-grained temporal synchronization between visual frames and corresponding audio segments, ensuring smooth transitions at the frame level. Clip-level adapters manage longer-term dependencies and transitions between different audio segments, preventing the accumulation of artifacts that typically occurs when concatenating multiple short audio clips. This hierarchical approach allows the model to scale to longer durations without the memory and computational constraints of full fine-tuning.

## Foundational Learning
- **Adapter-based fine-tuning**: Why needed - Enables efficient adaptation of pre-trained models without full parameter updates; Quick check - Compare parameter count and inference speed vs full fine-tuning
- **Temporal synchronization metrics**: Why needed - Quantifies alignment between visual events and generated audio; Quick check - Validate FD metrics correlate with human perception of sync quality
- **Audio quality evaluation (FD, KL divergence)**: Why needed - Provides objective measures of audio fidelity and distribution matching; Quick check - Benchmark against ground truth audio distributions
- **Long-form sequence processing**: Why needed - Addresses memory and computational challenges of extended audio generation; Quick check - Test scalability beyond training distribution length
- **Dataset curation for sound effects**: Why needed - Clean training data improves model generalization to pure audio events; Quick check - Verify noise/artifact removal effectiveness

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Video frames -> Frame-level adapter -> Clip-level adapter -> Audio generation -> Output audio

Critical path: The system processes video frames through the frame-level adapter for fine-grained temporal alignment, then passes aggregated representations to the clip-level adapter for long-term coherence management, before generating synchronized audio output.

Design tradeoffs: The dual-adapter approach balances computational efficiency against temporal modeling capability. While more efficient than full fine-tuning, it may have limitations in capturing extremely long-range dependencies compared to autoregressive approaches. The lightweight design enables faster inference but may constrain the model's capacity for complex temporal reasoning.

Failure signatures: Common failure modes include temporal drift in audio synchronization over extended durations, artifacts at segment boundaries when clip-level adapters cannot fully resolve transitions, and quality degradation when processing content significantly longer than training examples. The system may also struggle with complex audio scenes requiring simultaneous multiple sound sources.

First experiments:
1. Test frame-level adapter performance on 30-second video clips with single dominant sound sources
2. Evaluate clip-level adapter effectiveness at managing transitions between different audio events
3. Compare computational efficiency against full fine-tuning baseline across varying video lengths

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation conducted on 10-second clips despite claiming long-form generation capability
- Dataset quality claims not independently verified for noise/artifact removal
- True long-form generation performance (>60 seconds) remains untested
- Limited analysis of temporal synchronization and coherence over extended durations

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Dual lightweight adapter architecture design is technically sound with clear improvements in audio quality metrics compared to baseline fine-tuning approaches

**Medium confidence**: Claims of reduced splicing artifacts and temporal inconsistencies are supported by metrics but not empirically demonstrated on long-form content

**Low confidence**: Dataset quality claims (pure sound effects without noise) are not independently verified, and long-form generation capability remains largely theoretical

## Next Checks

1. Validate the model on video clips exceeding 60 seconds to assess true long-form generation performance and temporal coherence
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contributions of frame-level versus clip-level adapters to quantify their individual impact
3. Perform perceptual studies with video editors to evaluate practical utility for post-production workflows, including synchronization accuracy and editing flexibility
