# Is Finer Better? The Limits of Microscaling Formats in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19026

- Microscaling formats with smaller block sizes can increase quantization error for narrow distributions

## Executive Summary
This study investigates the effectiveness of microscaling quantization formats in large language models, revealing a counterintuitive limitation: reducing block size does not always improve quantization accuracy. Through extensive experimentation across multiple LLM architectures, the authors demonstrate that smaller blocks can paradoxically increase quantization error when dealing with narrow activation distributions. This phenomenon arises from the interaction between limited scale dynamic range and the statistical properties of narrow distributions, challenging the conventional wisdom that finer-grained scaling is universally beneficial.

The research introduces FP8 unsigned E5M3 (UE5M3) scales as a solution, extending dynamic range while maintaining hardware efficiency. Experimental validation shows that UE5M3 scales achieve performance comparable to per-tensor scaling while remaining computationally efficient. The findings provide crucial insights for hardware designers and model developers optimizing quantization strategies for LLMs, highlighting the need for careful consideration of distribution characteristics when selecting microscaling configurations.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted comprehensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures to evaluate quantization performance under various microscaling configurations. They developed a theoretical framework based on normal distribution approximations to model quantization error, analyzing three primary sources: element quantization with non-zero scales, maximum element error, and zero-scale rounding. The study systematically varied block sizes and examined their impact on quantization error across different tensor distributions. To validate their findings, they implemented and tested the proposed UE5M3 format alongside conventional scaling approaches, measuring accuracy and hardware efficiency trade-offs.

## Key Results
- Smaller microscaling block sizes can increase quantization error for narrow activation distributions
- UE5M3 scales provide extended dynamic range while maintaining hardware efficiency
- Theoretical model accurately predicts quantization error trends across different distribution widths

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The core mechanism involves the interaction between block size, distribution width, and scale dynamic range. When dealing with narrow distributions, smaller blocks have fewer elements to share a common scale, which limits the effective dynamic range of that scale. This constraint can force quantization to use inappropriate scales that increase overall error. The theoretical model captures this by analyzing how quantization error arises from three sources: the error introduced when quantizing elements with non-zero scales, the maximum possible error for the largest elements in a block, and rounding errors when scales approach zero. The balance between these error sources shifts with block size and distribution width, explaining why smaller blocks aren't always better.

## Foundational Learning
- **Normal distribution approximations** - Used to model tensor element distributions and predict quantization behavior; needed for tractable theoretical analysis of complex quantization dynamics
- **Quantization error decomposition** - Understanding how total error breaks down into component sources; needed to identify which aspects of the quantization process dominate under different conditions
- **Dynamic range constraints** - The relationship between available scale bits and representable value ranges; needed to understand why narrow distributions are particularly sensitive to block size choices
- **Hardware efficiency trade-offs** - Balancing computational cost against accuracy improvements; needed to evaluate whether proposed solutions like UE5M3 are practically viable

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Activation tensors -> Microscaling blocks -> Shared scales -> Quantized values -> Computation
Critical path: Distribution analysis → Scale selection → Quantization → Error propagation → Accuracy impact
Design tradeoffs: Block size vs. scale precision vs. hardware overhead
Failure signatures: Accuracy degradation, unexpected error patterns, scale saturation
First experiments:
1. Measure activation distribution widths across different layers
2. Test quantization accuracy with varying block sizes on narrow distributions
3. Compare UE5M3 performance against baseline microscaling approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Theoretical framework relies heavily on normal distribution approximations that may not capture complex, multimodal activation distributions
- Study focuses primarily on unsigned microscaling formats, leaving questions about signed format behavior
- Limited validation across diverse hardware architectures and real-world deployment scenarios

## Confidence
- High confidence in experimental observation of smaller block sizes increasing error for narrow distributions
- Medium confidence in theoretical model's predictive accuracy across all scenarios
- Medium confidence in UE5M3's effectiveness based on current experimental results

## Next Checks
1. Test theoretical model against actual activation distributions from diverse LLM architectures to verify normal distribution assumption
2. Implement and benchmark UE5M3 across multiple hardware platforms to confirm consistent performance improvements
3. Evaluate microscaling performance on signed formats and compare against unsigned implementations under identical conditions
