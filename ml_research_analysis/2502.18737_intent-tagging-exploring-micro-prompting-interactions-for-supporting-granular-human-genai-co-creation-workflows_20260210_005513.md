# Intent Tagging: Exploring Micro-Prompting Interactions for Supporting Granular Human-GenAI Co-Creation Workflows

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.18737
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18737
- Reference count: 40
- Intent tagging enables non-linear, granular human-AI co-creation through atomic conceptual units

## Executive Summary
Intent tagging introduces a novel interaction paradigm for human-AI co-creation workflows using atomic conceptual units called tags to encapsulate user intent. The approach allows users to express intent at varying levels of ambiguity while supporting flexible, non-linear workflows. A user study comparing intent tagging with chat-based and design gallery approaches for slide creation demonstrated that participants felt significantly more in control and better able to communicate their intentions using intent tags. Users particularly valued the support for iterative refinement and integrated system suggestions for meta-intent elicitation.

## Method Summary
The research employed a within-subjects user study with 12 participants who created presentation slides using three different systems: an intent tagging system, a chat-based GenAI system, and a design gallery system. Participants completed tasks across all three systems in counterbalanced order, allowing direct comparison of user experience, perceived control, and communication effectiveness. The study measured quantitative metrics including perceived control and intention communication effectiveness, along with qualitative feedback on workflow preferences and system usability.

## Key Results
- Participants felt significantly more in control using intent tagging (mean difference = 2.67) compared to baseline approaches
- Users reported better ability to communicate intentions with intent tags (mean difference = 1.83)
- Participants particularly valued non-linear workflows and integrated system suggestions for meta-intent elicitation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Intent tagging works by breaking down complex creative tasks into atomic conceptual units that users can manipulate independently. This micro-prompting approach allows users to express granular intent without the cognitive overhead of composing complete prompts or navigating design galleries. The system's ability to suggest meta-intent and support iterative refinement creates a feedback loop where users can progressively refine their vision while maintaining control over the creative process.

## Foundational Learning
- **Atomic intent representation**: Breaking creative intent into discrete tags reduces cognitive load and enables precise expression of specific design elements
- **Non-linear workflow support**: Users can jump between different aspects of their creation without being constrained by linear prompting sequences
- **Meta-intent elicitation**: System-suggested tags help users discover and articulate higher-level creative goals they might not initially recognize
- **Iterative refinement**: The ability to modify individual tags allows for progressive refinement without starting over
- **Mixed-initiative interaction**: Balancing user control with AI suggestions creates a collaborative creative environment
- **Granular feedback loops**: Individual tag adjustments provide immediate, specific feedback that guides creative direction

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: User interface -> Tag manager -> Intent processor -> GenAI model -> Output renderer
- **Critical path**: User selects/modifies tags → Intent processor interprets tag combinations → GenAI model generates content → Output renderer displays results
- **Design tradeoffs**: Granular tag control vs. interface complexity; automated suggestions vs. user autonomy; flexibility vs. guided workflows
- **Failure signatures**: Ambiguous tag combinations → vague outputs; excessive tag specificity → limited creativity; poor meta-intent suggestions → user frustration
- **First experiments**: 1) Test tag granularity levels on user control perception; 2) Compare suggestion quality across different creative domains; 3) Measure iteration efficiency vs. linear workflows

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Small sample size (12 participants) limits generalizability of findings
- Focus on slide creation may not represent other GenAI co-creation contexts
- Lack of longitudinal data on sustained effectiveness and user adoption

## Confidence
- User experience claims: Medium
- Generalizability across domains: Low
- Effectiveness of meta-intent elicitation: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a longitudinal study with at least 30 participants across multiple GenAI application domains to assess sustained effectiveness and generalizability
2. Implement A/B testing with varying tag granularity levels to determine optimal balance between specificity and flexibility
3. Develop metrics to measure actual vs. perceived control and communication effectiveness in real-world usage scenarios
