# Speak Your Mind: The Speech Continuation Task as a Probe of Voice-Based Model Bias

## Quick Facts

- The authors introduce the Speech Continuation (SC) task as a probe for voice-based model bias in speech foundation models.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Speech Continuation (SC) task as a diagnostic tool for detecting voice-based model bias in speech foundation models. The authors evaluate three models—SpiritLM (base and expressive), VAE-GSLM, and SpeechGPT—across gender and phonation types (breathy, creaky, end-creak). Using a dataset combining spoken StereoSet prompts and neutral open-ended prompts, they assess speaker similarity, voice quality preservation, and text-based bias metrics. Results show that once semantic coherence is sufficiently high, significant gender effects emerge on metrics like agency and sentence polarity. Additionally, continuations revert toward modal phonation more strongly for female prompts, revealing systematic voice-quality bias.

## Method Summary
The study employs a Speech Continuation (SC) task where models generate coherent speech continuations from given prompts. Three speech foundation models are evaluated: SpiritLM (base and expressive variants), VAE-GSLM, and SpeechGPT. The evaluation uses a dataset combining spoken StereoSet prompts and neutral open-ended prompts, assessing speaker similarity, voice quality preservation, and text-based bias metrics. The task is designed to probe voice-based model bias by analyzing how models handle different speaker characteristics including gender and phonation types (breathy, creaky, end-creak).

## Key Results
- Once semantic coherence is sufficiently high (for VAE-GSLM), significant gender effects emerge on metrics like agency and sentence polarity
- Continuations revert toward modal phonation more strongly for female prompts, revealing systematic voice-quality bias
- The study demonstrates SC as a controlled diagnostic for socially relevant representational biases in speech generation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Speech Continuation task works as a probe for voice-based model bias because it creates controlled conditions where models must generate speech continuations while preserving speaker characteristics. By analyzing how models handle gender and phonation type variations in these constrained generation scenarios, the study can isolate and measure systematic biases that might otherwise be obscured in open-ended generation tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- Speech foundation models: Need to understand these are large-scale models trained on diverse speech data to generate or process speech across multiple tasks; quick check is verifying their training objectives and data sources.
- Voice quality metrics: Understanding phonation types (modal, breathy, creaky, end-creak) and how they're measured; quick check is confirming classification accuracy of automated phonation detectors.
- Text-based bias metrics: Familiarity with metrics like agency and polarity used to assess gender bias in generated text; quick check is reviewing their calculation methodology and validation.

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Speech foundation model (VAE-GSLM/SpiritLM/SpeechGPT) -> Continuation generator -> Voice quality classifier -> Text bias analyzer -> Evaluation metrics
- Critical path: Input prompt → Model continuation → Voice quality preservation assessment → Text-based bias analysis → Results aggregation
- Design tradeoffs: SC task provides controlled bias detection but may not reflect naturalistic speech generation scenarios
- Failure signatures: Poor semantic coherence, voice quality degradation, or inconsistent bias patterns across models
- First experiments: 1) Test baseline model continuation quality on neutral prompts, 2) Verify voice quality classifier performance across phonation types, 3) Assess text bias metric reliability on ground truth data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The SC task's constrained structure may not reflect naturalistic speech generation scenarios
- Gender annotation relies on perceived speaker gender from prompts, introducing subjectivity
- Limited to gender and two phonation types, not accounting for intersectional biases

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Gender effects on text-based bias metrics (agency, polarity) once semantic coherence is controlled
- Medium Confidence: Female prompts experiencing stronger reversion toward modal phonation
- Low Confidence: SC as a universally applicable diagnostic for socially relevant representational biases

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the same models on unconstrained speech continuation tasks to determine if SC-identified biases persist in naturalistic settings
2. Assess the accuracy and robustness of automated phonation classifiers across diverse acoustic conditions and speaker demographics
3. Expand the bias evaluation to include intersectional dimensions (e.g., gender × accent, gender × age) to uncover compounded or hidden biases
