# Failure-Aware Bimanual Teleoperation via Conservative Value Guided Assistance

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2602.01092
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01092
- Reference count: 35
- Primary result: 98% success rate and 25% faster completion on daily-life bimanual tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a failure-aware teleoperation framework for bimanual manipulation that combines conservative value learning with haptic assistance. The system learns to estimate task feasibility from offline teleoperation data, providing compliant assistance while preserving human control authority. The key innovation is a risk-sensitive success score that remains reliable under distribution shift, enabling adaptive assistance during contact-rich manipulation tasks. Experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements over conventional teleoperation and shared-autonomy baselines.

## Method Summary
The approach uses conservative value learning to estimate task feasibility from heterogeneous offline teleoperation data, producing a risk-sensitive success score that guides assistance intensity. During operation, this score regulates assistance while a learned actor provides corrective motion directions through joint-space impedance feedback on the master side. The framework maintains continuous human authority while embedding failure awareness into bilateral teleoperation through adaptive haptic feedback.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 98% success rate on 10 daily-life bimanual manipulation tasks
- Reduces task completion time by up to 25% compared to conventional teleoperation
- Outperforms shared-autonomy baselines in both success rate and completion time

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system leverages conservative value learning to estimate task feasibility from offline data, creating a risk-sensitive success score that guides assistance intensity. This success score, combined with a learned corrective actor, provides adaptive haptic feedback through joint-space impedance control. The approach maintains human authority while embedding failure awareness into the teleoperation loop, enabling compliant assistance during contact-rich manipulation tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- Conservative value learning: needed for reliable success estimation under distribution shift; quick check: verify failure detection on out-of-distribution data
- Bimanual manipulation dynamics: needed for understanding coordinated control requirements; quick check: validate with coupled degree-of-freedom experiments
- Haptic feedback impedance control: needed for providing compliant assistance; quick check: test different impedance parameters on task performance
- Risk-sensitive success scoring: needed for adaptive assistance intensity; quick check: evaluate score reliability across varying task conditions

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Offline data collection -> Conservative value learning -> Success score estimation -> Assistance intensity regulation -> Corrective actor network -> Joint-space impedance control -> Master haptic feedback

Critical path: Offline teleoperation data → Conservative value network → Success score → Assistance intensity → Corrective motion → Impedance control → Haptic feedback

Design tradeoffs: The system prioritizes human authority over full automation, accepting slower assistance adaptation in favor of maintaining operator control. Conservative learning sacrifices some performance on familiar tasks to ensure reliability on novel scenarios.

Failure signatures: Poor data quality in offline collection leads to unreliable success scores; overly conservative assistance reduces task completion speed; insufficient impedance tuning causes unstable haptic feedback.

First experiments:
1. Validate success score accuracy on held-out manipulation tasks
2. Test assistance effectiveness on simple pick-and-place with varying contact conditions
3. Evaluate human-in-the-loop performance on multi-step assembly tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided text.

## Limitations
- Performance gains may not generalize to complex or unstructured environments
- System reliability depends heavily on quality and diversity of offline teleoperation data
- Claims of "continuous human authority" need clarification regarding intervention limits during active assistance

## Confidence
High confidence: The technical feasibility of the proposed value-guided assistance framework
Medium confidence: The generalization of reported performance improvements across diverse manipulation scenarios
Low confidence: The long-term effectiveness of the system in highly dynamic or unstructured environments

## Next Checks
1. Test the system on tasks outside the training distribution to evaluate failure-aware assistance under significant distribution shift
2. Conduct user studies comparing operator satisfaction and perceived control between different assistance levels
3. Evaluate the computational overhead and real-time performance of the value estimation and assistance computation during operation
