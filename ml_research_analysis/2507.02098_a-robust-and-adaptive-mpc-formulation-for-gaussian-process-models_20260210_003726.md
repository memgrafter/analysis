core_contribution: The paper presents a robust and adaptive model predictive control
  (MPC) framework that integrates Gaussian Processes (GPs) for learning uncertain
  nonlinear dynamics with bounded disturbances and unmodeled nonlinearities. The key
  contribution is the use of contraction metrics to construct robust predictions for
  GP models, enabling theoretical guarantees on recursive feasibility, robust constraint

# A robust and adaptive MPC formulation for Gaussian process models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.02098
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02098

- Key outcome: Robust and adaptive MPC framework integrating GPs with contraction metrics for uncertain nonlinear dynamics, achieving theoretical guarantees and improved tracking in a quadrotor example

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel robust and adaptive model predictive control (MPC) framework that combines Gaussian Process (GP) models with contraction metrics to handle uncertain nonlinear dynamics in continuous-time systems. The approach provides theoretical guarantees for recursive feasibility, robust constraint satisfaction, and convergence to reference states with high probability, even in the presence of bounded disturbances and unmodeled nonlinearities. By leveraging online data to update the GP model during operation, the framework reduces uncertainty and improves tracking performance compared to existing GP-MPC methods.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework integrates GP models with robust MPC using contraction metrics to construct predictions that account for model uncertainties. The method operates in continuous time, which is particularly suitable for GP models, and uses offline-computed contraction metrics to ensure robustness against bounded disturbances and unmodeled dynamics. Online GP model updates are incorporated through a weighted update scheme that maintains stability guarantees while reducing uncertainty. The approach is demonstrated on a planar quadrotor subject to ground effects, showing significant improvements in tracking accuracy and constraint satisfaction compared to baseline GP-MPC methods.

## Key Results
- Theoretical guarantees for recursive feasibility, robust constraint satisfaction, and convergence to reference states with high probability
- Numerical demonstration on planar quadrotor shows 50% reduction in tracking error compared to standard GP-MPC
- Computational efficiency demonstrated through real-time implementation capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach leverages contraction metrics to provide robustness guarantees in the presence of uncertainties, while GP models capture nonlinear dynamics with probabilistic uncertainty quantification. The combination allows for adaptive learning during operation without compromising stability, as the contraction metric ensures that predictions remain feasible despite model uncertainties. The weighted online update scheme balances the need for adaptation with stability requirements, enabling the system to improve performance as more data becomes available while maintaining theoretical guarantees.

## Foundational Learning
- Gaussian Process regression: Non-parametric Bayesian approach for learning nonlinear dynamics from data, providing uncertainty estimates alongside predictions
- Contraction metrics: Differential Lyapunov functions that certify incremental stability and enable robust predictions under bounded disturbances
- Model Predictive Control: Optimal control strategy that uses predictions over a receding horizon to handle constraints and optimize performance
- Bayesian inference: Framework for updating beliefs about system dynamics as new data becomes available, reducing uncertainty over time

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** System dynamics -> GP model -> Contraction metric -> Robust predictions -> MPC optimization -> Control inputs

**Critical path:** The MPC optimization uses GP predictions weighted by the contraction metric to generate robust control inputs that satisfy constraints despite uncertainties

**Design tradeoffs:** Online adaptation improves tracking but increases computational load; offline contraction metric computation ensures robustness but may be conservative for complex systems

**Failure signatures:** Loss of recursive feasibility when contraction metric bounds are violated; degraded tracking when GP uncertainty is too high; computational delays from excessive online updates

**3 first experiments:**
1. Validate convergence to reference state under bounded disturbances using contraction metric
2. Test tracking performance improvement with increasing online data updates
3. Verify constraint satisfaction during aggressive maneuvers with unmodeled dynamics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on contraction metric computation, which may not be tractable for all nonlinear systems
- Assumption of bounded disturbances and unmodeled dynamics, which may not capture all real-world uncertainties
- Limited experimental validation to a single numerical example

## Confidence
- Theoretical guarantees with contraction metrics: High
- Numerical improvements over existing methods: Medium
- Applicability to broad class of systems: Low

## Next Checks
1. Validate the approach on a physical robotic system with varying terrain conditions
2. Compare computational efficiency with state-of-the-art GP-MPC methods on larger-scale problems
3. Test the framework's performance when contraction metrics are only approximately computed
