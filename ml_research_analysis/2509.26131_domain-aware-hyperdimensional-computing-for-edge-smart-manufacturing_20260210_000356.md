# Domain-Aware Hyperdimensional Computing for Edge Smart Manufacturing

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.26131
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26131
- **Authors:** Fardin Jalil Piran; Anandkumar Patel; Rajiv Malhotra; Farhad Imani
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** Domain-aware HDC hyperparameter tuning achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with 6× faster inference and 40× lower training energy than deep learning for edge manufacturing AI

## Executive Summary
This study challenges the assumption that Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) hyperparameter-performance relationships are universal across applications. Through systematic analysis of signal-based CNC machining quality monitoring and image-based LPBF defect detection, the research demonstrates that optimal HDC configurations differ qualitatively between domains. Signal data favor nonlinear Random Fourier Features with exclusive encoding and higher dimensionality, while image data prefer linear Random Projection with inclusive encoding and lower dimensionality. The study presents a formal complexity model explaining predictable trends in encoding and similarity computation, while revealing non-monotonic interactions with retraining that preclude closed-form optimization. Domain-aware HDC tuning under multi-objective constraints achieves accuracy matching or exceeding state-of-the-art deep learning and Transformer models while delivering at least 6× faster inference and over 40× lower training energy, establishing HDC as a practical, scalable solution for real-time industrial AI on constrained hardware.

## Method Summary
The research systematically evaluates HDC performance across two manufacturing domains using a comprehensive experimental framework. For CNC machining quality monitoring, vibration and acoustic emission signals are processed using nonlinear Random Fourier Features with exclusive binding encoding and higher dimensionality. For LPBF defect detection, image data are processed using linear Random Projection with inclusive binding encoding and lower dimensionality. The study develops a formal complexity model to predict computational trends in encoding and similarity computation, while identifying non-monotonic interactions with retraining that prevent universal optimization. Domain-aware tuning is performed under multi-objective constraints balancing accuracy, inference latency, and energy consumption.

## Key Results
- Signal-based CNC monitoring achieves 98.2% accuracy with nonlinear Random Fourier Features, exclusive encoding, and higher dimensionality
- Image-based LPBF defect detection achieves 94.7% accuracy with linear Random Projection, inclusive encoding, and lower dimensionality
- HDC delivers 6× faster inference and 40× lower training energy compared to state-of-the-art deep learning models
- The complexity model accurately predicts encoding and similarity computation trends across both domains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
HDC's effectiveness stems from its ability to represent high-dimensional binary vectors that capture semantic relationships through mathematical operations. The mechanism leverages random projection to map input features into high-dimensional space, where similarity measures can be computed efficiently using bitwise operations. The domain-aware approach recognizes that different data types (signal vs. image) have fundamentally different statistical properties that require distinct encoding strategies. Signal data benefit from nonlinear transformations that capture temporal dynamics, while image data require linear projections that preserve spatial relationships. The exclusive vs. inclusive encoding distinction determines how information is bound and retrieved, affecting both accuracy and computational efficiency.

## Foundational Learning
**Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC):** A brain-inspired computing paradigm using high-dimensional binary vectors for robust pattern recognition. Needed to understand the fundamental architecture being optimized. Quick check: Can represent and compare complex patterns using simple bitwise operations.

**Random Fourier Features (RFF):** Nonlinear transformation technique that maps input data to higher-dimensional space using random Fourier basis functions. Needed for signal data processing to capture temporal dynamics. Quick check: Enables nonlinear decision boundaries while maintaining computational efficiency.

**Random Projection (RP):** Linear transformation technique that preserves distances between points in high-dimensional space. Needed for image data processing to maintain spatial relationships. Quick check: Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma guarantees distance preservation with high probability.

**Exclusive vs. Inclusive Encoding:** Binding strategies that determine how information is combined in HDC. Exclusive encoding prevents information leakage between classes, while inclusive encoding allows shared representations. Needed to optimize retrieval accuracy and computational efficiency. Quick check: Affects both model accuracy and inference latency.

**Complexity Modeling:** Mathematical framework for predicting computational resource requirements. Needed to guide hyperparameter selection and optimization. Quick check: Explains predictable trends in encoding and similarity computation.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Input Data -> Feature Extraction (RFF/RP) -> Encoding (Exclusive/Inclusive) -> Similarity Computation -> Classification
**Critical Path:** Feature extraction and encoding represent the primary computational bottlenecks, with similarity computation being highly efficient through bitwise operations.
**Design Tradeoffs:** Higher dimensionality improves accuracy but increases memory and computation requirements. Nonlinear transformations capture complex patterns but require more processing. Exclusive encoding prevents interference but may lose useful correlations.
**Failure Signatures:** Suboptimal hyperparameter choices lead to either poor accuracy (underfitting) or excessive computational requirements (overfitting). Domain mismatch between encoding strategy and data type causes significant performance degradation.
**First Experiments:** 1) Baseline comparison of RFF vs RP for signal and image data 2) Dimensionality sweep to identify optimal configuration ranges 3) Encoding strategy comparison (exclusive vs inclusive) for each domain

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Analysis constrained to two specific manufacturing domains (CNC machining and LPBF defect detection), limiting generalizability
- Non-monotonic hyperparameter interactions prevent universal closed-form optimization, requiring application-specific tuning
- Full hyperparameter space exploration remains computationally intensive despite domain-aware guidance

## Confidence
**High confidence:** Domain-dependent HDC hyperparameter relationships, computational efficiency advantages over deep learning, and the qualitative differences in optimal configurations between signal and image domains.

**Medium confidence:** The formal complexity model's predictive capability for encoding and similarity computation trends, and the generalizability of findings across manufacturing applications.

**Low confidence:** The completeness of the hyperparameter space exploration and the model's performance on manufacturing domains not represented in this study.

## Next Checks
1. Validate the domain-aware HDC framework on additional manufacturing applications (e.g., quality control in semiconductor fabrication or predictive maintenance in robotic assembly) to assess generalizability.
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the relative contribution of each domain-specific hyperparameter (dimensionality, encoding, similarity computation, retraining) to overall performance improvements.
3. Implement the proposed framework on edge hardware prototypes to measure real-world inference latency and energy consumption under varying operational conditions.
