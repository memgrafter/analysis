# LLaMA-Based Models for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.08649
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08649
- Reference count: 10
- Key outcome: Fine-tuned Orca 2 (13B) achieves state-of-the-art ABSA performance, outperforming previous benchmarks by up to 8%

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) for compound aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) tasks. The study evaluates LLaMA-based models—LLaMA 2 and Orca 2—on four ABSA tasks and eight English datasets, comparing zero-shot, few-shot, and fully fine-tuned settings. The fine-tuned Orca 2 model, especially its 13B version, achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks and datasets, surpassing previous benchmarks by up to 8%. Zero-shot and few-shot performances remain significantly lower, and error analysis shows that opinion term prediction is the most challenging aspect for these models. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of fine-tuning LLaMA-based models for ABSA and highlight their limitations in few-shot learning.

## Method Summary
The paper evaluates LLaMA 2 and Orca 2 models on four ABSA tasks across eight English datasets. The study compares three training approaches: zero-shot, few-shot, and fully fine-tuned settings. The models are assessed on their ability to perform aspect extraction, opinion term extraction, aspect-level sentiment classification, and aspect-opinion pair extraction. Fine-tuning is performed using standard techniques with careful attention to hyperparameter selection. The evaluation includes comprehensive error analysis to identify model weaknesses, particularly focusing on the challenging opinion term prediction task.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned Orca 2 (13B) achieves state-of-the-art performance across all four ABSA tasks and eight datasets
- Zero-shot and few-shot performances remain substantially lower than fully fine-tuned models
- Opinion term prediction emerges as the most challenging task for all evaluated models
- Fine-tuned models outperform previous benchmarks by up to 8% in absolute performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Fine-tuned LLaMA-based models leverage their large-scale pretraining to capture complex linguistic patterns necessary for ABSA tasks. The models' transformer architecture enables them to understand contextual relationships between aspects, opinions, and sentiment expressions. The fine-tuning process adapts these general language capabilities to the specific requirements of ABSA, allowing the models to identify aspect-opinion pairs and their corresponding sentiments with high accuracy. The 13B parameter version of Orca 2 benefits from increased model capacity to handle the complexity of compound ABSA tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzing sentiments toward specific aspects within text - needed to understand the core task the models are solving
- **Transformer Architecture**: Self-attention mechanisms for capturing contextual relationships - fundamental to how LLaMA-based models process language
- **Fine-tuning vs. Zero/Few-shot Learning**: Different approaches to adapting pretrained models - critical for understanding performance differences
- **Compound Tasks**: Combining multiple ABSA subtasks (aspect extraction, opinion extraction, sentiment classification) - relevant for the multi-task evaluation
- **Parameter Scaling**: Impact of model size (7B vs 13B) on performance - important for interpreting the results
- **Error Analysis**: Systematic examination of model mistakes - necessary for understanding limitations

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Text -> Tokenizer -> LLaMA/Orca Transformer -> Task-specific Head -> Output Labels

**Critical Path**: Tokenization → Embedding Layer → Multi-head Self-attention → Feed-forward Networks → Task Head → Classification

**Design Tradeoffs**: Model size vs. computational efficiency (13B provides better performance but higher resource requirements); fine-tuning vs. prompt engineering (fine-tuning yields superior results)

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Difficulty with opinion term extraction
- Performance degradation in few-shot settings
- Challenges with compound task dependencies
- Lower accuracy on complex aspect-opinion relationships

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Compare zero-shot vs. few-shot vs. fine-tuned performance on a single ABSA task
2. Evaluate model performance on aspect extraction alone vs. compound ABSA tasks
3. Test different model sizes (7B vs 13B) on the same dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Zero-shot and few-shot performances remain substantially lower than fully fine-tuned models
- Study focuses exclusively on English datasets, limiting cross-lingual applicability
- Error analysis lacks detailed characterization of specific failure patterns
- Computational efficiency comparisons between model sizes are absent

## Confidence
- High: Fine-tuned Orca 2 models achieve state-of-the-art performance across all tasks
- Medium: Characterization of few-shot limitations and error patterns in opinion term prediction
- Medium: Claims about computational costs and training efficiency

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to determine optimal fine-tuning hyperparameters and their impact on performance
2. Test the models on multilingual datasets to evaluate cross-lingual transfer capabilities
3. Implement detailed error analysis with specific examples to better understand challenges in opinion term prediction and identify potential architectural improvements
