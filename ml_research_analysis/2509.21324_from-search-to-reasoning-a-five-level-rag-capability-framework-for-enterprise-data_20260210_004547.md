# From Search to Reasoning: A Five-Level RAG Capability Framework for Enterprise Data

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.21324
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21324
- **Reference count**: 4
- **Primary result**: Introduced a five-level framework (L1-L5) for classifying RAG systems by reasoning complexity and data modality, with L4 system achieving 82.74%, 63.83%, 79.44%, and 65.12% accuracy on four datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a five-level framework (L1-L5) for classifying Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by the complexity of data modalities and reasoning they support, from basic text retrieval (L1) to general intelligence (L5). It proposes structure-aware data representation, mixture of spaces, and adaptive chain of actions as core techniques for enabling L4 (reflective and reasoned knowledge) capabilities. Evaluated across four datasets (DelucionQA, FinTabNet, DMV Handbooks, Architectural Manuals), the L4 system (Corvic AI) achieved 82.74%, 63.83%, 79.44%, and 65.12% accuracy, outperforming L1 and L2 systems and showing increasing advantage with task complexity.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a five-level RAG capability framework (L1-L5) with a focus on L4 capabilities involving reflective reasoning and multimodal data handling. The L4 system uses structure-aware data representation, mixture of spaces (semantic, structural, metadata indexing), and adaptive chain of actions (reflective orchestration). Evaluation used four datasets from HuggingFace, with accuracy determined via LLM-as-a-Judge (gemini-2.0-flash using ragas library). GPT-4.1 was used for generation, text-embedding-3-large for embeddings, and ChromaDB for vector storage in baselines.

## Key Results
- L4 system achieved 82.74%, 63.83%, 79.44%, and 65.12% accuracy on DelucionQA, FinTabNet, DMV Handbooks, and Architectural Manuals respectively
- L4 showed increasing advantage over L1/L2 systems as task complexity increased across all four datasets
- Mixture of spaces approach improved recall when semantic search failed to match specific terminology or context

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Multi-Space Redundancy for Recall Recovery
Instead of a single semantic index, the system projects documents into semantic, structural, and metadata spaces. If a query fails to match in the semantic space, the system can recover the context via structural hierarchy or metadata tags. This redundancy increases both recall and precision, particularly for structured documents where relevant context is discoverable via non-semantic cues even when semantic similarity is low.

### Mechanism 2: Reflective Orchestration for Gap Mitigation
An orchestrator evaluates if retrieved context satisfies the query intent. If gaps are detected (missing entities, unanswerable), the system executes a new chain of actions—switching retrieval spaces or invoking tools—rather than hallucinating an answer. This reflective reasoning reduces brittleness by retrying with alternate spaces or tools when evidence is sparse.

### Mechanism 3: Structure-Aware Unification for Grounding
Documents are parsed into an enriched intermediate form that explicitly links text to embedded tables, hierarchies, and cross-references. This prevents context stripping where a table cell is divorced from its column header, enabling precise section or field-specific retrieval across unstructured and structured modalities.

## Foundational Learning

- **Dense Vector Retrieval vs. Hybrid Search**
  - Why needed: The framework critiques pure dense retrieval (L1) and introduces hybrid "Mixture of Spaces" (L4). Understanding vector similarity limitations is prerequisite to grasping why structural spaces are necessary.
  - Quick check: Why would a semantic search fail to find a specific part number in a technical manual if the user doesn't know the exact name?

- **Agentic Planning (Chain of Thought)**
  - Why needed: L4 capabilities rely on "Adaptive Chain of Actions," which is fundamentally an agent architecture. You must understand how LLMs decompose goals into steps to understand the orchestration layer.
  - Quick check: What is the difference between a static RAG pipeline (fixed steps) and an agentic RAG pipeline (dynamic steps)?

- **Hallucination vs. Grounding**
  - Why needed: The paper frames L4 as a solution to the "existential risk" of hallucinations in enterprise settings. The mechanism of "reflection" is specifically designed to ensure grounding.
  - Quick check: How does providing external context (grounding) mathematically constrain the output space of an LLM to reduce hallucination?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Ingestion (Structure-Aware Parser) -> Indexing (Mixture of Spaces Indexer) -> Orchestration (Adaptive Chain of Actions Controller) -> Execution (Tool Layer + LLM Generation)
- **Critical path**: The Structure-Aware Data Representation. Without accurate parsing of hierarchies and tables, the downstream "Mixture of Spaces" has no structural signal to index, and the agent has nothing to reason over.
- **Design tradeoffs**: L4 systems use iterative loops (ACoA), improving accuracy but significantly increasing latency compared to L1 single-shot retrieval. L1/L2 are easier to implement but fail on multimodal data, while L4 handles modality but requires complex parsing and orchestration maintenance.
- **Failure signatures**: L1/L2 Failure manifests as "semantically similar but contextually wrong" retrieval; L4 Failure shows "Orchestration Loops" where reflection logic cannot satisfy its own stopping condition, or "Parsing Drift" where table structures are misinterpreted.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Run the same query set against a single-space vector store (L1) vs. Mixture of Spaces (L4) to measure delta in retrieving table-based answers.
  2. Disable the "reflective re-planning" loop in ACoA layer and measure accuracy drop for multi-hop questions to validate cost/benefit of agentic layer.
  3. Ingest a complex PDF and inspect intermediate representation to verify that "Document hierarchies" and "Embedded tables" are correctly linked before indexing.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How does the performance of an L4 system compare against representative L3 (Implicative Knowledge) baselines on complex reasoning tasks?
- **Basis in paper**: Section 6 states that future work will "include L3 baselines," which were absent in the current evaluation between L1, L2, and L4 systems.
- **Why unresolved**: The study evaluates L1, L2, and L4, leaving the specific performance delta between L3 (synthesis/inference) and L4 (reflective reasoning) unquantified.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Benchmark results including an L3-capable system on the DelucionQA, FinTabNet, and DMV datasets to isolate the value of L4's "reflective" capabilities over L3's "implicative" ones.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: What is the individual contribution of the "Mixture of Spaces" (MoS) versus "Adaptive Chain of Actions" (ACoA) to the observed accuracy improvements?
- **Basis in paper**: Section 6 calls for "targeted ablations" to map trade-offs; currently, the L4 results are presented for the Corvic AI system as a whole without isolating variables.
- **Why unresolved**: It is unclear whether performance gains are driven primarily by the multi-view retrieval (MoS) or the dynamic planning/agentic behavior (ACoA).
- **What evidence would resolve it**: An ablation study measuring accuracy drops when MoS or ACoA is disabled independently in the pipeline.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: What are the latency and computational cost overheads introduced by the L4 architecture's reflective loops compared to static L1/L2 pipelines?
- **Basis in paper**: Section 6 notes that future work is needed to "map accuracy–latency–cost trade-offs more completely."
- **Why unresolved**: While L4 improves accuracy, the "Adaptive Chain of Actions" implies multiple retrieval steps and tool invocations which likely increase response time and cost, metrics not reported in the results.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Comparative measurements of time-to-first-token and token consumption per query across the L1, L2, and L4 configurations.

## Limitations
- Corvic AI's L4 system is proprietary, making core mechanisms black boxes
- No error rates or robustness metrics provided for the structure-aware parser
- LLM-as-a-judge evaluation introduces potential subjectivity
- L5 "general intelligence" level remains entirely theoretical with no empirical validation

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The five-level taxonomy (L1-L5) is logically coherent and aligns with established progression in RAG research
- **Medium confidence**: Performance improvements are plausible given dataset complexity but cannot be independently verified without L4 implementation
- **Low confidence**: L5 "general intelligence" claims lack empirical support and appear aspirational

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation study on Mixture of Spaces**: Implement a three-space retrieval system and measure recall improvement on VDocRAG's visually-rich documents compared to single-space baseline
2. **Reflective orchestration calibration**: Build a simple gap-detection loop that retries retrieval with alternate strategies when LLM judges context insufficient, then measure accuracy gains on multi-hop questions from DMV Handbooks
3. **Parser robustness audit**: Test structure-aware parsing on a corpus of complex PDFs with nested tables and diagrams, measuring extraction accuracy against ground truth layouts to quantify error propagation risk
