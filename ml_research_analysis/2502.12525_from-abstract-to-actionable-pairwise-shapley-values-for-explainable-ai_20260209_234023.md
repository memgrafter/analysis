# From Abstract to Actionable: Pairwise Shapley Values for Explainable AI

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Novel pairwise Shapley framework improves interpretability through human-relatable instance comparisons while maintaining computational efficiency

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of improving interpretability in Shapley value-based feature attribution methods for explainable AI. The authors propose Pairwise Shapley Values, a novel framework that grounds feature attributions in explicit, human-relatable comparisons between proximal data instances, using single-value imputation for efficiency. Unlike traditional methods relying on abstract baselines or computationally intensive calculations, their approach mimics human decision-making strategies like comparative market analysis in real estate. The method was evaluated on diverse regression and classification tasks (home pricing, polymer property prediction, drug discovery), demonstrating enhanced interpretability through more intuitive explanations, improved model insights (e.g., monotonicity rates), and computational efficiency. The pairwise approach consistently outperformed existing Shapley-based methods while maintaining robustness across different similarity algorithms for reference selection.

## Method Summary
The Pairwise Shapley Values framework introduces a novel approach to feature attribution by computing Shapley values through pairwise comparisons between a target instance and its most similar neighbors. Instead of using abstract baselines, the method employs single-value imputation to handle missing data efficiently while maintaining computational tractability. The framework selects reference instances based on similarity metrics, then calculates feature contributions by comparing how features differ between the target and reference instances. This approach mimics human decision-making patterns, where people naturally compare similar cases to understand differences. The method was evaluated across multiple regression and classification tasks, demonstrating both improved interpretability and computational efficiency compared to traditional Shapley value implementations.

## Key Results
- Demonstrated computational efficiency gains through single-value imputation while maintaining explanation quality
- Improved interpretability with human-relatable comparisons in home pricing, polymer property prediction, and drug discovery tasks
- Achieved robust performance across diverse similarity algorithms for reference selection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Pairwise Shapley Values method works by grounding feature attributions in concrete, relatable comparisons rather than abstract baselines. By selecting similar reference instances and computing differences between them and the target instance, the framework creates explanations that align with how humans naturally reason about differences and similarities. The single-value imputation strategy provides computational efficiency while still capturing essential feature relationships. The method's effectiveness stems from its ability to translate complex model behavior into intuitive comparative narratives that domain experts can readily understand and validate.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Shapley Value Theory**: Understanding cooperative game theory foundations for feature attribution
   - Why needed: Provides theoretical grounding for fair feature contribution allocation
   - Quick check: Can explain how marginal contributions are calculated in cooperative games

2. **Imputation Methods**: Knowledge of single-value vs. multiple imputation strategies
   - Why needed: Critical for understanding computational trade-offs and data handling
   - Quick check: Can compare efficiency and accuracy implications of different imputation approaches

3. **Similarity Metrics**: Understanding various distance and similarity measures
   - Why needed: Reference selection quality directly impacts explanation validity
   - Quick check: Can explain how different metrics affect neighborhood selection

4. **Feature Attribution Methods**: Comparative understanding of LIME, SHAP, and other attribution techniques
   - Why needed: Context for evaluating pairwise approach against established methods
   - Quick check: Can articulate key differences between model-agnostic attribution approaches

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data -> Similarity Selection -> Reference Pair Formation -> Single-Value Imputation -> Shapley Calculation -> Attribution Output

**Critical Path**: Target instance → Similarity algorithm → Reference instance selection → Pairwise comparison → Attribution calculation

**Design Tradeoffs**: Computational efficiency vs. imputation accuracy, similarity metric choice vs. explanation stability, pairwise granularity vs. interpretability

**Failure Signatures**: Poor similarity metrics lead to irrelevant comparisons, inadequate imputation fails to capture feature interactions, computational bottlenecks with high-dimensional data

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Baseline comparison: Traditional SHAP vs. Pairwise SHAP on synthetic dataset with known ground truth
2. Similarity sensitivity: Test multiple similarity metrics on same dataset to evaluate robustness
3. Computational benchmarking: Measure runtime and memory usage across different dataset sizes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on single-value imputation may not fully capture complex missing data scenarios compared to sophisticated imputation methods
- Effectiveness heavily dependent on quality of similarity measures used for reference selection
- Subjective nature of "human-relatable comparisons" introduces variability in user validation

## Confidence

**High Confidence**:
- Computational efficiency claims: Supported by direct comparisons and timing data

**Medium Confidence**:
- Interpretability improvements: Based on qualitative assessments and specific case studies
- Performance robustness across tasks: Demonstrated on diverse but limited datasets

## Next Checks

1. Benchmark against state-of-the-art imputation methods to quantify trade-offs between computational efficiency and explanation quality
2. User studies with domain experts to validate whether pairwise explanations genuinely improve decision-making compared to traditional Shapley methods
3. Stress testing with adversarial or noisy similarity measures to assess robustness of reference selection process
