core_contribution: CalPro is a prior-aware evidential-conformal framework for calibrated,
  shift-robust uncertainty quantification in structured regression, particularly for
  protein structure prediction. It combines a geometric evidential head that outputs
  Normal-Inverse-Gamma predictive distributions via graph-based architectures, a differentiable
  conformal layer for end-to-end training with finite-sample coverage guarantees,
  and domain priors (disorder, flexibility) encoded as soft constraints.

# CalPro: Prior-Aware Evidential--Conformal Prediction with Structure-Aware Guarantees for Protein Structures

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.07201
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07201
- Authors: Ibne Farabi Shihab; Sanjeda Akter; Anuj Sharma
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: Near-nominal coverage under distribution shift with 30-50% reduced calibration error and 25% improved docking success

## Executive Summary
CalPro introduces a novel framework for calibrated uncertainty quantification in structured regression tasks, specifically addressing the challenges of protein structure prediction. The method combines evidential prediction with conformal inference to provide both theoretical guarantees and practical performance improvements. By incorporating domain priors as soft constraints and using a differentiable conformal layer, CalPro achieves robust coverage under distribution shift while maintaining sharp uncertainty estimates in regions where prior knowledge is informative.

## Method Summary
CalPro is a prior-aware evidential-conformal framework that addresses uncertainty quantification in structured regression, particularly for protein structure prediction. The method integrates a geometric evidential head producing Normal-Inverse-Gamma predictive distributions through graph-based architectures, a differentiable conformal layer enabling end-to-end training with finite-sample coverage guarantees, and domain priors (disorder, flexibility) encoded as soft constraints. The framework maintains near-nominal coverage under distribution shift with minimal degradation while reducing calibration error significantly and improving downstream task performance.

## Key Results
- Maintains near-nominal coverage under distribution shift with at most 5% degradation versus 15-25% for baselines
- Reduces calibration error by 30-50% compared to standard methods
- Improves downstream ligand-docking success by 25% while preserving coverage guarantees

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CalPro works by leveraging the complementary strengths of evidential prediction and conformal inference. The evidential component captures uncertainty through Normal-Inverse-Gamma distributions, which naturally encode both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. The conformal layer provides finite-sample coverage guarantees by calibrating these predictions based on empirical data. By incorporating domain priors as soft constraints, the method can exploit prior knowledge about protein flexibility and disorder regions to produce sharper intervals where priors are reliable, while falling back to data-driven estimates elsewhere. The PAC-Bayesian theoretical framework ensures that these advantages translate to structure-aware coverage guarantees.

## Foundational Learning
**Evidential Prediction**: Why needed - to naturally represent both types of uncertainty; Quick check - verify conjugate prior-posterior pairs maintain analytical tractability
**Conformal Inference**: Why needed - to provide finite-sample coverage guarantees without distributional assumptions; Quick check - confirm non-conformity scores are permutation-invariant
**PAC-Bayesian Bounds**: Why needed - to derive generalization guarantees over structured hypothesis spaces; Quick check - validate ambiguity set construction preserves coverage
**Graph Neural Networks**: Why needed - to capture structural dependencies in protein conformations; Quick check - ensure message-passing preserves equivariance properties
**Domain Priors**: Why needed - to incorporate expert knowledge about protein flexibility/disorder; Quick check - verify soft constraint gradients remain stable during training
**Normal-Inverse-Gamma Distributions**: Why needed - to maintain conjugate structure for efficient inference; Quick check - confirm predictive distributions remain well-behaved under parameter uncertainty

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Protein Structure Data -> Graph Neural Network Encoder -> Evidential Head (NIG) -> Conformal Layer -> Calibrated Predictions
**Critical Path**: Data preprocessing and graph construction → GNN feature extraction → NIG parameter estimation → Conformal calibration → Coverage verification
**Design Tradeoffs**: NIG assumptions vs multimodal uncertainty capture; Prior strength vs data-driven flexibility; Computational cost vs theoretical guarantees
**Failure Signatures**: Poor coverage when priors are incorrect; Degraded performance with multimodal uncertainty; Calibration breakdown under severe covariate shift
**First Experiments**:
1. Test coverage maintenance under synthetic covariate shift
2. Evaluate prior sensitivity by varying constraint strength
3. Compare computational overhead vs baseline conformal methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- NIG conjugate structure may not capture multimodal uncertainty patterns common in protein prediction
- Performance depends heavily on quality and availability of domain priors
- Theoretical guarantees rely on assumptions that may not hold in practice

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Empirical coverage results under distribution shift (5% degradation vs 15-25% baselines) and 25% docking improvement
- **Medium confidence**: Theoretical PAC-Bayesian guarantees and 30-50% calibration error reduction
- **Medium confidence**: Practical tightness of theoretical bounds for real protein datasets

## Next Checks
1. Test CalPro on protein families with known multimodal uncertainty patterns to assess NIG assumption breakdown
2. Evaluate performance when domain priors are noisy or incomplete, measuring prior quality vs calibration trade-off
3. Compare against conformal methods without conjugate priors to validate practical advantages in challenging scenarios
