# Quantum Computing Supported Adversarial Attack-Resilient Autonomous Vehicle Perception Module for Traffic Sign Classification

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2504.12644
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12644
- **Reference count**: 11
- **Primary result**: HCQ-DL models maintain >95% accuracy without attacks and >91% against GA/FGSA attacks, with 85% accuracy during PGD attacks versus <21% for classical models

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the critical vulnerability of deep learning-based autonomous vehicle perception systems to adversarial attacks by proposing hybrid classical-quantum deep learning (HCQ-DL) models. The approach integrates transfer learning models (alexnet and vgg-16) as feature extractors with quantum neural networks (QNNs) using variational quantum circuits (VQC) to enhance robustness against adversarial attacks. The HCQ-DL models were specifically tested on traffic sign classification tasks under three untargeted adversarial attack scenarios.

The research demonstrates that HCQ-DL models significantly outperform classical deep learning (C-DL) models in adversarial settings, maintaining accuracy above 95% in normal conditions and above 91% against two attack types. Notably, during projected gradient descent (PGD) attacks, the alexnet-based HCQ-DL model achieved 85% accuracy compared to under 21% for C-DL models, representing a substantial improvement in adversarial robustness for autonomous vehicle perception systems.

## Method Summary
The methodology employs transfer learning models (alexnet and vgg-16) as feature extractors, with their output layers replaced by quantum neural networks (QNNs). The QNNs utilize variational quantum circuits (VQC) to process the extracted features and improve robustness against adversarial attacks. The system was trained and evaluated using the GTSRB traffic sign dataset, with three untargeted adversarial attacks (PGD, FGSA, and GA) applied during testing to assess performance under attack conditions.

## Key Results
- HCQ-DL models achieved >95% accuracy in no-attack scenarios
- Against GA and FGSA attacks, HCQ-DL maintained >91% accuracy
- During PGD attacks, alexnet-based HCQ-DL achieved 85% accuracy versus <21% for classical models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The quantum neural networks in the hybrid architecture introduce non-linear transformations and increased parameter space that make it more difficult for adversarial perturbations to fool the classification system. The variational quantum circuits provide a richer feature space and more complex decision boundaries compared to classical neural networks, which helps the model maintain robustness against gradient-based adversarial attacks by making gradient estimation more challenging for attackers.

## Foundational Learning
- **Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC)**: Parametrized quantum circuits used as quantum neural networks; needed for introducing quantum-enhanced feature transformations; quick check: verify circuit depth and parameter count
- **Transfer Learning**: Using pre-trained classical models as feature extractors; needed to leverage existing feature representations; quick check: confirm frozen vs trainable layers
- **Adversarial Attacks (PGD, FGSA, GA)**: Gradient-based attack methods targeting model vulnerabilities; needed to benchmark robustness; quick check: verify attack parameters and implementation fidelity
- **Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)**: Quantum circuits adapted for machine learning tasks; needed to provide quantum advantage in feature space; quick check: validate quantum circuit compilation and execution

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Traffic Sign Images -> Classical Feature Extractor (alexnet/vgg-16) -> Quantum Neural Network (VQC) -> Classification Output
**Critical Path**: Input → Feature Extraction → Quantum Processing → Classification
**Design Tradeoffs**: Quantum circuits offer enhanced robustness but require simulator-based validation and face hardware implementation challenges
**Failure Signatures**: Degradation during PGD attacks, potential quantum circuit optimization issues, classical-quantum integration bottlenecks
**First Experiments**: 1) Validate baseline performance without quantum components, 2) Test individual quantum circuit configurations, 3) Benchmark against targeted adversarial attacks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to three specific untargeted attack methods without testing against targeted attacks or real-world perturbations
- Quantum components validated only on simulators, not on actual quantum hardware
- Single dataset (traffic signs) without cross-domain testing or larger perception task validation

## Confidence
- HCQ-DL superiority claims: Medium
- Quantum robustness benefits: Medium
- Traffic sign classification results: High

## Next Checks
1. Test HCQ-DL models against targeted adversarial attacks and physical-world perturbations on traffic signs
2. Implement and benchmark the quantum circuits on actual quantum hardware (IBM Q, Rigetti) to measure real performance gaps
3. Conduct cross-dataset evaluation using the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark and real autonomous driving datasets to assess generalization
