  in Hindi by combining transformer-based encoders (MuRIL, XLM-R) and generative models
  (Llama-2, Llama-3, GPT3.5-turbo) with retrieval augmentation (RA) from Wikipedia.
  RA is applied by retrieving relevant sentences and titles from a Hindi Wikipedia-based

# Enhancing Hindi NER in Low Context: A Comparative study of Transformer-based models with vs. without Retrieval Augmentation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.16002
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16002
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Retrieval augmentation improves low-context Hindi NER performance across transformer encoders and generative models, with XLM-R showing largest relative gain (0.495 to 0.71 macro F1).

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of named entity recognition (NER) in low-context Hindi text by combining transformer-based encoders and generative models with retrieval augmentation from Wikipedia. The research demonstrates that integrating relevant contextual information from a knowledge base significantly improves NER performance, particularly for examples with minimal surrounding context. The methodology employs both fine-tuning approaches for encoders and few-shot prompting for generative models, with systematic evaluation showing consistent improvements across different model architectures.

## Method Summary
The study employs a knowledge base constructed from Hindi Wikipedia, containing articles, categories, and a graph structure. For each input example, a retrieval model (BM25 or DPR) searches this knowledge base to find relevant sentences and titles based on contextual information. The retrieved content is then used to augment the input examples - for transformer encoders, this occurs during fine-tuning by modifying the input with retrieved context, while for generative models, it's incorporated through few-shot prompting strategies. The research compares multiple transformer encoders (MuRIL, XLM-R) and generative models (Llama-2, Llama-3, GPT3.5-turbo) to evaluate the effectiveness of retrieval augmentation across different architectures.

## Key Results
- Retrieval augmentation improves MuRIL macro F1 from 0.69 to 0.70
- XLM-R shows dramatic improvement from 0.495 to 0.71 macro F1 with RA
- GPT3.5-turbo increases from 0.17 to 0.31 macro F1 when using RA
- Llama-2-7B fine-tuned with RA achieves 37.0 macro F1, outperforming base Llama-2-7B and other generative models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Retrieval augmentation works by providing additional contextual information from a knowledge base to supplement low-context input examples. When an input contains insufficient context for accurate entity recognition, the retrieval system finds relevant sentences and titles from Wikipedia that provide background information about entities mentioned in the text. This external context helps models disambiguate entities and understand their roles, particularly when the original input lacks sufficient surrounding information. The mechanism is especially effective for Hindi NER because Wikipedia provides structured, reliable information about named entities that may not be apparent from short or ambiguous text alone.

## Foundational Learning

**Transformer-based encoders (MuRIL, XLM-R)** - why needed: Provide strong cross-lingual representations for Hindi text processing. quick check: Verify multilingual pretraining objectives and Hindi-specific fine-tuning procedures.

**Generative models (Llama-2, Llama-3, GPT3.5-turbo)** - why needed: Enable few-shot learning capabilities for NER tasks with limited labeled data. quick check: Confirm prompt engineering strategies and few-shot examples used.

**Retrieval augmentation (BM25, DPR)** - why needed: Supplies external context when input examples lack sufficient information. quick check: Validate retrieval quality metrics and knowledge base coverage for Hindi entities.

**Knowledge base construction** - why needed: Provides structured information source for contextual retrieval. quick check: Verify Wikipedia extraction process and graph structure integrity.

**Macro F1 evaluation** - why needed: Measures balanced performance across entity classes in NER tasks. quick check: Confirm class distribution and potential imbalance effects on reported metrics.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Input text -> Retrieval model (BM25/DPR) -> Knowledge base (Hindi Wikipedia) -> Retrieved context -> Transformer/generative model -> NER predictions

**Critical path:** The most critical component is the retrieval system's ability to find relevant contextual information. Poor retrieval quality directly degrades the augmentation's effectiveness, regardless of model architecture.

**Design tradeoffs:** The study balances between using lightweight retrieval (BM25) versus more sophisticated neural retrieval (DPR), and between fine-tuning encoders versus using few-shot prompting for generative models. Each approach has different computational requirements and performance characteristics.

**Failure signatures:** If retrieval augmentation fails, expect: (1) retrieval results containing irrelevant or noisy information, (2) minimal performance improvement over baseline models, (3) inconsistent gains across different model architectures, and (4) low precision in retrieved contexts.

**First experiments:** 1) Test retrieval quality independently using standard IR metrics on the Hindi Wikipedia knowledge base. 2) Evaluate ablation of retrieved sentences vs. titles to determine most valuable context. 3) Compare different retrieval models (BM25 vs DPR) on a held-out validation set.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- Results are specific to Hindi language and Hindi Wikipedia knowledge base, limiting generalizability to other languages and knowledge sources
- Large performance jump for XLM-R (0.495 to 0.71) may require verification for reliability
- Even with RA, absolute performance for GPT3.5-turbo remains relatively low (0.31 macro F1), indicating fundamental limitations in Hindi NER capability

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in comparative methodology and experimental design due to established transformer models and systematic baseline comparisons
- **Medium confidence** in generalizability to other low-resource languages given Hindi-specific focus and Wikipedia dependency
- **Medium confidence** in absolute performance numbers due to limited evaluation metrics and lack of contemporary Hindi NER comparisons

## Next Checks
1. Replicate experiments with different knowledge sources (e.g., domain-specific corpora) to assess impact of knowledge base quality and domain relevance on retrieval augmentation effectiveness

2. Conduct ablation studies isolating contributions of retrieved sentences vs. titles to determine optimal retrieval strategies for low-context NER

3. Extend evaluation to other low-resource languages and compare performance across language families to understand generalizability of RA benefits in cross-lingual NER tasks
