# Quantum Enhanced Anomaly Detection for ADS-B Data using Hybrid Deep Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.15991
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15991
- Reference count: 31
- Primary result: Hybrid quantum-classical neural network achieves 90.17%-94.05% accuracy in detecting ADS-B spoofing attacks

## Executive Summary
This study explores the application of quantum machine learning (QML) for anomaly detection in Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data, a critical component of modern aviation safety systems. The research introduces a hybrid quantum-classical neural network (H-FQNN) model that integrates quantum circuits with classical neural network layers to detect trajectory-based spoofing attacks in ADS-B data streams. The H-FQNN model was trained and evaluated on a publicly available ADS-B dataset containing various attack scenarios, including gradual latitude/longitude drift and merge attacks. Performance was benchmarked against a traditional fully connected neural network (FNN) model.

Results demonstrate that the H-FQNN achieves competitive anomaly detection performance, with accuracies ranging from 90.17% to 94.05% and F1 scores reaching 93.99%, closely matching the FNN's performance (91.50%-93.37% accuracy, 93.35% F1 score). The study confirms the feasibility of applying QML to aviation cybersecurity, showing that quantum-enhanced architectures can effectively process complex flight data patterns. Optimal performance was observed with six qubits in the quantum layer, balancing computational efficiency with detection accuracy. These findings establish a foundation for further exploration of quantum methods in safety-critical aviation systems, highlighting QML's potential to enhance real-time anomaly detection capabilities once quantum hardware matures.

## Method Summary
The researchers developed a hybrid quantum-classical neural network (H-FQNN) that combines quantum circuit layers with classical neural network layers to detect spoofing attacks in ADS-B data. The model processes ADS-B trajectory data through a quantum layer consisting of parameterized quantum circuits with rotation gates, followed by classical dense layers for classification. The quantum layer leverages quantum superposition and entanglement properties to capture complex patterns in flight trajectories. The H-FQNN was trained on a simulated ADS-B dataset containing various attack scenarios including gradual drift attacks and merge attacks, with performance evaluated against a traditional fully connected neural network baseline.

## Key Results
- H-FQNN achieved 90.17%-94.05% accuracy in detecting ADS-B spoofing attacks across different attack scenarios
- Model reached F1 scores up to 93.99%, closely matching the FNN baseline performance of 93.35%
- Six qubits in the quantum layer provided optimal balance between computational efficiency and detection accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The hybrid quantum-classical architecture works by leveraging quantum circuits' ability to process high-dimensional feature spaces through superposition, while classical layers handle the final classification decision. The quantum layer captures complex non-linear relationships in flight trajectory data that traditional classical networks might struggle to represent efficiently. The parameterized quantum circuits with rotation gates create a rich feature representation space that can distinguish between normal flight patterns and various spoofing attack signatures. The classical layers then refine these quantum-derived features for accurate binary classification of anomalous vs normal ADS-B transmissions.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: ADS-B Data -> Quantum Circuit Layer (6 qubits) -> Classical Dense Layers -> Classification Output

Critical path: Input normalization → Quantum feature extraction → Classical classification → Output decision

Design tradeoffs: The architecture balances quantum circuit depth (complexity) against noise tolerance and computational efficiency. More qubits provide richer feature representations but increase simulation complexity and hardware requirements.

Failure signatures: Performance degradation occurs when attack patterns closely resemble normal flight behavior, when quantum circuit depth becomes too shallow to capture complex relationships, or when qubit noise overwhelms signal processing in simulated quantum hardware.

Three first experiments:
1. Test H-FQNN on a separate ADS-B dataset with different attack scenarios to validate generalizability
2. Vary quantum circuit depth and gate configurations to optimize feature extraction capabilities
3. Implement noise models to simulate real quantum hardware effects on detection performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results based on simulated ADS-B data rather than real-world operational data
- Quantum circuit implementation relies on classical simulation rather than true quantum hardware
- Benchmark comparison limited to single classical baseline without exploring other anomaly detection methods

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Performance comparison claims | Medium - competitive results but lack real quantum hardware validation |
| Feasibility demonstration | Medium - proof-of-concept established but not tested in operational environments |
| Six-qubit optimization finding | Low - limited hyperparameter exploration, single dataset used |

## Next Checks
1. Test the H-FQNN model on multiple real-world ADS-B datasets from different aviation authorities to assess generalizability
2. Implement and evaluate the model on actual quantum hardware (e.g., IBM Quantum systems) to measure quantum advantage and noise effects
3. Conduct comparative benchmarking against other established anomaly detection methods (isolation forests, autoencoders, attention-based models) on identical datasets
