## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Unified framework that improves AI search accuracy by 22% and reduces critical failures by 16.7% through tool-augmented retrieval and agent distillation

## Executive Summary
TURA introduces an agentic framework that bridges static RAG and dynamic data sources for AI search. It features intent-aware retrieval to decompose queries and select tools, DAG-based planning for parallel execution, and a distilled executor for low-latency performance. In large-scale production deployment, TURA improved session success rate by 8.9% and reduced critical failures by 16.7% versus a strong LLM+RAG baseline. Answer accuracy reached 87.5% (vs. 65.3%) and faithfulness 96.2% (vs. 72.4%). Agent distillation achieved 88.3% accuracy at 750ms latency, outperforming the 82.4% teacher model. TURA demonstrates a production-proven blueprint for robust, real-time AI search integrating heterogeneous information sources.

## Method Summary
TURA is an agentic framework that bridges static retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with dynamic data sources for AI search. The system employs intent-aware retrieval to decompose user queries and select appropriate tools, DAG-based planning for parallel execution of multiple retrieval tasks, and a distilled executor for low-latency responses. The framework integrates heterogeneous information sources through a unified interface, enabling real-time AI search that outperforms traditional LLM+RAG approaches. The agent distillation component compresses the full reasoning pipeline into a faster model while maintaining high accuracy.

## Key Results
- Session success rate improved by 8.9% in large-scale production deployment
- Critical failures reduced by 16.7% versus strong LLM+RAG baseline
- Answer accuracy reached 87.5% (vs. 65.3%) and faithfulness 96.2% (vs. 72.4%)
- Agent distillation achieved 88.3% accuracy at 750ms latency, outperforming 82.4% teacher model

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TURA's effectiveness stems from its unified approach to handling both static and dynamic information sources. The intent-aware retrieval decomposes complex queries into manageable components, enabling precise tool selection for each sub-task. DAG-based planning allows parallel execution of multiple retrieval operations, reducing overall latency while maintaining accuracy. The distilled executor provides a lightweight yet effective alternative to the full reasoning pipeline, enabling real-time responses without significant accuracy loss. By integrating heterogeneous data sources through a unified interface, TURA overcomes the limitations of traditional RAG systems that struggle with dynamic or specialized data.

## Foundational Learning
- **Intent-aware retrieval**: Why needed - decomposes complex queries into specific sub-tasks; Quick check - verify query decomposition accuracy on multi-intent test cases
- **DAG-based planning**: Why needed - enables parallel execution of multiple retrieval tasks; Quick check - measure speedup from parallel vs sequential execution
- **Agent distillation**: Why needed - compresses reasoning pipeline for low-latency deployment; Quick check - compare accuracy-latency tradeoffs across different distillation targets
- **Tool selection mechanisms**: Why needed - matches query components to appropriate data sources; Quick check - evaluate tool selection accuracy on diverse query types
- **Unified interface design**: Why needed - integrates heterogeneous data sources seamlessly; Quick check - test compatibility with new data source types
- **Real-time execution pipeline**: Why needed - ensures production viability with low latency requirements; Quick check - benchmark end-to-end latency across query complexities

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
User Query -> Intent Analyzer -> DAG Planner -> Tool Selector -> Multiple Retrievers -> Answer Generator -> Distilled Executor

### Critical Path
User Query → Intent Analyzer → DAG Planner → Parallel Retrieval Execution → Answer Generation → Distilled Executor

### Design Tradeoffs
- **Accuracy vs. Latency**: Full agent provides 87.5% accuracy but higher latency; distilled executor offers 88.3% at 750ms, trading some reasoning depth for speed
- **Complexity vs. Maintainability**: DAG-based planning adds architectural complexity but enables parallel execution and better failure isolation
- **Static vs. Dynamic Integration**: Unified interface simplifies heterogeneous data source integration but requires careful abstraction layer design

### Failure Signatures
- **Tool selection failures**: Incorrect query decomposition leading to wrong data source selection
- **DAG planning failures**: Suboptimal parallel execution causing resource contention or increased latency
- **Distillation fidelity issues**: Distilled model missing edge cases handled by full reasoning pipeline
- **Integration failures**: Data source incompatibility or latency spikes from heterogeneous sources

### First Experiments to Run
1. **Tool selection accuracy test**: Evaluate intent analyzer's ability to correctly decompose and route 100 diverse queries to appropriate tools
2. **DAG execution timing**: Measure parallel execution speedup versus sequential baseline across varying query complexities
3. **Distillation ablation study**: Compare distilled executor performance against full pipeline across latency targets (500ms, 750ms, 1000ms)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation conducted in proprietary production environment, limiting independent verification
- Agent distillation methodology details are sparse, unclear if true knowledge distillation or parameter-efficient fine-tuning
- Production deployment results may be influenced by proprietary query distributions and user populations

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Architectural framework is technically sound | High |
| Quantitative improvements are accurate | Medium |
| Real-time performance improvements are valid | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. **Independent Reproduction**: Implement TURA's framework using open-source components and evaluate on publicly available search query datasets (e.g., TREC datasets) to verify claimed accuracy improvements of ~22% over baselines.

2. **Robustness Testing**: Conduct adversarial testing with ambiguous, multi-intent queries to evaluate whether the DAG-based planning and tool selection mechanisms maintain performance across diverse query types beyond the reported production deployment.

3. **Latency-Accuracy Tradeoff Analysis**: Systematically evaluate the distilled agent across different latency targets (500ms, 1000ms, 1500ms) to determine if the 88.3% accuracy at 750ms represents an optimal point or if better tradeoffs exist for different deployment scenarios.
