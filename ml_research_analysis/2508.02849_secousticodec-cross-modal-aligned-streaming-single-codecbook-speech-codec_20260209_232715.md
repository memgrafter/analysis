core_contribution: SecoustiCodec addresses the challenge of achieving high-quality,
  low-bitrate speech coding while supporting streaming and maintaining semantic disentanglement
  from paralinguistic information. It introduces a novel architecture that separately
  models acoustic, semantic, and paralinguistic information in a single-codebook space,
  using a VAE+FSQ-based semantic quantization method and contrastive learning for
  cross-modal alignment.

## Executive Summary
SecoustiCodec introduces a novel approach to speech coding that achieves high-quality reconstruction at extremely low bitrates (0.27-1 kbps) while supporting streaming applications. The system employs a single-codebook architecture that separately models acoustic, semantic, and paralinguistic information, using a VAE+FSQ-based semantic quantization method and contrastive learning for cross-modal alignment. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing single-codebook codecs, particularly excelling in low-bitrate scenarios where traditional methods struggle.

## Method Summary
SecoustiCodec employs a unified single-codebook architecture that disentangles speech into acoustic, semantic, and paralinguistic components through separate modeling paths. The semantic information is quantized using a VAE+FSQ (Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder with Frequency Sensitive Quantization) approach, while contrastive learning ensures cross-modal alignment between different information streams. An acoustic-constrained multi-stage optimization strategy is used to ensure robust convergence during training. The streaming capability is maintained through careful architectural design that allows for sequential processing without requiring full context.

## Key Results
- Achieves PESQ score of 1.77 at 0.27 kbps, outperforming existing single-codebook codecs
- Reaches PESQ score of 2.58 at 1 kbps, demonstrating high-quality reconstruction at low bitrates
- Maintains streaming capability with minimal latency while preserving speech quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The architecture works by leveraging the complementary strengths of different information representations in speech. By separating semantic content (what is being said) from paralinguistic features (how it's being said) and acoustic details, the system can allocate bits more efficiently. The VAE+FSQ quantization provides a compact yet expressive representation of semantic content, while contrastive learning ensures that different modalities remain properly aligned. The multi-stage optimization prevents catastrophic forgetting and ensures that each component is properly learned before integration.

## Foundational Learning
- **VAE+FSQ Quantization**: Needed to create compact, expressive representations of semantic content that preserve meaning while minimizing bitrate. Quick check: Verify that quantized representations maintain semantic similarity through reconstruction quality.
- **Contrastive Learning**: Required to ensure cross-modal alignment between acoustic, semantic, and paralinguistic streams. Quick check: Measure alignment quality through downstream task performance or similarity metrics.
- **Single-Codebook Architecture**: Chosen to simplify the coding process while maintaining the benefits of information separation. Quick check: Compare bitrate efficiency against multi-codebook alternatives.
- **Multi-Stage Optimization**: Essential for preventing training collapse when dealing with multiple complex objectives. Quick check: Monitor training stability and convergence speed across different optimization schedules.
- **Streaming Architecture Design**: Critical for real-time applications where latency matters. Quick check: Measure end-to-end latency and compare against streaming requirements.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Input Waveform -> Acoustic Encoder -> Acoustic Features
Input Waveform -> Semantic Encoder -> VAE+FSQ Quantizer -> Semantic Codebook
Input Waveform -> Paralinguistic Encoder -> Paralinguistic Features
Contrastive Learning Module (Aligns all streams)
Decoder (Reconstructs waveform from combined features)

Critical Path:
The critical path for quality involves the acoustic encoder, semantic quantization, and decoder. The semantic path is particularly crucial as it carries the majority of the information content at low bitrates.

Design Tradeoffs:
- Single-codebook vs multi-codebook: Single-codebook simplifies implementation and reduces synchronization complexity but requires more sophisticated information separation
- Streaming vs non-streaming: Streaming capability adds latency constraints but enables real-time applications
- Bitrate vs quality: Lower bitrates improve efficiency but require more aggressive compression

Failure Signatures:
- Quality degradation at very low bitrates indicates semantic quantization failure
- Misalignment between streams suggests contrastive learning issues
- High latency indicates streaming architecture problems
- Unstable training suggests multi-stage optimization needs adjustment

First Experiments:
1. Measure reconstruction quality with semantic path disabled to quantify its contribution
2. Test contrastive learning effectiveness by measuring cross-modal similarity with and without the module
3. Evaluate streaming performance by measuring quality degradation with different chunk sizes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Missing details on test conditions and PESQ implementation prevent proper benchmarking
- No subjective listening tests to validate perceived quality improvements
- Limited evaluation of actual semantic-paralinguistic separation capability

## Confidence
- High confidence: Architectural innovations are well-described and technically sound
- Medium confidence: Quantitative results appear robust but lack complete experimental details
- Low confidence: Claims about semantic-paralinguistic disentanglement effectiveness without supporting evaluations

## Next Checks
1. Conduct MUSHRA or ITU-T P.800 subjective listening tests comparing SecoustiCodec against baseline codecs at multiple bitrates
2. Implement cross-validation using standardized speech datasets with publicly available PESQ implementations to verify reported scores
3. Design objective metrics or experiments to quantify the degree of semantic-paralinguistic disentanglement achieved
