# Probing Syntax in Large Language Models: Successes and Remaining Challenges

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.03211
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03211
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Structural probe accuracy declines sharply with increasing linear distance and syntactic depth between words, while surprisal has minimal impact.

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates how well structural probes extract syntactic dependencies from large language model (LLM) representations, focusing on whether their performance is affected by structural properties (linear distance, depth) or statistical factors (word predictability). Using controlled sentence stimuli and naturalistic data, it finds that probe accuracy strongly declines with increasing linear distance and syntactic depth between words, while surprisal—the predictability of a word given its context—has little impact. In simple prepositional-phrase constructions, probes often incorrectly bind both the subject and a nearby attractor noun to the verb, mirroring attraction effects seen in human parsing. Despite these challenges, structural probes still outperform baselines based on raw activations or simple distance heuristics, indicating they do capture syntactic structure. The findings highlight current limitations—such as bias toward short dependencies and interference from nearby nouns—and provide a benchmark of controlled stimuli to better evaluate future structural probe designs.

## Method Summary
The study employs controlled sentence stimuli and naturalistic data to evaluate structural probe performance in LLMs. Probes are trained to predict syntactic dependency arcs from model representations. Performance is systematically compared against baseline models using raw activations and distance heuristics. Key factors tested include linear distance between words, syntactic depth, and surprisal (word predictability). The experimental design isolates structural versus statistical influences on probe accuracy.

## Key Results
- Probe accuracy strongly declines with increasing linear distance and syntactic depth between words
- Surprisal (word predictability) has little impact on probe accuracy
- Probes exhibit attraction effects, incorrectly linking nearby nouns to verbs in prepositional-phrase constructions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study leverages controlled stimuli and naturalistic data to isolate structural factors affecting probe performance. By systematically varying linear distance, syntactic depth, and surprisal, it identifies which aspects of LLM representations capture syntax and which do not. The comparison with baselines reveals that probes do encode syntactic structure beyond simple heuristics.

## Foundational Learning
- **Structural probes:** Tools that predict syntactic dependencies from neural representations; needed to evaluate how well models capture syntax, quick check: probe predicts dependency arcs from activations
- **Linear distance:** Word separation in sentence order; needed to assess syntactic complexity, quick check: count intervening words between dependency pair
- **Syntactic depth:** Nesting level in parse tree; needed to measure structural complexity, quick check: count parent nodes between word and root
- **Surprisal:** Negative log probability of word given context; needed to test predictability effects, quick check: compute -log P(word|context)
- **Attraction effects:** Interference from nearby nouns during dependency resolution; needed to explain probe errors, quick check: count nearby nouns in subject-verb constructions
- **Baselines:** Simple heuristics (distance, raw activations); needed for performance comparison, quick check: compare probe accuracy to distance heuristic

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map:** Sentence stimuli → LLM representations → Structural probe → Dependency predictions → Accuracy evaluation
- **Critical path:** Probe training → Baseline comparison → Factor analysis (distance, depth, surprisal)
- **Design tradeoffs:** Probe complexity vs. interpretability; controlled stimuli vs. naturalistic generalization
- **Failure signatures:** High error rates at long distances and deep depths; attraction to nearby nouns
- **First experiments:** (1) Test probe accuracy across linear distance intervals, (2) Compare probe performance at different syntactic depths, (3) Evaluate surprisal impact by controlling word predictability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results may not generalize to languages beyond English
- Attraction effects may reflect probe limitations rather than true syntactic understanding
- Unclear how model architecture and training data influence probe performance

## Confidence
- Probe bias toward short dependencies: Medium
- Impact of syntactic depth on accuracy: Medium
- Generalizability to other languages: Low

## Next Checks
- Test probes across diverse languages and syntactic constructions to assess cross-linguistic generalizability
- Compare probe behavior with human parsing data in controlled experiments to better understand attraction effects
- Analyze probe performance across different LLM architectures and training regimes to identify structural influences
