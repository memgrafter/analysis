# Reinforcement Learning for Monetary Policy Under Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Analyzing Tabular and Function Approximation Methods

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.17929
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17929
- **Reference count:** 14
- **Primary result:** Tabular Q-learning outperformed sophisticated RL methods for dynamic interest rate setting under macroeconomic uncertainty

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates nine reinforcement learning approaches for dynamic interest rate setting under macroeconomic uncertainty using historical Federal Reserve Economic Data from 1955-2025. The authors construct a linear-Gaussian transition model and compare methods ranging from tabular Q-learning to deep RL and Bayesian approaches. Contrary to expectations, standard tabular Q-learning achieved the best performance (-615.13 ± 309.58 mean return), significantly outperforming enhanced RL techniques and traditional Taylor Rule baselines. The analysis reveals that simpler approaches may be more robust in this domain, with algorithmic sophistication not guaranteeing improved performance.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates nine reinforcement learning methods including tabular Q-learning, double Q-learning, SARSA, policy gradient methods, actor-critic approaches, and deep RL techniques for monetary policy applications. The authors use historical Federal Reserve Economic Data from 1955-2025 to construct a linear-Gaussian transition model representing macroeconomic dynamics. Each algorithm is trained and evaluated on the same dataset with performance measured by cumulative returns. The study compares these RL approaches against traditional Taylor Rule baselines to assess relative performance in dynamic interest rate setting under uncertainty.

## Key Results
- Standard tabular Q-learning achieved the best performance (-615.13 ± 309.58 mean return)
- Enhanced RL techniques and deep learning methods underperformed compared to simple tabular approaches
- Algorithmic sophistication did not guarantee improved performance in this monetary policy domain
- RL approaches show promise but current methods may serve better as decision support tools than direct policy replacements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The superior performance of tabular Q-learning likely stems from its simplicity and robustness in the specific linear-Gaussian environment constructed for this study. The tabular approach may be less prone to overfitting and hyperparameter sensitivity compared to more complex function approximation methods. The linear transition model may not require the expressive power of deep neural networks, making simpler methods more efficient. Additionally, the historical dataset may not contain sufficient complexity to justify sophisticated function approximation techniques.

## Foundational Learning
- **Reinforcement Learning Basics**: Understanding of value-based vs policy-based methods and their tradeoffs in continuous action spaces
  - Why needed: Essential for comparing tabular vs function approximation approaches
  - Quick check: Can identify when tabular methods are sufficient vs when function approximation is necessary

- **Linear-Gaussian Models**: Familiarity with linear transition dynamics and Gaussian noise assumptions in economic modeling
  - Why needed: Core assumption underlying the experimental setup and its limitations
  - Quick check: Can explain when linear-Gaussian assumptions break down in real economic data

- **Monetary Policy Framework**: Understanding of Taylor Rule, interest rate transmission mechanisms, and macroeconomic objectives
  - Why needed: Context for evaluating RL methods in policy applications
  - Quick check: Can articulate the goals and constraints of central bank decision-making

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Historical Data → Transition Model → RL Environment → RL Agent → Policy Output → Performance Evaluation

**Critical Path:** Data preprocessing → Model specification → Agent training → Policy generation → Performance assessment

**Design Tradeoffs:** Simplicity vs expressiveness (tabular vs deep RL), model fidelity vs computational tractability, historical fit vs forward-looking robustness

**Failure Signatures:** Overfitting to linear-Gaussian assumptions, hyperparameter sensitivity in complex methods, poor generalization to regime changes

**First Experiments:**
1. Replicate tabular Q-learning baseline on the provided dataset
2. Compare performance across different state space discretizations
3. Test sensitivity to learning rate and exploration parameters

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Simplified linear-Gaussian transition model may not capture complex macroeconomic dynamics and regime changes
- Historical dataset represents single economic trajectory, limiting generalizability to alternative scenarios
- Small number of hyperparameters tuned, lacking extensive optimization across all methods

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Tabular Q-learning outperforming other RL methods in this specific setup
- **Medium confidence:** RL approaches show promise for monetary policy applications
- **Medium confidence:** Current methods better suited for decision support than direct policy replacement
- **Low confidence:** Generalization to real-world policy implementation

## Next Checks
1. Test the same RL methods under alternative transition models (e.g., regime-switching, non-linear dynamics) to assess robustness
2. Implement extensive hyperparameter optimization across all methods to determine if performance gaps persist
3. Conduct out-of-sample validation using synthetic macroeconomic scenarios and stress testing to evaluate decision quality under uncertainty
