# TenAd: A Tensor-based Low-rank Black Box Adversarial Attack for Video Classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.01228
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01228
- Reference count: 37
- This paper introduces TenAd, a tensor-based low-rank black-box adversarial attack method for video classification that addresses the inefficiency of existing approaches

## Executive Summary
This paper presents TenAd, a novel black-box adversarial attack method specifically designed for video classification tasks. The approach leverages tensor decomposition techniques to exploit the inherent low-rank structure of video data, enabling more efficient generation of adversarial examples with fewer queries to the target model. By representing videos as fourth-order tensors and focusing perturbations on dominant low-rank components, TenAd achieves significant improvements in query efficiency while maintaining high attack success rates and producing visually imperceptible adversarial examples.

## Method Summary
TenAd operates by first representing input videos as fourth-order tensors, capturing spatial, temporal, and channel dimensions. The method then applies tensor decomposition techniques, specifically CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition, to extract the dominant low-rank components that capture the most significant video features. Adversarial perturbations are generated by focusing modifications on these low-rank components rather than the full tensor space, dramatically reducing the search space. The attack employs a black-box optimization strategy where it iteratively queries the target model with modified videos and updates perturbations based on the observed model responses. This low-rank perturbation approach maintains the visual quality of the adversarial examples while achieving higher attack success rates with substantially fewer queries compared to existing methods.

## Key Results
- TenAd achieves up to 99% reduction in query numbers compared to state-of-the-art black-box attack methods
- The method maintains high attack success rates while producing adversarial examples with superior visual similarity (higher SSIM and PSNR values)
- Experimental validation on UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets demonstrates TenAd's effectiveness across different video classification models and attack scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TenAd exploits the natural low-rank structure inherent in video data, where most information can be captured by a small number of dominant components. By decomposing video tensors and focusing adversarial perturbations on these components, the method efficiently navigates the perturbation space while maintaining visual fidelity. The black-box optimization strategy enables effective attack generation without requiring gradient information from the target model.

## Foundational Learning
- **Tensor decomposition (CP decomposition)**: Needed to extract low-rank components from video tensors; quick check: verify decomposition preserves key video features
- **Black-box optimization**: Required for attacking models without gradient access; quick check: ensure convergence with limited queries
- **Adversarial perturbation theory**: Fundamental to understanding attack effectiveness; quick check: validate perturbation bounds maintain imperceptibility
- **Video representation learning**: Essential for understanding spatial-temporal feature extraction; quick check: confirm fourth-order tensor representation captures video dynamics
- **Query efficiency metrics**: Critical for evaluating attack performance; quick check: compare query counts across different attack strategies
- **Visual similarity metrics (SSIM, PSNR)**: Used to assess adversarial example quality; quick check: validate metrics correlate with human perception

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Video input -> Tensor representation -> CP decomposition -> Low-rank component extraction -> Perturbation generation -> Model querying -> Response analysis -> Perturbation update

**Critical Path**: The core workflow follows: tensor decomposition → low-rank perturbation generation → black-box optimization loop → adversarial example creation

**Design Tradeoffs**: Prioritizes query efficiency over computational overhead of tensor decomposition; balances attack success rate with visual similarity; trades off complete perturbation coverage for focused low-rank modifications

**Failure Signatures**: Attack failures occur when: (1) video lacks exploitable low-rank structure, (2) black-box optimization converges prematurely, (3) perturbation magnitudes exceed imperceptibility thresholds, or (4) target model exhibits strong adversarial defenses

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Validate low-rank structure assumption on diverse video datasets beyond UCF-101 and HMDB-51
2. Benchmark query efficiency against baseline methods using identical attack success rate targets
3. Conduct ablation study isolating contributions of tensor decomposition components versus optimization strategy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The low-rank structure assumption may not hold for all video types, particularly those with complex motion patterns or non-standard temporal dynamics
- Computational overhead from tensor decomposition and reconstruction may offset query efficiency gains in resource-constrained scenarios
- The method's effectiveness across different video classification architectures and tasks beyond action recognition remains untested

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The mathematical framework for tensor decomposition and low-rank approximation is sound and well-established. The query efficiency improvements over baseline methods are statistically significant and reproducible based on the provided experimental setup.

**Medium Confidence**: The visual similarity metrics (SSIM, PSNR) and attack success rates are reliable within the tested datasets, but the perceptual quality assessments may not fully capture human perception of adversarial perturbations in motion.

**Low Confidence**: The claim of "superior visual similarity" is somewhat subjective and depends heavily on the specific metrics chosen. The long-term transferability of TenAd attacks across different model architectures and video classification tasks has not been thoroughly evaluated.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive cross-dataset validation to assess whether the low-rank structure assumption holds for videos outside the action recognition domain, such as surveillance footage or medical imaging sequences
2. Perform ablation studies isolating the contribution of each tensor decomposition component to the attack success rate, distinguishing between genuine efficiency gains and potential overfitting to the specific datasets used
3. Evaluate the computational overhead of TenAd compared to baseline methods in terms of wall-clock time and memory usage, particularly for high-resolution videos or real-time attack scenarios
