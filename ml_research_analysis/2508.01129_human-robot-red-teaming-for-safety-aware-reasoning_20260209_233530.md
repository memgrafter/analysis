# Human-Robot Red Teaming for Safety-Aware Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.01129
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01129
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Human-robot red teaming achieves 0.875 success rate in symbolic planning and 0.83 safety success rate in robot execution across 8 domains

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of enabling robots to reason over safety in safety-critical domains where robots operate alongside humans. The authors propose a human-robot red teaming paradigm for safety-aware reasoning, where humans and robots work together to challenge assumptions about an environment and explore potential hazards. The approach involves iteratively analyzing a shared model of the environment through three levels: generating possibilities, identifying assumptions, and reflecting on limitations through dialogue. The method was tested across 8 problem domains using symbolic planning and robot execution experiments.

## Method Summary
The human-robot red teaming approach employs an iterative process of shared environmental modeling through three analytical levels. First, the system generates possibilities by exploring potential scenarios and actions. Second, it identifies assumptions underlying the environmental model through collaborative dialogue between human and robot. Third, it reflects on limitations by examining what the model cannot capture or predict. This framework was implemented in both symbolic planning tasks and physical robot execution experiments with NASA's iMETRO and Valkyrie robots in lunar habitat and household environments.

## Key Results
- Human-robot red teaming achieved a success rate of 0.875 across 400 planning tasks in 8 different domains
- Robot execution experiments showed a safety success rate of 0.83 across 12 trials
- The approach demonstrated effectiveness across two different robot embodiments (iMETRO and Valkyrie) in both lunar habitat and household environments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by creating a collaborative reasoning framework where humans and robots iteratively challenge and refine their shared understanding of safety-critical environments. By systematically generating possibilities, identifying assumptions, and reflecting on limitations through dialogue, the system can surface potential hazards that might be overlooked by either human or robot working alone. The iterative nature allows for continuous improvement of the environmental model and safety reasoning capabilities.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Safety-aware reasoning** - needed because robots must understand safety beyond simple rule-following in dynamic environments; quick check: can the system identify novel safety scenarios not in its training data?
2. **Collaborative assumption identification** - required to surface implicit assumptions that could lead to unsafe behavior; quick check: does the dialogue process reveal assumptions humans didn't explicitly state?
3. **Iterative environmental modeling** - essential for adapting to changing conditions in safety-critical domains; quick check: how quickly can the system update its model when environmental conditions change?
4. **Embodiment-aware planning** - necessary because different robot bodies have different capabilities and limitations; quick check: does the planning account for specific physical constraints of each robot type?
5. **Dialogue-based limitation reflection** - important for identifying gaps in reasoning that might lead to unsafe decisions; quick check: can the system articulate why certain scenarios are considered unsafe?
6. **Multi-level analysis framework** - provides structured approach to safety reasoning across different abstraction levels; quick check: does the framework scale to more complex scenarios with additional levels?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Human -> Dialogue Interface -> Assumption Identifier -> Model Refiner -> Robot Controller -> Robot
                    -> Possibility Generator -> Model Refiner -> Robot Controller -> Robot

Critical Path: Human dialogue → Assumption identification → Model refinement → Robot execution

Design Tradeoffs:
- Dialogue vs. automated assumption identification (human oversight vs. scalability)
- Iterative refinement vs. real-time response requirements
- Domain-specific vs. generalizable safety models
- Model complexity vs. computational efficiency

Failure Signatures:
- Assumption identification failures lead to overlooked hazards
- Dialogue breakdowns cause communication gaps
- Model refinement errors propagate to unsafe actions
- Embodiment mismatch causes execution failures

3 First Experiments:
1. Test assumption identification with simple environmental scenarios
2. Validate model refinement with controlled perturbations
3. Evaluate dialogue effectiveness with varying communication quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Results were achieved in relatively controlled experimental settings across only 8 problem domains and 12 robot execution trials
- Methodology for determining and validating what constitutes safe behavior across different domains is not fully detailed
- Reliance on dialogue for assumption identification may face practical challenges in noisy or communication-limited real-world environments

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| 0.875 success rate in symbolic planning | Medium |
| 0.83 safety success rate in robot execution | Medium |
| Approach works across different robot embodiments | Medium |
| Dialogue-based assumption identification is effective | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Expand testing to a wider range of real-world safety-critical domains with varying levels of complexity and uncertainty
2. Conduct longitudinal studies to assess the approach's effectiveness over extended periods and with multiple human operators
3. Implement the dialogue-based assumption identification in noisy or communication-limited environments to evaluate robustness under practical constraints
