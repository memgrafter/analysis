# Opening the Black-Box: Symbolic Regression with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Energy Applications

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2504.03913
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03913
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** KANs achieve comparable or superior accuracy to FNNs (R² 0.976-0.999) while providing interpretable symbolic equations

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) against traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs) across eight diverse nuclear engineering datasets. KANs, which transform into interpretable symbolic equations after training, demonstrate comparable or superior accuracy to FNNs, with R² scores typically ranging from 0.976 to 0.999. Unlike FNNs, KANs produce interpretable symbolic equations, enhancing transparency. SHAP analysis reveals KANs better capture known physical relationships, while FNNs offer only statistical accuracy. KANs also exhibit feature elimination capabilities, simplifying problem spaces. The study highlights KANs as a promising alternative for sensitive industries requiring both accuracy and interpretability, though some limitations exist for high-dimensional output problems.

## Method Summary
The study compares KANs and FNNs on 8 nuclear engineering datasets using pykan-0.2.8 for KAN implementation and FNN hyperparameters from Myers et al. [69]. Training used two-stage L-BFGS optimization with hyperopt (200 TPE evaluations) for hyperparameter tuning. KANs employed learnable B-spline activation functions that were post-hoc converted to symbolic equations. Metrics included R², MAE, MAPE, MSE, RMSE, RMSPE, plus Kernel SHAP for explainability. Data preprocessing involved 70/30 train-test splits, min-max scaling, and tensor conversion. The study specifically evaluated accuracy, interpretability (symbolic equation extraction), and explainability.

## Key Results
- KANs achieved R² scores ranging from 0.976 to 0.999 across 8 datasets, comparable to or exceeding FNN performance
- KANs generated interpretable symbolic equations while FNNs remained black-box models
- SHAP analysis showed KANs better captured known physical relationships versus FNN statistical correlations
- KANs demonstrated feature elimination capabilities, simplifying problem spaces by identifying and excluding less important variables
- KANs underperformed on high-output dimensionality problems (6→22), suggesting architectural limitations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Symbolic Regression via B-spline to Symbolic Conversion
KANs provide interpretable symbolic equations that maintain comparable accuracy to FNNs by using learnable B-spline activation functions on network edges, which can be post-hoc converted into symbolic expressions (e.g., sin, tanh, exp) via fitting to a library of mathematical primitives. This converts the learned univariate functions into explicit algebraic formulas.

### Mechanism 2: Feature Elimination via Learned Activation Sparsity
KANs can automatically identify and exclude less important input features during symbolic conversion through regularization and pruning steps. The learned B-spline activation functions for unimportant features converge to constants (often zero), which disappear from the final symbolic equation.

### Mechanism 3: Learning Physical Relationships via KART
KANs learn real, physical relationships from experimental data better than FNNs by implementing the Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem. This structural bias encourages the model to find a disentangled, compositional representation of the data more likely to align with underlying physical laws than the entangled structure of FNNs.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: B-splines as Learnable Activation Functions**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the fundamental building block of a KAN. Unlike FNNs with fixed activations, KANs learn the shape of the activation function itself using B-splines.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why a B-spline, defined by control points and a knot vector, is a more flexible and learnable function than a `ReLU(x)` activation?

- **Concept: The Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem (KART)**
  - **Why needed here:** This is the theoretical justification for the KAN architecture, providing the guarantee that a network of univariate functions can represent any continuous multivariate function.
  - **Quick check question:** According to KART, can any continuous function of multiple variables be written using only univariate functions and addition? What is the key structural implication for a neural network?

- **Concept: Symbolic Regression**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper frames KANs as a tool for symbolic regression—the discovery of a mathematical formula that fits data. Understanding the goal (finding an equation) vs. standard regression (finding a prediction) is key to the paper's value proposition.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the goal of symbolic regression differ from standard regression with a neural network? What does a successful KAN output look like in this context?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data -> Edge (Spline) -> Node (Sum) -> Next Layer Edge (Spline) ... -> Output. After training: prune_model() -> auto_symbolic() converts splines to formulas.
- **Critical path:** Data flows through edge functions (splines) to nodes (sums), repeating across layers, then converts to symbolic form post-training.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Interpretability vs. Accuracy: Setting simplicity_weight=0 maximizes accuracy but may produce complex equations
  - Interpretability vs. Equation Length: Deeper KANs model more complex functions but produce longer, less readable equations
  - Performance vs. Output Dimensionality: KANs underperformed on 22-output problems; consider problem decomposition
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Equation Complexity Explosion: Equations are hundreds of characters long and unreadable (too complex or weak regularization)
  - Feature Over-Elimination: Known important physical features missing from equation with poor accuracy (over-regularization)
  - Poor Performance on High-Output Problems: Model fails to learn all outputs simultaneously (high output dimensionality strain)
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Replicate the "toy problem" (HEAT dataset): Train a KAN and compare R² score and generated equation to paper's results
  2. Experiment with Symbolic Simplicity: Change simplicity_weight parameter and observe trade-off between equation length and R² score
  3. Test Feature Elimination: Introduce a redundant feature to a dataset and verify if KAN correctly excludes it from the symbolic equation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What are the specific input-to-output dimensionality limits at which KANs begin to underperform compared to FNNs? The authors successfully mitigated underperformance on high-output problems by spatially splitting datasets but didn't systematically test architectural limits to establish general rules for high-dimensional outputs.

### Open Question 2
How do KANs compare to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in terms of accuracy and physical consistency? The study only benchmarked KANs against standard FNNs, leaving the performance gap between KANs and models with hard-coded physical constraints unexplored.

### Open Question 3
Does the computational efficiency and symbolic conversion capability of KANs scale effectively to datasets significantly larger than those tested? The authors observed no major computational issues but acknowledged the datasets were "sufficiently small," potentially masking scalability problems with B-spline fitting.

### Open Question 4
Can the complex symbolic equations generated by KANs be simplified to improve human readability without sacrificing significant accuracy? The generated equations are highly complex and lengthy to maintain high R² scores, potentially limiting their utility for human operators in safety-critical scenarios.

## Limitations
- Claims about KANs discovering "real physical relationships" versus FNNs learning "statistical artifacts" require more direct physical validation beyond SHAP analysis
- KANs underperformed on high-output dimensionality problems (6→22), suggesting architectural limitations that weren't fully explored
- The symbolic conversion process quality depends heavily on chosen function library and simplicity weight parameters, but the paper only reports results with simplicity_weight=0

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** KANs achieve comparable accuracy to FNNs (R² typically 0.976-0.999) across diverse datasets. The mathematical mechanism (KART + B-spline edges → symbolic conversion) is sound.
- **Medium Confidence:** KANs better capture known physical relationships as evidenced by SHAP analysis and feature elimination capabilities. The symbolic equations are interpretable, though equation complexity wasn't systematically quantified.
- **Low Confidence:** Claims about KANs discovering "real" physical relationships versus FNNs learning "statistical artifacts" require more direct physical validation beyond SHAP analysis.

## Next Checks

1. **Physical Validation:** For datasets with known physics (HEAT, CHF), verify whether KAN-extracted equations match or approximate analytical solutions, and whether FNN predictions deviate from these physical constraints.

2. **Equation Complexity Analysis:** Systematically measure symbolic equation length and complexity (e.g., character count, operator count) across datasets and KAN architectures to quantify the interpretability-accuracy tradeoff.

3. **Feature Elimination Validation:** For datasets where feature elimination is claimed (HEAT, Microreactor), artificially reintroduce eliminated features with known physical relevance and measure impact on accuracy to test if elimination was appropriate.
