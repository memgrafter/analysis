# Score-based Idempotent Distillation of Diffusion Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.21470
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21470
- Authors: Shehtab Zaman; Chengyan Liu; Kenneth Chiu
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: SIGNs achieve state-of-the-art FID scores of 11.09 on CIFAR-10 and 23.32 on CelebA, outperforming prior idempotent models by 41% on CelebA

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Score-based Idempotent Generative Networks (SIGNs), a novel approach for distilling diffusion models that eliminates adversarial losses in favor of stable distribution matching and flow-based objectives. The method learns score functions that map noisy samples back to the data manifold, providing a more stable training alternative to existing idempotent models. SIGNs demonstrate significant improvements in FID scores while enabling zero-shot editing capabilities through single or multi-step sampling.

## Method Summary
SIGNs distill pre-trained diffusion models by learning score functions that map noisy samples back to the data manifold. The key innovation is replacing unstable tightening losses with distribution matching and flow-based losses, enabling stable training without adversarial components. The model is trained to minimize these alternative losses, theoretically ensuring the learned distribution matches the true data distribution. During inference, SIGNs can project corrupted images back to the data manifold in single or multi-step sampling, demonstrating zero-shot editing capabilities.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art FID scores of 11.09 on CIFAR-10
- Achieves state-of-the-art FID scores of 23.32 on CelebA
- Outperforms prior idempotent models by 41% on CelebA

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SIGNs work by distilling pre-trained diffusion models to learn score functions that map noisy samples back to the data manifold. The critical innovation is replacing unstable tightening losses with distribution matching and flow-based losses, which enables stable training without adversarial components. This approach leverages the theoretical property that minimizing these alternative losses ensures the learned distribution matches the true data distribution. The elimination of adversarial losses addresses the primary instability in previous idempotent models while maintaining or improving generation quality.

## Foundational Learning
- **Diffusion Models**: Why needed - Understanding the teacher model being distilled; Quick check - Can explain the relationship between noise schedules and score functions
- **Idempotent Generative Models**: Why needed - Understanding the target model properties being learned; Quick check - Can describe what makes a generative model idempotent
- **Score Matching**: Why needed - Core mechanism for learning score functions; Quick check - Can differentiate between denoising score matching and score-based generation
- **Distribution Matching**: Why needed - Alternative to adversarial losses for stable training; Quick check - Can explain how KL divergence relates to distribution alignment
- **Flow-based Losses**: Why needed - Provides stable gradients for training; Quick check - Can describe how normalizing flows preserve probability distributions

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Pre-trained Diffusion Model -> SIGN Generator -> Distribution Matching Loss + Flow-based Loss -> Trained SIGN

**Critical Path**: The core training loop involves taking noisy samples from the diffusion model, passing them through the SIGN generator, and computing distribution matching and flow-based losses to update the generator weights. This creates a stable feedback loop without adversarial components.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach trades the expressiveness of adversarial training for stability by using distribution matching and flow-based losses. While this improves training stability, it requires a pre-trained teacher model and may have different computational characteristics during inference compared to end-to-end trained models.

**Failure Signatures**: Training instability may manifest as mode collapse or poor sample quality if the distribution matching loss is improperly weighted. The model may also fail to generalize if the teacher diffusion model has insufficient capacity or was poorly trained.

**3 First Experiments**: 1) Train SIGN on CIFAR-10 with varying loss weight combinations to find optimal stability-quality tradeoff; 2) Evaluate zero-shot editing capabilities on corrupted CelebA images with different corruption levels; 3) Compare generation speed and quality against the original diffusion teacher model on both datasets.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Computational cost comparisons lack full quantification, as the complete pipeline includes substantial pre-training resources
- Theoretical guarantees rely on idealized assumptions about perfect score estimation and infinite capacity networks
- Empirical validation is limited to two datasets with relatively small image sizes, with no systematic evaluation of zero-shot editing capabilities

## Confidence
**Major claim clusters confidence:**
- FID score improvements (High): Well-supported by quantitative metrics on standard benchmarks
- Training stability (Medium): Demonstrated empirically but theoretical guarantees have assumptions
- Zero-shot editing capabilities (Low): Qualitative results only, no systematic evaluation

## Next Checks
1. Benchmark runtime per sample generation against both the original diffusion model and other distilled approaches under identical hardware conditions
2. Evaluate scalability by testing on higher-resolution datasets (e.g., LSUN, ImageNet 64x64) and measuring performance degradation
3. Conduct ablation studies removing each loss component to quantify their individual contributions to final performance
