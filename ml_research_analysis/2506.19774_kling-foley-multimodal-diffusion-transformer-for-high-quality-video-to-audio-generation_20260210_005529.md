# Kling-Foley: Multimodal Diffusion Transformer for High-Quality Video-to-Audio Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.19774
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19774
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: State-of-the-art video-to-audio generation with improved semantic and temporal alignment

## Executive Summary
Kling-Foley is a large-scale multimodal Video-to-Audio generation model that synthesizes high-fidelity, temporally synchronized audio aligned with video content. It introduces multimodal diffusion transformers combined with visual semantic representation and audio-visual synchronization modules to improve semantic alignment and temporal coherence. A universal latent audio codec supports high-quality modeling across sound effects, speech, singing, and music, while stereo rendering adds spatial presence. The model is trained with a flow matching objective and includes learnable duration embeddings for flexible, variable-length audio generation. To address benchmark limitations, the authors release Kling-Audio-Eval, an industrial-scale multimodal dataset with 20,935 manually annotated samples across nine sound scenarios.

## Method Summary
Kling-Foley uses a multimodal diffusion transformer (MM-DiT) architecture with T5-Base for text, ViT-bigG-14-QuickGELU/MetaCLIP for visual semantics, and Synchformer for audio-visual sync features. The model employs a Mel-VAE codec with 43Hz latent rate and trains via flow matching with conditional velocity field prediction. Training uses multi-stage stepping optimization with smooth inverse decay learning rate and exponential warmup. The system supports TTA, V2A, and TV2A modes with learnable duration embeddings for variable-length generation.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on FD_PANNs, KL_PANNs, IB-score, DeSync, SDR, and MCD metrics
- Outperforms MMAudio, V ATT, and V-AURA across multiple benchmark datasets
- Demonstrates superior semantic alignment and temporal coherence in generated audio

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The model's effectiveness stems from its multimodal diffusion transformer architecture that jointly processes text, visual, and audio information through learned semantic representations. The audio-visual synchronization module ensures temporal coherence by extracting and aligning features at different temporal resolutions. The universal latent audio codec enables high-quality modeling across diverse audio types while the flow matching objective provides stable training dynamics for generating variable-length audio sequences.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multimodal diffusion transformers**: Why needed - Jointly model text, visual, and audio modalities for coherent generation; Quick check - Verify cross-modal attention flows correctly between all three modalities
- **Flow matching objective**: Why needed - Provides stable training dynamics for stochastic generation; Quick check - Monitor training stability and sample diversity
- **Audio-visual synchronization**: Why needed - Ensures temporal alignment between video frames and audio samples; Quick check - Measure DeSync metric on validation set
- **Latent audio codecs**: Why needed - Enables efficient high-quality audio representation; Quick check - Compare reconstructed audio quality vs. original
- **Learnable duration embeddings**: Why needed - Allows flexible generation of variable-length audio; Quick check - Test generation with different duration parameters
- **Multi-stage optimization**: Why needed - Gradually transitions between reconstruction and generation objectives; Quick check - Monitor KL divergence during training

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: T5-Base -> MM-DiT -> Mel-VAE
**Critical Path**: Text/Visual inputs → Semantic encoders → Multimodal transformer → Audio generation → VAE decoding
**Design Tradeoffs**: Proprietary 100M+ dataset enables strong performance but limits reproducibility; flow matching vs. diffusion provides stable training but requires careful hyperparameter tuning
**Failure Signatures**: High DeSync indicates temporal misalignment; poor IB-score suggests semantic misalignment; KL collapse in VAE indicates posterior collapse
**First Experiments**: 1) Train Mel-VAE codec and verify audio reconstruction quality; 2) Test MM-DiT with synthetic inputs to verify multimodal attention; 3) Generate audio from simple video clips to check temporal alignment

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Proprietary 100M+ training dataset not publicly available, preventing exact replication
- Key architectural parameters including layer counts and hidden dimensions not fully specified
- Training hyperparameters such as batch size and total steps are omitted
- Custom captioning pipeline details not provided, limiting understanding of semantic representation generation

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Overall MM-DiT architecture and evaluation methodology
- **Medium confidence**: VAE codec architecture and flow matching training procedure
- **Medium confidence**: Empirical results showing state-of-the-art performance

## Next Checks
1. Implement the Mel-VAE codec with multi-stage optimization and verify learned prior generates realistic audio latents from Gaussian noise
2. Validate the audio-visual synchronization module by extracting Synchformer features and confirming temporal alignment preservation during upsampling
3. Test the flow matching training dynamics by implementing Algorithm 2 with smooth inverse decay learning rate and monitoring convergence across optimization stages
