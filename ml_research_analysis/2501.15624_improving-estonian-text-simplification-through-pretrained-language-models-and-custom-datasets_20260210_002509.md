# Improving Estonian Text Simplification through Pretrained Language Models and Custom Datasets

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.15624
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15624
- Reference count: 13
- New Estonian Simplification Dataset constructed with 50,416 sentence pairs

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the scarcity of resources for Estonian text simplification by introducing a new dataset and benchmarking two neural approaches: OpenNMT and a fine-tuned LLaMA model. The Estonian Simplification Dataset was constructed by combining translated English corpora, GPT-4.0-generated simplifications, and manual corrections, totaling 50,416 sentence pairs. The LLaMA model was fine-tuned using this dataset with the Unsloth framework to optimize memory usage and training efficiency. Evaluation combined automatic metrics (BLEU, SARI, FKGL) with human ratings across grammaticality, readability, meaning preservation, and simplification effort.

## Method Summary
The authors constructed a new Estonian simplification dataset through multiple stages: translating English simplification corpora to Estonian, generating simplifications using GPT-4.0, and applying manual corrections. Two neural approaches were evaluated: OpenNMT and a fine-tuned LLaMA model. The LLaMA model was fine-tuned using the Unsloth framework to optimize memory usage and training efficiency. The evaluation employed both automatic metrics (BLEU, SARI, FKGL) and human assessments covering grammaticality, readability, meaning preservation, and simplification effort.

## Key Results
- LLaMA 3.1 outperformed OpenNMT in SARI and human evaluations, demonstrating superior simplification quality and semantic retention
- While OpenNMT achieved higher BLEU scores, LLaMA showed better performance in meaning preservation and readability according to human raters
- The fine-tuned LLaMA model proved effective for low-resource languages, highlighting the potential of LLMs when properly adapted to specific linguistic contexts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of fine-tuned LLaMA models for Estonian text simplification stems from leveraging the strong language understanding capabilities of large pretrained models, then adapting them to the specific task of simplification through targeted fine-tuning on domain-relevant data. The combination of automatic generation and human correction in dataset construction helps bridge the gap between general language understanding and the specific requirements of simplification, including maintaining meaning while reducing complexity.

## Foundational Learning
- Text simplification concepts: Understanding the core goals of simplification (reducing complexity while preserving meaning) is essential for evaluating model performance and designing appropriate evaluation metrics
- Low-resource language challenges: Recognizing the unique difficulties in developing NLP systems for languages with limited training data helps contextualize the dataset construction approach and its importance
- Neural machine translation fundamentals: Understanding encoder-decoder architectures and attention mechanisms is crucial for grasping how models like OpenNMT and LLaMA approach the simplification task

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: English corpus -> Translation -> GPT-4.0 simplification -> Manual correction -> Fine-tuning dataset; Pretrained LLaMA -> Fine-tuning with Unsloth -> Simplified Estonian output
- Critical path: Dataset construction (translation + generation + correction) -> Model fine-tuning -> Evaluation (automatic + human)
- Design tradeoffs: GPT-4.0 generation provides scalability but introduces quality variability requiring manual correction; fine-tuning large models requires significant computational resources but yields better performance than training from scratch
- Failure signatures: Over-simplification losing important information; under-simplification failing to reduce complexity; grammatical errors introduced during generation or translation
- First experiments: 1) Evaluate dataset quality through inter-annotator agreement on sample simplifications; 2) Compare model outputs against reference simplifications using multiple metrics; 3) Conduct ablation study on dataset components (e.g., removing GPT-generated samples)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dataset construction relies heavily on GPT-4.0-generated simplifications, introducing potential quality issues that manual corrections may not fully resolve
- Only two neural approaches (OpenNMT and LLaMA) were evaluated, leaving uncertainty about whether other architectures might perform better
- Human evaluation sample size is not specified, limiting confidence in the qualitative results

## Confidence
- Dataset construction and composition: Medium - While the methodology is described, the quality and consistency of GPT-4.0-generated simplifications remains uncertain
- LLaMA outperforming OpenNMT: High - Results are clearly presented with both automatic and human evaluation metrics
- Fine-tuned LLMs effectiveness for low-resource languages: Medium - Based on single language experiment, requires replication

## Next Checks
1. Conduct inter-annotator agreement analysis on human evaluations to establish reliability of the ratings
2. Test additional neural architectures (e.g., T5, BART) to determine if LLaMA's performance is architecture-specific or generalizable
3. Evaluate model performance on out-of-domain texts to assess generalization beyond the training corpus
