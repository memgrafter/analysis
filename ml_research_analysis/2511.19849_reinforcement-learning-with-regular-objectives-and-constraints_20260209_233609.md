# Reinforcement Learning with $ω$-Regular Objectives and Constraints

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.19849
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19849
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: Novel RL framework combining ω-regular objectives with explicit constraints

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a reinforcement learning framework that treats ω-regular objectives and constraints separately, enabling more flexible safety-critical decision making. The authors develop a model-based RL algorithm using linear programming to maximize the probability of satisfying ω-regular objectives while adhering to ω-regular constraints within specified thresholds. The work addresses limitations of previous approaches that failed to maintain optimality when translating temporal logic specifications to reward-based formulations.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a model-based RL algorithm that formulates the problem as a linear program. The approach maximizes the probability of satisfying an ω-regular objective while ensuring ω-regular constraints are met within specified thresholds. They prove that optimal policies exist as convex combinations of two stationary policies and show that for almost-sure constraints, stationary or deterministic policies suffice. The method also includes a translation to constrained limit-average problems that preserves optimality.

## Key Results
- Optimal policies exist as convex combinations of two stationary policies
- For almost-sure constraints, stationary or deterministic policies suffice
- Translation to constrained limit-average problems preserves optimality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by separating the treatment of safety requirements (constraints) from optimization targets (objectives). This separation allows for more precise control over safety guarantees while still optimizing performance. The linear programming formulation enables systematic optimization of the satisfaction probability for ω-regular objectives under the constraint satisfaction thresholds.

## Foundational Learning

1. **ω-Regular Languages**
   - Why needed: Provide the formal language for specifying both objectives and constraints
   - Quick check: Can express safety properties, liveness properties, and complex temporal patterns

2. **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**
   - Why needed: Standard framework for modeling sequential decision problems under uncertainty
   - Quick check: States, actions, transitions, and rewards/discounts form the basic RL structure

3. **Linear Programming in RL**
   - Why needed: Enables exact solution for model-based RL problems with specific objective forms
   - Quick check: Can solve for optimal policies when transition dynamics are known

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Environment -> MDP Model -> LP Solver -> Optimal Policy

Critical Path: MDP formulation -> LP constraint generation -> Policy optimization -> Constraint satisfaction verification

Design Tradeoffs: Model-based approach requires known dynamics but enables exact optimization; separation of objectives and constraints provides flexibility but increases problem complexity

Failure Signatures: Constraint violations indicate insufficient threshold setting; suboptimal objective satisfaction suggests incorrect objective specification

First Experiments:
1. Verify LP formulation correctness on simple safety-critical benchmark problems
2. Test convex combination property with synthetic MDPs having known optimal policies
3. Validate translation to limit-average problems on problems with explicit solutions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Analysis assumes deterministic transition functions, limiting applicability to stochastic environments
- Computational complexity for large state spaces remains unexplored
- Proof of stationary policy sufficiency relies on specific structural assumptions about constraint satisfaction sets

## Confidence
- High confidence in mathematical framework and proofs
- Medium confidence in algorithmic approach and LP formulation
- Low confidence in practical applicability due to lack of empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. Extend analysis to stochastic transition functions and evaluate impact on policy optimality guarantees
2. Conduct empirical studies comparing computational efficiency against state-of-the-art constrained RL methods on benchmark problems
3. Test framework on real-world safety-critical applications to assess robustness under model uncertainty and noisy observations
