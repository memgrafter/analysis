# Remini: Leveraging Chatbot-Mediated Mutual Reminiscence for Promoting Positive Affect and Feeling of Connectedness among Loved Ones

## Quick Facts

- One-line primary result: LLM-guided chatbot structure significantly enhances positive affect and connectedness in mutual reminiscence

## Executive Summary
Remini is a chatbot designed to facilitate mutual reminiscence between close partners through structured conversational guidance based on the Social Functions of Autobiographical Memory (SFAM) framework. The system employs LLM-powered prompts to support reciprocal self-disclosure and co-constructed memory narratives across five phases: rapport building, memory narration, elaboration, reflection, and summary. Compared to a minimal-guidance baseline, Remini significantly improved positive affect, emotional synchrony, partner responsiveness, conversation engagement, and memory detail richness.

The findings demonstrate that structured conversational facilitation can deepen shared memories and psychosocial benefits, offering practical design insights for chatbots supporting intimate human-to-human connections. The study's results suggest that LLM-guided structure provides meaningful advantages over unstructured reminiscence approaches, particularly in enhancing emotional expression and feelings of connection between partners.

## Method Summary
The study employed a controlled experimental design comparing Remini's structured LLM-guided approach against a minimal-guidance baseline chatbot. Twenty-four close partner dyads participated in reminiscence sessions facilitated by either Remini or the baseline system. The LLM-powered Remini guided conversations through five distinct phases using targeted prompts based on the SFAM framework. Data collection included self-reported measures of positive affect, emotional synchrony, partner responsiveness, and conversation engagement, as well as qualitative analysis of memory detail richness. The experimental sessions were conducted in controlled settings to isolate the effects of the structured guidance approach.

## Key Results
- Remini significantly enhanced positive affect compared to minimal-guidance baseline
- Participants experienced greater emotional synchrony and partner responsiveness
- Conversation engagement and memory detail richness were substantially higher with structured LLM guidance
- Users reported deeper emotional expression and stronger feelings of connection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The LLM-guided structure works by providing scaffolding that helps participants navigate the complex social dynamics of mutual reminiscence. The five-phase approach creates a safe, progressive space for emotional disclosure while maintaining conversational flow. The prompts are designed to elicit specific types of autobiographical memory functions, ensuring that conversations move beyond surface-level recollection to deeper meaning-making and connection. This structured approach reduces cognitive load on participants, allowing them to focus on the emotional content rather than conversation management.

## Foundational Learning
1. Social Functions of Autobiographical Memory (SFAM) framework - why needed: Provides theoretical basis for structuring reminiscence conversations to maximize social and emotional benefits; quick check: Understand how different memory functions (e.g., directive, self, social) map to conversational goals
2. LLM-powered prompt engineering for conversational guidance - why needed: Enables dynamic, context-aware support that adapts to conversation flow while maintaining structure; quick check: Examine prompt templates and their alignment with SFAM phases
3. Mutual reminiscence dynamics - why needed: Understanding how shared memory construction differs from individual reminiscence informs system design; quick check: Review literature on co-constructed narratives and emotional synchrony in close relationships

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** User Interface -> LLM Engine -> SFAM Phase Manager -> Memory Repository -> Feedback Loop
**Critical Path:** User input → LLM processing → Phase-appropriate prompt generation → Conversation facilitation → Memory capture → User response
**Design Tradeoffs:** Structured guidance vs. conversational spontaneity; pre-defined phases vs. flexible flow; automated prompts vs. human moderation
**Failure Signatures:** Stilted conversations when prompts feel too rigid; reduced emotional depth if phases progress too quickly; user disengagement when guidance feels intrusive
**First 3 Experiments:** 1) A/B test different prompt styles within same SFAM phase; 2) Compare single-phase vs. multi-phase approaches; 3) Test memory detail richness across different relationship types

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Small sample size (N=24 dyads) limits statistical power and generalizability
- Study limited to close partners already familiar with each other, reducing applicability to other relationship types
- Controlled experimental setting may not capture natural reminiscence dynamics and contextual richness
- Self-reported measures introduce potential social desirability bias in emotionally sensitive contexts

## Confidence

**Positive affect and connectedness improvements:** High
**LLM-guided structure superiority over minimal guidance:** High
**Generalizability to diverse populations or relationship types:** Low
**Long-term relational or emotional benefits:** Low

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the study with a larger, more diverse sample including different relationship types (e.g., friends, family members, colleagues)
2. Conduct longitudinal follow-ups to assess whether observed benefits persist or evolve over weeks or months
3. Complement self-reported measures with observational or physiological indicators of emotional synchrony and engagement
