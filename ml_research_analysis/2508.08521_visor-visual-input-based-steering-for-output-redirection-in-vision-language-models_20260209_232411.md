# VISOR: Visual Input-based Steering for Output Redirection in Vision-Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.08521
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08521
- Authors: Mansi Phute; Ravikumar Balakrishnan
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: Achieves behavioral control of VLMs through visual input alone, enabling model steering without access or runtime overhead

## Executive Summary
VISOR introduces a novel method for steering Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using visual input-based steering rather than requiring model access or runtime modifications. The approach optimizes universal adversarial images that, when provided as input alongside user queries, can replicate the effects of activation-based steering vectors. This breakthrough enables practical deployment across all serving modalities - API, open-weight, and self-hosting - while maintaining task performance on unrelated benchmarks at 99.9% preservation.

The method demonstrates superior performance for negative steering tasks, achieving up to 25% behavioral shifts compared to modest changes from traditional steering vectors, while matching their effectiveness for positive steering within 1-2%. By eliminating runtime overhead and model access requirements, VISOR exposes a critical security vulnerability where adversaries can manipulate VLM behavior through visual channels alone, raising important safety considerations for deployed systems.

## Method Summary
VISOR optimizes universal adversarial images that function as steering vectors when provided as visual input to VLMs. The method works by generating images that, when processed by the vision encoder, produce activation patterns similar to those induced by traditional activation-based steering vectors. These optimized images are small (150KB) and can be applied to any VLM regardless of serving modality. The optimization process involves creating images that maximize the cosine similarity between their induced activations and target steering vector activations while maintaining visual coherence. During inference, the steering image is simply prepended to the user's query image, requiring no model modifications or additional computational overhead.

## Key Results
- Single 150KB steering image achieves behavioral control comparable to steering vectors (within 1-2% for positive steering)
- Dramatically exceeds steering vectors for negative steering tasks (up to 25% shifts vs. modest changes)
- Maintains 99.9% performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU tasks
- Eliminates runtime overhead and model access requirements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
VISOR exploits the fact that VLMs process visual and textual information through separate encoders that are later fused. By optimizing adversarial images that induce specific activation patterns in the vision encoder, these patterns can influence the fused representations and downstream behavior without requiring access to model weights or gradients. The universal nature of the images means they can be precomputed and applied across different instances of the same model architecture, making them practical for real-world deployment scenarios where model access is restricted.

## Foundational Learning
- **Vision-Language Model Architecture**: Understanding how VLMs separate visual and textual processing through distinct encoders is crucial for grasping why steering images can influence behavior without model access. Quick check: Can you identify the fusion mechanism in a VLM architecture diagram?
- **Activation-based Steering**: Traditional steering modifies model behavior by adding vectors to activation spaces, which VISOR replicates through visual input instead. Quick check: What is the mathematical relationship between steering vectors and activation modifications?
- **Universal Adversarial Examples**: These are inputs optimized to cause specific behaviors across different model instances, enabling the steering image approach. Quick check: How do universal adversarial examples differ from instance-specific ones?
- **Cosine Similarity Optimization**: The method uses cosine similarity to align steering image activations with target steering vector activations. Quick check: Why is cosine similarity preferred over Euclidean distance for activation alignment?
- **Model Serving Modalities**: Understanding API, open-weight, and self-hosting differences explains why model access independence is valuable. Quick check: What are the security implications of each serving modality?
- **Negative vs Positive Steering**: Negative steering reduces undesired behaviors while positive steering enhances desired ones, with VISOR showing asymmetric performance. Quick check: Why might negative steering be more challenging than positive steering?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
User Query Image -> Vision Encoder -> Fusion Module -> Text Decoder -> Output
Steering Image (Universal Adversarial) -> Vision Encoder (same path)

**Critical Path:**
The critical path involves the steering image passing through the vision encoder to generate activations that influence the fusion module's representations. Since the steering image is optimized to mimic steering vector effects, it must produce activation patterns that the fusion mechanism interprets similarly to traditional steering. The efficiency gain comes from precomputing this influence rather than computing it at runtime.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
VISOR trades the flexibility of dynamic steering (which requires model access) for universal applicability and zero runtime overhead. The 150KB image size represents a balance between steering effectiveness and practical deployment constraints. While larger images might provide better steering, they would increase bandwidth requirements and potentially reduce deployment feasibility in constrained environments.

**Failure Signatures:**
Performance degradation on larger model variants (1.5-13B, 1.5-33B) indicates the method may not scale well across model sizes. Visual artifacts in steering images could reveal their adversarial nature, potentially allowing detection. Limited evaluation on diverse task types beyond MMLU suggests potential blind spots in real-world applicability.

**First Experiments to Run:**
1. Test VISOR effectiveness across diverse VLM architectures including proprietary models and those with different vision encoders
2. Conduct adversarial simulation studies where attackers attempt to inject steering images through various channels
3. Evaluate VISOR's impact on long-form generation tasks and complex reasoning benchmarks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited scalability across model sizes, with degraded performance on larger variants (1.5-13B, 1.5-33B)
- Narrow evaluation scope focused primarily on MMLU tasks, lacking assessment of long-form content generation
- Security vulnerability claims assume adversaries can control image delivery channels
- 150KB image size could impact serving efficiency in bandwidth-constrained environments

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- Steering image methodology achieves comparable positive steering (1-2% difference) and superior negative steering (25% shifts)
- Runtime overhead elimination and model access independence are well-validated

**Medium Confidence:**
- Security vulnerability claims and adversarial implications require real-world adversarial testing
- Scalability to larger models needs more extensive validation beyond three tested variants

**Low Confidence:**
- Generalizability to diverse VLM architectures and tasks beyond MMLU benchmarks remains unproven

## Next Checks
1. Test VISOR's effectiveness across diverse VLM architectures including proprietary models and those with different vision encoders to assess architectural generalizability
2. Conduct adversarial simulation studies where attackers attempt to inject steering images through various channels (adversarial examples, social engineering, supply chain attacks) to validate real-world exploitability
3. Evaluate VISOR's impact on long-form generation tasks and complex reasoning benchmarks to ensure the 99.9% task preservation claim holds across broader use cases
