# Analyzing and Fine-Tuning Whisper Models for Multilingual Pilot Speech Transcription in the Cockpit

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.21990
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21990
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: WER reduced from 68.49% to 26.26% using fine-tuned Whisper Large with text normalization on cockpit pilot speech

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of transcribing multilingual pilot speech in cockpit environments, where standard ASR models struggle due to domain-specific vocabulary, noise, and language mixing. The authors propose combining text normalization strategies—including handling ICAO alphabets, removing filler words, and standardizing compound words—with LoRA-based fine-tuning of Whisper models. Using 215 minutes of cockpit and pilot interview recordings in German and English, they demonstrate that fine-tuning with normalization reduces Word Error Rate from 68.49% (baseline) to 26.26% on the Whisper Large model, with similar gains across other model sizes. The results highlight the importance of domain adaptation and tailored preprocessing for effective ASR in specialized settings.

## Method Summary
The authors combine text normalization strategies with LoRA-based fine-tuning of Whisper models to improve multilingual pilot speech transcription in cockpit environments. The normalization process includes handling ICAO alphabets, removing filler words, and standardizing compound words. They fine-tune four Whisper model sizes (tiny, base, small, large) using a dataset of 215 minutes of cockpit and pilot interview recordings in German and English. The fine-tuning approach uses LoRA adapters to adapt the models to the specific domain while preserving the original model weights.

## Key Results
- WER reduced from 68.49% (baseline) to 26.26% on Whisper Large with fine-tuning and normalization
- Similar performance gains observed across all Whisper model sizes
- Fine-tuned models show improved handling of domain-specific vocabulary and language mixing

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by addressing two key challenges in cockpit ASR: domain-specific vocabulary and multilingual speech patterns. Text normalization standardizes ICAO alphabets, removes filler words, and handles compound word structures, while LoRA fine-tuning adapts the model parameters to the specific acoustic and linguistic characteristics of cockpit speech. This combination allows the model to better handle the unique vocabulary, code-switching patterns, and noise characteristics present in aviation communications.

## Foundational Learning
- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: Why needed - enables efficient fine-tuning by modifying only a small subset of parameters while keeping the original model frozen; Quick check - verify adapter rank parameters are appropriate for the task
- **Text normalization**: Why needed - standardizes domain-specific patterns like ICAO alphabets and compound words to improve recognition; Quick check - ensure normalization rules cover all expected aviation terminology
- **Whisper architecture**: Why needed - provides robust multilingual speech recognition foundation; Quick check - confirm model versions and configurations match reported settings
- **WER (Word Error Rate)**: Why needed - standard metric for evaluating ASR performance; Quick check - verify calculation methodology and normalization
- **Domain adaptation**: Why needed - adjusts general ASR models to specialized vocabulary and acoustic conditions; Quick check - assess adaptation effectiveness on held-out domain data
- **Multilingual ASR**: Why needed - cockpit communications involve mixed German-English speech; Quick check - evaluate performance across language boundaries

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Raw audio -> Preprocessing -> Whisper model -> LoRA adapter -> Output normalization -> Final transcription

**Critical Path**: Audio input → Normalization → LoRA-tuned Whisper → WER calculation

**Design Tradeoffs**: LoRA adapters offer parameter-efficient fine-tuning but may limit adaptation depth compared to full fine-tuning. The normalization strategy is tightly coupled with fine-tuning, making it difficult to isolate individual contributions to performance gains.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on domain-specific vocabulary suggests insufficient fine-tuning data or ineffective normalization rules. Language mixing errors indicate inadequate multilingual adaptation.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate baseline Whisper performance on held-out cockpit data without any fine-tuning
2. Test normalization-only approach on fine-tuned models to isolate preprocessing impact
3. Assess multilingual performance by evaluating models on language-specific subsets of the data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Small dataset size (215 minutes) may limit generalizability beyond the specific German-English aviation domain
- WER evaluation may be affected by inconsistent punctuation or capitalization normalization
- Study focuses on two languages, leaving multilingual scalability beyond this pair unexplored

## Confidence
- WER reduction claims: High (for reported conditions)
- Generalization to other aviation contexts: Medium (due to limited dataset)
- Multilingual scalability: Low (only tested on German-English pair)

## Next Checks
1. Test model performance on an independent, held-out dataset of pilot speech recordings from different aircraft or operational contexts to assess generalization
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing fine-tuning with normalization versus fine-tuning alone and normalization alone to quantify individual contributions
3. Evaluate the approach on additional language pairs beyond German-English to assess multilingual robustness
