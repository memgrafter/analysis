# Explainable AI for microseismic event detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.17458
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17458
- Authors: Ayrat Abdullin; Denis Anikiev; Umair bin Waheed
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: XAI techniques revealed PhaseNet focuses on P- and S-wave arrivals, leading to SHAP-gated inference that improved F1-score from 0.97 to 0.98 on microseismic detection

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the interpretability challenge in deep learning models for microseismic event detection by applying explainable AI techniques to PhaseNet. The researchers used Grad-CAM and SHAP to analyze model behavior, revealing that PhaseNet focuses on P- and S-wave arrivals with vertical components driving P-phase picks and horizontal components driving S-phase picks. Building on these insights, they developed a SHAP-gated inference scheme that combines model output with SHAP-based evidence, resulting in improved detection performance and noise robustness.

## Method Summary
The researchers applied two XAI techniques to analyze PhaseNet's decision-making process: Grad-CAM for visualizing attention regions and SHAP for quantifying feature importance. They discovered that the model focuses on P- and S-wave arrivals, with vertical components primarily driving P-phase identification and horizontal components driving S-phase detection. Based on these insights, they implemented a SHAP-gated inference approach that combines the original PhaseNet predictions with SHAP-derived evidence scores. This hybrid method was evaluated on a test set of 9,000 waveforms, demonstrating improved F1-score from 0.97 to 0.98 with enhanced robustness to noise.

## Key Results
- XAI analysis revealed PhaseNet focuses on P- and S-wave arrivals for microseismic detection
- Vertical components drive P-phase picks while horizontal components drive S-phase picks
- SHAP-gated inference improved F1-score from 0.97 to 0.98 (precision 0.99, recall 0.97) on test set
- The approach showed greater robustness to noise compared to baseline PhaseNet

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The SHAP-gated inference works by combining the original PhaseNet predictions with SHAP-derived evidence scores that quantify the contribution of each input feature. By incorporating this interpretability-based evidence, the system can better distinguish between true seismic events and noise artifacts. The mechanism leverages the observation that seismic phases have distinct characteristics in different components, allowing the model to weight evidence appropriately based on component-specific importance revealed by SHAP analysis.

## Foundational Learning

Seismic Wave Phases
- Why needed: Understanding P- and S-wave characteristics is essential for interpreting what the model learns
- Quick check: Verify P-waves arrive first and are compressional, while S-waves are slower and shear

XAI Techniques (Grad-CAM, SHAP)
- Why needed: These methods provide visibility into deep learning model decision processes
- Quick check: Ensure Grad-CAM shows attention maps while SHAP provides feature importance scores

Microseismic Event Detection
- Why needed: Context for the specific application and performance metrics used
- Quick check: Confirm detection involves identifying both event occurrence and phase arrival times

Synthetic Data Generation
- Why needed: Understanding how realistic test data was created for evaluation
- Quick check: Verify noise models and signal characteristics match field conditions

Performance Metrics (Precision, Recall, F1)
- Why needed: To properly interpret the quantitative improvements reported
- Quick check: Ensure precision emphasizes false positives while recall emphasizes false negatives

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Input Waveforms -> PhaseNet Backbone -> Grad-CAM/SHAP Analysis -> SHAP-gated Inference -> Output Detections

Critical Path: Raw seismic data → PhaseNet processing → XAI interpretation → Combined evidence scoring → Final detection decision

Design Tradeoffs: The SHAP-gated approach adds computational overhead for interpretability but provides measurable performance gains and noise robustness that may justify the cost in critical applications.

Failure Signatures: The system may struggle with overlapping events, poor signal-to-noise ratios beyond tested levels, or phase arrivals that don't match training distribution.

First Experiments:
1. Test baseline PhaseNet performance on controlled synthetic datasets with varying noise levels
2. Apply Grad-CAM to visualize attention patterns for known event types
3. Generate SHAP values for individual waveforms to identify feature importance patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to synthetic datasets, which may not capture real-world complexity
- Modest absolute improvement (F1 0.97 to 0.98) that may not generalize across all geological settings
- Noise robustness tested only under controlled synthetic noise injection, not real seismic noise patterns

## Confidence

Confidence in XAI interpretations: High
- The use of Grad-CAM and SHAP to identify P- and S-wave arrival focus is well-supported by methodology

Confidence in performance claims: Medium
- Quantitative improvements are statistically rigorous but depend heavily on synthetic data limitations

Confidence in noise robustness claims: Medium
- Demonstrated under controlled conditions but real seismic data contains more complex noise sources

## Next Checks

1. Test the SHAP-gated inference approach on real field datasets from multiple geological settings to verify generalization.
2. Evaluate performance across different network architectures beyond PhaseNet to assess method transferability.
3. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of Grad-CAM versus SHAP components to the observed improvements.
