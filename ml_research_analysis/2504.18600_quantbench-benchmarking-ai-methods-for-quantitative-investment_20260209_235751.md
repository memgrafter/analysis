## Executive Summary
This paper introduces QuantBench, a comprehensive benchmark platform designed to address the lack of standardized evaluation frameworks for AI methods in quantitative investment. The platform provides a full-pipeline solution covering data preparation, modeling, portfolio optimization, and order execution across multiple markets and data types. Through extensive empirical studies, QuantBench reveals critical insights about model performance, including the effectiveness of tree-based models with strong features, the importance of model ensembles to combat overfitting, the significant impact of alpha decay requiring frequent model updates, and the critical role of training objective selection.

## Method Summary
QuantBench is a comprehensive benchmark platform for evaluating AI methods across the full quantitative investment pipeline, including factor mining, modeling (classification/regression/ranking), portfolio optimization, and order execution. The platform integrates multi-market stock data from China, US, Hong Kong, and UK markets spanning ~2003-2024, supporting diverse data types including market data (OHLCV, tick-level), fundamental features from financial statements, relational data from Wikidata and industry graphs, and news sentiment scores. Model architectures span tree-based methods (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost), temporal models (LSTM, GRU, TCN, Transformers), and spatiotemporal models (GCN, GAT, RGCN, THGNN, DTML). Training employs walk-forward optimization with 3/6/12-month rolling windows, using task-specific metrics like Information Coefficient (IC), annualized return, Sharpe ratio, and task-agnostic metrics including robustness, correlation, and alpha decay.

## Key Results
- Tree models like XGBoost often outperform deep neural networks when feature engineering is strong, particularly with Alpha101 features
- Model ensembles effectively mitigate overfitting in low signal-to-noise environments, reducing performance variance across runs
- Alpha decay is significant, with IC half-life showing models degrade quickly without frequent updates, necessitating 3-month rolling retraining
- The choice of training objective critically impacts performance, with IC loss generally superior to MSE for ranking-based tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
QuantBench works by providing a standardized, full-pipeline evaluation framework that addresses the fragmented nature of quantitative investment research. By integrating diverse data sources (market, fundamental, relational, news) and supporting multiple model architectures across different markets and frequencies, it enables comprehensive benchmarking that mirrors real-world investment scenarios. The platform's walk-forward validation with rolling windows captures temporal dynamics and distribution shifts inherent in financial markets. Task-specific evaluation metrics aligned with industry practices (IC for signal strength, Sharpe ratio for risk-adjusted returns, slippage for execution quality) ensure results translate to practical investment outcomes rather than just statistical performance.

## Foundational Learning

**Temporal Alignment in Financial Data**
- Why needed: Financial data has strict causality requirements; using future information for prediction creates data leakage
- Quick check: Verify all features, including relational graph snapshots and news sentiment, use only information available at prediction time

**Alpha Decay and Non-Stationarity**
- Why needed: Financial market distributions shift over time, causing model performance to degrade (alpha decay)
- Quick check: Measure IC half-life across different rolling window sizes to quantify model degradation rate

**Walk-Forward Validation**
- Why needed: Standard cross-validation doesn't capture temporal dependencies and lookahead bias in time series
- Quick check: Compare walk-forward results against simple temporal split to verify reduced lookahead bias

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Data Preparation -> Feature Engineering -> Model Training -> Portfolio Optimization -> Order Execution -> Evaluation Metrics

**Critical Path**
The most critical evaluation path is: Feature Engineering (Alpha101/158) -> Model Selection (XGBoost vs LSTM) -> IC-based Stock Selection -> Portfolio Construction -> Performance Evaluation (Sharpe ratio, max drawdown)

**Design Tradeoffs**
The platform trades computational efficiency for comprehensiveness by implementing multiple data types and model architectures, requiring significant resources for full evaluation. Walk-forward validation provides realistic temporal evaluation but increases computational cost compared to standard cross-validation.

**Failure Signatures**
- High variance across repeated runs indicates overfitting to noisy patterns
- Performance degradation over time signals alpha decay and distribution shift
- Poor correlation between IC and portfolio returns suggests misalignment between training objective and financial outcomes

**First 3 Experiments**
1. Compare XGBoost vs LSTM performance on Alpha101 features using IC as training objective and top-300 stock selection
2. Evaluate ensemble performance (XGBoost + LSTM) against individual models to measure overfitting reduction
3. Test different rolling window sizes (3-month vs 6-month vs 12-month) to quantify alpha decay and optimal update frequency

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Efficient Continual Learning for Alpha Decay**
The paper observes that frequent updates (e.g., 3-month rolling) yield the best performance due to distribution shifts, but this approach is computationally expensive, creating a need for efficient online learning and continual learning techniques. Evidence that would resolve this: A continual learning method that maintains the performance stability of a 3-month rolling update scheme while significantly reducing training time and computational load compared to full retraining.

**Graph-Based Modeling Effectiveness**
The empirical study shows that incorporating graph structures does not consistently yield performance improvements, with many relational GNNs (like RGCN) struggling or underperforming compared to temporal models. Evidence that would resolve this: The development of a spatiotemporal model that utilizes graph structures to consistently outperform strong temporal baselines (e.g., LSTM, GRU) across multiple markets and metrics.

**Automatic Training Objective Alignment**
The authors found that the effectiveness of training objectives (e.g., IC loss vs. MSE) varies significantly by model architecture and suggest a need for AutoML to optimize the selection of training objectives automatically. Evidence that would resolve this: A systematic study or AutoML framework demonstrating a consistent correlation between specific automatically selected loss functions and maximized portfolio returns across diverse model architectures.

## Limitations
- Missing implementation details for relational graph construction from Wikidata and news sentiment feature extraction
- Absent hyperparameter configurations for the extensive model suite, preventing exact reproduction
- Underspecified backtest configuration details including transaction costs, slippage models, and portfolio rebalancing rules
- Limited effectiveness of Alpha101/158 factors in recent years suggests historical outperformance may not translate to current market conditions

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The platform architecture description and the general framework of walk-forward validation are clearly specified and reproducible.

**Medium Confidence**: The empirical findings about tree models outperforming deep networks with strong features and the effectiveness of ensemble methods are supported by presented results, though exact magnitude may vary.

**Low Confidence**: Specific performance metrics (IC, Sharpe ratios) and the relative ranking of different model architectures cannot be precisely reproduced without the missing implementation details.

## Next Checks

1. Validate temporal alignment by implementing a data leakage test: ensure all features, including relational graph snapshots and news sentiment scores, use only information available at prediction time for a sample period.

2. Implement and compare the simplest specified pipeline: XGBoost with Alpha101 features versus LSTM with Alpha158 features, using IC as the training objective and top-300 stock selection, to verify the paper's core claim about tree models' effectiveness.

3. Conduct an ensemble stability test: run multiple seeds of the same model architecture and compare variance to ensemble performance to verify the paper's finding that ensembles mitigate overfitting in low signal-to-noise environments.
