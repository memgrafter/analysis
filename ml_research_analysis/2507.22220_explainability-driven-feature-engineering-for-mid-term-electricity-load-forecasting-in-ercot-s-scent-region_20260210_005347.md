- This paper demonstrates that SHAP-driven feature engineering can significantly improve mid-term electricity load forecasting accuracy, particularly during peak demand events.

## Executive Summary
This paper demonstrates that SHAP-driven feature engineering can significantly improve mid-term electricity load forecasting accuracy, particularly during peak demand events. By analyzing SHAP values, the authors identified key feature deficiencies in traditional models and engineered new variables—such as load_spike_vs_mean and CDD_x_hour—to better capture short-term surges and weather-load interactions. This iterative process led to dramatic performance gains: XGBoost improved from a MAPE of 3.15% to 0.79%, while LightGBM reduced MAPE from 5.26% to 0.91%. The study also highlights how XGBoost with SHAP provides superior interpretability and accuracy compared to LSTM-based approaches. The results validate SHAP as both an explainability tool and a mechanism for targeted model refinement in critical load forecasting applications.

## Method Summary
The authors employed SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to analyze feature importance in mid-term electricity load forecasting models. This analysis revealed deficiencies in traditional feature sets, particularly in capturing short-term load surges and weather-load interactions. The team then iteratively engineered new features—including load_spike_vs_mean (to capture sudden demand changes) and CDD_x_hour (to model temperature-load relationships at specific times)—and evaluated their impact on model performance. The approach was tested using both XGBoost and LightGBM models on ERCOT's SCENT region data, with comparisons to LSTM-based forecasting methods.

## Key Results
- SHAP-driven feature engineering improved XGBoost MAPE from 3.15% to 0.79%
- LightGBM MAPE reduced from 5.26% to 0.91% through targeted feature development
- XGBoost with SHAP outperformed LSTM-based approaches in both accuracy and interpretability
- Engineered features like load_spike_vs_mean and CDD_x_hour effectively captured short-term surges and weather-load interactions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The SHAP-driven approach works by providing granular, instance-level explanations of model predictions, which enables precise identification of feature deficiencies. When traditional models underperform during peak demand events, SHAP values reveal which features contribute to prediction errors. This transparency allows engineers to create targeted features that address specific forecasting challenges—such as sudden load spikes or complex weather-load relationships—rather than relying on generic feature selection methods. The iterative cycle of analysis, engineering, and evaluation creates a feedback loop that progressively improves model performance while maintaining interpretability.

## Foundational Learning
- **SHAP Values**: Explainability metric for feature contributions to model predictions; needed to identify feature deficiencies, verified by observing consistent underprediction patterns during peak events
- **Mid-term Load Forecasting**: Prediction of electricity demand 1-7 days ahead; needed for grid planning and reliability, verified by focusing on ERCOT's SCENT region operational requirements
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of new predictive variables from existing data; needed to capture complex load dynamics, verified by performance improvements after adding engineered features
- **XGBoost vs LightGBM**: Gradient boosting implementations with different optimization strategies; needed for comparative analysis, verified by distinct performance characteristics on the same dataset
- **Load Spikes**: Sudden increases in electricity demand; needed to understand forecasting challenges, verified by SHAP analysis revealing consistent underprediction during surge periods
- **Weather-Load Interaction**: Complex relationship between temperature and electricity consumption; needed for comprehensive forecasting, verified by engineered features capturing temporal patterns

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Raw Data -> Preprocessing -> Feature Engineering (SHAP-driven) -> Model Training (XGBoost/LightGBM) -> Performance Evaluation -> SHAP Analysis -> Iterative Refinement

**Critical Path**: Data preprocessing → SHAP analysis → Feature engineering → Model training → Performance validation

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Interpretability vs. complexity: SHAP analysis adds computational overhead but enables targeted improvements
- Feature engineering effort vs. performance gains: iterative development requires significant expertise but yields substantial MAPE reductions
- Model selection: XGBoost provides better interpretability with SHAP while maintaining superior accuracy to LSTM approaches

**Failure Signatures**:
- Persistent underprediction during peak events indicates missing features for short-term surges
- Inconsistent feature importance across time periods suggests inadequate temporal modeling
- High SHAP value variance implies unstable feature contributions requiring feature refinement

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Apply SHAP analysis to baseline model to identify top underperforming features during peak events
2. Engineer load_spike_vs_mean feature and evaluate impact on peak demand prediction accuracy
3. Test CDD_x_hour feature across different time-of-day segments to optimize temporal resolution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Study focuses exclusively on ERCOT's SCENT region, limiting generalizability to other grid regions
- Lack of specified temporal scope and data preprocessing details makes performance assessment difficult
- LSTM baseline comparison lacks detailed performance metrics, weakening comparative claims

## Confidence
- Performance improvements (MAPE reductions) → High confidence based on specific metrics provided
- Cross-regional applicability → Low confidence due to single-region focus
- Comparative advantage over LSTM → Medium confidence due to incomplete baseline metrics

## Next Checks
1. Test the SHAP-driven feature engineering approach on at least two other regional grid datasets (e.g., PJM, CAISO) to verify cross-regional applicability
2. Conduct ablation studies removing individual engineered features to quantify their marginal contribution to performance improvements
3. Compare SHAP-based feature engineering with established automated feature selection methods (e.g., mutual information, recursive feature elimination) to establish relative effectiveness
