# Evaluating Standard and Dialectal Frisian ASR: Multilingual Fine-tuning and Language Identification for Improved Low-resource Performance

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.04883
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04883
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: Multilingual fine-tuning with Dutch and German data reduces WER from 14.2% to 13.1% on Standard Frisian

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the challenge of improving Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) performance for Frisian and its regional dialects using self-supervised learning approaches. The authors employ a pre-trained XLS-R 1B model and fine-tune it using multilingual data (Frisian, Dutch, German, and English) while implementing an auxiliary language identification task. The experimental results demonstrate that incorporating Dutch and German data into the fine-tuning process reduces Word Error Rate (WER) from 14.2% to 13.1% on Standard Frisian test data. However, adding English data slightly increases the WER to 13.4%. The study reveals that dialectal speech remains substantially more challenging than standard speech, with WERs reaching 24.1% for South Frisian when using multilingual fine-tuning with language identification.

## Method Summary
The researchers fine-tune a pre-trained XLS-R 1B model using multilingual data from Frisian, Dutch, German, and English sources. They implement an auxiliary language identification task by incorporating language-specific tokens into the model architecture. The training process involves standard ASR fine-tuning techniques combined with the language identification objective. The model is evaluated on both Standard Frisian and dialectal speech (Clay Frisian, Wood Frisian, and South Frisian) using Word Error Rate as the primary metric. The approach leverages self-supervised learning capabilities of the foundation model while adapting it to the specific characteristics of the Frisian language and its dialects through multilingual fine-tuning and language identification mechanisms.

## Key Results
- Multilingual fine-tuning with Dutch and German data reduces WER from 14.2% to 13.1% on Standard Frisian
- Language identification tokens provide marginal improvements on Standard Frisian but more substantial benefits on dialectal speech, reducing WER by approximately 1%
- Dialectal speech shows significantly worse performance, with WER reaching 24.1% for South Frisian using multilingual fine-tuning with language identification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging cross-linguistic transfer learning from related languages (Dutch and German) to improve phonetic and lexical modeling of Frisian. The self-supervised pre-training provides a robust foundation for speech representations, while multilingual fine-tuning allows the model to learn shared acoustic patterns across languages. The language identification tokens help the model distinguish between standard and dialectal speech patterns, enabling more accurate recognition of dialect-specific pronunciations and vocabulary. This is particularly important for Frisian dialects that exhibit substantial phonetic and lexical variation from the standard language.

## Foundational Learning

**Self-supervised learning**: Why needed - Provides robust speech representations without extensive labeled data; Quick check - Verify model learns meaningful phonetic features through reconstruction tasks

**Multilingual transfer learning**: Why needed - Leverages related languages to improve low-resource ASR performance; Quick check - Compare performance gains from different language combinations

**Language identification integration**: Why needed - Helps model distinguish between standard and dialectal speech patterns; Quick check - Measure impact on dialectal speech recognition accuracy

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: XLS-R 1B -> Multilingual fine-tuning -> Language ID tokens -> ASR output

**Critical path**: Pre-trained model weights → Multilingual data input → Fine-tuning with language ID task → Optimized ASR model

**Design tradeoffs**: The approach balances between leveraging multilingual data for improved generalization while maintaining language-specific accuracy. The language identification tokens add computational overhead but provide benefits for dialectal speech recognition.

**Failure signatures**: If multilingual fine-tuning causes performance degradation, check for language interference or overfitting to dominant languages. If language ID tokens don't help, verify proper token integration and training stability.

**First experiments**:
1. Compare single-language fine-tuning versus multilingual fine-tuning on WER reduction
2. Test language ID token ablation to measure contribution to dialectal speech improvement
3. Evaluate model performance on unseen speakers to assess generalization capabilities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Small dataset size (10 hours of Standard Frisian training data) constrains generalizability
- Focus on single pre-trained model (XLS-R 1B) limits architectural comparison
- Evaluation limited to word error rate without exploring phoneme error rate or speaker adaptation

## Confidence

**Multilingual fine-tuning improves Frisian ASR performance**: High confidence - Results consistently show WER reduction from 14.2% to 13.1% across multiple experiments

**Language identification tokens provide marginal benefits for Standard Frisian but meaningful improvements for dialectal speech**: Medium confidence - Improvements are statistically significant but relatively small in absolute terms

**Dialectal speech remains substantially more challenging than standard speech for ASR systems**: High confidence - WER differences between standard and dialectal speech are large and consistent across experimental conditions

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the same fine-tuning approach with alternative foundation models (e.g., Whisper, HuBERT) to determine if results are model-dependent or generalizable across architectures
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the specific contribution of language identification tokens versus multilingual fine-tuning effects, particularly examining whether improvements are due to better language boundary detection or enhanced phonetic modeling
3. Test the models on out-of-domain dialectal speech from speakers not present in the training data to assess generalization capabilities and speaker adaptation requirements
