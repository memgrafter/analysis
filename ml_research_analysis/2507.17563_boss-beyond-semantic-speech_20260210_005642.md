# BoSS: Beyond-Semantic Speech

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2507.17563
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17563
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Introduces BoSS framework and Spoken Interaction System Capability Levels (L1-L5) to benchmark speech models' ability to interpret beyond-semantic features like affective cues and contextual dynamics.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Beyond-Semantic Speech (BoSS), a framework for understanding the multidimensional features of speech that extend beyond explicit semantics, such as affective cues, contextual dynamics, and implicit meanings. To benchmark the progression of speech intelligence, the authors propose Spoken Interaction System Capability Levels (L1-L5), ranging from basic command recognition to human-like social interaction. They present a formalized framework grounded in cognitive relevance theories and evaluate BoSS-related attributes across five dimensions using several open-source speech language models. The results show that current models struggle to fully interpret beyond-semantic signals, particularly in dialect comprehension, age perception, and nonverbal cue interpretation. These findings highlight the need for advancing BoSS research to enable richer, more context-aware human-machine communication.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a theoretical framework using Relevance Theory to model speech understanding as an optimization problem maximizing cognitive effect over processing effort. The system constructs observation vectors combining explicit semantics, affective cues, contextual dynamics, and implicit semantics, then uses neural networks to score relevance. A Hidden Markov Model selects the optimal meaning hypothesis based on these relevance scores. The evaluation tests existing open-source speech language models on five BoSS dimensions using custom datasets for dialect comprehension, context memory, emotion perception, age perception, and non-verbal cue responsiveness, with responses scored by GPT-4o.

## Key Results
- Current speech language models show significant limitations in interpreting beyond-semantic speech features
- Dialect comprehension and generation performance varies widely across models, with some achieving high accuracy while others struggle
- Emotion perception and age perception tasks reveal models often miss affective and contextual cues
- Non-verbal cue interpretation (coughs, laughter) performs poorly, with models scoring between 1.5% and 9.19% on responsiveness
- The proposed BoSS framework and capability levels provide a structured approach for evaluating and advancing speech intelligence

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Interpreting beyond-semantic speech can be framed as an optimization problem where the system selects the meaning hypothesis that maximizes cognitive relevance.
- Mechanism: The framework proposes an "Optimal Meaning Hypothesis" ($H^*_t$) selected by maximizing the ratio of Cognitive Effect ($E$) to Processing Effort ($P$). Neural networks ($NN_E$, $NN_P$) are trained to predict these values based on observation and context.
- Core assumption: The cognitive trade-off between processing effort and contextual effect is a valid computational objective function.
- Evidence anchors: Equations (2) defining $H^*_t = \text{argmax}_{H \in \mathcal{H}} (E_H / P_H)$, with related work focusing on end-to-end token prediction.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Effective semantic interpretation requires decomposing speech signal into distinct latent vectors representing explicit content, affect, context, and implicit meaning.
- Mechanism: The system constructs an observation vector $O_t = [V_{L,t}, V_{AC,t}, V_{CD,t}, V_{IS,t}]$ to explicitly represent paralinguistic features and environmental cues separately from text transcript.
- Core assumption: Implicit semantics can be reliably disentangled from explicit semantics and vocal characteristics into a distinct vector.
- Evidence anchors: GOAT-SLM and EchoMind emphasize necessity of modeling paralinguistic and non-lexical vocal cues separately.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Temporal dynamics of dialogue can be modeled using a Hidden Markov Model where emission probabilities are driven by computed relevance score.
- Mechanism: The framework uses an HMM to model sequence of hidden states, with emission probability $P(O_t|H_t)$ derived from exponentiated relevance score ($e^{E/P}$).
- Core assumption: Hidden states can adequately represent discrete, nuanced "meanings" or "intents" for high-level social interaction.
- Evidence anchors: Equation (7) derives emission probability using relevance ratio calculated by neural networks.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Relevance Theory (Cognitive Science)**
  - Why needed here: Theoretical backbone defining "meaning" as balance of cognitive effect and processing effort.
  - Quick check question: In this framework, does a "relevant" message require high cognitive effect, low processing effort, or both?

- **Concept: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) & Emission Probabilities**
  - Why needed here: The proposed architecture uses HMM to handle temporal dynamics, requiring understanding of mapping observations to states via emission probabilities.
  - Quick check question: In Equation 7, how does the Relevance Score ($E/P$) directly influence the probability of a specific hidden state emitting the observed speech vector?

- **Concept: Paralinguistics & Prosody**
  - Why needed here: To understand inputs to vectors $V_{AC}$ (Affective Cues) and $V_{IS}$ (Implicit Semantics), distinguishing between what is said and how it is said.
  - Quick check question: If a speaker says "Great job" with low pitch and slow tempo, which vector ($V_L$ or $V_{AC}$) signals the literal meaning should be inverted?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input Encoders (Audio, Prosody/Affect, Environment/History) -> Relevance Engine (NN_E, NN_P) -> Temporal Model (HMM) -> Response Generator (TTS)
- **Critical path:** The calculation of the Relevance Score ($R = E/P$). If $NN_E$ and $NN_P$ are not accurately trained, HMM emission probabilities will be malformed.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Interpretable HMM vs. End-to-End LLM: Tradeoff between interpretability/control of HMM approach and raw performance/fluency of large end-to-end models.
  - Vector Disentanglement: Forcing separation of $V_L$ and $V_{IS}$ prevents loss of implicit cues but requires complex training data.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Literalism: Model responds factually when emotion should be read (failure in $V_{AC}$ integration)
  - Amnesia: Loss of context in multi-turn dialogue (failure in $V_{CD}$ or HMM state history)
  - Tone Mismatch: Responding to child's query with formal adult language (failure in $V_{IS}$ / Age Awareness)
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Metric Validation: Reproduce "Optimal Meaning Hypothesis" test on Chinese Dialect datasets to verify if relevance scoring improves accuracy over semantic-only baselines.
  2. Ablation Study: Remove specific input vectors (e.g., disable $V_{AC}$) and measure performance drop on Emotion Perception task to quantify affective cues contribution.
  3. Non-verbal Integration: Test system against "Non-verbal Information" dataset to see if $V_{CD}$ successfully triggers appropriate responses compared to baseline models scoring ~2%.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can machines identify and interpret non-verbal and contextual cues embedded in speech?
- Basis in paper: Introduction explicitly states current limitations raise critical questions about interpreting these cues to infer nuanced meanings and intentions.
- Why unresolved: Current speech technologies primarily extract explicit semantics, failing to capture implicit signals like intonation or pauses that modify meaning.
- What evidence would resolve it: A computational model capable of distinguishing between identical semantic content with different intents (sarcasm vs. praise) with accuracy comparable to human perception.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the proposed "Optimal Meaning Hypothesis" framework be implemented effectively in end-to-end neural architectures?
- Basis in paper: Section 4 proposes formalized framework using neural networks and HMMs, but Section 5 evaluates existing SLMs rather than validating model trained on this specific theoretical objective.
- Why unresolved: Paper provides theoretical formulation for $H^*_t$ but does not demonstrate practical training dynamics or convergence of proposed relevance-scoring neural networks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful training and validation of speech model that optimizes specific $E/P$ ratio, showing superior performance on BoSS benchmarks compared to standard likelihood-based training.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can SLMs be modified to interpret non-verbal vocal signals (coughing, laughter) which currently result in near-zero appropriate responsiveness?
- Basis in paper: Table 6 and Section 5.5 show current models score between 1.5% and 9.19% on non-verbal responsiveness; discussion notes models treat speech as "textual tokens," filtering out non-semantic sounds.
- Why unresolved: Standard audio encoders and tokenization strategies tend to discard or misclassify non-speech sounds, treating them as noise rather than communicative signals.
- What evidence would resolve it: Architecture modifications allowing model to ingest "cough" and generate context-appropriate response (e.g., "Are you okay?") rather than ignoring it, significantly raising scores reported in Table 6.

## Limitations

- The theoretical framework connecting Relevance Theory to HMM-based state selection remains largely untested empirically.
- The evaluation methodology relies heavily on GPT-4o as automated judge, introducing potential biases and lack of transparency.
- The HMM approach may be fundamentally limited for modeling complex, long-range dependencies required for human-like social interaction.
- Dialect evaluation depends on synthesized speech using unspecified translation models and TTS systems that may not accurately represent natural dialectal variations.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Identification of five BoSS dimensions as important for human-like speech interaction.
- **Medium Confidence**: Formal mathematical framework connecting Relevance Theory to speech understanding via HMMs.
- **Low Confidence**: Claim that current open-source SLMs "struggle" with BoSS attributes based on presented evaluation methodology.

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical Relevance Score Validation**: Conduct controlled experiments comparing the proposed Relevance Score (E/P) framework against baseline semantic-only models on a simplified meaning selection task.

2. **GPT-4o Judge Reliability Assessment**: Perform inter-annotator reliability studies using multiple human judges to score emotion, age, and non-verbal responses, calculating Cohen's kappa and comparing human-human vs human-GPT-4o agreement.

3. **HMM vs. Transformer Comparison**: Implement the same BoSS evaluation tasks using a modern end-to-end Transformer architecture and compare performance against the proposed HMM-based approach.
