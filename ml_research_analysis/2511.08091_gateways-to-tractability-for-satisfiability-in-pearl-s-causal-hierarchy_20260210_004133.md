# Gateways to Tractability for Satisfiability in Pearl's Causal Hierarchy
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.08091
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08091
- Reference count: 40
- SATlinprob is in FPT with respect to d + tw(ϕ), and SATcausal is NP-complete even for simple cases

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the computational complexity of satisfiability problems within Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH), a framework for reasoning about probabilistic, interventional, and counterfactual statements. The authors investigate whether treewidth-based algorithms, effective for Boolean satisfiability, can be applied to PCH satisfiability problems. They provide the first parameterized tractability results for these problems, showing that SATlinprob is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the combined parameter of depth and treewidth, while also establishing fundamental limits by proving SATcausal is NP-complete even in restricted cases.

## Method Summary
The authors develop novel algorithms that avoid traditional dynamic programming approaches typically used for treewidth-based algorithms. Instead, they exploit structural characterizations of well-formed causal models and employ linear programming to verify the existence of structural causal models (SCMs) while avoiding exponential dependencies on input size. For SATlinprob, they reduce the problem to SAT while carefully managing the parameter dependence. For SATlincounterfact, they develop an FPT algorithm based on a combined parameter of depth and number of variables. The approach represents a significant departure from conventional methods in parameterized complexity.

## Key Results
- SATlinprob is in FPT with respect to the combined parameter d + tw(ϕ), and in XP with respect to tw(ϕ) alone
- SATlinprob is W[1]-hard with respect to the number of variables n
- SATcausal is NP-complete even if d = 2 and all edges in G_ϕ are pairwise vertex-disjoint
- SATlincounterfact is in FPT with respect to the combined parameter d + n

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of these algorithms stems from exploiting the structural properties of causal models within PCH. By characterizing well-formed causal models and using linear programming verification, the authors avoid the typical exponential blowup associated with dynamic programming on tree decompositions. The reduction to SAT for SATlinprob carefully manages parameter dependencies, while the SATlincounterfact algorithm leverages the combined parameter of depth and variables to achieve fixed-parameter tractability. The NP-completeness proof for SATcausal demonstrates that certain fundamental limitations exist regardless of treewidth considerations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Treewidth parameter**: Measures graph complexity for fixed-parameter algorithms; needed to bound search space in SATlinprob
- **Linear programming verification**: Used to check existence of SCMs without exponential blowup; needed to avoid dynamic programming
- **Structural causal models (SCMs)**: Formal representation of causal relationships; needed as the underlying problem instance
- **Pearl's Causal Hierarchy**: Framework organizing probabilistic, interventional, and counterfactual reasoning; needed to define problem variants
- **Parameterized complexity classes**: FPT, XP, W[1]; needed to precisely characterize algorithmic tractability
- **Problem reduction to SAT**: Technique for leveraging existing SAT solvers; needed to handle SATlinprob efficiently

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: PCH problem → Structural analysis → Linear programming verification → Parameter management
- **Critical path**: Problem instance → Tree decomposition → Parameter extraction (d + tw(ϕ)) → Linear program construction → Feasibility check
- **Design tradeoffs**: Avoids dynamic programming (innovation) but may have large parameter dependence; uses SAT reduction for tractability but requires careful parameter management
- **Failure signatures**: High parameter values cause exponential blowup; disconnected graphs may break structural assumptions; incorrect parameter extraction invalidates complexity claims
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Test SATlinprob algorithm on small instances with known solutions to verify correctness, 2) Measure runtime growth as d + tw(ϕ) increases to empirically verify FPT claim, 3) Attempt SATcausal instances with d=2 and vertex-disjoint edges to validate NP-completeness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The reduction to SAT for SATlinprob may have a large parameter dependence that warrants further investigation
- The novel algorithmic approach avoiding dynamic programming may require additional validation of correctness for complex cases
- The absence of dynamic programming may limit scalability to larger problem instances

## Confidence
- High confidence in the structural characterizations and reduction techniques used for SATlinprob
- Medium confidence in the NP-completeness proof for SATcausal, pending detailed verification of edge cases
- Medium confidence in the FPT result for SATlincounterfact due to the novel algorithmic approach

## Next Checks
1. Implement the proposed algorithm for SATlinprob to empirically verify the FPT claim and measure actual parameter dependence
2. Rigorously verify the NP-completeness proof for SATcausal by testing against all possible configurations of the simple cases
3. Conduct a complexity analysis of the reduction from PCH to SAT to determine the exact parameter dependence and identify potential optimizations
