- One-line result: Introduces holdout-based benchmarking framework for synthetic tabular data evaluation

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive framework for benchmarking synthetic tabular data that simultaneously measures fidelity and privacy through holdout-based comparison. The approach employs a three-pronged evaluation strategy: accuracy metrics using total variation distance on discretized univariate and bivariate distributions, embedding-based similarity measures using sentence transformers, and novelty assessment through nearest-neighbor distances. The framework supports mixed data types and sequential data with contextual information, providing a standardized way to evaluate synthetic data generators across multiple dimensions.

## Method Summary
The framework evaluates synthetic tabular data by comparing it against a holdout sample from the original data, establishing expected behavior baselines. Numerical and datetime columns are discretized into deciles, while categorical columns retain only the top 10 most frequent categories, enabling consistent comparison across data types through total variation distance. Each tabular record is serialized to a string, embedded using a pre-trained sentence transformer, and compared via centroid cosine similarity and discriminative AUC. Novelty is assessed through nearest-neighbor distance distributions, quantifying whether synthetic samples are novel composites rather than replicas of training data.

## Key Results
- Holdout-based benchmarking successfully distinguishes generalization from memorization in synthetic data generation
- The framework demonstrates effective evaluation across mixed data types using standardized discretization
- For UCI Adult Census dataset, optimal synthetic data achieves fidelity approaching holdout reference while maintaining sufficient novelty for privacy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Holdout-based benchmarking provides principled reference for distinguishing generalization from memorization.
- Mechanism: By splitting data before synthesis, synthetic samples should approximate training as closely as holdout does, but no closer. Smaller synthetic-to-training distances than holdout-to-training indicates memorization.
- Core assumption: Holdout set is representative; sampling variance is primary source of expected deviation.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states framework "facilitates quantitative assessment"; Section 2 establishes "synthetic samples should be as close to training as holdout but not closer"; related work (Platzer 2021) introduced holdout strategy.
- Break condition: Small or non-representative holdout makes reference metrics unreliable.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Decile-based discretization enables consistent accuracy computation across mixed data types.
- Mechanism: Numerical/datetime columns transformed into 10 equally-populated bins; categorical columns retain top 10 categories. This normalization enables univariate/bivariate accuracy via L1 total variation distance.
- Core assumption: Top-10 categories and decile binning capture most informative features; rare values contribute negligibly.
- Evidence anchors: Section 2.1 describes discretization into deciles and top-10 category retention; states this "enables consistent comparison across different data types."
- Break condition: Skewed distributions or important rare categories obscured by top-10/decile binning.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Embedding synthetic records enables high-dimensional fidelity and novelty assessment.
- Mechanism: Records serialized to strings, embedded with pre-trained sentence transformer, compared via centroid cosine similarity (fidelity) and nearest-neighbor L2 distances (novelty). Captures joint structure beyond pairwise bivariate metrics.
- Core assumption: Sentence embedding model trained on natural language generalizes meaningfully to serialized tabular data.
- Evidence anchors: Section 2.2 describes serialization and embedding process; Section 2.3 details DCR calculations for novelty assessment.
- Break condition: Serialization order or formatting biases embedding distances across different schemas.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Total Variation Distance (TVD)**
  - Why needed here: All accuracy metrics defined as (100% - TVD) between training and synthetic frequency distributions.
  - Quick check question: If synthetic categorical distribution is [0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25] and training is [0.5, 0.3, 0.15, 0.05], what is the TVD and resulting accuracy?

- Concept: **Holdout Methodology in Generative Modeling**
  - Why needed here: Unlike supervised learning, here holdout establishes expected "natural" distance baseline for synthetic data novelty assessment.
  - Quick check question: Why is comparing synthetic-to-training distances against holdout-to-training distances more informative than absolute distance thresholds?

- Concept: **Nearest Neighbor Distance Distributions**
  - Why needed here: DCR metrics rely on comparing distributions of nearest-neighbor distances, not just averages.
  - Quick check question: If DCR share is 70% (synthetic samples closer to training than holdout), what does this imply about memorization risk?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Accuracy module (univariate, bivariate, coherence metrics) -> Similarity module (embedding, centroid cosine similarity, discriminative AUC) -> Distances module (DCR distributions, identical-match shares) -> Report generator (HTML visualizations)

- Critical path: 1) Split original data → training + holdout 2) Train synthesizer on training data only 3) Generate synthetic dataset 4) Run qa.report() with all three dataframes 5) Compare synthetic metrics against holdout reference values

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Decile binning vs. finer-grained quantiles: Coarser bins improve stability for small datasets but lose detail
  - Lightweight embedding model (MiniLM) vs. larger models: Faster inference but potentially weaker joint distribution capture
  - Top-10 category limit: Reduces noise from rare categories but may misrepresent long-tailed distributions

- Failure signatures:
  - Accuracy approaching 100% with DCR share >70%: Likely memorization/replication
  - Low accuracy but high similarity: Marginal distributions wrong but joint structure approximately preserved
  - High identical-match rate with low DCR share: Dataset has legitimate duplicates; check training data for duplicates

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline validation: Run framework on training vs. holdout (no synthetic data) to establish expected reference metrics
  2. Memorization detection: Generate synthetic data with deliberately overfitted model and verify DCR share increases
  3. Utility-privacy sweep: Generate multiple synthetic datasets with varying privacy parameters and plot fidelity-privacy frontier

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does choice of embedding model affect stability and validity of high-dimensional similarity and distance metrics?
- Basis in paper: Section 2.2 states authors opted for all-MiniLML6v2 but choice is flexible
- Why unresolved: Framework relies on embeddings for centroid similarity and nearest-neighbor novelty calculations, but sensitivity to semantic properties or dimensionality is not quantified
- Evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of metric outcomes using different pre-trained models on identical datasets

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent does context-window truncation bias evaluation of long sequential data?
- Basis in paper: Section 2.2 notes long sequences are truncated to fit language model's context window
- Why unresolved: Truncation potentially discards long-range dependencies, meaning quality assessment may only reflect prefix quality
- Evidence would resolve it: Study correlating framework scores against sequence length or comparison using models with variable context windows

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does fixed discretization strategy fail to capture critical outliers or rare categories?
- Basis in paper: Section 2.1 describes decile transformation and top-10 category retention
- Why unresolved: By aggregating tails and dropping rare values, framework may report high accuracy while failing to detect synthetic model failures on rare data points
- Evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of framework's sensitivity to distributional shifts in tail ends or "other" category of categorical data

## Limitations

- Reliance on holdout assumption breaks down for small or non-representative holdouts
- Decile/top-10 discretization may miss critical distributional features in skewed or long-tailed data
- Sentence transformer embedding assumption lacks direct validation for tabular data

## Confidence

- Holdout benchmarking methodology: **High** (established practice with theoretical grounding)
- Discretization and accuracy metrics: **Medium** (practical but unverified for edge cases)
- Embedding-based similarity and novelty: **Low** (transfer assumption unvalidated for tabular data)

## Next Checks

1. **Benchmark embedding generalization**: Compare framework results using sentence transformer embeddings against domain-specific embeddings on identical datasets to quantify transfer loss.

2. **Holdout size sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary holdout proportions and measure stability of reference metrics to determine minimum viable holdout size.

3. **Rare category impact test**: Create synthetic datasets with artificially rare but important categories removed from top-10 lists, then measure accuracy inflation to quantify discretization bias.
