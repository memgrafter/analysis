# SoK: Systematic analysis of adversarial threats against deep learning approaches for autonomous anomaly detection systems in SDN-IoT networks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.26350
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26350
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Key outcome:** Systematic analysis of adversarial threats against DL-based AAD systems in SDN-IoT networks reveals up to 48.4% accuracy reduction and proposes adaptive countermeasures

## Executive Summary
This study provides a comprehensive systematic analysis of adversarial threats targeting deep learning-based autonomous anomaly detection systems in Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Internet of Things (IoT) environments. The research introduces a structured threat model that categorizes attacks into data-level, model-level, and hybrid threats, evaluating white-box, black-box, and grey-box attack strategies across three benchmark datasets. The findings demonstrate significant vulnerability of DL-based AAD systems to adversarial manipulation, with Membership Inference attacks causing the most substantial detection accuracy degradation. The study proposes adaptive countermeasures including real-time adversarial mitigation, enhanced retraining mechanisms, and explainable AI-driven security frameworks to enhance system robustness.

## Method Summary
The study employs a systematic threat analysis methodology that begins with defining a structured threat model categorizing adversarial attacks into data-level, model-level, and hybrid threats. The research evaluates multiple attack strategies (white-box, black-box, and grey-box) across three benchmark datasets: CICIDS2017, InSDN, and CICIoT2023. Performance metrics including detection accuracy, evasion success rates, and computational overhead are measured under various attack scenarios. The analysis includes evaluation of adversarial training as a defense mechanism and assessment of its limitations in real-time SDN-IoT deployment contexts. The methodology emphasizes quantitative measurement of attack impacts and qualitative assessment of countermeasure effectiveness.

## Key Results
- Adversarial attacks can reduce detection accuracy by up to 48.4%, with Membership Inference attacks causing the most significant degradation
- C&W and DeepFool attacks achieve high evasion success rates against DL-based AAD systems
- Adversarial training enhances robustness but faces high computational overhead limiting real-time deployment in SDN-IoT environments
- Proposed adaptive countermeasures include real-time adversarial mitigation, enhanced retraining mechanisms, and explainable AI-driven security frameworks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The systematic approach works by creating a comprehensive threat taxonomy that captures the full spectrum of adversarial attack vectors against DL-based AAD systems. By evaluating attacks across multiple access levels (white-box, black-box, grey-box) and using diverse benchmark datasets, the study establishes a robust foundation for understanding attack effectiveness and system vulnerabilities. The mechanism of measuring both attack success rates and defensive countermeasure performance provides actionable insights for security enhancement. The integration of explainable AI frameworks helps identify attack patterns and failure modes, enabling more targeted and effective defense strategies.

## Foundational Learning
- **SDN-IoT network architecture**: Understanding the control-data plane separation and centralized control in SDN, combined with distributed IoT devices, is essential for identifying attack surfaces and potential vulnerabilities in the network infrastructure
- **Deep learning for anomaly detection**: Knowledge of neural network architectures (CNN, RNN, LSTM) and their application to network traffic analysis is needed to understand how adversarial examples can manipulate detection outcomes
- **Adversarial machine learning**: Familiarity with attack techniques like FGSM, C&W, DeepFool, and membership inference is required to comprehend the threat landscape and attack methodologies
- **Benchmark datasets (CICIDS2017, InSDN, CICIoT2023)**: Understanding the characteristics and limitations of these datasets is crucial for interpreting evaluation results and assessing generalizability
- **Computational overhead analysis**: Knowledge of performance metrics and resource constraints in real-time systems is needed to evaluate the feasibility of defensive mechanisms
- **Explainable AI frameworks**: Understanding techniques for model interpretability and attack pattern identification is essential for developing effective countermeasures

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input traffic -> Preprocessing layer -> DL model (AAD) -> Decision output -> Security monitoring layer -> Countermeasure deployment

**Critical Path:** Network traffic ingestion → Feature extraction → Model inference → Anomaly detection → Security response → Countermeasure activation

**Design Tradeoffs:** Accuracy vs. computational efficiency in real-time deployment, comprehensive threat coverage vs. system complexity, robustness vs. performance overhead, interpretability vs. model complexity

**Failure Signatures:** Sudden accuracy degradation (>40%), consistent evasion by specific attack types, increased false positive/negative rates, computational bottlenecks during adversarial training, model behavior changes under attack scenarios

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test attack effectiveness using C&W and DeepFool on CICIDS2017 dataset with white-box access
2. Evaluate Membership Inference attack impact on detection accuracy across all three benchmark datasets
3. Measure computational overhead of adversarial training on DL model with varying network traffic volumes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses on specific benchmark datasets that may not fully represent real-world SDN-IoT traffic diversity and complexity
- Computational overhead analysis for adversarial training is qualitative rather than providing quantitative performance metrics
- Proposed countermeasures lack empirical validation in live SDN-IoT environments with real network traffic
- Statistical validation of attack success rates and detection accuracy degradation is limited across multiple independent runs

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Attack categorization framework provides comprehensive threat taxonomy, benchmark dataset selection covers relevant network traffic types, evasion attack effectiveness (C&W, DeepFool) demonstrates consistent attack success
- **Medium Confidence**: Detection accuracy degradation figures show significant impact but lack detailed statistical validation, adversarial training overhead estimates suggest feasibility challenges, proposed countermeasures appear theoretically sound but untested
- **Low Confidence**: Real-time deployment feasibility claims lack quantitative evidence, generalizability to production environments remains unproven, effectiveness of explainable AI frameworks not empirically demonstrated

## Next Checks
1. Conduct statistical validation of attack success rates across multiple independent runs with confidence intervals and error margins
2. Implement and measure computational overhead of adversarial training in simulated SDN-IoT environment with varying network scales and traffic patterns
3. Test proposed countermeasures against adaptive adversaries that can detect and evade defensive mechanisms in real-time scenarios with live network traffic
