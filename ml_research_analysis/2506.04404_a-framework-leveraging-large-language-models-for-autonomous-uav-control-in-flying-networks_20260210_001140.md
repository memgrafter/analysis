# A Framework Leveraging Large Language Models for Autonomous UAV Control in Flying Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.04404
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04404
- Reference count: 20
- FLUC framework integrates LLMs with ArduPilot for natural language UAV mission control

## Executive Summary
FLUC is a modular framework that enables autonomous UAV mission control through natural language commands by integrating open-source Large Language Models with the ArduPilot autopilot system. The framework translates high-level user commands into executable UAV mission code, eliminating the need for domain-specific programming expertise. The system was evaluated using three different LLMs (Qwen 2.5, Gemma 2, and LLaMA 3.2), demonstrating varying performance characteristics in structured reasoning, latency, and logical coherence. A case study implementing an energy-aware UAV positioning algorithm validated the framework's capability to interpret structured prompts and execute domain-specific logic autonomously.

## Method Summary
The framework architecture integrates Large Language Models with ArduPilot through a modular design that processes natural language commands into executable UAV mission code. The system employs a prompt engineering approach where user commands are converted into structured prompts for LLM processing. Three open-source LLMs were evaluated: Qwen 2.5 demonstrated superior structured reasoning and code generation capabilities, Gemma 2 provided optimal balance between accuracy and response latency, while LLaMA 3.2 offered faster responses but exhibited lower logical coherence. The evaluation focused on code generation performance metrics and included a case study applying energy-aware UAV positioning algorithms to validate autonomous execution of domain-specific logic.

## Key Results
- Qwen 2.5 excelled in structured reasoning and code generation accuracy for UAV mission tasks
- Gemma 2 achieved optimal balance between execution accuracy and response latency
- LLaMA 3.2 provided faster response times but demonstrated reduced logical coherence
- Case study confirmed FLUC's ability to autonomously execute energy-aware UAV positioning algorithms from natural language prompts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages LLMs' natural language understanding capabilities to bridge the gap between human operators and UAV control systems. By translating high-level commands into structured mission code, FLUC reduces the technical barrier for UAV operation while maintaining precision through LLM-generated code. The modular architecture allows for LLM swapping and optimization based on specific mission requirements, while the integration with ArduPilot provides reliable low-level control and safety mechanisms.

## Foundational Learning
- LLM-Prompt Engineering: Essential for converting natural language to structured mission code; verify through controlled command testing
- ArduPilot Integration: Provides reliable autopilot foundation; validate through basic flight maneuvers
- Natural Language Processing: Enables intuitive human-UAV interaction; test with varied command phrasings
- Code Generation Validation: Ensures generated code meets safety and execution standards; verify through simulation
- Modular Architecture Design: Allows LLM flexibility and system scalability; assess through component swapping experiments
- Energy-aware Algorithm Implementation: Critical for extended UAV operations; validate through mission duration testing

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Natural Language Input -> LLM Processing -> Code Generation -> ArduPilot Interface -> UAV Mission Execution

**Critical Path:**
1. User command reception and preprocessing
2. Structured prompt generation for LLM
3. Code generation and validation
4. ArduPilot mission upload and execution
5. Flight status monitoring and feedback

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- LLM selection balances reasoning accuracy vs. latency vs. computational requirements
- Natural language flexibility vs. structured command precision
- Open-source LLM integration vs. proprietary model performance
- Real-time response capability vs. thorough code validation

**Failure Signatures:**
- LLM misinterpretation of commands leading to invalid code generation
- Integration timing issues between LLM output and ArduPilot mission upload
- Natural language ambiguity causing execution errors
- Latency spikes during critical mission phases

**Three First Experiments:**
1. Basic waypoint navigation command testing with each LLM variant
2. Complex multi-step mission command execution validation
3. Error handling and recovery scenario testing with ambiguous inputs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation focused on code generation rather than comprehensive end-to-end mission execution validation
- Limited testing across diverse mission scenarios and environmental conditions
- Single case study provides proof-of-concept but lacks systematic verification across UAV mission types
- Natural language processing vulnerabilities may impact safety in critical flight operations

## Confidence
- High confidence: Framework architecture and LLM integration approach are technically sound and well-documented
- Medium confidence: Comparative LLM performance analysis within controlled testing environments
- Low confidence: Real-world mission execution reliability and safety in diverse operational conditions

## Next Checks
1. Conduct field trials across varied mission types (surveillance, delivery, search-and-rescue) in different environmental conditions to validate real-world performance and safety
2. Implement systematic stress testing with edge cases, ambiguous commands, and adversarial inputs to evaluate robustness of natural language interpretation
3. Perform comprehensive benchmarking against traditional script-based UAV control systems across metrics including mission completion rate, response time, and error frequency in multi-UAV scenarios
