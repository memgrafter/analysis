# Model management to support systems engineering workflows using ontology-based knowledge graphs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.09596
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09596
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Framework uses ontologies and knowledge graphs to manage engineering workflows, artifacts, and relationships, enabling versioning, querying, and reasoning while addressing traceability and repeatability challenges

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a framework for managing models and artifacts in systems engineering workflows through ontology-based knowledge graphs. The approach formally defines workflows, artifacts, and their relationships, enabling improved storage, versioning, and information access. The framework includes tools for designing workflows, enacting them, and storing artifacts, and was applied to a drivetrain smart sensor system case study.

## Method Summary
The framework leverages ontologies and knowledge graphs to formally represent system engineering workflows and their related artifacts. It provides tools for workflow design using BPMN notation, workflow enactment, and artifact storage with versioning capabilities. The system supports querying and reasoning over stored data through SPARQL and SHACL constraints, enabling traceability and repeatability in complex engineering workflows.

## Key Results
- Framework enables formal definition of workflows, artifacts, and relationships using ontologies and knowledge graphs
- Supports versioning, querying, and reasoning capabilities for stored engineering data
- Applied successfully to a drivetrain smart sensor system case study with improvements in storage, versioning, and information access

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by using ontologies as a formal specification language for engineering workflows and artifacts. Knowledge graphs store these relationships in a structured, queryable format. This enables automated reasoning about workflow dependencies, artifact relationships, and versioning information. The combination of formal semantics with graph-based storage allows for both human-readable workflow definitions and machine-processable artifact management.

## Foundational Learning
- **Ontologies**: Formal specifications of concepts and relationships needed to standardize workflow definitions across different engineering domains. Quick check: Can represent workflow steps, artifact types, and their relationships unambiguously.
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Graph-based data structures that store interconnected data with semantic meaning, enabling complex queries across workflow artifacts. Quick check: Support SPARQL queries and reasoning over workflow relationships.
- **BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation)**: Standardized graphical notation for specifying business processes and workflows, providing a common language for workflow design. Quick check: Enables clear communication between engineers and automated workflow enactment.
- **SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language)**: Language for validating RDF graph structures, ensuring stored artifacts conform to defined schemas. Quick check: Can enforce data quality constraints on stored engineering artifacts.
- **Protégé**: Ontology editor and framework for building knowledge-based systems, providing tools for ontology creation and management. Quick check: Supports collaborative ontology development and validation.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Workflow Designer -> Enactor -> Knowledge Graph Store -> Query/Reasoning Engine

**Critical Path**: Engineers design workflows in BPMN → workflows are enacted and artifacts generated → artifacts and relationships are stored in knowledge graph → stored data is queried and reasoned over for traceability and repeatability

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework prioritizes formal semantic representation and reasoning capabilities over simplicity, requiring engineers to learn ontology concepts and tools. This creates a steeper learning curve but enables more powerful querying and validation capabilities compared to traditional file-based approaches.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Inconsistent artifact relationships leading to broken traceability
- Performance degradation with large knowledge graphs
- Difficulty in workflow design due to complex ontology structures
- Validation failures when artifacts don't conform to SHACL constraints

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Model a simple linear workflow with 3-5 steps and basic artifacts to verify core functionality
2. Create conflicting artifact versions to test versioning and conflict resolution mechanisms
3. Execute complex queries across multiple workflow executions to validate reasoning capabilities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Lack of quantitative validation metrics for claimed improvements in storage, versioning, and information access
- No performance comparisons against baseline artifact management approaches
- Limited evidence of real-world adoption and user experience feedback

## Confidence
- Storage improvements: Medium (case study based, no quantitative metrics)
- Versioning capabilities: Medium (architecture described but not validated)
- Information access: Medium (benefits inferred from system design)
- Traceability and repeatability: Medium (claimed benefits not systematically tested)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct controlled experiments comparing workflow efficiency and error rates between the ontology-based system and traditional artifact management approaches across multiple engineering projects
2. Perform scalability testing with larger knowledge graphs and more complex workflows to identify performance bottlenecks
3. Execute a longitudinal study tracking how engineers actually use the system over time, measuring adoption rates and identifying usability pain points through user interviews and system logs
