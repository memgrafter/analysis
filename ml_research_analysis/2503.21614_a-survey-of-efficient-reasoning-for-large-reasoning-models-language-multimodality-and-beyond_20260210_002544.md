# A Survey of Efficient Reasoning for Large Reasoning Models: Language, Multimodality, and Beyond

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.21614
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21614
- Reference count: 40
- This survey comprehensively reviews efficient reasoning in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), addressing the challenge of excessive token generation during chain-of-thought reasoning.

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive examination of efficient reasoning techniques for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), focusing on the critical challenge of excessive token generation during chain-of-thought reasoning processes. The work systematically categorizes methods across the entire LRM lifecycle, from inference-time strategies to pretraining approaches, addressing the fundamental trade-off between reasoning depth and computational efficiency. By identifying key patterns of inefficiency and surveying current methodologies, the paper establishes a foundational framework for understanding how to optimize reasoning models while maintaining their reasoning capabilities. The survey covers both language-based and emerging multimodal reasoning scenarios, making it a valuable resource for researchers navigating this rapidly evolving field.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a comprehensive literature review methodology, systematically categorizing efficient reasoning approaches across multiple dimensions of the LRM lifecycle. It organizes methods into four main categories: inference-time strategies (length budgeting, system/model switching), supervised fine-tuning techniques (reasoning chain compression, latent-space training), reinforcement learning approaches (length-aware rewards), and pretraining methods (subquadratic attention, linearization). The work identifies three primary patterns of inefficiency in reasoning models: redundant content generation, overthinking simple problems, and incoherent reasoning traces. By analyzing these patterns alongside existing methodologies, the survey provides a structured framework for understanding the token economy of reasoning models and potential optimization strategies.

## Key Results
- LRMs face significant efficiency challenges due to excessive token generation during chain-of-thought reasoning, with inefficiency patterns including redundant content, overthinking, and incoherent reasoning
- The survey systematically categorizes efficient reasoning methods across the LRM lifecycle: inference-time strategies, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and pretraining approaches
- Key challenges include quantifying reasoning utility and controlling thinking length while maintaining performance, with future directions spanning multimodal reasoning, test-time scaling, and application-specific optimizations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Efficient reasoning methods work by addressing the fundamental trade-off between reasoning depth and computational efficiency in Large Reasoning Models. The mechanisms operate at multiple levels: inference-time strategies directly constrain token generation through length budgeting and adaptive stopping criteria, while training-based approaches modify the model's internal reasoning patterns through supervised fine-tuning with compressed chains or reinforcement learning with length-aware rewards. Pretraining methods tackle efficiency at the architectural level by redesigning attention mechanisms and token representations. These approaches collectively enable models to maintain reasoning quality while reducing computational overhead, addressing the core challenge that excessive token generation creates both economic and practical barriers to deploying reasoning models at scale.

## Foundational Learning
**Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**: Why needed - It's the fundamental reasoning paradigm that LRMs use, but generates excessive tokens; Quick check - Verify understanding of how CoT reasoning differs from direct answer generation.

**Token Economy**: Why needed - Central to understanding the efficiency challenge; Quick check - Calculate token generation rates for simple vs complex reasoning tasks.

**Length Budgeting**: Why needed - Core inference-time efficiency strategy; Quick check - Compare performance vs efficiency trade-offs at different budget thresholds.

**Reasoning Chain Compression**: Why needed - Key supervised fine-tuning technique; Quick check - Measure compression ratios and impact on reasoning quality.

**Length-Aware Rewards**: Why needed - Critical for RL-based efficiency optimization; Quick check - Design reward functions that balance reasoning quality and token efficiency.

**Subquadratic Attention**: Why needed - Architectural approach to efficiency; Quick check - Compare computational complexity of different attention mechanisms.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input -> Length Budgeting/Stopping Criteria -> Reasoning Generation -> Token Compression -> Output

**Critical Path**: Input → Reasoning Chain Generation → Length Control → Output, with efficiency optimizations applied at each stage

**Design Tradeoffs**: Depth vs efficiency (deeper reasoning vs token usage), quality vs speed (comprehensive reasoning vs quick responses), model complexity vs computational cost (sophisticated architectures vs simpler designs)

**Failure Signatures**: Overthinking simple problems (excessive tokens for easy tasks), incoherent reasoning traces (poor quality despite efficiency), catastrophic performance drops (excessive compression), token starvation (insufficient reasoning depth)

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Implement length budgeting with different threshold values and measure impact on reasoning quality across various task complexities
2. Test reasoning chain compression techniques on mathematical reasoning datasets to evaluate trade-offs
3. Compare subquadratic attention variants (linearized attention, local windows) on long-context reasoning tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Quantitative claims about token generation patterns and efficiency gains vary significantly across benchmarks and model architectures
- Treatment of multimodal reasoning efficiency is comparatively limited given its nascent state in the literature
- Practical impact assessments lack extensive empirical validation across diverse problem domains

## Confidence
- High: Structural organization and technical accuracy of described approaches
- Medium: Quantitative claims about token generation patterns and efficiency gains
- Low: Comprehensiveness of multimodal reasoning efficiency coverage

## Next Checks
1. Conduct empirical benchmarking across multiple LRMs to quantify actual token savings and performance impacts of surveyed efficiency methods on standardized reasoning tasks.

2. Systematically evaluate the effectiveness of reasoning chain compression techniques across different reasoning domains (mathematical, logical, commonsense) to identify domain-specific limitations.

3. Investigate the relationship between reasoning efficiency and model trustworthiness by testing whether efficiency optimizations compromise reasoning transparency or introduce hidden biases in decision-making processes.
