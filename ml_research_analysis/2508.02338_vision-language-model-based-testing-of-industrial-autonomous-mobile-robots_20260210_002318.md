# Vision Language Model-based Testing of Industrial Autonomous Mobile Robots

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.02338
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02338
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: RVSG uses VLMs to generate diverse human behaviors violating safety/functional requirements for AMR testing, outperforming baseline methods in simulation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces RVSG, a novel testing approach for industrial Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) that leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to generate diverse human behaviors that violate safety and functional requirements. The key innovation addresses the challenge of testing AMRs in unpredictable real-world environments by using multi-turn conversations with VLMs to create realistic test scenarios and human configurations, validated through simulation. The approach is evaluated on an AMR from PAL Robotics in a warehouse environment and demonstrates superior performance in generating effective requirement-violating scenarios compared to baseline methods.

## Method Summary
RVSG employs VLMs to simulate human behaviors that challenge AMR safety and functionality through iterative conversation-based scenario generation. The approach uses multi-turn dialogues with VLMs to create diverse test scenarios and human configurations, which are then validated in simulation environments. The method specifically targets the generation of requirement-violating scenarios that expose potential weaknesses in AMR navigation and safety systems. By leveraging the natural language understanding and generation capabilities of VLMs, RVSG can create complex, realistic scenarios that traditional testing methods might miss.

## Key Results
- RVSG generates diverse human behaviors that effectively violate safety and functional requirements in AMR testing
- The approach outperforms baseline methods in creating requirement-violating scenarios in warehouse simulation
- Navigation route variations significantly impact scenario performance and stability, revealing system uncertainties

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
RVSG works by leveraging VLMs' natural language understanding to simulate complex human behaviors that challenge AMR systems. The multi-turn conversation approach allows for iterative refinement of test scenarios, creating increasingly sophisticated violations of safety requirements. VLMs can understand and generate contextually appropriate human behaviors that traditional scripted testing might miss, enabling more comprehensive coverage of edge cases and failure modes.

## Foundational Learning
- **Vision Language Models (VLMs)**: AI models that understand both visual inputs and natural language, crucial for interpreting and generating human behaviors in AMR contexts. Quick check: Verify VLM can process both image and text inputs simultaneously.
- **Multi-turn conversational AI**: Iterative dialogue systems that refine outputs through multiple exchanges, essential for developing complex test scenarios. Quick check: Ensure system maintains context across conversation turns.
- **Simulation-based validation**: Using virtual environments to test real-world systems before deployment, critical for safe AMR testing. Quick check: Validate simulation accurately reflects real-world physics and constraints.
- **Requirement-violating scenario generation**: Creating test cases specifically designed to break system constraints, necessary for robust safety testing. Quick check: Confirm generated scenarios actually violate specified requirements.
- **Human behavior modeling**: Simulating realistic human actions and movements around AMRs, vital for testing safety systems. Quick check: Validate human movement patterns follow realistic physics and social norms.
- **Navigation route analysis**: Studying how different paths affect AMR performance, important for understanding system limitations. Quick check: Compare route variations across multiple test runs.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: VLM Conversation Interface -> Scenario Generator -> Simulation Environment -> AMR Controller -> Performance Evaluator

**Critical Path**: The core testing loop flows from VLM-generated human behaviors through the simulation environment to the AMR controller, with performance metrics fed back to refine subsequent VLM prompts.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach balances between computational cost of VLM processing and the diversity of generated scenarios. Using simulation rather than real-world testing provides safety and repeatability but may miss some real-world complexities.

**Failure Signatures**: Common failure modes include VLM generating physically impossible human behaviors, simulation inaccuracies leading to false positives/negatives, and AMR controllers failing to handle novel scenarios appropriately.

**First Experiments**:
1. Run baseline VLM conversations without AMR to validate human behavior generation quality
2. Test single scenario in simulation to verify integration between components
3. Compare scenario generation speed and diversity across different VLM models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Validation limited to single AMR model from PAL Robotics in warehouse environment, raising questions about generalizability
- Lack of clarity on specific baseline method used for comparison makes performance assessment difficult
- Reliance on simulation for validation raises concerns about real-world applicability and effectiveness

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: RVSG generates diverse human behaviors violating safety and functional requirements, supported by methodology and simulation results.

**Medium Confidence**: RVSG outperforms baseline methods, though baseline definition and evaluation metrics lack clarity.

**Low Confidence**: Claims of cost-effectiveness and scalability lack real-world validation and cost analysis.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct real-world testing of RVSG on multiple AMR platforms and in diverse environments to validate generalizability and robustness.

2. Define and disclose the baseline method and evaluation metrics used for comparison to provide clearer understanding of RVSG's performance advantages.

3. Perform cost-benefit analysis comparing RVSG to traditional testing methods to substantiate claims of cost-effectiveness and scalability.
