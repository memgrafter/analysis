# F-BFQ: Flexible Block Floating-Point Quantization Accelerator for LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.13401
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13401
- Authors: Jude Haris; José Cano
- Reference count: 31
- Primary result: 1.4× speedup over ARM NEON CPU for LLM inference on AMD Kria KV260 FPGA

## Executive Summary
This paper presents F-BFQ, a flexible hardware accelerator for large language model inference that leverages block floating-point (BFP) quantization to improve efficiency on resource-constrained edge devices. The key innovation is a Dynamic Super-Block Processor that can process two different BFP quantization variants (Q2_K and Q3_K) concurrently without reconfiguration, enabling efficient matrix multiplication across different LLM layers. The accelerator was evaluated on the AMD Kria KV260 FPGA board with three LLM models (GPT2, MobileLLaMA, and TinyLlama), achieving an average 1.4× speedup over ARM NEON CPU while maintaining 5.2 tokens per second throughput.

## Method Summary
F-BFQ addresses the challenge of accelerating LLM inference on edge devices by implementing a flexible BFP quantization accelerator. The approach uses block floating-point quantization to reduce numerical precision while maintaining accuracy, and introduces a novel Dynamic Super-Block Processor that can handle two BFP variants (Q2_K and Q3_K) simultaneously. This design eliminates the need for reconfiguration when switching between quantization schemes across different model layers. The accelerator focuses on optimizing matrix multiplication operations, which are the computational bottleneck in transformer-based LLMs. The implementation was prototyped on the AMD Kria KV260 FPGA platform and evaluated with three quantized LLM models.

## Key Results
- Achieved 1.4× average speedup compared to ARM NEON CPU execution
- Delivered 5.2 tokens per second throughput on evaluated models
- Successfully processed both Q2_K and Q3_K BFP quantization variants without reconfiguration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Dynamic Super-Block Processor is the core mechanism enabling F-BFQ's flexibility. By processing both Q2_K and Q3_K BFP variants concurrently, the accelerator eliminates the overhead associated with reconfiguring hardware when switching between quantization schemes across different LLM layers. This concurrent processing approach maximizes hardware utilization while maintaining the benefits of reduced precision through BFP quantization. The block floating-point representation allows for efficient use of limited hardware resources while preserving sufficient numerical accuracy for language modeling tasks.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Block Floating-Point (BFP) Quantization**
   - Why needed: Reduces numerical precision requirements while maintaining accuracy for neural network inference
   - Quick check: Verify that BFP maintains acceptable accuracy compared to full precision for the target models

2. **Dynamic Super-Block Processing**
   - Why needed: Enables hardware to handle multiple quantization variants without reconfiguration overhead
   - Quick check: Confirm that concurrent processing of Q2_K and Q3_K doesn't introduce timing conflicts

3. **Matrix Multiplication Acceleration**
   - Why needed: Matrix multiplication is the primary computational bottleneck in transformer models
   - Quick check: Validate that optimized matrix multiplication kernels provide expected performance gains

4. **FPGA-based Acceleration**
   - Why needed: FPGAs provide flexibility to implement custom quantization schemes and processing architectures
   - Quick check: Ensure FPGA resource utilization remains within available limits

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Data -> Dynamic Super-Block Processor -> Matrix Multiplication Units -> Output Data

**Critical Path**: The Dynamic Super-Block Processor represents the critical path as it handles the concurrent processing of both quantization variants. Any bottleneck in this component directly impacts overall throughput.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The primary tradeoff involves flexibility versus resource utilization. Supporting both Q2_K and Q3_K variants simultaneously requires additional hardware resources but eliminates reconfiguration overhead. The design prioritizes runtime flexibility over maximum resource efficiency.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation may occur if the concurrent processing of both variants creates resource contention. Accuracy loss could indicate issues with the BFP quantization implementation or improper handling of numerical precision across different model layers.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Verify correct operation of the Dynamic Super-Block Processor with synthetic data streams representing both Q2_K and Q3_K formats
2. Benchmark matrix multiplication performance with individual quantization variants before testing concurrent operation
3. Measure resource utilization (LUTs, DSPs, BRAM) on the target FPGA to ensure the design fits within available resources

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to AMD Kria KV260 FPGA platform, limiting generalizability
- Performance claims focus on matrix multiplication kernels without comprehensive end-to-end inference measurements
- Evaluation covers only three relatively small LLM models (GPT2, MobileLLaMA, TinyLlama)
- Token generation rate of 5.2 tokens/second may be insufficient for practical applications

## Confidence
High - The BFP quantization methodology and flexible hardware design principles are sound and well-explained
Medium - The speedup over ARM NEON is demonstrated but evaluation scope is limited
Low - The work appears to be a prototype demonstration rather than production-ready solution

## Next Checks
1. Measure full end-to-end inference latency across all transformer layers for the evaluated models, not just matrix multiplication kernels
2. Evaluate resource utilization (LUTs, DSPs, BRAM) and power consumption of the F-BFQ implementation on the target FPGA
3. Test the accelerator on additional LLM architectures and larger model variants to assess scalability and robustness across diverse workloads
