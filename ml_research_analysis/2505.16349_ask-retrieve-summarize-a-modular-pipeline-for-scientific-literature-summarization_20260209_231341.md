core_contribution: XSum introduces a modular pipeline for multi-document summarization
  in scientific literature using retrieval-augmented generation. It addresses the
  challenge of synthesizing knowledge from multiple sources by incorporating a question-generation
  module that dynamically creates queries from paper titles and abstracts, and an

# Ask, Retrieve, Summarize: A Modular Pipeline for Scientific Literature Summarization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.16349
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16349
- Authors: Pierre Achkar; Tim Gollub; Martin Potthast
- Reference count: 37
- XSum achieves ROUGE-1 of 0.51, BERTScore of 0.62, Ref-F1 of 0.76, G-Eval of 4.2, and CheckEval of 0.97 on SurveySum dataset

## Executive Summary
XSum introduces a modular pipeline for multi-document summarization in scientific literature using retrieval-augmented generation. The system addresses the challenge of synthesizing knowledge from multiple sources by incorporating a question-generation module that dynamically creates queries from paper titles and abstracts, and an editor module that synthesizes retrieved answers into coherent, citation-rich summaries. Evaluated on the SurveySum dataset, XSum demonstrates significant improvements over existing approaches in producing high-quality, academically sound summaries.

## Method Summary
XSum employs a three-stage modular architecture: question generation, retrieval-augmented generation, and editing. The system first generates context-specific questions from paper titles and abstracts, then retrieves relevant information from a scientific corpus using these questions, and finally synthesizes the retrieved content into coherent summaries with proper citations. This approach leverages the strengths of retrieval-augmented generation while addressing the challenge of producing structured, citation-rich summaries in scientific domains.

## Key Results
- XSum achieves ROUGE-1 score of 0.51, BERTScore of 0.62, Ref-F1 of 0.76, G-Eval of 4.2, and CheckEval of 0.97 on SurveySum dataset
- Outperforms existing approaches in multi-document scientific literature summarization
- Demonstrates effectiveness in producing coherent, citation-rich summaries

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The modular pipeline approach works by decomposing the complex task of scientific summarization into manageable subtasks. Question generation creates focused queries that capture the essential information needs, retrieval fetches relevant content from a broad scientific corpus, and the editing module synthesizes this information into coherent summaries while maintaining proper citation structure. This decomposition allows each module to specialize in its task, leading to better overall performance compared to monolithic approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- Multi-document summarization: Why needed - to synthesize knowledge from multiple sources; Quick check - can the system produce coherent summaries from 5+ papers
- Retrieval-augmented generation: Why needed - to ground summaries in verifiable sources; Quick check - does the system cite retrieved papers correctly
- Modular architecture design: Why needed - to specialize each component for its task; Quick check - can modules be individually evaluated and improved

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Question Generation -> Retrieval -> Editing

**Critical Path**: Title/Abstract -> Question Generation -> Retrieval Query -> Retrieved Content -> Summary Generation -> Edited Summary

**Design Tradeoffs**: The modular approach sacrifices end-to-end optimization for specialized component performance, but gains interpretability and easier debugging compared to monolithic architectures.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor question generation leads to irrelevant retrievals, inadequate editing results in incoherent summaries, and weak retrieval produces summaries lacking proper citations or scientific accuracy.

**First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate question generation quality using human judgment on query relevance
2. Test retrieval precision and recall on held-out scientific documents
3. Assess summary coherence and citation accuracy through expert review

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided in the source material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to computer science domain on SurveySum dataset
- Reliance on predefined templates may not capture nuanced semantic relationships in diverse scientific literature
- Automated metrics may not fully capture citation quality and relevance

## Confidence
High confidence in reported performance metrics on SurveySum dataset using established benchmarks. Medium confidence in modular architecture's effectiveness for multi-document summarization within evaluated scope. Low confidence in generalization claims to non-computer science domains and citation quality assertions.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate XSum on cross-disciplinary scientific literature to assess domain generalization capabilities
2. Conduct human evaluation studies focusing specifically on citation accuracy and relevance in generated summaries
3. Perform ablation studies to determine individual contribution of each module (question generation, retrieval, and editing) to overall performance
