# RankArena: A Unified Platform for Evaluating Retrieval, Reranking and RAG with Human and LLM Feedback

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.05512
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05512
- Reference count: 40
- Supports 84 reranker models, 5 retrievers, and provides unified evaluation with human and LLM feedback

## Executive Summary
RankArena is a unified evaluation platform designed to assess retrieval, reranking, and RAG systems using both human and LLM-based feedback. The platform addresses the challenge of scalable, user-centric evaluation by offering five complementary evaluation modes: pairwise battles, direct reranker inspection, manual annotation, LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, and end-to-end RAG assessment. It provides structured prompts for LLM judgment and supports a comprehensive set of 84 reranker models and 5 retrievers, enabling holistic performance evaluation across multiple dimensions.

## Method Summary
RankArena implements a multi-modal evaluation framework that combines human expertise with LLM-based judgment capabilities. The platform integrates five distinct evaluation modes to capture diverse feedback signals for training rerankers, reward models, and retrieval agents. Evaluations were conducted on NVIDIA A40 GPUs, demonstrating the platform's capability to handle computationally intensive ranking and retrieval tasks. The system captures feedback through pairwise battles between models, direct inspection of reranker outputs, manual annotation workflows, LLM-based judgments using structured prompts, and comprehensive RAG system assessment.

## Key Results
- Achieved an average BEIR score of 52.8 for the best method (twolar)
- Human-LLM agreement reached 74.2% overall
- Strong correlations between BEIR benchmarks (0.7 to 0.9)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The platform's effectiveness stems from its unified approach that combines multiple evaluation perspectives. By integrating human judgment with LLM feedback, RankArena captures both subjective quality assessments and objective performance metrics. The five evaluation modes provide complementary views of system performance, while the structured prompts for LLM judgment ensure consistency in automated evaluations. The support for 84 reranker models and 5 retrievers enables comprehensive benchmarking across different architectures and approaches.

## Foundational Learning
- **BEIR benchmarks**: Essential for standardized retrieval evaluation across diverse datasets; quick check: verify benchmark coverage matches target use cases
- **LLM-as-a-judge methodology**: Provides scalable automated evaluation; quick check: validate prompt design and output consistency
- **Pairwise comparison**: Captures relative performance differences; quick check: ensure balanced comparison sampling
- **Reranker diversity**: Enables comprehensive architecture evaluation; quick check: verify model compatibility and performance ranges
- **Multi-modal feedback integration**: Combines subjective and objective evaluation signals; quick check: assess feedback correlation and redundancy

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: User Interface -> Evaluation Engine -> Model Repository -> Feedback Collection -> Result Analysis
Critical path: User submits evaluation request → Platform selects models → Executes pairwise comparisons → Collects feedback → Generates comprehensive report
Design tradeoffs: Balance between evaluation comprehensiveness and computational efficiency; between automated and human evaluation; between model diversity and depth of analysis
Failure signatures: Low human-LLM agreement indicating potential bias or poor prompt design; high benchmark correlation suggesting evaluation redundancy; computational bottlenecks during large-scale evaluations
First experiments: 1) Run single pairwise comparison to verify basic functionality, 2) Execute LLM-only evaluation with sample dataset, 3) Perform end-to-end RAG assessment with minimal configuration

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- Limited diversity of evaluated models (only 84 rerankers and 5 retrievers)
- Strong correlation between BEIR benchmarks (0.7 to 0.9) may indicate evaluation redundancy
- Human-LLM agreement rate of 74.2% suggests notable disagreement affecting reliability

## Confidence
- High confidence in technical implementation and platform availability
- Medium confidence in scalability claims
- Medium confidence in evaluation results due to limited model diversity and benchmark correlation issues

## Next Checks
1. Test RankArena with a broader set of retriever and reranker models, particularly newer or specialized models not included in the current 84+5 evaluation set
2. Conduct cross-validation using different LLM judgment prompts to assess the stability of human-LLM agreement rates
3. Perform ablation studies on the BEIR benchmark correlations to identify potential redundancy and validate the diversity of evaluation metrics
