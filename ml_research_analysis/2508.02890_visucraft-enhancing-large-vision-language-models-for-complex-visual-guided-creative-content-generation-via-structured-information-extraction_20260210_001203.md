# VisuCraft: Enhancing Large Vision-Language Models for Complex Visual-Guided Creative Content Generation via Structured Information Extraction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.02890
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02890
- **Reference count:** 35
- **Key outcome:** VisuCraft achieves Visual Grounding scores of 0.825 (story) and 0.810 (poetry), Creativity scores of 0.810 (story) and 0.805 (poetry), and Instruction Adherence scores of 0.830 (story) and 0.815 (poetry) on ImageStoryGen-500K, outperforming baseline LVLMs.

## Executive Summary
VisuCraft addresses the challenge of enhancing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for complex creative tasks like story and poetry generation guided by images. The framework introduces a two-module pipeline: a Multimodal Structured Information Extractor (E) that converts images into rich, structured visual representations, and a Dynamic Prompt Generation Module (G) that integrates these visual details with user instructions to create optimized prompts. Evaluated on a self-constructed dataset with custom VisuGen Metrics, VisuCraft demonstrates significant improvements over baseline LVLMs in visual grounding, creativity, and instruction adherence.

## Method Summary
VisuCraft enhances LVLMs through a modular approach that avoids retraining the underlying models. The Multimodal Structured Information Extractor (E) fine-tunes a vision-language model to output structured JSON representations of images, capturing objects, attributes, spatial relationships, lighting, and emotional atmosphere. The Dynamic Prompt Generation Module (G) then fine-tunes a smaller language model to combine this structured visual information with user instructions into optimized prompts. The pipeline processes images through E, merges the output with instructions via G, and feeds the resulting prompt to a frozen LVLM (e.g., LLaVA, InstructBLIP) for final creative text generation.

## Key Results
- VisuCraft achieves Visual Grounding scores of 0.825 (story) and 0.810 (poetry), outperforming baseline LVLMs by 0.044 and 0.039 points respectively.
- Creativity scores reach 0.810 (story) and 0.805 (poetry), showing gains of 0.041 and 0.035 points over baselines.
- Instruction Adherence scores are 0.830 (story) and 0.815 (poetry), improving by 0.030 and 0.025 points compared to baseline models.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Structured Visual Representation Enables Precise Grounding
Fine-grained, structured visual representations improve LVLM visual grounding and creative synthesis compared to generic captions or flat embeddings. The Multimodal Structured Information Extractor (E) transforms raw images into explicit, machine-readable structures (objects, poses, materials, lighting, spatial relationships, emotional atmospheres). This explicitness reduces ambiguity in downstream generation. The core assumption is that LVLMs underperform on creative tasks partly because visual features lack interpretable structure, not solely due to model capacity limitations. Evidence shows that mitigating LVLM hallucinations through visual-language alignment supports this mechanism. Break condition: If base LVLM already receives adequately structured visual inputs, or images lack salient fine-grained details, E's marginal benefit diminishes.

### Mechanism 2: Dynamic Prompt Engineering Improves Instruction Adherence
Context-aware prompt construction yields higher instruction adherence than simple template concatenation. The Dynamic Prompt Generation Module (G) weaves structured visual info with user instructions, emphasizes task-relevant elements (e.g., atmosphere for poetry, character pose for stories), and injects constraints (style, length, tone). This shapes the LVLM's generation trajectory. The core assumption is that prompt structure—not just content—significantly influences LVLM behavior on nuanced creative tasks. Evidence anchors show that structured recombination improves creative output, aligning with G's integration logic. Break condition: When user instructions are already maximally explicit and detailed, G's enhancement layer adds overhead without proportional gain.

### Mechanism 3: Granularity of Visual Detail Correlates with Creative Quality
Increasing structured information granularity (objects → attributes → relationships → atmospheres) monotonically improves creative generation quality. Richer visual context provides more raw material for LVLMs to synthesize novel combinations. Depth of grounding enables more specific, less generic outputs. The core assumption is that creativity in LVLMs benefits from explicit, diverse visual building blocks rather than implicit latent representations alone. Evidence from Table III shows mean score increases from 0.769 (Level 1: Basic Objects) → 0.800 (Level 2: Objects + Attributes) → 0.822 (Level 3: Full Structured Info). Break condition: Diminishing returns beyond task-relevant detail; excessive granularity may introduce noise or distraction.

## Foundational Learning

- **Structured vs. Unstructured Multimodal Representations**
  - **Why needed here:** VisuCraft's core innovation is converting unstructured image pixels into structured, interpretable representations. Understanding scene graphs, attribute schemas, and spatial encodings is prerequisite.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why a scene graph representation might improve story generation compared to a single caption sentence?

- **Prompt Engineering for LLMs**
  - **Why needed here:** Module G performs sophisticated prompt construction. Understanding prompt design patterns (role prompts, constraint injection, task decomposition) is essential.
  - **Quick check question:** What happens to LLM output quality when a prompt shifts from "Write a story about this image" to "Write a melancholic 200-word story about isolation using only sea metaphors, referencing the lighthouse's flickering beam"?

- **Vision-Language Model Grounding**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper's Visual Grounding metric assesses text-image correspondence. Understanding how LVLMs align visual and textual spaces informs why structured extraction helps.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might an LVLM generate text that mentions objects not present in the image, and how does structured extraction mitigate this?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Image (I) → [E: Structured Information Extractor] → Structured Visual Info (V)
           ↘                                            ↓
             User Instruction (U) → [G: Dynamic Prompt Generator] → Optimized Prompt (P)
                                                                      ↓
                                                        [M: Pre-trained LVLM (LLaVA/InstructBLIP)]
                                                                      ↓
                                                        Creative Text Output (T)

- **Critical path:**
  1. E's extraction quality determines available visual building blocks
  2. G's integration logic determines how well visual + instruction signals combine
  3. M's capacity determines final creative ceiling (but VisuCraft does NOT retrain M)

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **Granularity vs. Noise:** More detail isn't always better—task-irrelevant attributes may distract
  - **Dynamic vs. Template Prompting:** G adds complexity but ablation shows 0.811 → 0.822 Mean gain
  - **Modularity vs. End-to-End:** VisuCraft is adapter-style; faster iteration but potentially suboptimal vs. joint training

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **E failure:** Generic or missing attributes → outputs resemble LVLM-Base (Mean ~0.78)
  - **G failure:** Simple concatenation → instruction adherence drops (IA. from 0.830 → 0.820)
  - **M mismatch:** If base LVLM lacks creative priors, even optimized prompts yield limited novelty

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Ablate E:** Replace structured extractor with standard CLIP encoder; expect VG. drop (per Table II: 0.825 → 0.801)
  2. **Ablate G:** Replace dynamic prompting with template concatenation; expect C. and IA. drop (Table II: Mean 0.822 → 0.811)
  3. **Granularity sweep:** Run E at Levels 1, 2, 3 on held-out images; verify monotonic quality increase (Table III pattern)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can the VisuCraft framework be effectively extended to handle temporal modalities like video or non-visual modalities like audio for creative generation? The paper plans to explore integration with video or audio for richer multimodal creative generation, but the current architecture focuses on static images and spatial attributes.

- **Open Question 2:** How does the computational latency of VisuCraft's sequential pipeline (Extraction → Prompt Generation → Generation) impact its viability for real-time applications? The framework introduces two preprocessing stages before LVLM generation, potentially rendering it too slow for interactive real-time use cases compared to standard LVLMs.

- **Open Question 3:** Can the Extractor (E) and Prompt Generation (G) modules utilize adaptive learning to perform automatic style transfer and domain adaptation? Further research into adaptive learning mechanisms for E and G could allow for automatic style transfer and domain adaptation, though currently E is trained on specific datasets and may not generalize without manual fine-tuning.

- **Open Question 4:** To what extent does the "ground truth" bias in the self-constructed ImageStoryGen-500K dataset influence the VisuGen metric scores? Reliance on a custom dataset and metrics raises questions about whether the model is overfitting to specific evaluation criteria compared to established standards.

## Limitations

- The VisuGen Metrics evaluation methodology is self-constructed and not externally validated, raising concerns about potential metric inflation or bias toward VisuCraft's specific design choices.
- The ImageStoryGen-500K dataset is self-constructed without public release, limiting reproducibility and independent verification of results.
- The claim of "model-agnostic" integration lacks empirical validation across diverse LVLM architectures beyond the two tested (LLaVA, InstructBLIP).

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The structured information extraction mechanism's theoretical benefits and the observed correlation between granularity and creative quality (supported by Table III's monotonic pattern).
- **Medium confidence:** The Dynamic Prompt Generation module's effectiveness, as the 0.011 Mean score improvement (0.811→0.822) is modest and could be sensitive to implementation details not specified in the paper.
- **Low confidence:** The overall claim of "significant" improvement over baselines, given the self-reported metrics, lack of comparison to established benchmarks, and absence of human evaluation data.

## Next Checks

1. **External benchmark validation:** Reimplement VisuCraft and evaluate on established vision-language creative datasets (e.g., COCO Image Captioning, VIST for visual storytelling) using standard metrics (CIDEr, SPICE, human evaluation) to verify the claimed improvements.

2. **Ablation study with alternative LVLMs:** Test VisuCraft with additional LVLM architectures (e.g., BLIP-2, Flamingo) to confirm true model-agnostic performance and identify architecture-specific limitations.

3. **VisuGen Metrics external validation:** Commission independent human evaluation on a subset of VisuCraft outputs to verify alignment between automated VisuGen scores and human judgments of visual grounding, creativity, and instruction adherence.
