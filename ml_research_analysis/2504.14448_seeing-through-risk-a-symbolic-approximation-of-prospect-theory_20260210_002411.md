# Seeing Through Risk: A Symbolic Approximation of Prospect Theory

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.14448
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14448
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: Symbolic modeling framework achieves 79.8% accuracy and 0.827 AUC on synthetic data, outperforming both black-box logistic baseline and parametric CPT model

## Executive Summary
This study presents a symbolic modeling framework that approximates Prospect Theory using interpretable features and logistic regression, deliberately avoiding complex nonlinear utility and probability weighting functions. The approach selects features based on effect size to retain only behaviorally relevant predictors, creating a transparent model that captures key decision-making phenomena. The symbolic model demonstrates strong empirical performance on synthetic data while maintaining interpretability, addressing a fundamental tension in behavioral economics between model accuracy and cognitive transparency.

## Method Summary
The symbolic approximation framework replaces traditional parametric utility and probability weighting functions with interpretable features selected through effect size analysis. Rather than modeling prospect theory through complex nonlinear transformations, the approach identifies and retains only the most behaviorally relevant predictors. This creates a logistic regression model that approximates prospect theory predictions while maintaining complete transparency about decision-making processes. The framework is evaluated against both a black-box logistic baseline and a parametric cumulative prospect theory model using synthetic data generated from established parametric models.

## Key Results
- Symbolic model achieves 79.8% accuracy and 0.827 AUC on synthetic data
- Outperforms black-box logistic baseline (75.7%, 0.797 AUC) and parametric CPT model (49.0%, 0.627 AUC)
- Successfully reproduces key prospect theory phenomena including the reflection effect
- Maintains interpretability while achieving competitive or superior predictive performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The symbolic approximation works by replacing complex parametric functions with interpretable features that capture the same behavioral effects. By selecting features based on effect size, the model retains only those variables that have substantial impact on decision-making, eliminating noise and irrelevant complexity. This approach leverages the insight that prospect theory's core predictions can be captured through linear combinations of carefully chosen features rather than through nonlinear transformations of outcomes and probabilities. The logistic regression framework provides both computational efficiency and complete transparency about how each feature contributes to predictions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Prospect Theory**: Behavioral economic framework describing how people make decisions under risk, characterized by loss aversion and probability weighting. Understanding PT is essential for grasping what phenomena the symbolic model aims to capture and why traditional parametric approaches are complex.
- **Feature Selection via Effect Size**: Statistical approach to identifying which variables have meaningful impact on outcomes. This concept is crucial because the symbolic model's performance depends entirely on selecting the right subset of interpretable features.
- **Logistic Regression vs. Parametric Models**: Comparison of linear probability models with nonlinear utility functions. Understanding this distinction explains why the symbolic approach can maintain interpretability while achieving competitive accuracy.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Prospect Theory phenomena -> Feature selection (effect size threshold) -> Interpretable features -> Logistic regression -> Predictions
- **Critical Path**: Feature selection and construction are the critical path since model performance depends entirely on choosing the right interpretable predictors that capture behavioral effects
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Interpretability vs. accuracy (symbolic sacrifices some parametric precision for transparency), simplicity vs. completeness (may miss nuanced nonlinear effects), computational efficiency vs. model richness
- **Failure Signatures**: Poor feature selection leading to underfitting, missing nonlinear interactions that parametric models capture, threshold sensitivity causing unstable feature sets
- **First Experiments**: 1) Test different effect size thresholds to find optimal feature selection, 2) Validate on empirical human choice data rather than synthetic, 3) Compare against additional PT estimation methods including rank-dependent utility

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided in the source material.

## Limitations
- Heavy reliance on effect size threshold selection, which could substantially impact model performance and generalizability
- Use of synthetic data generated from parametric models raises questions about real-world applicability to actual human decision-making data
- Limited comparison scope with only one black-box baseline and one parametric CPT model, excluding other established PT estimation methods

## Confidence
High: The symbolic modeling framework is demonstrably interpretable and achieves strong performance metrics on synthetic data. The claim that feature selection based on effect size improves interpretability while maintaining predictive accuracy is well-supported by the empirical results.

Medium: The assertion that the symbolic model "outperforms" parametric CPT models may be context-dependent given the limited comparison scope. The claim about reproducing key PT phenomena like the reflection effect requires validation on more diverse datasets beyond the synthetic generation process.

Low: Extrapolation to AI safety and economic policy applications appears premature without validation on real-world behavioral datasets or demonstration of robustness to distributional shifts.

## Next Checks
1. Test the symbolic model on empirical human choice data from established prospect theory experiments (e.g., Kahneman & Tversky's original gambles) to assess real-world validity
2. Conduct cross-validation with varying effect size thresholds to establish sensitivity and identify optimal feature selection parameters
3. Compare against additional PT estimation approaches including rank-dependent utility and cumulative prospect theory models using standardized benchmark datasets
