# Precision Autotuning for Linear Solvers via Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.00728
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00728
- Reference count: 39
- Primary result: First RL-based precision autotuning framework for iterative refinement, achieving reduced computational cost while maintaining accuracy comparable to double-precision baselines.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning framework for adaptive precision tuning in linear solvers, specifically targeting iterative refinement for solving systems of linear equations Ax = b. The approach formulates precision selection as a contextual bandit problem, where the agent dynamically chooses precision configurations for computational steps based on problem features. The framework uses a Q-table mapping discretized features (such as approximate condition number and matrix norm) to precision actions, optimized via an epsilon-greedy strategy to maximize a multi-objective reward balancing accuracy and computational cost. The empirical results demonstrate effective precision selection that reduces computational cost while maintaining accuracy comparable to double-precision baselines, with generalization to out-of-sample data.

## Method Summary
The framework models precision tuning as a contextual bandit problem where at each iteration, the agent observes discretized features of the current problem state (approximate condition number, matrix norm) and selects precision configurations for computational steps. A Q-table maps these features to actions representing chosen precision levels, learned through epsilon-greedy exploration to maximize a reward balancing accuracy and computational efficiency. Applied to iterative refinement for linear systems Ax = b, the approach dynamically adjusts precision during refinement steps rather than using fixed precision throughout. The reward function explicitly trades off solution accuracy against computational cost, enabling the agent to find optimal precision configurations that minimize work while maintaining required accuracy.

## Key Results
- Achieved computational cost reduction while maintaining accuracy comparable to double-precision baselines
- Demonstrated effective precision selection through empirical evaluation on test datasets
- Showed generalization capability to out-of-sample data beyond training distribution
- First application of reinforcement learning to precision autotuning in numerical linear algebra

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by framing precision selection as a sequential decision problem where each choice impacts both computational cost and solution quality. The contextual bandit formulation allows the agent to learn correlations between problem features (condition number, matrix norm) and optimal precision choices. By explicitly balancing accuracy and cost in the reward function, the framework discovers precision configurations that minimize work while maintaining solution quality. The epsilon-greedy exploration strategy ensures sufficient coverage of the feature-action space while exploiting learned patterns, enabling robust performance across diverse problem instances.

## Foundational Learning
- **Contextual bandit problems**: Framework formulation as a contextual bandit enables learning of feature-action mappings without full Markov decision process complexity; quick check: verify bandit assumptions hold (single-step reward feedback, no state transitions).
- **Iterative refinement**: Understanding of this numerical method is essential as the target application; quick check: confirm iterative refinement convergence properties for test problems.
- **Mixed-precision arithmetic**: Core concept enabling computational efficiency gains; quick check: verify hardware/software support for required precision levels.
- **Q-learning with epsilon-greedy exploration**: Standard RL technique for balancing exploration and exploitation; quick check: monitor exploration rate decay and convergence behavior.
- **Multi-objective optimization**: Reward design balancing accuracy and computational cost; quick check: sensitivity analysis of reward weighting parameters.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Problem features → Discretization → Q-table lookup → Precision action → Computational step → Accuracy/cost evaluation → Reward → Q-table update

**Critical path**: Feature extraction → Q-table action selection → Precision execution → Result evaluation → Reward computation → Q-table update

**Design tradeoffs**: Discretized features simplify Q-table management but may lose precision sensitivity; epsilon-greedy balances exploration vs exploitation but requires tuning; multi-objective reward adds complexity but enables cost-aware optimization.

**Failure signatures**: Poor accuracy indicates inadequate feature representation or reward weighting; excessive computational cost suggests insufficient exploration or inappropriate reward scaling; lack of generalization indicates overfitting to training distribution.

**3 first experiments**:
1. Baseline comparison: Run iterative refinement with fixed double precision to establish reference accuracy and cost
2. Feature sensitivity: Test Q-table performance with varying discretization granularity of problem features
3. Reward sensitivity: Evaluate impact of different accuracy-cost weightings in the reward function

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Discretized features may limit fine-grained precision tuning decisions and representational capacity
- Focus on iterative refinement raises questions about generalization to other numerical algorithms and problem domains
- Multi-objective reward function design complexity could impact learned policy effectiveness
- Limited comparison with alternative autotuning methods or broader benchmark suites

## Confidence

**High**: The RL framework formulation as a contextual bandit problem and its application to precision tuning in iterative refinement is well-established and clearly presented.

**Medium**: The effectiveness of the epsilon-greedy strategy for Q-table optimization and the generalizability to out-of-sample data are supported by empirical results, but further validation is needed.

**Low**: The broader applicability of the framework to other numerical algorithms and the impact of discretized features on precision tuning decisions are not fully explored.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the framework on a wider range of numerical algorithms beyond iterative refinement to assess generalizability
2. Compare the proposed RL-based autotuning approach with alternative methods (e.g., heuristic-based or analytical approaches) to establish relative performance
3. Investigate the impact of using continuous feature representations instead of discretized features on the precision tuning decisions and overall performance
