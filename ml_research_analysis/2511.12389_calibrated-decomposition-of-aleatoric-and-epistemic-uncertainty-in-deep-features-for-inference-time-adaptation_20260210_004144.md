## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of conflating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in deep visual inference systems. The framework disentangles these uncertainty modes using global feature density deviation for aleatoric uncertainty and three local geometric statistics for epistemic uncertainty, all computed directly in semantic feature space without sampling or ensembling. The method applies distribution-free conformal calibration to produce prediction intervals with finite coverage, then uses the decomposed uncertainty signals to guide adaptive model selection at inference time.

## Method Summary
The framework extracts 256D features from a frozen encoder for each detection, then computes aleatoric uncertainty via Mahalanobis distance from global feature density (with trace-regularized covariance). Epistemic uncertainty is formed from three complementary components: support deficiency (kNN-based), spectral collapse (effective rank), and cross-layer inconsistency (cosine divergence). These components are weighted and combined, with weights optimized to minimize correlation with aleatoric uncertainty. Distribution-free conformal calibration produces prediction intervals, and an RL controller (or threshold policy) uses the decomposed uncertainties to select appropriate model capacity at inference time.

## Key Results
- Achieves approximately 60% computational savings on MOT17 with negligible accuracy loss
- Improves margins by 13.6 percentage points over total-uncertainty baselines
- Maintains 90% coverage with 30% narrower prediction intervals compared to confidence-based calibration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Aleatoric Uncertainty from Global Feature Density Deviation
Aleatoric uncertainty is estimated using a regularized Mahalanobis distance in semantic feature space. The global mean and covariance are estimated from cached calibration features with trace-based shrinkage for numerical stability. Larger Mahalanobis distances indicate degraded observations (occlusion, blur, sensor noise) that perturb the feature representation. This assumes observation degradation manifests as deviation from in-distribution feature density.

### Mechanism 2: Epistemic Uncertainty from Local Geometric Signatures
Epistemic uncertainty is captured through three complementary local statistics: support deficiency (distance-weighted kNN aggregation), spectral collapse (local covariance effective rank), and cross-layer inconsistency (cosine divergence between consecutive encoder layers). These components are normalized to [0,1] and combined with learned weights. This assumes unfamiliar samples exhibit sparse local neighborhoods, degenerated local geometry, or unstable hierarchical feature evolution.

### Mechanism 3: Orthogonality-Enforced Decomposition Enables Effective Adaptive Compute
Enforcing near-zero correlation between aleatoric and epistemic components (|r|<0.3) allows adaptive model selection to allocate compute only when epistemic uncertainty is high and aleatoric is low—targeting reducible error. An RL controller escalates model capacity only when σ_epis > τ_epis AND σ_alea ≤ τ_alea, avoiding wasted compute on irreducible noise. This assumes the two uncertainty types vary independently across real-world inputs.

## Foundational Learning

- **Aleatoric vs. Epistemic Uncertainty Distinction**: Understanding the difference between irreducible observation noise and reducible representation gaps is essential for correct uncertainty attribution and effective compute allocation. Quick check: Given a blurry image of a common object class, which uncertainty type should dominate? (Answer: Primarily aleatoric—the model knows the class, but observation quality is poor.)

- **Mahalanobis Distance in High-Dimensional Feature Space**: The aleatoric estimator relies on Mahalanobis distance to measure deviation from a reference distribution. Understanding covariance structure and regularization is essential for numerical stability. Quick check: Why add λ·tr(Σ)/d·I to the covariance matrix before inversion? (Answer: Trace-based shrinkage prevents ill-conditioning when dimensions exceed samples or features are correlated.)

- **Distribution-Free Conformal Prediction**: The calibration layer uses conformal quantiles to construct prediction intervals with finite-sample coverage guarantees. Understanding exchangeability and coverage guarantees is essential for correct implementation. Quick check: What assumption must hold for conformal coverage guarantees to apply? (Answer: Exchangeability between calibration and test samples—i.e., they are drawn from the same distribution without systematic drift.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Frozen encoder -> Feature extraction (256D) -> Global density module (aleatoric) and Local geometry module (epistemic) -> Weight optimizer -> Conformal calibration (leaf-based quantiles) -> Adaptive controller (RL or threshold policy) -> Model selection

- **Critical path**: 1) Cache calibration features during offline pass 2) Fit global (μ, Σ) and per-leaf conformal quantiles 3) At inference: extract v(x), compute σ_alea and σ_epis 4) Retrieve leaf-specific quantile, form prediction interval 5) If σ_epis > τ_epis and σ_alea ≤ τ_alea: escalate model; else maintain current

- **Design tradeoffs**: k for kNN (larger k smooths but increases latency), number of conformal leaves (more leaves tighten intervals but risk insufficient calibration samples), RL vs. threshold policy (RL learns context-aware switching but requires trajectory data)

- **Failure signatures**: Orthogonality collapse (|r|>0.3 indicates components capture overlapping signals), coverage failure (empirical coverage < 1-α suggests exchangeability violation), compute waste under noise (model escalation during high-aleatoric frames indicates τ thresholds need recalibration)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Orthogonality validation: Compute corr(σ_alea, σ_epis) across held-out sequences; verify |r|<0.1 2) Calibration coverage test: Run conformal calibration on 50% held-out calibration split; confirm ≥ 90% coverage with intervals < 0.5 width 3) Single-sequence adaptive pilot: Deploy threshold policy on MOT17-04; measure compute savings vs. fixed-XLarge baseline while tracking IoU drop (< 1% acceptable)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does temporal correlation in video sequences affect the finite-sample coverage guarantees of the conformal calibration procedure, given that exchangeability is assumed but not strictly satisfied? The paper mentions "temporally aware conformal methods" as future work, but standard conformal prediction requires exchangeability which video data violates.

### Open Question 2
Does the aleatoric-epistemic decomposition remain orthogonal and well-calibrated when applied to domains substantially different from pedestrian tracking? All experiments use pedestrian benchmarks; generalization to other object categories, scenes, or non-tracking vision tasks is not evaluated.

### Open Question 3
Are the three epistemic components (support deficiency, spectral collapse, cross-layer inconsistency) sufficient to capture all representation-driven uncertainty, or are there failure modes not addressed? The components are designed heuristically; the paper does not prove completeness or provide a theoretical characterization of the epistemic uncertainty space.

### Open Question 4
What is the minimum calibration set size required to achieve stable orthogonality and reliable conformal coverage, and how does this scale with feature dimensionality? The paper uses n_cal samples but does not analyze sensitivity to calibration set size or provide guidance for resource-constrained settings.

## Limitations

- The orthogonality assumption may not hold under all distribution shifts, potentially degrading adaptive compute performance
- Performance depends heavily on the choice of frozen encoder providing semantically meaningful features
- Conformal calibration requires exchangeable calibration and test distributions, making it vulnerable to temporal or domain drift
- RL policy implementation details (reward function, training protocol) are underspecified, making reproduction challenging

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Orthogonality measurement results (|r|<0.3), conformal coverage validation (90% target), and relative performance improvements (13.6 percentage points, 60% compute savings)
- **Medium Confidence**: The three-component epistemic decomposition captures all relevant epistemic modes; claim based on empirical observation rather than theoretical completeness
- **Low Confidence**: The RL policy's superior performance over simple threshold-based control in real-world deployment; training protocol and reward function details are underspecified

## Next Checks

1. **Orthogonality Robustness Test**: Compute correlation between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty on held-out sequences with varying degrees of domain shift (weather, lighting, camera angle) to verify the |r|<0.3 relationship holds beyond the reported datasets.

2. **Encoder Ablation Study**: Replace the 256D feature extractor with alternative self-supervised encoders (MAE, VICReg) and measure degradation in uncertainty decomposition quality and adaptive compute performance to validate encoder choice independence.

3. **Temporal Drift Evaluation**: Introduce controlled temporal distribution shift in MOT20 by training conformal calibration on early sequences and testing on later sequences, measuring coverage degradation and adaptive policy stability.
