- No-regret learning is impossible under action feedback but achievable under type feedback in Bayesian Stackelberg games

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses online learning in Bayesian Stackelberg games where a leader commits to strategies repeatedly while facing a follower with unknown private types. The central challenge is that the leader has no prior knowledge of the follower's type distribution or payoffs. The authors prove a fundamental impossibility: no-regret learning is unattainable when the leader only observes the follower's actions (action feedback). They then develop a novel no-regret algorithm that works under the stronger assumption of type feedback, where the leader observes both the follower's action and their private type. The algorithm achieves O(√T) regret when the number of leader actions is fixed, representing the first no-regret result for this problem without requiring knowledge of follower payoffs.

## Method Summary
The proposed algorithm operates in epochs, using type observations to estimate the follower's type distribution and learn best-response regions. During each epoch, the algorithm restricts future choices to approximately optimal leader commitments based on the current estimates. The method involves discretizing both the type space and payoff space to handle the infinite possibilities, then using these discretized representations to guide the learning process. The algorithm maintains regret bounds that depend polynomially on various parameters including the number of types, the discretization granularity, and the range of payoffs, while achieving the optimal √T dependence on time when the leader's action space is fixed.

## Key Results
- Proves no-regret learning is impossible under action feedback alone
- Achieves O(√T) regret under type feedback when leader actions are fixed
- First no-regret algorithm for this problem without requiring follower payoff knowledge
- Algorithm works by epoch-based estimation of type distribution and best-response regions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithm succeeds by leveraging the additional information available in type feedback to overcome the fundamental limitations present in action feedback. By observing both the follower's action and their private type, the leader can directly estimate the follower's type distribution and construct accurate best-response strategies. The epoch-based approach allows for gradual refinement of these estimates while maintaining bounded regret. The discretization of continuous spaces enables tractable computation while preserving the theoretical guarantees through careful analysis of the approximation errors.

## Foundational Learning
- Bayesian Stackelberg games: Leader-follower games with incomplete information about follower types; needed to model real-world scenarios where one party has private information
- Online learning with no-regret: Framework for sequential decision-making where average regret vanishes over time; needed to evaluate long-term performance
- Type feedback vs action feedback: Different observability models in games; needed to understand fundamental limitations and possibilities
- Epoch-based learning: Technique of dividing learning into phases with different strategies; needed to balance exploration and exploitation
- Discretization of continuous spaces: Approximation technique for handling infinite possibilities; needed to make the problem computationally tractable

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Type observation -> Distribution estimation -> Best-response learning -> Commitment restriction -> Regret calculation
Critical path: The algorithm's performance depends critically on accurate type distribution estimation and timely convergence of best-response learning within each epoch.
Design tradeoffs: The main tradeoff involves the granularity of discretization (finer discretization improves accuracy but increases computational complexity) and epoch length (longer epochs allow better estimation but may delay adaptation).
Failure signatures: The algorithm may fail if the type distribution is too complex for the chosen discretization level, or if the follower's strategy is not fixed but evolves over time.
First experiments:
1. Test algorithm in simple two-type games with known optimal solutions to verify basic functionality
2. Vary the number of types and discretization levels to characterize the polynomial factors in the regret bound
3. Compare performance under type feedback versus action feedback to demonstrate the impossibility result empirically

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Impossibility result for action feedback depends on follower having fixed, unknown strategy
- Requires knowledge of follower's strategy space and leader's own payoffs
- Polynomial dependence on parameters may be prohibitive in practice
- Discretization introduces approximation errors that are not fully characterized

## Confidence
High: Impossibility result, No-regret algorithm under type feedback
Medium: Practical applicability of algorithm

## Next Checks
1. Test algorithm in simulated Stackelberg games with varying numbers of types and actions to empirically verify the O(√T) regret bound and characterize polynomial factors
2. Extend analysis to settings where follower's strategy evolves over time according to unknown process
3. Investigate whether weaker forms of feedback (noisy type or action observations) can still enable no-regret learning through statistical techniques
