core_contribution: This study exposes critical vulnerabilities in large language models
  (LLMs) by developing Priming Attack strategies that achieve a 100% attack success
  rate on open-source models (e.g., Llama-3.2, Gemma-2, Qwen2.5) and at least 95%
  on closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5, Claude-3.5). Inspired by psychological
  phenomena like "Priming Effect" and "Cognitive Dissonance," the method manipulates
  models' autoregressive generation to produce harmful content by first priming them
  with malicious context, then suppressing safety responses through "Safe Attention
  Shift." Analysis reveals that self-attention consistently concentrates on the last
  token, and specific neurons are easily activated across different inputs, enabling
  these attacks.

# Intrinsic Model Weaknesses: How Priming Attacks Unveil Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2502.16491
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16491
- **Reference count**: 26
- **Primary result**: Priming Attack strategies achieve 100% success rate on open-source LLMs and at least 95% on closed-source models

## Executive Summary
This study reveals critical vulnerabilities in large language models (LLMs) through the development of Priming Attack strategies. Inspired by psychological phenomena like the Priming Effect and Cognitive Dissonance, these attacks manipulate models' autoregressive generation to produce harmful content by first priming them with malicious context, then suppressing safety responses through a mechanism called "Safe Attention Shift." The research demonstrates that self-attention consistently concentrates on the last token, and specific neurons are easily activated across different inputs, enabling these attacks to succeed against both open-source models (Llama-3.2, Gemma-2, Qwen2.5) and closed-source models (GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5, Claude-3.5) with remarkably high success rates.

## Method Summary
The researchers developed Priming Attack strategies that exploit psychological principles to manipulate LLM behavior. The method involves two key phases: first, priming the model with malicious context to set up the desired response trajectory, and second, implementing "Safe Attention Shift" to suppress safety mechanisms during generation. By analyzing self-attention patterns, the study found that attention consistently concentrates on the last token, while specific neurons show easy activation across different inputs. This combination allows attackers to bypass safety measures and elicit harmful content generation from the models.

## Key Results
- 100% attack success rate achieved on open-source LLMs (Llama-3.2, Gemma-2, Qwen2.5)
- At least 95% attack success rate on closed-source models (GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5, Claude-3.5)
- Self-attention consistently concentrates on the last token across attacked models
- Specific neurons are easily activated across different inputs, enabling attack effectiveness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Priming Attack strategy works by exploiting the autoregressive nature of LLM generation and their attention mechanisms. The attack first establishes a malicious priming context that sets the generation trajectory toward harmful content. The "Safe Attention Shift" component then manipulates the attention mechanism to suppress the model's safety responses, effectively bypassing built-in guardrails. The consistent concentration of self-attention on the last token creates a predictable pattern that attackers can exploit, while the easy activation of specific neurons across different inputs provides multiple attack vectors. This combination of psychological priming and attention manipulation reveals fundamental vulnerabilities in how LLMs process and generate sequential information.

## Foundational Learning
- **Autoregressive Generation**: The sequential token-by-token generation process in LLMs that creates opportunities for context manipulation
  - *Why needed*: Understanding this mechanism is crucial because Priming Attacks exploit the step-by-step nature of generation
  - *Quick check*: Verify that model generates tokens sequentially rather than in parallel

- **Self-Attention Mechanism**: The process by which LLMs weigh the importance of different tokens when generating new ones
  - *Why needed*: The attack specifically targets the attention mechanism's tendency to focus on recent tokens
  - *Quick check*: Examine attention weight distributions to confirm last-token concentration

- **Neuron Activation Patterns**: The specific neural responses that occur during different types of input processing
  - *Why needed*: Understanding which neurons activate across inputs helps identify attack vectors
  - *Quick check*: Map neuron activation patterns across diverse input types

- **Cognitive Priming**: The psychological principle where exposure to one stimulus influences response to subsequent stimuli
  - *Why needed*: This concept directly inspires the attack methodology
  - *Quick check*: Test whether initial context influences subsequent generation

- **Attention Shift Mechanisms**: The ability to redirect a model's focus during generation
  - *Why needed*: Critical for understanding how "Safe Attention Shift" suppresses safety responses
  - *Quick check*: Measure attention distribution changes before and after safety intervention

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input -> Tokenizer -> Embedding Layer -> Transformer Blocks (Multi-Head Attention + Feed-Forward) -> Output Layer -> Token Generation

**Critical Path**: The attack exploits the path from input context through the attention mechanism to token generation, specifically targeting the transformer blocks where self-attention is computed.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The architecture balances computational efficiency with modeling capacity, but this creates vulnerabilities where attention patterns become predictable and exploitable. The autoregressive design that enables coherent generation also creates sequential dependencies that can be manipulated.

**Failure Signatures**: The primary failure signature is the consistent concentration of self-attention on the last token, regardless of context or model architecture. Secondary signatures include easy activation of specific neurons across diverse inputs and the suppression of safety responses during generation.

**First Experiments**:
1. Analyze attention weight distributions across multiple model architectures to verify last-token concentration patterns
2. Map neuron activation patterns across different input types to identify universally active neurons
3. Test "Safe Attention Shift" effectiveness by measuring safety response suppression rates

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The evaluation methodology relies on self-reported attack success without independent verification or external benchmarking against established safety evaluation frameworks
- The paper does not disclose the diversity or representativeness of harmful prompts used across different model architectures
- The "Safe Attention Shift" mechanism is described conceptually but lacks detailed technical implementation specifications, making reproducibility challenging

## Confidence
- **Confidence: Medium** in the reported attack success rates due to limited methodological transparency
- **Confidence: Low** in the proposed mechanistic explanations linking attention patterns to vulnerability exploitation
- **Confidence: Low** in the generalizability of findings across diverse model architectures and prompt types

## Next Checks
1. Conduct independent replication studies using standardized safety evaluation benchmarks like AdvGLUE or RealToxicityPrompts to verify attack success rates across diverse model families
2. Perform ablation studies systematically removing or modifying the "Safe Attention Shift" components to quantify their individual contributions to attack effectiveness
3. Analyze the same attention and neuron activation patterns across models that successfully resist these attacks to determine if the observed vulnerabilities are universal or model-specific
