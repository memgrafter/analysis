# Honey, I Shrunk the Language Model: Impact of Knowledge Distillation Methods on Performance and Explainability

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.16056
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16056
- Reference count: 40
- Knowledge distillation methods significantly impact small language model performance and explainability

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how different knowledge distillation methods affect the performance and explainability of small language models. The authors systematically compare four distillation methods: few-shot prompting, critique-revision prompting for data generation, and multitask, counterfactual, and combined multitask+counterfactual training. Using the Commonsense Question-Answering dataset, they evaluate student models (T5-base and T5-large) on accuracy and explanation quality. Results show that multitask training yields the best performance, while combining critique-revision prompting with multitask+counterfactual training produces the highest explainability scores.

## Method Summary
The study employs a systematic approach to knowledge distillation, comparing four distinct methods. The first method uses few-shot prompting to generate training data. The second employs critique-revision prompting to iteratively improve generated data quality. The third through fifth methods involve different training strategies: multitask training, counterfactual training, and a combined multitask+counterfactual approach. The authors evaluate student models (T5-base and T5-large) on the Commonsense Question-Answering dataset, measuring both task performance and explanation quality using automated metrics including BERTScore, BLEU, and QBE.

## Key Results
- Multitask training yields the best performance on the Commonsense Question-Answering task
- Combining critique-revision prompting with multitask+counterfactual training produces the highest explainability scores
- Data generation methods significantly impact explainability while training methods primarily affect performance
- Student models show improved performance compared to standard training approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Assumption: The effectiveness of multitask training likely stems from its ability to teach models multiple related skills simultaneously, creating richer representations that transfer better to the target task. The combination of critique-revision prompting with multitask+counterfactual training may work by generating higher-quality synthetic data that better captures the reasoning patterns needed for both accurate answers and explanations.

## Foundational Learning
Unknown: The paper does not explicitly discuss foundational learning principles or connections to broader theories of how language models acquire knowledge through distillation processes.

## Architecture Onboarding
Assumption: The paper assumes readers understand basic knowledge distillation concepts and the T5 architecture. The evaluation metrics (BERTScore, BLEU, QBE) are mentioned but not fully explained, suggesting some prior familiarity with NLP evaluation methods is expected.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
Unknown: The paper does not explicitly identify specific open questions or directions for future research in the provided text.

## Limitations
- Evaluation is limited to a single dataset (Commonsense Question-Answering) and two T5 model sizes
- Explainability assessment relies on automated metrics rather than human evaluation
- Critique-revision prompting method is resource-intensive and may not scale well

## Confidence
- Core findings confidence: Medium
- The systematic methodology provides strong internal validity, but narrow scope and automated metrics reduce broader applicability confidence

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the study across multiple datasets (e.g., SQuAD, MNLI, BoolQ) to assess generalizability of performance and explainability findings
2. Conduct human evaluation studies to validate automated explainability metrics and assess the practical utility of generated explanations
3. Test additional student model architectures (e.g., DistilBERT, BERT variants) to determine if the distillation method effects are consistent across different model families
