## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.24124
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24124

- Primary result: Data-free method for mitigating weight outliers in LLMs via fusible rotations, outperforming Hadamard rotations and data-dependent methods like SpinQuant and OSTQuant

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces OptRot, a data-free method for improving post-training quantization by mitigating weight outliers in large language models. The approach learns fusible rotations that minimize the element-wise fourth power of rotated weights, which provably reduces weight incoherence and improves quantization error bounds. The method is evaluated on Llama and Qwen model families, demonstrating consistent improvements in KL divergence and downstream task performance across different quantization settings.

## Method Summary
OptRot addresses the challenge of weight outliers in post-training quantization by learning data-free rotations that reduce weight incoherence. The key innovation is minimizing the fourth power of rotated weights, which has a provable effect on reducing incoherence and improving quantization error bounds. The method learns these rotations through an optimization process that can be fused with existing weights, making it computationally efficient. A data-dependent extension (OptRot+) incorporates activation covariance information for further improvements. The approach is designed to be quantization-agnostic while specifically targeting weight outlier mitigation.

## Key Results
- OptRot outperforms Hadamard rotations and data-dependent methods (SpinQuant, OSTQuant) for weight quantization
- In W4A8 setting, OptRot matches or exceeds SpinQuant performance while being data-free
- Consistent improvements in KL divergence and downstream task performance on Llama and Qwen families
- OptRot+ provides additional gains by incorporating activation covariance information

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
OptRot works by learning rotations that minimize the fourth power of rotated weights, which directly reduces weight incoherence. This mathematical approach creates a provable relationship between the rotation optimization and improved quantization bounds. By focusing on the fourth power, the method particularly targets weight outliers that would otherwise dominate quantization error. The learned rotations can be fused with existing weights, maintaining computational efficiency while providing theoretical guarantees for quantization performance improvement.

## Foundational Learning
- **Weight Incoherence**: The degree to which weight distributions deviate from ideal quantization targets; needed to understand quantization error sources; quick check: measure variance of weight magnitudes after rotation
- **Fusible Rotations**: Matrix transformations that can be combined with weight matrices without additional computation; needed for maintaining efficiency; quick check: verify rotation matrix multiplication is associative
- **Fourth Power Minimization**: Optimization objective that disproportionately penalizes large weight values; needed to target outliers; quick check: plot weight distribution before/after optimization
- **Quantization Error Bounds**: Theoretical limits on quantization accuracy based on weight statistics; needed to evaluate method effectiveness; quick check: compute KL divergence between quantized and original distributions
- **Activation Covariance**: Statistical relationship between different activation channels; needed for data-dependent extension; quick check: calculate correlation matrix of activation patterns

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Weights -> Rotation Learning -> Fusible Rotation -> Quantized Weights

**Critical Path**: The optimization of rotations occurs before quantization, and the learned rotations must be efficiently fused with original weights. The critical performance determinant is the quality of rotation learning, which directly impacts quantization error.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades computational complexity of rotation learning against improved quantization accuracy. Data-free approach sacrifices potential gains from activation information but gains privacy and efficiency. The fourth-power objective specifically targets outliers but may not optimize for other quantization metrics.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor rotation learning manifests as minimal improvement in weight incoherence metrics. When both weights and activations are heavily quantized (W4A4), performance degrades significantly. The method may struggle with extremely sparse weight distributions or pathological outlier patterns.

**First Experiments**: 1) Compare weight incoherence metrics before/after OptRot on a small model layer; 2) Measure quantization error bounds improvement with varying rotation block sizes; 3) Evaluate computational overhead of rotation learning versus quantization gains.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance trade-offs in W4A4 setting suggest limitations when both weights and activations are heavily quantized
- Limited evaluation on diverse model architectures beyond Llama and Qwen families
- Theoretical guarantees based on fourth-power minimization need more extensive practical validation
- Computational overhead of data-dependent extension (OptRot+) not fully characterized

## Confidence
- High confidence in core algorithmic contribution and evaluated setting effectiveness
- Medium confidence in theoretical bounds and their practical implications
- Low confidence in generalizability across different model families and quantization schemes

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate OptRot on diverse model architectures including GPT-style models, vision transformers, and multimodal models to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies varying rotation block sizes and optimization hyperparameters to understand their impact on quantization performance
3. Test OptRot in mixed-precision quantization scenarios and compare against state-of-the-art data-dependent methods across a broader range of bit-widths (e.g., W3A4, W5A8)
