# Compliance Brain Assistant: Conversational Agentic AI for Assisting Compliance Tasks in Enterprise Environments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.17289
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17289
- Reference count: 13
- Primary result: Conversational AI assistant for enterprise compliance tasks with routed FastTrack/RAG and FullAgentic modes

## Executive Summary
Compliance Brain Assistant (CBA) is a conversational AI system designed to assist with enterprise compliance tasks by intelligently routing queries between two operational modes: a fast, RAG-based FastTrack mode and a more thorough, multi-step agentic FullAgentic mode. A lightweight LLM router determines which workflow to use based on query complexity and artifact requirements. Evaluated across three internal benchmarks, CBA significantly outperformed a baseline vanilla LLM, achieving higher match and pass rates while maintaining low latency. The system demonstrates effective trade-offs between response quality and speed, offering a practical solution for enterprise compliance environments.

## Method Summary
CBA employs a dual-mode architecture with FastTrack (RAG-based) for quick responses and FullAgentic (multi-step agentic) for complex compliance tasks. A lightweight LLM router dynamically selects the optimal workflow based on query characteristics such as complexity and artifact needs. The system was evaluated on three proprietary internal benchmarks, showing substantial improvements in accuracy and efficiency compared to vanilla LLM baselines.

## Key Results
- CBA achieved an average match rate of 83.7% versus 41.7% for vanilla LLM
- CBA achieved a pass rate of 82.0% versus 20.0% for vanilla LLM
- The routing design provided better quality metrics while maintaining low latency compared to single-mode approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system works by routing queries to the most appropriate processing mode based on complexity and artifact requirements. FastTrack uses RAG for quick, straightforward compliance queries, while FullAgentic employs multi-step reasoning for more complex tasks. The lightweight LLM router acts as an intelligent dispatcher, ensuring that queries are handled by the most suitable workflow. This design balances accuracy and speed, making it effective for enterprise compliance environments where both quality and efficiency are critical.

## Foundational Learning
- **RAG-based FastTrack**: Uses retrieval-augmented generation for quick, context-aware responses. Why needed: Provides fast answers for simple compliance queries. Quick check: Validate retrieval accuracy on standard QA datasets.
- **Multi-step Agentic FullAgentic**: Employs agentic reasoning for complex, multi-step compliance tasks. Why needed: Handles nuanced queries requiring deeper analysis. Quick check: Measure reasoning depth and task completion accuracy.
- **LLM Router**: Lightweight model that routes queries to appropriate mode. Why needed: Optimizes trade-off between speed and accuracy. Quick check: Test routing accuracy across diverse query types.
- **Dual-mode Architecture**: Combines FastTrack and FullAgentic for comprehensive coverage. Why needed: Addresses full spectrum of compliance query complexity. Quick check: Evaluate coverage and performance across query complexity spectrum.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: User Query -> LLM Router -> [FastTrack (RAG) | FullAgentic (Multi-step Agentic)] -> Response
- **Critical Path**: Query → Router → Mode Selection → Processing → Response
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Speed vs. Accuracy; Simplicity vs. Complexity; Cost vs. Performance
- **Failure Signatures**: Router misclassification → Suboptimal mode selection; RAG retrieval failure → Inaccurate FastTrack responses; Agentic loop failure → Incomplete FullAgentic processing
- **First Experiments**: 1) Router accuracy across query complexity spectrum; 2) End-to-end latency comparison between modes; 3) User satisfaction with routed vs. single-mode responses

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Proprietary benchmarks limit reproducibility and independent validation
- Narrow focus on match and pass rates without broader quality metrics
- Router decision boundaries and potential biases are not characterized

## Confidence
- **Major Claims**: Medium
- **Internal Consistency**: High
- **External Validity**: Medium
- **Reproducibility**: Low

## Next Checks
1. Replicate key performance comparisons using public compliance QA datasets (e.g., FinQA, Legal-BERT benchmarks) to test generalizability beyond proprietary benchmarks.
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the impact of the router versus the individual FastTrack and FullAgentic components to quantify routing contribution.
3. Perform a user study with enterprise compliance professionals to assess practical utility, response quality, and trust in the assistant under realistic conditions.
