# TensorSLM: Energy-efficient Embedding Compression of Sub-billion Parameter Language Models on Low-end Devices

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.13514
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13514
- Reference count: 40
- Achieves 2.0× embedding layer compression with 50% energy reduction on Raspberry Pi 5

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the dual challenges of adaptability and energy efficiency for Small Language Models (SLMs) deployed on low-end devices. The authors propose TensorSLM, a training-free approach that compresses token embeddings using Tensor-Train Decomposition (TTD), enabling dynamic vocabulary updates without retraining. The method is evaluated on sub-billion parameter versions of GPT-2, CerebrasGPT, and OPT models across multiple tasks on Raspberry Pi 5, demonstrating comparable performance to uncompressed models while achieving significant energy savings.

## Method Summary
TensorSLM employs Tensor-Train Decomposition to compress token embeddings in pre-trained language models. Each token embedding vector is converted into a lower-dimensional Matrix Product State (MPS), enabling dynamic vocabulary updates without the need for retraining. This training-free approach allows for efficient deployment on resource-constrained devices while maintaining model performance across language modeling, classification, and zero-shot reasoning tasks.

## Key Results
- Achieves approximately 2.0× compression of embedding layers while maintaining comparable task performance
- Reduces single-query energy consumption by half on Raspberry Pi 5
- Demonstrates superior performance on unprompted and unconstrained question answering tasks compared to matrix-based SVD approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TensorSLM leverages the mathematical properties of Tensor-Train Decomposition to efficiently represent high-dimensional embedding vectors in a compressed format. By converting token embeddings into Matrix Product States, the method exploits the inherent low-rank structure of language data while preserving semantic relationships. This tensor-based approach provides better preservation of semantic information compared to traditional matrix factorization methods, particularly for tasks requiring rich contextual understanding like question answering.

## Foundational Learning
- **Tensor-Train Decomposition**: A tensor decomposition method that represents high-dimensional tensors as products of smaller core tensors, reducing computational complexity while preserving essential information. Needed to compress embeddings without losing semantic meaning. Quick check: Verify rank selection balances compression ratio with reconstruction accuracy.
- **Matrix Product State (MPS)**: A tensor network structure used to represent quantum states and high-dimensional data efficiently. Required for maintaining sequential relationships in token embeddings. Quick check: Confirm MPS order preserves word context and semantic dependencies.
- **Dynamic Vocabulary Updates**: The ability to modify model vocabulary without retraining by leveraging the compressed tensor representation. Essential for adapting to changing deployment environments. Quick check: Test vocabulary expansion/reduction without performance degradation.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Input tokens -> Embedding compression (TTD) -> Compressed embeddings -> Model layers -> Output
**Critical Path**: Token input → Tensor-Train compressed embeddings → Model processing → Task output
**Design Tradeoffs**: Compression ratio vs. task performance; training-free deployment vs. potential accuracy loss; hardware compatibility vs. compression efficiency
**Failure Signatures**: Significant performance degradation on semantic tasks; inability to maintain vocabulary flexibility; hardware incompatibility issues
**First Experiments**: 1) Test embedding compression ratio with different rank parameters; 2) Verify dynamic vocabulary update functionality without retraining

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does TensorSLM perform on larger language models beyond the sub-billion parameter range?
- What is the impact of TensorSLM on latency during real-time inference on different low-end devices?
- Can the Tensor-Train Decomposition approach be extended to compress other model components beyond embeddings?

## Limitations
- The approach is specifically designed for sub-billion parameter models and may not scale effectively to larger models
- Limited evaluation on devices beyond Raspberry Pi 5, which may have different hardware constraints
- The training-free nature may result in some performance trade-offs compared to fine-tuned compressed alternatives
- No analysis of long-term stability or degradation when performing frequent vocabulary updates

## Confidence
Medium-High. The method is well-grounded in established tensor decomposition theory and demonstrates practical benefits on standard benchmarks. However, the evaluation is limited to specific model architectures and hardware platforms, which may affect generalizability.

## Next Checks
1. Verify the actual compression ratio achieved with different rank parameters across various embedding dimensions
2. Test dynamic vocabulary update functionality with vocabulary sizes beyond those reported in the paper
3. Evaluate energy consumption measurements using standardized benchmarking tools
4. Compare performance degradation on semantic tasks when using different tensor decomposition ranks
5. Test compatibility with other low-end devices beyond Raspberry Pi 5
