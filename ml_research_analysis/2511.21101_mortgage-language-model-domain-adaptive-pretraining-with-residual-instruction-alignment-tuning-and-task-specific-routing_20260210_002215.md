# Mortgage Language Model: Domain-Adaptive Pretraining with Residual Instruction, Alignment Tuning, and Task-Specific Routing

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.21101
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21101
- **Reference count:** 15
- **Primary result:** Dual-track domain adaptation achieves significant performance gains over baselines in mortgage finance tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of applying large language models to specialized mortgage finance domains while preserving instruction-following capabilities. The authors propose a dual-track specialization framework combining continued pretraining with instruction residual technique and task-specific supervised fine-tuning, plus an intelligent routing mechanism. The approach involves creating two specialist models - one for conversational Q&A using instruction residuals and another for structured tasks using supervised fine-tuning, with a routing system to direct queries appropriately. Evaluation on domain-specific benchmarks shows significant improvements over baselines across multiple metrics including LLM-as-a-Judge scoring and BERTScore.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a dual-track domain adaptation framework that preserves instruction-following capabilities while specializing in mortgage finance. The first track uses continued pretraining with an instruction residual technique, where original instruction-following knowledge is preserved alongside mortgage-specific knowledge. The second track employs task-specific supervised fine-tuning for structured mortgage tasks. A routing mechanism directs queries to the appropriate specialist model based on query characteristics. The framework includes a two-phase pipeline with explicit instruction alignment tuning, followed by task-specific fine-tuning. The approach balances domain expertise with general language understanding through carefully structured pretraining and fine-tuning phases.

## Key Results
- MLM v2 achieves an LLM-as-a-Judge summarization score of 4.58 (vs 3.99 baseline)
- Q&A score of 4.09 (vs 4.0 baseline) and classification score of 2.6 (vs 1.2 baseline)
- BERTScore improvements of 0.77 vs 0.74 for summarization, 0.68 vs 0.58 for Q&A, and 0.75 vs 0.73 for classification
- Superior security resistance and domain-specific knowledge compared to baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dual-track approach works by maintaining a balance between domain-specific expertise and general instruction-following capabilities. The instruction residual technique preserves the model's ability to follow complex instructions while adding mortgage-specific knowledge through continued pretraining. Task-specific supervised fine-tuning allows the model to excel at structured mortgage tasks like loan classification and document analysis. The routing mechanism ensures queries are handled by the most appropriate specialist, optimizing performance across different query types. This architecture prevents catastrophic forgetting while enabling deep domain specialization.

## Foundational Learning
**Domain adaptation** - Fine-tuning large language models on specialized datasets to improve performance in specific domains while retaining general capabilities. Why needed: Generic LLMs lack the specialized knowledge required for mortgage finance tasks. Quick check: Compare performance on domain-specific vs general tasks.

**Instruction fine-tuning** - Training models to follow complex instructions while maintaining task performance. Why needed: Mortgage tasks require both domain knowledge and the ability to interpret complex user requests. Quick check: Evaluate instruction-following capability before and after fine-tuning.

**Supervised fine-tuning** - Training models on labeled datasets for specific task performance. Why needed: Structured mortgage tasks like loan classification require precise, accurate outputs. Quick check: Measure task-specific accuracy improvements.

**Routing mechanisms** - Intelligent systems that direct queries to appropriate models or processing pipelines. Why needed: Different query types benefit from different model specializations. Quick check: Evaluate routing accuracy and overall system performance.

**BERTScore** - Metric for evaluating text generation quality by comparing contextual embeddings. Why needed: Provides more nuanced evaluation than simple string matching for mortgage documents. Quick check: Compare BERTScore to human evaluation on sample outputs.

**LLM-as-a-Judge** - Using large language models to evaluate and score other model outputs. Why needed: Scalable evaluation method for comparing model performance on subjective tasks. Quick check: Validate judge consistency across multiple evaluation rounds.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Mortgage Corpus -> Continued Pretraining (Instruction Residual) -> Specialist Model 1 (Conversational) <- Routing System -> User Queries; Structured Tasks Data -> Supervised Fine-tuning -> Specialist Model 2 (Structured) <- Routing System -> User Queries

**Critical Path:** User Query → Routing Mechanism → Appropriate Specialist Model → Output Generation → LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs:** The dual-track approach trades model complexity for performance gains. Using two specialist models increases resource requirements but enables deeper specialization than a single multi-task model. The routing mechanism adds latency but improves accuracy by directing queries to the most suitable model.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor routing decisions lead to decreased performance on both conversational and structured tasks. Inadequate instruction alignment tuning results in loss of general instruction-following capabilities. Insufficient domain-specific pretraining data limits mortgage expertise development.

**First Experiments:** 1) Evaluate routing accuracy by testing query classification performance, 2) Compare individual specialist model performance against baseline models, 3) Test catastrophic forgetting by evaluating general instruction-following capabilities after domain fine-tuning.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Heavy reliance on LLM-as-a-Judge scoring introduces potential subjectivity and alignment issues
- Security resistance improvements are asserted without detailed attack scenario testing or quantitative metrics
- Routing mechanism performance impact on overall system accuracy isn't clearly isolated from individual specialist model performances

## Confidence
**High confidence** in the architectural framework and pretraining methodology, as these follow established patterns in domain adaptation research. **Medium confidence** in the quantitative results due to the LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation approach, which may not be consistent across different models or prompts. **Low confidence** in the security resistance claims without detailed penetration testing methodology or attack vectors.

## Next Checks
1) Independent human evaluation of the LLM-as-a-Judge scores to verify alignment and consistency across different evaluators
2) Comprehensive security testing using standardized attack patterns to quantify the claimed resistance improvements
3) Ablation studies isolating the routing mechanism's contribution to overall performance from the individual specialist models' capabilities
