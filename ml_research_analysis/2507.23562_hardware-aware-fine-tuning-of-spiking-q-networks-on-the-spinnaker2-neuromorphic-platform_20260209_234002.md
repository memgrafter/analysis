# Hardware-Aware Fine-Tuning of Spiking Q-Networks on the SpiNNaker2 Neuromorphic Platform

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2507.23562
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23562
- **Reference count:** 31
- **Primary result:** 32× energy reduction (0.006 J vs 0.145 J) on CartPole-v0 with comparable latency and accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a hardware-aware deep reinforcement learning system using spiking neural networks (SNNs) for classical control tasks on the energy-efficient SpiNNaker2 neuromorphic platform. The authors developed a pipeline that trains spiking Q-networks using surrogate gradients, then fine-tunes and quantizes them to 8-bit precision for deployment. The system achieves significant energy efficiency gains while maintaining task performance, demonstrating that calibrated quantization and threshold optimization can preserve both accuracy and biologically inspired temporal coding on energy-constrained platforms.

## Method Summary
The authors trained spiking Q-networks using Q-learning with surrogate gradients, then applied hardware-aware fine-tuning and 8-bit quantization for deployment on SpiNNaker2. The approach involved layer-wise quantization scaling and threshold tuning to maintain spiking dynamics during hardware deployment. The system was evaluated on CartPole-v0 and Acrobot-v1 tasks from OpenAI Gym, with performance compared against a GTX 1650 GPU baseline.

## Key Results
- Achieved up to 32× reduction in energy consumption (0.006 J vs 0.145 J for CartPole-v0)
- Maintained comparable inference latency and task performance between neuromorphic and GPU implementations
- Successfully deployed calibrated quantized SNNs while preserving spiking dynamics on energy-constrained platforms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by training SNNs with surrogate gradients to enable gradient-based optimization of spiking networks, then applying hardware-aware quantization that preserves the temporal dynamics essential for spiking neural computation. Layer-wise quantization scaling ensures that the quantized weights maintain the relative importance across different network layers, while threshold tuning compensates for the discretization effects of 8-bit representation, allowing the system to retain both accuracy and biologically inspired temporal coding patterns on the SpiNNaker2 platform.

## Foundational Learning

**Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)**: Why needed - Enable event-driven, energy-efficient computation; Quick check - Verify spiking activity patterns match target firing rates

**Q-Learning with SNNs**: Why needed - Combine temporal coding with reinforcement learning for control tasks; Quick check - Confirm Q-value estimates converge during training

**Surrogate Gradient Method**: Why needed - Enable backpropagation through discontinuous spiking functions; Quick check - Validate gradient flow doesn't vanish during training

**Quantization-aware Training**: Why needed - Optimize weights for fixed-point hardware implementation; Quick check - Measure accuracy degradation after quantization

**Neuromorphic Hardware Constraints**: Why needed - Understand platform-specific limitations for deployment; Quick check - Verify memory and connectivity constraints are satisfied

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: State Encoder -> Spiking Q-Network -> Action Selector -> Environment -> Reward Calculator

**Critical Path**: Observation → Preprocessing → Spiking Computation → Q-value Estimation → Action Selection → Environment Step → Reward Processing

**Design Tradeoffs**: The system trades some precision (8-bit quantization) for significant energy savings, and uses surrogate gradients that approximate the non-differentiable spiking function rather than exact gradients. Threshold tuning balances between maintaining spiking dynamics and computational efficiency.

**Failure Signatures**: Training divergence indicates surrogate gradient instability; poor inference accuracy suggests inadequate quantization calibration; energy measurements inconsistent with expected hardware specifications point to implementation errors.

**First Experiments**: 1) Run single-layer SNN with synthetic data to verify spiking dynamics; 2) Test Q-learning convergence on CartPole with full-precision network; 3) Measure energy consumption of individual SpiNNaker2 cores under different workloads

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results constrained to simple OpenAI Gym control tasks, limiting generalizability to complex RL problems
- 8-bit quantization approach may face challenges with more complex state spaces or continuous control problems
- Surrogate gradient method introduces approximation errors that could accumulate in more demanding scenarios

## Confidence

**High** confidence in energy efficiency measurements and hardware deployment methodology
**Medium** confidence in scalability to more complex tasks and environments
**Medium** confidence in long-term stability under varying operational conditions

## Next Checks

1. Test the system on continuous control tasks from MuJoCo or similar benchmark suites to evaluate scalability
2. Compare performance against other neuromorphic platforms (Intel Loihi, BrainScaleS) and emerging AI accelerators to establish relative positioning
3. Conduct long-duration stress tests to verify model stability and performance consistency over extended operation periods on the SpiNNaker2 platform
