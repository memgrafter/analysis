core_contribution: We investigated a failure mode in large language models where plain-text
  prompts elicit excessive outputs, termed Overflow. Using BenchOverflow, a model-agnostic
  benchmark of nine plain-text prompting strategies, we systematically induced high-volume
  generations across nine state-of-the-art open- and closed-source models under a
  fixed 5000-token budget.

# BenchOverflow: Measuring Overflow in Large Language Models via Plain-Text Prompts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.08490
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08490
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Systematic evaluation of Overflow in LLMs using a model-agnostic benchmark of nine plain-text prompting strategies, revealing heavy-tailed length distributions and demonstrating that a simple conciseness reminder consistently reduces cap-saturation rates.

## Executive Summary
This study introduces BenchOverflow, a systematic benchmark for measuring Overflow—a failure mode in large language models where plain-text prompts elicit excessive outputs. The authors evaluate nine state-of-the-art models under a fixed 5000-token budget using nine distinct plain-text prompting strategies. Results reveal pronounced rightward shifts and heavy tails in length distributions, with cap-saturation rates indicating significant tail risk. A lightweight mitigation—a fixed conciseness reminder—consistently reduces overflow, demonstrating that even simple defenses can improve length control without eroding task performance.

## Method Summary
The authors develop BenchOverflow, a model-agnostic benchmark comprising nine plain-text prompting strategies designed to systematically induce high-volume generations. They evaluate nine state-of-the-art open- and closed-source models under a fixed 5000-token budget, measuring length distributions, cap-saturation rates (CSR@1k/3k/5k), within-prompt variability, and cross-model correlations. A lightweight mitigation—a fixed conciseness reminder—is tested across strategies to assess its effectiveness in reducing overflow. The study focuses on quantifying overflow as a reliability, cost, and sustainability concern, establishing BenchOverflow as a practical benchmark for comparing length-control robustness.

## Key Results
- Pronounced rightward shifts and heavy tails in length distributions across models and strategies
- Cap-saturation rates (CSR@1k/3k/5k) indicate significant tail risk for most models
- Within-prompt variability is generally low but model-dependent
- Cross-model correlations show overflow effects are broadly reproducible yet heterogeneous across families and attack vectors
- A fixed conciseness reminder consistently reduces right tails and lowers CSR for most strategies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark systematically induces overflow by using plain-text prompts that are inherently open-ended or directive, encouraging models to generate lengthy responses. The 5000-token budget creates a hard constraint that reveals tail risk when models approach or exceed this limit. The conciseness reminder works by explicitly cueing the model to be brief, which appears to override the default tendency toward verbose generation in most cases.

## Foundational Learning
- **Overflow**: A failure mode where LLMs produce excessively long outputs in response to plain-text prompts, representing a reliability and cost concern.
  - Why needed: Establishes the phenomenon as a measurable and reproducible failure mode.
  - Quick check: Look for rightward shifts and heavy tails in length distributions.
- **Cap-saturation rates (CSR)**: Metrics measuring the proportion of generations exceeding specific token thresholds (1k, 3k, 5k).
  - Why needed: Quantifies tail risk and overflow severity.
  - Quick check: CSR@5k > 0 indicates significant overflow risk.
- **Plain-text prompting strategies**: Nine distinct approaches designed to elicit long responses, including open-ended questions and directive prompts.
  - Why needed: Provides a systematic way to induce and measure overflow.
  - Quick check: Evaluate whether strategies consistently produce long outputs across models.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: BenchOverflow benchmark -> Nine prompting strategies -> Nine LLMs -> Length distribution analysis -> CSR calculation -> Mitigation testing (conciseness reminder)

**Critical path**: Prompt generation -> Model inference (5000-token budget) -> Output length measurement -> CSR calculation -> Variability and correlation analysis -> Mitigation evaluation

**Design tradeoffs**: Fixed 5000-token budget vs. variable budgets; single mitigation strategy vs. multiple interventions; focus on plain-text prompts vs. structured prompts

**Failure signatures**: CSR@5k > 0; rightward shifts in length distributions; heavy tails indicating high variability in output lengths

**3 first experiments**:
1. Replicate the Overflow benchmark with a 2000-token budget to assess scalability
2. Test the conciseness reminder on a subset of strategies to confirm reproducibility
3. Compare overflow patterns across model families to identify architectural vulnerabilities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation is limited to a 5000-token budget, which may not capture overflow dynamics at different constraints
- The conciseness reminder represents a single, simple intervention; more sophisticated techniques may yield different results
- The study does not investigate correlations between overflow patterns and specific model architectures or training regimes

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Overflow is measurable and reproducible; CSR is a reliable metric; conciseness reminder reduces overflow
- **Medium confidence**: Within-prompt variability is model-dependent; overflow is a reliability, cost, and sustainability concern
- **Low confidence**: Overflow effects are "broadly reproducible yet heterogeneous"; specific mechanisms driving heterogeneity require further investigation

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the Overflow benchmark with variable token budgets (e.g., 2000, 10000 tokens) to assess scalability and budget-dependent dynamics
2. Test additional mitigation strategies, such as dynamic token limiting or adaptive prompting, to compare efficacy against the fixed conciseness reminder
3. Conduct ablation studies on model families to identify architectural or training-related factors that influence overflow susceptibility
