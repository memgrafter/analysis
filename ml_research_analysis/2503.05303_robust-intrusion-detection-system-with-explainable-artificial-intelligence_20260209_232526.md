# Robust Intrusion Detection System with Explainable Artificial Intelligence

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.05303
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05303
- Reference count: 15
- Primary result: SHAP-based XAI approach detects adversarial attacks in 5G networks with 0.9259 accuracy and 0.8654 F1-score

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical vulnerability of machine learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) to adversarial attacks in 5G and beyond mobile network environments. The proposed solution integrates Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) through SHAP feature importance values to detect adversarial attacks in real-time by analyzing deviations in SHAP value distributions from normal training patterns. The approach was validated in an O-RAN infrastructure setup for detecting RRC signaling storm attacks, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods. A novel zero-touch mitigation strategy relying on anticipated adversarial examples is introduced to strengthen IDS defenses against complex threats.

## Method Summary
The core methodology introduces a SHAP-based approach for real-time adversarial attack detection in ML-based IDS. The system analyzes SHAP feature importance values to identify deviations from normal training data patterns, enabling early detection of manipulated network traffic. The framework was implemented and tested within an O-RAN infrastructure environment, specifically targeting RRC signaling storm attacks. The approach leverages XAI to provide interpretability of model decisions while simultaneously using these explanations as detection mechanisms for adversarial manipulation.

## Key Results
- SHAP achieved detection accuracy of 0.9259 and F1-score of 0.8654 for RRC signaling storm attack detection
- SHAP outperformed alternative methods including LIME and permutation importance in adversarial attack detection
- The XAI-integrated approach demonstrated effectiveness in real-time detection within O-RAN infrastructure environments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging the fundamental property that adversarial attacks introduce systematic perturbations in feature importance distributions. SHAP values provide consistent, theoretically grounded feature attribution that remains relatively stable under normal conditions but exhibits detectable deviations when adversarial manipulation occurs. By establishing baseline SHAP distributions from clean training data, the system can identify outliers and anomalies that indicate potential attacks. This transforms XAI from a purely explanatory tool into an active defense mechanism, where the very interpretability that makes models vulnerable becomes their protection mechanism.

## Foundational Learning

1. **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** - Why needed: Provides theoretically grounded feature importance values for ML model interpretability. Quick check: Verify SHAP values sum to model output and satisfy local accuracy property.

2. **Adversarial ML Attacks** - Why needed: Understanding attack vectors that manipulate input features to evade detection. Quick check: Test detection system against FGSM, PGD, and C&W attack variants.

3. **O-RAN Architecture** - Why needed: Framework for disaggregated, intelligent radio access networks in 5G. Quick check: Validate compatibility with O-RAN E2 interface and near-real-time RIC.

4. **RRC Signaling Protocols** - Why needed: Critical control plane in mobile networks vulnerable to signaling storms. Quick check: Monitor RRC connection establishment/release message patterns.

5. **XAI for Security** - Why needed: Transforming interpretability from vulnerability to defensive capability. Quick check: Evaluate whether XAI explanations themselves can be attacked or manipulated.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Network Traffic -> Feature Extraction -> ML Model -> SHAP Analysis -> Anomaly Detection -> Mitigation Decision

Critical path: Real-time traffic flows through feature extraction, model inference, SHAP computation, and anomaly comparison against baseline distributions. Any deviation triggers mitigation response.

Design tradeoffs: Accuracy vs. computational overhead in real-time SHAP computation; comprehensive attack detection vs. false positive rates; interpretability depth vs. processing latency.

Failure signatures: Consistent false positives during high traffic variance; delayed detection during sophisticated evasion attacks; performance degradation under high-throughput conditions; SHAP value instability with non-stationary data distributions.

Three first experiments:
1. Baseline characterization: Capture and analyze SHAP distributions for normal RRC traffic across different time periods and load conditions.
2. Attack simulation: Generate synthetic adversarial examples using gradient-based methods and measure SHAP deviation patterns.
3. Comparative evaluation: Test SHAP-based detection against LIME and permutation importance methods using identical attack scenarios and metrics.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations

- Evaluation focused on single attack type (RRC signaling storm) and network domain, limiting generalizability
- Zero-touch mitigation strategy remains theoretical without practical implementation or real-world testing
- Computational overhead of real-time SHAP analysis for large-scale 5G networks not addressed
- No assessment of evasion techniques targeting SHAP value manipulation itself
- Training data distribution assumptions may not hold in dynamic 5G environments

## Confidence

Core methodology confidence: Medium-High
Generalizability confidence: Low-Medium
Zero-touch mitigation confidence: Low

## Next Checks

1. Test the SHAP-based detection framework against multiple attack types (DDoS, spoofing, man-in-the-middle) and in heterogeneous 5G deployment scenarios to validate cross-domain robustness.

2. Implement and evaluate the proposed zero-touch mitigation strategy in a production-grade testbed to measure response time, false positive impact, and system overhead.

3. Conduct adversarial training specifically targeting SHAP value manipulation to assess whether attackers can craft examples that evade detection while maintaining malicious functionality.
