# Knowledge Graph-Driven Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Integrating Deepseek-R1 with Weaviate for Advanced Chatbot Applications

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2502.11108
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11108
- **Reference count**: 9
- **Primary result**: Knowledge graph-driven RAG framework integrating DeepSeek-R1 with Weaviate enhances biomedical chatbot accuracy for AMD by reducing hallucinations and improving factual precision.

## Executive Summary
This study presents a knowledge graph-driven retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that integrates DeepSeek-R1 with Weaviate to enhance biomedical chatbot accuracy for age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The system extracts and refines causal relations and named entities from medical abstracts, stores them in a structured knowledge graph, and uses semantic embeddings for retrieval. By grounding LLM responses in verified clinical evidence, the approach significantly reduces hallucinations and improves factual precision. Experimental results demonstrate enhanced response clarity and reliability, making the system a robust solution for advanced biomedical chatbot applications.

## Method Summary
The framework combines knowledge graph construction with RAG by first extracting causal relations and named entities from biomedical literature. These extracted elements are refined and stored in a structured knowledge graph. Weaviate serves as the vector database for semantic retrieval, while DeepSeek-R1 provides the language model component. When queries are received, the system retrieves relevant knowledge graph nodes through semantic similarity search, then grounds the LLM response generation in this verified clinical evidence to ensure accuracy and reduce hallucinations.

## Key Results
- Significantly reduced hallucinations compared to standard RAG approaches
- Improved factual precision in biomedical responses about AMD
- Enhanced response clarity through grounding in structured clinical evidence

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages the complementary strengths of knowledge graphs and RAG: knowledge graphs provide structured, verified relationships between biomedical concepts, while RAG enables efficient retrieval of relevant information. By integrating DeepSeek-R1's reasoning capabilities with Weaviate's semantic search, the system can identify and retrieve precise causal relationships and entities from the knowledge graph. This structured approach grounds LLM responses in factual clinical evidence rather than relying solely on parametric knowledge, thereby reducing hallucinations and improving response accuracy for complex biomedical queries.

## Foundational Learning
- **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Extracting and structuring causal relationships from unstructured text
  - *Why needed*: Enables precise representation of biomedical relationships for accurate retrieval
  - *Quick check*: Verify graph connectivity and relationship accuracy using sample queries

- **Semantic Embeddings for Retrieval**: Converting biomedical concepts to vector representations for similarity search
  - *Why needed*: Allows efficient matching of query context to relevant knowledge graph nodes
  - *Quick check*: Test embedding quality by measuring nearest-neighbor accuracy

- **Causal Relationship Extraction**: Identifying cause-effect relationships between biomedical entities
  - *Why needed*: Provides the logical structure necessary for accurate medical reasoning
  - *Quick check*: Validate extracted relationships against ground truth clinical data

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Medical Abstracts -> Entity Extraction -> Causal Relationship Extraction -> Knowledge Graph -> Weaviate Vector DB -> Semantic Retrieval -> DeepSeek-R1 LLM -> Response Generation

**Critical Path**: Query Input -> Weaviate Semantic Search -> Knowledge Graph Node Retrieval -> Context Augmentation -> DeepSeek-R1 Generation -> Response Output

**Design Tradeoffs**: Knowledge graph precision vs. retrieval coverage; DeepSeek-R1's reasoning depth vs. computational cost; Weaviate's indexing speed vs. query accuracy

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Missing knowledge graph nodes → incomplete responses
- Poor semantic embeddings → irrelevant retrievals
- Over-aggressive filtering → reduced coverage
- LLM hallucinations despite grounding → insufficient context

**First Experiments**:
1. Test entity extraction accuracy on 50 biomedical abstracts using precision/recall metrics
2. Validate semantic search retrieval by measuring hit rate for known relationships
3. Compare hallucination rates between baseline RAG and knowledge graph-augmented responses

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation focused exclusively on age-related macular degeneration, limiting generalizability to other medical domains
- Lacks quantitative performance metrics to substantiate claims of improved accuracy and reduced hallucinations
- Sparse experimental setup details regarding knowledge graph size, test query methodology, and scalability assessment

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The conceptual framework combining knowledge graphs with RAG for biomedical applications is sound and well-motivated
- **Medium Confidence**: The integration of DeepSeek-R1 with Weaviate for semantic retrieval is technically feasible based on existing RAG literature
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about improved factual precision and reduced hallucinations lack empirical support without specific performance metrics

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a quantitative evaluation across multiple medical domains beyond AMD, measuring precision, recall, and hallucination rates with statistical significance testing
2. Implement ablation studies comparing the knowledge graph-driven approach against baseline RAG systems using identical datasets and evaluation metrics
3. Perform scalability testing with knowledge graphs of varying sizes (100 to 10,000+ nodes) to assess performance degradation and memory requirements
