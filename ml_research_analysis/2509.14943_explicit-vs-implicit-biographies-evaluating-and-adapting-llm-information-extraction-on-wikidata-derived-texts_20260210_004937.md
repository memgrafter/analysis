# Explicit vs. Implicit Biographies: Evaluating and Adapting LLM Information Extraction on Wikidata-Derived Texts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.14943
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14943
- Reference count: 7
- Primary result: Fine-tuning on combined explicit/implicit data improves implicit reasoning by 20-35 percentage points

## Executive Summary
This study investigates how textual implicitness affects large language models' (LLMs) performance in information extraction (IE) tasks. The researchers created synthetic datasets containing 10,000 implicit and explicit biographical descriptions derived from Wikidata. They found that LLMs struggle significantly more with extracting information from implicit texts compared to explicit ones, with a 14.6% failure rate (NaN outputs) for implicit versus 1.3% for explicit descriptions. To address this, they applied LoRA fine-tuning to three models (LLaMA 3.2-1B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and Phi-1.5), demonstrating that models trained on both explicit and implicit data achieved accuracy rates of 93.3-93.0% on implicit reasoning tasks, compared to 71.6-58.1% for models trained only on explicit data.

## Method Summary
The researchers created synthetic biographical texts by generating both explicit and implicit versions from Wikidata entries. They extracted triples (subject, predicate, object) and created explicit descriptions stating the information directly, then generated implicit versions by removing or transforming explicit information markers. They fine-tuned three small language models (LLaMA 3.2-1B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and Phi-1.5) using LoRA adapters with two different training strategies: one on explicit data only, and one on combined explicit and implicit data. Performance was evaluated on an implicit reasoning task where models had to extract information from both text types.

## Key Results
- LLMs showed 14.6% failure rate (NaN outputs) on implicit descriptions versus 1.3% on explicit descriptions
- Fine-tuned models achieved 93.3-93.0% accuracy on implicit reasoning tasks when trained on combined data
- Models trained only on explicit data scored 71.6-58.1% accuracy on the same implicit reasoning task
- Exposure to implicit patterns during fine-tuning significantly improved LLMs' ability to handle implicit information extraction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study demonstrates that LLMs can learn to handle implicit information when explicitly trained on both explicit and implicit patterns. The mechanism involves pattern recognition and inference capability development through exposure to transformed implicit structures during fine-tuning. The models appear to learn the mapping between explicit statements and their implicit counterparts, enabling them to infer missing information from context and semantic cues.

## Foundational Learning
**Information Extraction**: The process of automatically extracting structured information from unstructured text - needed to understand the core task being evaluated
**Textual Implicitness**: Information that is conveyed indirectly rather than stated explicitly - critical for understanding the challenge addressed
**LoRA Fine-tuning**: A parameter-efficient method for adapting pre-trained models - essential for understanding the adaptation approach used
**Synthetic Dataset Generation**: Creating controlled datasets with specific properties - important for understanding the experimental design
**Biographic Data Extraction**: Focusing on structured biographical information - relevant for understanding the domain context
**Model Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy measurements for structured extraction tasks - necessary for interpreting the results

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Wikidata triples -> Synthetic text generator -> Explicit/implicit datasets -> LoRA fine-tuning -> Evaluation

**Critical Path**: Data generation → Fine-tuning → Evaluation → Analysis

**Design Tradeoffs**: Used synthetic data for control versus real-world complexity; chose LoRA for efficiency versus full fine-tuning; focused on small models for accessibility versus larger models for potential performance

**Failure Signatures**: NaN outputs indicate extraction failures; accuracy drops signal implicit reasoning difficulties; training instability suggests data quality issues

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Generate 100 explicit and 100 implicit biographical descriptions from Wikidata triples
2. Fine-tune a small model on explicit-only data subset
3. Fine-tune another instance on combined explicit/implicit data subset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Synthetic biographical texts may not capture real-world implicit information complexity
- Exact match accuracy metrics may miss nuanced comprehension differences
- LoRA fine-tuning with 10,000 examples may lack sufficient diversity for robust generalization

## Confidence
**High confidence**: LLMs exhibit significantly lower performance on implicit versus explicit information extraction tasks
**Medium confidence**: Training on combined explicit/implicit data substantially improves implicit reasoning performance
**Low confidence**: Current LLM difficulties with implicit information are primarily due to insufficient training data rather than architectural limitations

## Next Checks
1. Test fine-tuned models on naturally occurring implicit texts from diverse domains (news articles, academic papers, social media)
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing LoRA fine-tuning with full fine-tuning and alternative architectures
3. Implement human evaluation studies to assess genuine comprehension versus surface-level pattern matching
