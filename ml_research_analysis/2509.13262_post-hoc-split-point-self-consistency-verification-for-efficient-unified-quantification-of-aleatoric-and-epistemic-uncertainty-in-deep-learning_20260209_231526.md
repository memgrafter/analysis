core_contribution: This paper addresses the challenge of efficiently quantifying both
  aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in deep learning models. Existing methods are
  either computationally intensive (e.g., Bayesian or ensemble methods) or provide
  only partial, task-specific estimates (e.g., single-forward-pass techniques).

# Post-Hoc Split-Point Self-Consistency Verification for Efficient, Unified Quantification of Aleatoric and Epistemic Uncertainty in Deep Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.13262
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13262
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proposed post-hoc single-forward-pass framework quantifies both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in deep learning without modifying pretrained models

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel post-hoc framework for quantifying both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in deep learning models using a single forward pass. The method, called Split-Point Analysis (SPA), decomposes predictive residuals into upper and lower subsets and computes Mean Absolute Residuals (MARs) on each side. Under ideal conditions, the total MAR equals the harmonic mean of subset MARs, with deviations defining a novel "Self-consistency Discrepancy Score" (SDS) for fine-grained epistemic estimation. The framework demonstrates improved empirical coverage for regression tasks and enhanced calibration for classification through softmax output adjustment.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework leverages Split-Point Analysis to quantify both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in deep learning models. For regression tasks, side-specific quantile regression yields prediction intervals that are calibrated via the Self-consistency Discrepancy Score. For classification, when calibration data is available, SPA-based calibration identities adjust softmax outputs before computing predictive entropy. The method operates post-hoc on pretrained models without requiring modifications or retraining, making it computationally efficient compared to Bayesian or ensemble approaches. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks show the framework matches or exceeds state-of-the-art UQ methods while maintaining minimal computational overhead.

## Key Results
- Joint quantification of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty through a single forward pass
- Improved empirical coverage for regression prediction intervals via quantile regression and SDS calibration
- Enhanced classification calibration through SPA-based adjustment of softmax outputs
- Computational efficiency matching or exceeding state-of-the-art UQ methods with minimal overhead

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by decomposing predictive residuals into upper and lower subsets through Split-Point Analysis. Under ideal conditions, the total Mean Absolute Residual (MAR) equals the harmonic mean of the subset MARs. Deviations from this ideal relationship are captured by the Self-consistency Discrepancy Score (SDS), which provides fine-grained epistemic uncertainty estimation. For regression, quantile regression generates prediction intervals that are further calibrated using SDS. For classification, calibration data enables SPA-based adjustment of softmax outputs, followed by entropy computation on calibrated probabilities. This unified approach captures both inherent data uncertainty (aleatoric) and model uncertainty (epistemic) through a single forward pass.

## Foundational Learning

**Split-Point Analysis (SPA)**: Decomposition of predictive residuals into upper and lower subsets to analyze uncertainty patterns
- Why needed: Enables separate quantification of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty components
- Quick check: Verify residual distribution symmetry and identify split points where residuals change behavior

**Self-consistency Discrepancy Score (SDS)**: Metric measuring deviation from ideal harmonic mean relationship between total and subset MARs
- Why needed: Quantifies epistemic uncertainty through inconsistency in residual decomposition
- Quick check: Calculate SDS across multiple split points and verify correlation with known uncertainty levels

**Quantile Regression**: Technique for estimating prediction intervals in regression tasks
- Why needed: Provides side-specific uncertainty bounds for aleatoric uncertainty quantification
- Quick check: Evaluate empirical coverage of prediction intervals against true data distribution

**Predictive Entropy**: Measure of uncertainty in classification outputs
- Why needed: Captures overall uncertainty in softmax probability distributions
- Quick check: Compare entropy values across calibrated and uncalibrated outputs

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Pretrained Model -> Split-Point Analysis -> MAR Calculation -> SDS Computation -> Uncertainty Quantification
**Critical Path**: Forward pass through pretrained model → Residual calculation → Split-point decomposition → MAR computation → SDS derivation → Uncertainty output
**Design Tradeoffs**: Post-hoc approach preserves model integrity but requires careful calibration; single forward pass ensures efficiency but may miss some uncertainty patterns; quantile regression adds computational overhead for regression tasks
**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on multi-modal distributions; over-reliance on calibration data quality; sensitivity to residual distribution assumptions
**First Experiments**:
1. Test residual decomposition on synthetic datasets with known aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty components
2. Evaluate SDS sensitivity to different split-point selection strategies
3. Compare calibration effectiveness across datasets with varying calibration data availability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several open questions regarding the generalizability of the SPA framework across diverse real-world datasets and tasks, particularly for complex multi-modal distributions where residual decomposition may not cleanly capture aleatoric uncertainty. It also questions the framework's performance when residual distributions deviate from well-behaved assumptions and explores strategies for classification tasks when calibration data is limited or unavailable.

## Limitations
- Performance may degrade on complex multi-modal distributions where residual decomposition assumptions break down
- Classification effectiveness depends heavily on availability and quality of calibration data
- Initial quantile regression step for regression tasks may introduce computational overhead not fully addressed
- Limited performance comparison to only specific benchmark datasets, raising questions about domain robustness

| Improved empirical coverage for regression | Medium |
| Robustness across diverse real-world datasets | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the framework's performance on real-world datasets with complex, multi-modal distributions to assess robustness beyond benchmark datasets.
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the impact of the quantile regression step on overall computational efficiency in regression tasks.
3. Test the classification calibration approach on datasets with limited or no calibration data to understand performance degradation and potential mitigation strategies.
