# Generative AI Meets Wireless Sensing: Towards Wireless Foundation Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.15258
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15258
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Comprehensive survey on integrating generative AI into wireless sensing systems, proposing pathways toward unified wireless foundation models

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive survey on the integration of generative AI into wireless sensing systems. It examines how generative models like GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models can be applied to improve wireless sensing tasks such as localization, activity recognition, and environmental reconstruction. The paper categorizes approaches into two main modes: using generative AI as a plugin to augment existing models or as a solver to directly address sensing tasks. It highlights the potential of generative AI in addressing challenges such as data scarcity and model generalization in wireless sensing. The survey also outlines future directions toward a unified wireless foundation model that leverages self-supervised pretraining, efficient fine-tuning, and cross-modal generation to enable scalable and adaptable sensing systems.

## Method Summary
The paper conducts a systematic survey of existing literature on generative AI applications in wireless sensing, categorizing approaches into plugin and solver modes. It analyzes various generative model architectures (GANs, VAEs, diffusion models) and their applications across different sensing tasks including localization, activity recognition, and environmental reconstruction. The survey identifies key challenges in the field such as data scarcity, model generalization, and scalability, while proposing future directions toward a unified wireless foundation model framework that integrates self-supervised pretraining, efficient fine-tuning, and cross-modal generation capabilities.

## Key Results
- Generative AI can address data scarcity challenges in wireless sensing through data augmentation and synthetic data generation
- Two distinct operational modes identified: generative AI as plugin augmentation and generative AI as direct solver
- Proposed unified wireless foundation model framework incorporating self-supervised pretraining and cross-modal generation capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper identifies that generative AI models can effectively address core challenges in wireless sensing by leveraging their ability to learn complex data distributions and generate realistic synthetic samples. GANs and diffusion models excel at capturing the statistical properties of wireless signals, enabling data augmentation when real-world training data is limited. VAEs provide latent space representations that can be used for efficient data compression and reconstruction. These capabilities are particularly valuable in wireless sensing where signal variations due to environmental factors, device heterogeneity, and temporal dynamics create significant data scarcity and generalization challenges.

## Foundational Learning
- Wireless signal propagation fundamentals - why needed: Understanding signal behavior is crucial for interpreting how generative models can augment sensing tasks; quick check: Verify models capture multipath effects and environmental interference patterns
- Generative model architectures (GANs, VAEs, diffusion) - why needed: Different architectures offer distinct advantages for various sensing modalities; quick check: Evaluate trade-offs between generation quality and computational efficiency
- Self-supervised learning in wireless contexts - why needed: Enables pretraining on unlabeled wireless data to overcome scarcity; quick check: Assess performance improvements when fine-tuning from self-supervised pretraining

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Raw wireless signals -> Signal preprocessing -> Generative model (GAN/VAE/diffusion) -> Task-specific network -> Sensing output
- Critical path: Data preprocessing and feature extraction -> Generative augmentation -> Task model training -> Inference pipeline
- Design tradeoffs: Generation quality vs. computational efficiency; model complexity vs. deployment constraints; synthetic data realism vs. task-specific performance
- Failure signatures: Mode collapse in GANs leading to unrealistic signal patterns; VAE posterior collapse reducing reconstruction quality; diffusion models requiring excessive computational resources
- First experiments: 1) Compare data augmentation performance using GAN vs. diffusion models for localization accuracy; 2) Evaluate cross-modal generation between RF signals and environmental features; 3) Test self-supervised pretraining impact on activity recognition with limited labeled data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several open questions regarding the practical implementation of wireless foundation models, including how to effectively integrate multi-modal data sources, what efficient fine-tuning strategies work best for resource-constrained devices, and how to ensure cross-domain generalization across different wireless environments and sensing tasks.

## Limitations
