core_contribution: This work addresses the problem of protecting static images from
  misuse in diffusion-based image-to-video (I2V) generation models, which can synthesize
  realistic videos from still images and pose privacy, security, and intellectual
  property risks. The authors propose Vid-Freeze, a novel attention-suppressing adversarial
  attack that adds carefully crafted perturbations to images to completely block motion
  synthesis while preserving the semantic fidelity of the input image.

# Vid-Freeze: Protecting Images from Malicious Image-to-Video Generation via Temporal Freezing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.23279
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23279
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Vid-Freeze achieves near-zero temporal SSIM (0.0056) and flow magnitude (0.0497) on CogVideoX-2B, preventing motion synthesis while preserving image semantics

## Executive Summary
This work introduces Vid-Freeze, a novel defense mechanism that protects static images from malicious misuse in diffusion-based image-to-video generation models. The method applies carefully crafted adversarial perturbations to images that specifically target and suppress the attention mechanisms within I2V models, effectively freezing generated videos while maintaining the original image's semantic content. Experiments demonstrate that immunized images produce nearly static videos even under low perturbation budgets, providing strong protection against harmful video generation. The approach outperforms previous defenses like I2VGuard and shows promise for addressing privacy, security, and intellectual property concerns in the emerging I2V generation landscape.

## Method Summary
Vid-Freeze employs an attention-suppressing adversarial attack that adds imperceptible perturbations to static images, specifically designed to block motion synthesis in diffusion-based image-to-video models. The method explicitly targets the attention mechanism within I2V models, causing generated videos to remain frozen or nearly static while preserving the semantic fidelity of the input image. The adversarial perturbations are optimized to maximize temporal dissimilarity and minimize optical flow magnitude in the generated videos, effectively preventing any meaningful motion from being synthesized. The approach is evaluated on a curated dataset of 50 images using the CogVideoX-2B model, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing defenses.

## Key Results
- Achieves near-zero temporal SSIM (0.0056) and flow magnitude (0.0497) even with low perturbation budgets
- Outperforms prior defenses like I2VGuard in preventing motion synthesis
- Successfully preserves semantic fidelity of input images while blocking video generation
- Qualitative results confirm immunized images produce static videos, demonstrating strong protection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Vid-Freeze works by exploiting the attention mechanisms that are fundamental to diffusion-based image-to-video generation models. The method adds adversarial perturbations that specifically interfere with how these models attend to spatial-temporal features during video synthesis. By disrupting the attention patterns, the perturbations prevent the model from properly propagating motion information from the still image, effectively freezing the generated output. This approach is particularly effective because attention mechanisms are central to how I2V models interpret and extend static images into dynamic sequences, making them a critical vulnerability that can be exploited for protection purposes.

## Foundational Learning

**Attention Mechanisms**: The core operation in transformer-based models that determines how different parts of input data influence each other. Needed to understand how Vid-Freeze targets the fundamental processing units of I2V models. Quick check: Verify that the perturbation specifically reduces attention weights in key layers.

**Adversarial Perturbations**: Carefully crafted noise added to inputs that causes models to malfunction while remaining imperceptible to humans. Essential for understanding how Vid-Freeze maintains image quality while blocking video generation. Quick check: Confirm perturbations stay within acceptable L-infinity bounds.

**Diffusion Models**: Generative models that learn to reverse a noising process, commonly used for high-quality image and video synthesis. Important background for understanding the target of Vid-Freeze's protection. Quick check: Validate that the defense works across different diffusion model variants.

**Temporal SSIM**: Structural similarity index measured across video frames to quantify motion and temporal coherence. Critical metric for evaluating how effectively Vid-Freeze prevents motion synthesis. Quick check: Ensure temporal SSIM remains near zero for immunized images.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Image -> Vid-Freeze Perturbation -> Immunized Image -> I2V Model -> Frozen Video Output

**Critical Path**: The perturbation generation process is the critical path, as it must successfully suppress attention mechanisms while maintaining image quality. This involves gradient-based optimization that balances attack effectiveness against imperceptibility constraints.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The primary tradeoff involves perturbation strength versus imperceptibility - stronger perturbations provide better protection but risk visible artifacts. Vid-Freeze optimizes for low perturbation budgets while maintaining high protection levels, though this may limit effectiveness against adaptive attackers.

**Failure Signatures**: If Vid-Freeze fails, videos may show partial motion synthesis, artifacts around perturbed regions, or complete loss of image semantic fidelity. The method may also be vulnerable to adaptive attacks that modify attention mechanisms or use alternative generation strategies.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test Vid-Freeze against multiple I2V models (e.g., Pika, RunwayML, Stable Video Diffusion) to assess cross-model effectiveness
2. Conduct large-scale perceptual studies with human evaluators to verify perturbation imperceptibility across diverse image categories
3. Perform stress testing with adaptive attackers who modify I2V architectures to bypass attention suppression defenses

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Effectiveness may not generalize across different I2V models beyond the tested CogVideoX-2B
- Evaluation on relatively small dataset of 50 curated images may not capture full real-world diversity
- Potential vulnerability to adaptive attackers who modify I2V architectures or training procedures

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Core adversarial attack mechanism targeting attention layers, experimental methodology, and quantitative results on tested model

**Medium confidence**: Effectiveness against unknown or future I2V models, real-world applicability, and robustness to potential adaptive attacks

**Medium confidence**: Claimed imperceptibility of perturbations and preservation of semantic fidelity across all image types

## Next Checks
1. Test Vid-Freeze against multiple I2V models (e.g., Pika, RunwayML, Stable Video Diffusion) to assess cross-model effectiveness and identify potential failure modes
2. Conduct large-scale perceptual studies with human evaluators across diverse image categories to verify perturbation imperceptibility and semantic preservation claims
3. Perform stress testing with adaptive attackers who may modify I2V architectures or training procedures to bypass attention suppression defenses
