# SNOMED CT-powered Knowledge Graphs for Structured Clinical Data and Diagnostic Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.16899
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16899
- Reference count: 25
- Knowledge-driven framework integrating SNOMED CT terminology with Neo4j graph databases for improved AI diagnostic reasoning

## Executive Summary
This study presents a knowledge-driven framework that combines SNOMED CT clinical terminology with Neo4j graph databases to structure clinical data and enhance AI-based diagnostic reasoning. The approach represents diseases, symptoms, and treatments as interconnected nodes and edges, enabling multi-hop reasoning while maintaining terminological consistency. A JSON-formatted dataset derived from clinical records is used to fine-tune large language models, resulting in significantly improved clinical logic consistency in AI-generated diagnoses.

## Method Summary
The framework integrates SNOMED CT terminology with Neo4j graph databases to create structured representations of clinical data. Clinical entities are mapped to SNOMED CT concepts and stored as nodes with semantic relationships as edges. This structured knowledge graph enables multi-hop reasoning capabilities. Clinical records are transformed into JSON format and used to fine-tune large language models, improving their diagnostic reasoning capabilities while maintaining clinical logic consistency.

## Key Results
- Demonstrated enhanced accuracy and completeness of AI-generated diagnoses through structured knowledge representation
- Improved clinical logic consistency in AI outputs after fine-tuning with structured clinical data
- Showed potential for scalable implementation in reliable AI-assisted clinical systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages structured knowledge representation to provide AI systems with explicit clinical relationships and hierarchies. By encoding clinical knowledge as interconnected graphs rather than unstructured text, the system can perform multi-hop reasoning across related clinical concepts. This structured approach reduces ambiguity and ensures terminological consistency, which directly addresses common failures in clinical AI reasoning where context and relationships between concepts are lost.

## Foundational Learning
- SNOMED CT terminology mapping - Essential for standardizing clinical concepts across different healthcare systems and ensuring semantic interoperability
  * Quick check: Verify that all clinical entities are correctly mapped to existing SNOMED CT concepts
- Neo4j graph database operations - Required for efficient storage and traversal of clinical knowledge relationships
  * Quick check: Test graph query performance with increasing numbers of clinical records
- Multi-hop reasoning patterns - Critical for capturing complex clinical relationships beyond immediate symptom-disease associations
  * Quick check: Validate reasoning chains by comparing with clinical expert knowledge

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Clinical Records -> SNOMED CT Mapping -> Neo4j Graph Database -> JSON Transformation -> LLM Fine-tuning -> Diagnostic Reasoning

**Critical Path:** The most critical sequence is Clinical Records → SNOMED CT Mapping → Neo4j Graph Database, as errors in terminology mapping or graph construction will propagate through all subsequent stages and compromise the entire reasoning system.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The choice of Neo4j provides excellent support for graph traversals and relationship queries but may face scalability challenges with very large clinical datasets. Alternative approaches like property graph databases or relational databases with graph extensions could offer different performance characteristics.

**Failure Signatures:** Incorrect SNOMED CT mappings will manifest as disconnected graph components or missing relationships. Poor LLM fine-tuning will show as hallucinations or inconsistent reasoning patterns. Performance bottlenecks will appear as slow query response times during multi-hop reasoning operations.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Validate SNOMED CT mapping accuracy by comparing mapped concepts against clinical expert annotations
2. Test multi-hop reasoning capabilities with synthetic clinical scenarios of increasing complexity
3. Benchmark graph query performance with varying dataset sizes to establish scalability limits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Experimental validation limited to specific datasets without clear evidence of clinical diversity or real-world complexity
- Scalability concerns for large-scale clinical deployments not explicitly addressed
- Heavy dependence on SNOMED CT mapping quality and completeness, which varies across healthcare systems

## Confidence

**High confidence:** Technical feasibility of SNOMED CT-Neo4j integration approach is well-established
**Medium confidence:** Demonstrated improvements in AI diagnostic reasoning based on available experimental results
**Low confidence:** Scalability and real-world deployment considerations lack sufficient validation

## Next Checks

1. Conduct multi-center validation using diverse clinical datasets from different healthcare systems to assess generalizability across varying SNOMED CT implementation practices
2. Perform scalability testing with millions of clinical records to evaluate Neo4j performance and identify potential bottlenecks in real-world deployment scenarios
3. Implement and evaluate the framework in a controlled clinical setting with actual healthcare professionals to assess practical utility, workflow integration, and impact on diagnostic accuracy compared to existing methods
