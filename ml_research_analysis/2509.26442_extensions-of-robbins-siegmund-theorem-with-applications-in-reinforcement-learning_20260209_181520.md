core_contribution: This paper extends the classical Robbins-Siegmund theorem to handle
  almost supermartingales with zero-order terms that are only square-summable, addressing
  a critical gap in analyzing modern stochastic approximation and reinforcement learning
  algorithms. The key innovation is introducing a novel and mild assumption on the
  increments of stochastic processes, which, combined with the square-summable condition,
  enables almost sure convergence to a bounded set.

# Extensions of Robbins-Siegmund Theorem with Applications in Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.26442
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26442
- **Reference count:** 10
- **Key outcome:** Extends Robbins-Siegmund theorem to handle almost supermartingales with square-summable zero-order terms, enabling first-ever almost sure convergence rates, high-probability bounds, and Lp rates for linear Q-learning.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a fundamental limitation in analyzing modern reinforcement learning algorithms by extending the classical Robbins-Siegmund theorem. The key innovation allows convergence analysis when noise terms are only square-summable rather than strictly summable, achieved through a novel assumption on stochastic increment growth. Applied to linear Q-learning with linear function approximation, the framework delivers the first complete convergence characterization, proving that the algorithm converges to a bounded set with explicit rates despite previous concerns about possible divergence.

## Method Summary
The method extends the Robbins-Siegmund theorem by relaxing the summable zero-order term requirement to square-summable, while introducing a linear increment bound on stochastic processes. For linear Q-learning, the authors map the algorithm to stochastic approximation form using skeleton iterates to handle Markovian noise and error decomposition for time-inhomogeneity. The analysis verifies that linear Q-learning satisfies the extended theorem's assumptions, yielding bounded-set convergence with provable rates under standard learning rate schedules and ε-softmax behavior policies.

## Key Results
- First almost sure convergence rate for linear Q-learning to a bounded set
- First high-probability concentration bound for linear Q-learning convergence
- First Lp convergence rate (p ≥ 2) for linear Q-learning with explicit constants
- Resolves long-standing theoretical concerns about linear Q-learning stability without algorithmic modifications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Controlling stochastic increment growth enables convergence with square-summable noise.
- **Mechanism:** The linear increment bound |z_{n+1} - z_n| ≤ BT_n(z_n + 1) prevents noise "spikes" that would cause divergence under weaker conditions, replacing the need for strict summability.
- **Core assumption:** Increment bound (Theorem 3, A2) - update size scales linearly with current state magnitude and learning rate.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract states square-summable condition with increment assumption enables almost sure convergence; Section 3 proves increment bound is critical for controlling noise growth.
- **Break condition:** If noise variance scales faster than O(T_n z_n), spikes recur and convergence fails.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Iterates converge to bounded set rather than single fixed point with persistent noise.
- **Mechanism:** The drift term cannot shrink error to zero under relaxed conditions, proving convergence to distance zero from bounded interval [0, ξ/α].
- **Core assumption:** Negative drift when outside bounded set (Theorem 4, A3) - x_n - y_n ≤ -c_n(z_n - B_4).
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract emphasizes convergence to bounded set; Section 3 proof shows contradiction if limit exceeds set boundary.
- **Break condition:** If noise/drift term ξ is too large relative to contraction strength α, target set becomes effectively infinite.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Linear Q-learning stability achieved by mapping to extended Robbins-Siegmund template.
- **Mechanism:** Skeleton iterates examine subsequence w_{t_m} to handle Markovian noise; error decomposition manages time-inhomogeneity, forcing SA update into required (RS-Special) form.
- **Core assumption:** Geometric Markov chain mixing (Assumption 5.1) and sufficient negativity from expected update direction (Assumption 5.4).
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 5 describes skeleton iterates technique; Section 6 maps linear Q-learning to SA and verifies assumptions.
- **Break condition:** Insufficient exploration violating irreducibility breaks mixing time bounds and skeleton iterate construction.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** **Almost Supermartingales**
  - **Why needed here:** The entire paper extends Robbins-Siegmund theorem for these processes, allowing positive perturbation terms (x_n) unlike standard supermartingales.
  - **Quick check question:** In E_n[z_{n+1}] ≤ (1+a_n)z_n + x_n - y_n, what happens if x_n is summable vs. non-summable?

- **Concept:** **Robbins-Monro Conditions**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper addresses "square summable" learning rate regime (∑α_t^2 < ∞ but ∑α_t = ∞) which is standard in RL but problematic for original RS theorem.
  - **Quick check question:** Why is ∑α_t = ∞ required for convergence, and why does ∑α_t^2 < ∞ help dampen noise?

- **Concept:** **Convergence to a Set vs. Point**
  - **Why needed here:** Standard RL theory seeks convergence to optimal point w*, but this paper proves linear Q-learning stays within bounded ball B(B_9), resolving divergence issues.
  - **Quick check question:** Does d(w_t, B) → 0 imply w_t converges to single limit point inside B?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Theorem Core (Theory) → Analysis Bridge (Method) → Application Layer (RL)
- **Critical path:** When analyzing new RL algorithm, must verify increment bound (Theorem 3, A2) for update rule. If |z_{n+1} - z_n| grows faster than O(T_n z_n), theory collapses.
- **Design tradeoffs:** Trades exact convergence (to optimal weights) for stability (boundedness). Linear Q-learning won't diverge but may oscillate within bounded set rather than finding precise optimum.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Explosive Noise: If noise scales with state-squared, linear increment bound violated
  - Slow Mixing: If Markov chain doesn't mix fast enough, bias term in skeleton iterates cannot be bounded by T_m^2
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Replicate Boundedness: Implement Linear Q-learning with ε-softmax, plot ||w_t|| over time to verify stays within theoretical bound B_9
  2. Vary Learning Rates: Test LR1 vs LR2 regimes to observe convergence rate differences vs. concentration bounds
  3. Stress Assumptions: Reduce exploration or increase feature correlation to see if iterates escape bounded set

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Can high-probability concentration bounds and Lp convergence rates for (RS-Special) be extended to general (RS) almost supermartingale form?
  - **Basis:** Authors state counterparts of Theorem 6 and Corollary 7 are not provided for (RS) because structure in Assumption 4.1 cannot be embedded
  - **Why unresolved:** Induction techniques for exponential tail bounds depend on specific step-size structure not yet mapped to general (RS)
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Formal proof deriving high-probability concentration bound for general (RS) without summable zero-order term

- **Open Question 2:** Can convergence analysis be extended to nonlinear function approximation (e.g., neural networks)?
  - **Basis:** Conclusion lists extending analysis to nonlinear function approximation as promising direction
  - **Why unresolved:** Current application relies on linear properties to satisfy increment conditions and growth bounds
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Proof of almost sure convergence rates for stochastic approximation using nonlinear function approximator

- **Open Question 3:** How can precise convergence characterizations be utilized to design adaptive learning rate algorithms?
  - **Basis:** Conclusion identifies developing adaptive algorithms exploiting precise convergence characterization as future direction
  - **Why unresolved:** Paper focuses on theoretical rates for fixed learning rate schedules rather than dynamic tuning
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Adaptive algorithm design utilizing derived Lp rates or distance-to-set metrics to adjust step sizes in real-time

## Limitations
- The linear increment bound assumption (A2) is non-trivial to verify for algorithms beyond linear Q-learning and may fail for super-linear noise growth
- Bounded-set convergence is weaker than point convergence, and explicit bounds depend on unspecified constants limiting practical applicability
- The framework relies on strong Lipschitz continuity assumptions that may not hold in practical scenarios with complex function approximation

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Theoretical framework for almost supermartingales is mathematically rigorous with sound proof structure
- **Medium Confidence:** Empirical validation lacks implementation details and specific parameter values
- **Medium Confidence:** Convergence rates and concentration bounds derived under strict conditions that may not hold in practice

## Next Validation Checks
1. **Increment Bound Verification:** Test linear increment bound (A2) on synthetic examples with varying noise characteristics to determine practical limitations
2. **Boundedness in Adversarial Environments:** Implement linear Q-learning on known counterexamples (e.g., Baird's counterexample) to verify whether iterates remain within theoretical bound B_9
3. **Rate Sensitivity Analysis:** Vary learning rate parameters (ν, κ_0) to empirically validate convergence rate claims and identify thresholds where theoretical assumptions break down
