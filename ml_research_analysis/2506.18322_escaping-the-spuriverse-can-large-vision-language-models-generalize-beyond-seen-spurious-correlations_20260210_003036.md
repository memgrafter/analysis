# Escaping the SpuriVerse: Can Large Vision-Language Models Generalize Beyond Seen Spurious Correlations?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.18322
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18322
- Reference count: 20
- Primary result: SpuriVerse benchmark shows LVLMs struggle with spurious correlations (max 37.1% accuracy) but can improve to 78.4% with fine-tuning, at the cost of non-spurious accuracy.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SpuriVerse, a benchmark designed to evaluate how vision-language models (LVLMs) rely on spurious correlations in visual question answering tasks. The benchmark was created by analyzing GPT-4o's errors on existing VQA datasets, identifying cases caused by spurious features, and generating synthetic counterfactual images to verify these correlations. Evaluations across 15 state-of-the-art LVLMs revealed that even top models struggled with spurious patterns, achieving at best 37.1% accuracy. The authors demonstrate that fine-tuning on diverse spurious examples can significantly improve robustness to held-out spurious patterns (up to 78.4% accuracy), but this comes at the cost of reduced accuracy on non-spurious samples, revealing a fundamental trade-off between robustness and overall performance.

## Method Summary
The SpuriVerse benchmark was constructed through a five-step pipeline: first, collecting GPT-4o errors from existing VQA benchmarks; second, verifying spurious correlations through human and model annotation; third, generating counterfactual scene descriptions; fourth, creating synthetic images using Stable Diffusion XL; and fifth, filtering samples based on accuracy gaps (≥30% difference between core and spurious conditions). The final benchmark contains 124 types of spurious correlations, each with 1 original and 10 synthetic image-question-answer triples. The authors evaluated 15 LVLMs on the benchmark and conducted fine-tuning experiments using Llama-3.2-11B-vision-instruct and Qwen2.5-vl-7b-instruct with LoRA, achieving significant improvements on spurious patterns while observing a trade-off with general performance.

## Key Results
- Even the best LVLM achieved only 37.1% accuracy on the anchor set containing spurious correlations
- Fine-tuning on diverse spurious examples improved accuracy to 78.4% on held-out spurious patterns
- This improvement came at the cost of reduced accuracy on non-spurious samples
- Standard prompting strategies (Chain-of-Thought, Spurious-Aware prompting) failed to improve performance on spurious correlations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark works by systematically identifying and isolating spurious correlations that models learn from training data. By creating counterfactual images that modify only the spurious features while keeping the core visual content constant, the authors can measure whether models rely on these correlations rather than genuine visual understanding. The fine-tuning approach works by exposing models to diverse examples of spurious patterns, teaching them to recognize and ignore these unreliable features.

## Foundational Learning
- **Spurious correlation identification**: Why needed - To isolate features that models incorrectly associate with answers; Quick check - Verify that accuracy gap between core and spurious conditions exceeds 30%
- **Counterfactual image generation**: Why needed - To create controlled test conditions that isolate spurious features; Quick check - Human verification that generated images faithfully represent intended spurious attributes
- **Fine-tuning with LoRA**: Why needed - To efficiently adapt large models to avoid spurious correlations; Quick check - Monitor training loss and validation accuracy on both spurious and non-spurious sets
- **Accuracy gap threshold**: Why needed - To ensure only meaningful spurious correlations are included; Quick check - Confirm that the 30% threshold effectively filters noise while capturing real spurious patterns
- **Multiple model verification**: Why needed - To ensure spurious patterns are not model-specific artifacts; Quick check - Validate that accuracy gaps appear consistently across GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Qwen-VL-Max
- **Mixed training set composition**: Why needed - To study the trade-off between spurious robustness and general performance; Quick check - Compare performance on pure spurious vs. mixed training sets

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: GPT-4o error analysis → Human verification → Scene description generation → Stable Diffusion XL → Accuracy gap filtering → Benchmark construction
- **Critical path**: Error collection → Spurious pattern identification → Counterfactual image generation → Model evaluation → Fine-tuning experiments
- **Design tradeoffs**: Synthetic images provide controlled testing but may not capture all real-world distribution shifts; multiple-choice format limits output space but ensures comparability
- **Failure signatures**: Poor performance on anchor set indicates reliance on spurious correlations; lack of improvement with fine-tuning suggests ineffective training data or hyperparameters
- **First experiments**:
  1. Generate and verify 20-30 synthetic image pairs to ensure faithful representation of spurious attributes
  2. Run initial evaluation on 2-3 LVLMs to confirm the existence of spurious correlation gaps
  3. Test LoRA fine-tuning on a small subset (10 patterns) to verify training pipeline functionality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Can the observed trade-off between accuracy on non-spurious samples and robustness to spurious correlations be eliminated, or is it an inherent limitation of current LVLM architectures?
- Does the susceptibility to spurious correlations manifest differently in open-ended visual generation tasks compared to the multiple-choice VQA format used in SpuriVerse?
- Are there more sophisticated prompt-based interventions that can effectively correct spurious correlations without the need for fine-tuning?

## Limitations
- The benchmark may not capture all possible spurious correlations, as it relies on GPT-4o's error analysis
- Synthetic counterfactual images, while controlled, may not fully represent real-world distribution shifts
- The trade-off between spurious robustness and overall accuracy suggests fine-tuning may be learning to ignore potentially useful visual features

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Benchmark construction methodology is well-documented and reproducible; evaluation results are reliable across multiple models
- **Medium confidence**: Effectiveness of fine-tuning on spurious robustness is demonstrated but generalizability to real-world scenarios remains uncertain
- **Medium confidence**: Claim that models can learn to avoid spurious correlations is supported, but long-term effectiveness and unintended consequences need further investigation

## Next Checks
1. Test the robustness of fine-tuned models on additional out-of-distribution datasets beyond SpuriVerse to verify generalization of spurious correlation avoidance
2. Analyze which specific visual features are being down-weighted during fine-tuning to better understand the trade-off between spurious robustness and overall performance
3. Evaluate the impact of different spurious correlation thresholds (e.g., 20%, 40%) on benchmark construction to assess sensitivity of results to this parameter
