# A Comparative Study of Task Adaptation Techniques of Large Language Models for Identifying Sustainable Development Goals

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.15208
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15208
- Reference count: 40
- Large language models can effectively classify text for SDG identification, with fine-tuned smaller models matching or outperforming much larger ones

## Executive Summary
This study systematically evaluates 18 large language models ranging from 220 million to 1.5 trillion parameters for classifying text according to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The research compares three task adaptation techniques: Zero-Shot Learning, Few-Shot Learning with semantic similarity sampling, and Fine-Tuning. Results demonstrate that optimized smaller models, particularly fine-tuned LLaMa-2 13B, achieve state-of-the-art performance with an F1 score of 92.4%, comparable to or exceeding much larger models. The study also shows that Few-Shot Learning with semantic similarity sampling significantly improves results over random sampling, and that quantized model versions perform competitively, offering resource-efficient alternatives for real-world deployment.

## Method Summary
The study evaluated 18 large language models across three task adaptation techniques for SDG classification. Zero-Shot Learning tested models without task-specific training, Few-Shot Learning used 8-32 examples with semantic similarity-based sampling, and Fine-Tuning trained models on labeled data. Model sizes ranged from 220M to 1.5T parameters, including both proprietary and open-source options. Performance was measured using standard metrics including F1 score on an SDG corpus. The evaluation compared model performance across adaptation techniques, with special attention to the efficiency of smaller quantized models versus larger models.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned LLaMa-2 13B achieved top performance with 92.4% F1 score
- Few-Shot Learning with semantic similarity sampling outperformed random sampling
- Quantized smaller models achieved competitive results compared to larger models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness stems from leveraging task adaptation techniques that optimize the knowledge already encoded in large language models for specific SDG classification tasks. Fine-tuning allows models to specialize their general language understanding for the specific terminology and context of SDGs, while semantic similarity sampling in Few-Shot Learning ensures more representative and relevant examples are used for adaptation. The study demonstrates that model size is not the sole determinant of performance when appropriate adaptation techniques are employed, and that smaller, optimized models can achieve comparable results with lower computational overhead.

## Foundational Learning
- Task adaptation techniques (why needed: to specialize general language models for specific classification tasks; quick check: verify model performance improvement after adaptation)
- Semantic similarity sampling (why needed: to select most representative examples for few-shot learning; quick check: measure performance difference between random and semantic sampling)
- Model quantization (why needed: to reduce computational requirements while maintaining performance; quick check: compare quantized vs full-precision model metrics)
- Zero-shot vs few-shot vs fine-tuning tradeoffs (why needed: to understand resource-accuracy tradeoffs; quick check: analyze performance-resource curves across techniques)
- SDG corpus structure and annotation (why needed: to understand evaluation framework; quick check: verify consistency and completeness of SDG labels)

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
SDG Corpus -> Task Adaptation Technique (ZSL/FSL/FT) -> Large Language Model (size/type) -> Performance Metrics (F1, accuracy)

Critical Path:
SDG Corpus -> Task Adaptation Technique selection -> Model loading/initialization -> Adaptation execution -> Performance evaluation

Design Tradeoffs:
Model size vs performance (larger models generally perform better but require more resources), adaptation technique vs resource requirements (fine-tuning yields best results but requires labeled data and training), precision vs efficiency (quantized models save resources but may slightly reduce accuracy), proprietary vs open-source models (tradeoff between performance and accessibility)

Failure Signatures:
Poor performance may indicate inadequate task adaptation technique selection, insufficient or unrepresentative training data, model architecture mismatch with task requirements, or suboptimal hyperparameter settings during fine-tuning

First Experiments:
1. Benchmark Zero-Shot performance baseline for all models on SDG corpus
2. Implement semantic similarity sampling and compare Few-Shot results against random sampling
3. Fine-tune smallest model with promising initial results and compare against larger models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on a single SDG corpus, limiting generalizability
- Potential biases in model outputs not extensively addressed for diverse linguistic contexts
- Computational resource requirements for fine-tuning very large models not detailed

## Confidence

High: Comparative performance rankings between adaptation techniques (ZSL, FSL, FT) and semantic similarity sampling superiority

Medium: Generalizability of specific model performance rankings to other SDG-related tasks

Low: Long-term stability of model performance and assessment of concept drift in SDG-related language use

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-corpus validation using multiple SDG-related datasets from different domains
2. Implement bias detection and mitigation protocols for multilingual SDG monitoring
3. Perform cost-benefit analysis comparing inference costs of quantized smaller models versus larger models for sustained deployment scenarios
