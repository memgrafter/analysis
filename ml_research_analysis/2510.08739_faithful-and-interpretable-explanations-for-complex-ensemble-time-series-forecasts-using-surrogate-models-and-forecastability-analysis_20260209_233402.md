# Faithful and Interpretable Explanations for Complex Ensemble Time Series Forecasts using Surrogate Models and Forecastability Analysis

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.08739
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08739
- **Reference count:** 4
- **Primary result:** Uses surrogate LightGBM models with TreeSHAP to explain complex ensemble time series forecasts while incorporating forecastability analysis

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of interpreting black-box ensemble time series forecasting models like AutoGluon by introducing a surrogate-based explanation framework. The method trains a LightGBM surrogate model to faithfully mimic the ensemble forecasts, then applies TreeSHAP to generate interpretable feature attributions. The approach is validated through synthetic experiments showing high correlation (0.961) between SHAP values and ground truth effects, and demonstrates that forecastability analysis can quantify the intrinsic predictability of time series, correlating with both forecast accuracy and explanation fidelity.

## Method Summary
The core methodology involves training a LightGBM surrogate model to approximate the predictions of complex ensemble forecasting models (specifically AutoGluon). Once trained, TreeSHAP is applied to the surrogate to extract interpretable feature attributions that explain the forecast decisions. The paper introduces forecastability analysis using spectral methods to quantify the intrinsic predictability of each time series. A critical technical contribution is the demonstration that per-item normalization is essential for generating meaningful explanations across heterogeneous time series with varying scales.

## Key Results
- Surrogate model achieves Pearson correlation of 0.961 with ground truth effects in synthetic experiments
- Forecastability metric correlates strongly with both forecast accuracy and surrogate fidelity
- Per-item normalization is necessary for meaningful explanations across heterogeneous time series scales

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The surrogate approach works because LightGBM can approximate the complex decision boundaries of ensemble models while remaining interpretable through TreeSHAP. The forecastability analysis captures the intrinsic predictability of time series by analyzing their spectral properties, which naturally correlates with how well any forecasting model (including the surrogate) can perform. Per-item normalization ensures that feature attributions are comparable across time series with vastly different scales and distributions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Surrogate modeling** - Creating interpretable models that approximate black-box predictions; needed because direct interpretation of ensemble models is intractable
- **TreeSHAP** - A method for computing feature attributions in tree-based models; needed to extract interpretable explanations from the LightGBM surrogate
- **Spectral forecastability** - Analyzing frequency components to quantify predictability; needed to understand the intrinsic difficulty of forecasting each time series
- **Per-item normalization** - Scaling features individually for each time series; needed to ensure feature attributions are meaningful across heterogeneous data
- **Feature injection experiments** - Synthetic testing method where known effects are introduced; needed to validate explanation faithfulness against ground truth
- **Ensemble forecasting** - Combining multiple models for improved predictions; needed as the target for explanation since these are inherently complex

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Time Series -> Ensemble Forecast (AutoGluon) -> Surrogate LightGBM -> TreeSHAP Explanations + Forecastability Analysis

**Critical Path:** Ensemble predictions → Surrogate training → SHAP attribution → Forecastability correlation

**Design Tradeoffs:** Accuracy vs interpretability (surrogate vs original), computational cost of surrogate training, complexity of forecastability metric

**Failure Signatures:** Poor surrogate fidelity indicates ensemble model complexity exceeds surrogate capacity; unstable SHAP values suggest insufficient training data or inappropriate normalization

**First Experiments:**
1. Validate surrogate faithfulness on held-out test data from the same distribution
2. Test explanation stability across multiple random seeds
3. Compare explanations from different surrogate algorithms (XGBoost, Random Forest)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Generalizability to non-AutoGluon ensemble methods remains uncertain
- Reliance on LightGBM surrogate may introduce bias if structure diverges from ensemble
- Forecastability metric validation limited to M4 subset without broader benchmarking
- Computational overhead of surrogate training not evaluated for operational settings

## Confidence
**High confidence:** Surrogate model faithfully reproduces AutoGluon forecasts with high fidelity (Pearson correlation 0.961 in synthetic experiments). The necessity of per-item normalization for meaningful explanations across heterogeneous time series is clearly demonstrated. Forecastability correlates strongly with both forecast accuracy and surrogate fidelity in the tested M4 subset.

**Medium confidence:** The surrogate approach is generally applicable to other ensemble time series forecasting models beyond AutoGluon. The spectral forecastability metric meaningfully captures intrinsic predictability across diverse time series domains.

**Low confidence:** The surrogate-based explanations remain faithful under real-world data perturbations and concept drift. The computational overhead is negligible relative to the overall forecasting pipeline.

## Next Checks
1. Test surrogate faithfulness across multiple ensemble forecasting frameworks (not just AutoGluon) and time series from diverse domains beyond M4.
2. Evaluate the sensitivity of SHAP-based explanations to perturbations in the input data and concept drift scenarios.
3. Benchmark the computational overhead of surrogate training and explanation generation in large-scale forecasting pipelines.
