core_contribution: This paper systematically compares explainability methods for hardware
  trojan detection, evaluating domain-aware property analysis, model-agnostic case-based
  reasoning, and feature attribution techniques (LIME, SHAP, gradient). The study
  finds that property-based analysis provides circuit-specific interpretations aligned
  with engineering expertise (e.g., "high fanin complexity near outputs indicates
  potential triggers"), while case-based reasoning achieves 97.4% correspondence between
  predictions and training exemplars.

# Explainability Methods for Hardware Trojan Detection: A Systematic Comparison

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.18696
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18696
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: 46.15% precision and 52.17% recall achieved on 11,392 test samples, representing 9-fold improvement over prior work

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a systematic comparison of explainability methods for hardware trojan detection, evaluating three distinct approaches: domain-aware property analysis, model-agnostic case-based reasoning, and feature attribution techniques (LIME, SHAP, gradient). The study demonstrates that domain-aware methods provide circuit-specific interpretations aligned with engineering expertise, while case-based reasoning achieves high correspondence between predictions and training exemplars. The XGBoost classifier significantly outperforms previous detection methods, though absolute performance values remain moderate.

## Method Summary
The research systematically compares explainability methods by evaluating their effectiveness in detecting hardware trojans through feature analysis, model interpretation, and prediction validation. Three primary approaches were examined: domain-aware property analysis using circuit-specific features, model-agnostic case-based reasoning for prediction-exemplar correspondence, and feature attribution methods including LIME, SHAP, and gradient-based techniques. The study used a dataset of 11,392 test samples to evaluate detection accuracy, with the XGBoost classifier achieving 46.15% precision and 52.17% recall, representing a 9-fold improvement over prior work.

## Key Results
- Domain-aware property analysis provides circuit-specific interpretations aligned with engineering expertise
- Case-based reasoning achieves 97.4% correspondence between predictions and training exemplars
- Gradient attribution runs 481× faster than SHAP but provides similar domain-opaque insights

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of these explainability methods stems from their complementary approaches to interpreting hardware trojan detection models. Domain-aware property analysis leverages circuit-specific knowledge to identify suspicious patterns like "high fanin complexity near outputs indicates potential triggers," providing interpretations that align with engineering expertise. Case-based reasoning achieves high prediction-exemplar correspondence by mapping new predictions to similar training examples, creating transparent decision pathways. Feature attribution methods quantify the contribution of individual features to predictions, though their domain-opaque nature limits practical interpretability despite computational efficiency.

## Foundational Learning
- **Hardware trojan detection fundamentals**: Understanding how malicious modifications to integrated circuits can be identified through feature analysis
  - Why needed: Provides context for evaluating explainability method effectiveness
  - Quick check: Can identify basic trojan characteristics in sample circuits

- **Explainability method taxonomy**: Classification of methods into domain-aware, case-based, and feature attribution categories
  - Why needed: Establishes framework for systematic comparison
  - Quick check: Can categorize new explainability methods appropriately

- **Feature importance vs. interpretability**: Distinguishing between ranking features by importance versus providing meaningful explanations
  - Why needed: Critical for evaluating practical utility of detection methods
  - Quick check: Can articulate difference between high accuracy and actionable insights

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Hardware trojan detection system -> Feature extraction module -> Explainability method selector -> Interpretation generator -> Expert validation interface

**Critical path**: Circuit input → Feature extraction → Model prediction → Explainability method → Interpretation → Security assessment

**Design tradeoffs**: Computational efficiency vs. interpretability depth, domain specificity vs. generalizability, model accuracy vs. explanation transparency

**Failure signatures**: High false positive rates indicate need for better feature selection, low correspondence in case-based reasoning suggests model overfitting, domain-opaque explanations reveal limitations in feature attribution methods

**3 first experiments**:
1. Compare detection accuracy across circuit families with varying complexity
2. Measure computation time for each explainability method on identical datasets
3. Evaluate expert comprehension of generated explanations through structured interviews

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in source material

## Limitations
- Generalizability concerns across different circuit architectures and trojan types
- Moderate absolute performance values despite 9-fold improvement over prior work
- Potential overfitting indicated by 97.4% correspondence in case-based reasoning

## Confidence

High: 9-fold improvement in detection accuracy over prior work is empirically validated
Medium: Systematic framework provides structured evaluation but may miss emergent properties
Low: Gap between controlled experimental conditions and real-world hardware security scenarios

## Next Checks

1. External validation on diverse circuit families from multiple manufacturers to assess method robustness across architectural variations

2. Long-term stability testing of explainability methods as trojan techniques evolve and become more sophisticated

3. Controlled user studies with hardware security experts to evaluate whether generated explanations actually improve detection accuracy and threat assessment compared to traditional methods
