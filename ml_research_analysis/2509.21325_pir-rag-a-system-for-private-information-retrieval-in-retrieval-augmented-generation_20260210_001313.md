# PIR-RAG: A System for Private Information Retrieval in Retrieval-Augmented Generation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2509.21325
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21325
- **Reference count:** 11
- **Primary result:** PIR-RAG achieves 0.799 NDCG@10 with 16.84s end-to-end query time for privacy-preserving RAG systems

## Executive Summary
PIR-RAG introduces a novel architecture for privacy-preserving Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems that combines semantic clustering with lattice-based Private Information Retrieval protocols. The system addresses the fundamental privacy vulnerability in RAG workflows where user queries are exposed during document retrieval by service providers. By organizing documents into coarse-grained semantic clusters and retrieving entire clusters in batched PIR operations, PIR-RAG optimizes for the full RAG pipeline where complete document content is required for LLM inference.

The architecture achieves competitive search quality while maintaining strong privacy guarantees, outperforming existing approaches when measured by "RAG-Ready Latency"—the true end-to-end time needed to securely fetch content for generation. Evaluation against graph-based PIR and private scoring baselines demonstrates PIR-RAG's practical advantages for real-world deployment of privacy-preserving AI systems at scale.

## Method Summary
PIR-RAG implements a hybrid approach combining semantic clustering with lattice-based PIR protocols to enable private document retrieval in RAG systems. The system first organizes documents into semantic clusters based on coarse-grained similarity, then retrieves entire clusters using batched PIR operations rather than individual document queries. This design uniquely optimizes for RAG workflows where full document content, not just relevance scores, is required for LLM processing. The lattice-based PIR protocol provides computational security guarantees while maintaining practical performance, and the clustering approach reduces the number of PIR operations needed per query. The system introduces a novel "RAG-Ready Latency" metric that measures true end-to-end performance including document fetching and LLM preparation time.

## Key Results
- Achieves 0.799 NDCG@10 search quality metric on evaluation datasets
- Completes end-to-end queries in 16.84 seconds with privacy preservation
- Outperforms baseline approaches when considering full document retrieval workflow requirements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system works by fundamentally rethinking the privacy challenge in RAG systems. Traditional approaches expose user queries during retrieval by requiring service providers to know which documents to fetch. PIR-RAG eliminates this exposure by using semantic clustering to group related documents, then retrieving entire clusters through batched PIR operations. This means the service provider only learns which clusters contain relevant information, not the specific documents or user intent. The lattice-based PIR protocol provides strong cryptographic guarantees while remaining computationally feasible for practical deployment. By optimizing for the complete RAG workflow rather than just retrieval accuracy, the system ensures that privacy preservation doesn't come at the cost of practical usability.

## Foundational Learning

**Private Information Retrieval (PIR)** - Cryptographic protocols enabling users to retrieve database items without revealing which items were accessed. Critical for maintaining user privacy in cloud-based retrieval systems. Quick check: Verify protocol provides information-theoretic or computational privacy guarantees against honest-but-curious adversaries.

**Semantic Clustering** - Unsupervised grouping of documents based on semantic similarity rather than exact keyword matching. Enables efficient batch retrieval operations while maintaining retrieval quality. Quick check: Validate cluster purity metrics and ensure meaningful groupings for diverse query types.

**Lattice-Based Cryptography** - Post-quantum secure cryptographic primitives based on lattice problems. Provides computational security guarantees for PIR implementations. Quick check: Confirm security parameter selection meets target security levels (e.g., 128-bit security).

**RAG-Ready Latency** - Novel metric measuring total time from query submission to document availability for LLM inference. Captures true end-to-end performance impact of privacy mechanisms. Quick check: Compare against traditional retrieval metrics to validate practical significance.

**Coarse-Grained Retrieval** - Retrieval approach that operates at document cluster level rather than individual documents. Trades some precision for significant efficiency gains in privacy-preserving contexts. Quick check: Measure recall degradation when moving from fine to coarse retrieval granularity.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** User Query -> Semantic Clustering Index -> Lattice-Based PIR Protocol -> Document Clusters -> LLM Input Preparation

**Critical Path:** Query reception → Semantic cluster identification → Batched PIR retrieval → Document assembly → LLM preprocessing

**Design Tradeoffs:** The system trades some retrieval precision (through coarse-grained clustering) for significant privacy and efficiency gains. Clustering reduces PIR operations but may include irrelevant documents. The lattice-based approach provides strong security but requires careful parameter tuning for performance.

**Failure Signatures:** Performance degradation when clusters become too large or too small, indicating poor semantic organization. Security vulnerabilities could arise from improper lattice parameter selection. System failures manifest as increased latency or compromised privacy guarantees.

**First Experiments:** 1) Measure cluster quality metrics (purity, coherence) across different semantic models. 2) Benchmark PIR protocol performance with varying cluster sizes and security parameters. 3) Profile end-to-end latency breakdown to identify bottlenecks in the critical path.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Performance validation limited to synthetic or small-scale datasets, raising scalability concerns for production deployments
- Security parameter specifications and formal proofs not fully detailed in public description
- Clustering approach may introduce approximation errors affecting retrieval quality in diverse real-world scenarios

## Confidence
**High:** Architectural innovation combining semantic clustering with PIR protocols represents clear methodological advancement
**Medium:** Performance claims require independent verification across different document sizes and query distributions
**Medium:** Security guarantees depend on lattice parameter specifications not fully disclosed in public materials

## Next Checks
1. Independent security audit of lattice-based PIR implementation with full parameter disclosure to verify claimed privacy guarantees against known attacks
2. Large-scale deployment testing with real-world document collections exceeding 1 million documents to validate scalability claims and measure performance degradation patterns
3. Cross-architecture comparison using standardized benchmarks that include both synthetic and real user query logs to verify claimed advantages in RAG-Ready Latency and retrieval quality across diverse scenarios
