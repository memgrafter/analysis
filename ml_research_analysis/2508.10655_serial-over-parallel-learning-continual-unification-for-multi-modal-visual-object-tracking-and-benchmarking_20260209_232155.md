# Serial Over Parallel: Learning Continual Unification for Multi-Modal Visual Object Tracking and Benchmarking

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.10655
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10655
- Reference count: 40
- This paper addresses unification performance degradation in multi-modal visual object tracking by reformulating the problem as a serial continual learning task, achieving 2.3% higher SR and 1.2% higher PR compared to parallel unification methods.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of unifying multiple multi-modal visual object tracking (MMVOT) tasks, where existing approaches suffer from performance degradation due to inconsistency between training and testing paradigms. The authors propose two key contributions: (1) UniBench300, the first unified benchmark integrating RGBT, RGBD, and RGBE tracking data, which reduces evaluation time by 27% by requiring only a single inference pass instead of three separate evaluations; and (2) a serial unification approach reformulated from a data-centric perspective, progressively integrating new tasks and naturally incorporating continual learning (CL) techniques to mitigate knowledge forgetting. Extensive experiments on two baselines (ViPT and SymTrack) and four benchmarks demonstrate that CL significantly improves unification stability. Notably, performance degradation is found to be negatively correlated with network capacity and varies across tasks (RGBT > RGBD > RGBE) due to modality discrepancies. The proposed approach achieves 2.3% higher SR and 1.2% higher PR compared to parallel unification methods.

## Method Summary
The authors reformulate multi-modal unification from a parallel to a serial process, progressively integrating new tasks while preserving knowledge from previous tasks using replay techniques. Instead of mixing all data modalities simultaneously in a single batch (parallel), the model trains on one task, then "freezes" or retains that knowledge while training on the next task. Data from previous tasks is replayed alongside new task data to stabilize the joint distribution optimization. This approach naturally aligns with continual learning philosophy and mitigates performance degradation caused by "knowledge forgetting." The method is validated on two baseline architectures (ViPT and SymTrack) across four benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in unified tracking performance.

## Key Results
- UniBench300 benchmark reduces evaluation time by 27% by requiring only a single inference pass instead of three separate evaluations
- Serial unification approach achieves 2.3% higher Success Rate (SR) and 1.2% higher Precision Rate (PR) compared to parallel unification methods
- Performance degradation is negatively correlated with network capacity, with larger models exhibiting less relative performance drop
- Degradation varies across tasks due to modality discrepancies: RGBT tracking suffers higher degradation than RGBD and RGBE due to greater distribution distance between Thermal and Depth modalities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Sequential Task Integration with Replay
The paper reformulates multi-modal unification from a parallel to a serial process, allowing integration of continual learning techniques like replay to mitigate performance degradation caused by "knowledge forgetting." Instead of mixing all data modalities simultaneously, the model trains on one task, then retains that knowledge while training on the next task. Data from previous tasks is replayed alongside new task data to stabilize joint distribution optimization. Core assumption: performance degradation in unified models is primarily caused by the optimizer struggling to find a global optimum that satisfies all local task-specific optima simultaneously. Evidence: Eq. 2 defines the training objective explicitly preserving previous parameters and data, and the abstract states this naturally aligns with continual learning philosophy.

### Mechanism 2: Capacity-Dependent Degradation Buffering
Performance degradation during unification is negatively correlated with network capacity; larger models exhibit less relative performance drop. A larger feature space provides a higher-dimensional manifold where distinct multi-modal distributions can be mapped with less interference. Core assumption: the unified model requires sufficient parameter dimensionality to resolve conflicts between heterogeneous modality features without forcing destructive weight updates. Evidence: Table 5 demonstrates that as the number of layers decreases, performance degradation increases, and the abstract explicitly states this negative correlation. Break condition: if the architecture is severely bottlenecked, increasing depth may not help if channel capacity cannot support the combined entropy of all modalities.

### Mechanism 3: Modality Discrepancy-Induced Interference
The degree of performance degradation varies by task specificity due to the distribution distance between modalities; tasks combining dissimilar modalities suffer more. The "distance" between data distributions dictates the conflict in gradient directions during optimization. RGBT tracking suffers higher degradation because Thermal and Depth distributions are "farther" apart than Depth and Event. Core assumption: the unified model attempts to map distinct physical signals into a shared space; higher heterogeneity requires more robust alignment mechanisms. Evidence: Figure 6 visualizes distribution distances correlating with the observed degradation hierarchy, and the abstract states modality discrepancies contribute to varying degradation levels. Break condition: if advanced fusion modules that explicitly minimize this discrepancy are introduced, the correlation between modality distance and degradation may weaken.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Catastrophic Forgetting in Continual Learning (CL)**
  - Why needed: The paper reframes "performance degradation" of unified trackers as a CL forgetting issue. Understanding that a model optimizing for Task B will degrade on Task A without constraints is central to the proposed serial solution.
  - Quick check: Can you explain why standard SGD on a mixed dataset might fail to retain "knowledge" from an earlier task if data distributions differ significantly?

- **Concept: Global vs. Local Optima Consistency**
  - Why needed: The paper argues current unified methods train for a "global optimum" (mixed data) but test for a "local optimum" (single benchmark), creating an inconsistency.
  - Quick check: Why does minimizing loss on joint distribution P(T, D, E) not guarantee minimizing loss on marginal distribution P(T)?

- **Concept: Multi-Modal Heterogeneity (RGBT/RGBD/RGBE)**
  - Why needed: Causal mechanisms depend on physical properties of sensors. Thermal is luminance-independent, Depth provides geometry, Event provides temporal gradients. Knowing these differences explains why "modality discrepancy" exists.
  - Quick check: Which modality pair (Thermal/Depth vs. Depth/Event) would you expect to have more conflicting features in a shared embedding space, based on paper's findings?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** RGB Backbone (ViT-B) -> Branch X (modality-specific adapter) -> Head (prediction layer)
- **Critical path:** 1) Train base model on Task 1 (e.g., RGBT) → get θ₁. 2) Initialize with θ₁, load mixed batch of Task 1 + Task 2 data. 3) Update to θ₂ using loss from both tasks (Replay). 4) Run single inference pass on UniBench300 (vs. 3 separate passes).
- **Design tradeoffs:** SymTrack uses more parameters (Symmetric Transformer) → higher performance stability but higher compute cost. ViPT is lighter but suffers more from unification degradation. Serial increases training complexity but aligns training/testing distributions and allows CL injection.
- **Failure signatures:** Modality Collapse shows significant PR/SR drop in RGBT tasks specifically indicating high modality discrepancy interference. Training Instability occurs if CL replay buffer is imbalanced, showing high accuracy on DepthTrack but dropping on LasHeR.
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Baseline Validation: Train ViPT or SymTrack on full mix, evaluate on separated benchmarks to confirm "performance degradation" phenomenon. 2) Serial Ablation: Retrain using serial paradigm, compare "Forgetting" rate against parallel baseline. 3) Capacity Analysis: Modify Branch X depth (12, 6, 2 layers), plot "Degradation %" vs. "Parameter Count" to verify negative correlation claim.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided content. However, based on the analysis and discussion, several important questions emerge from the work:

## Limitations
- The paper does not specify the exact replay buffer size or sampling strategy, which could significantly impact the effectiveness of the continual learning approach
- The paper does not explicitly compare the serial unification approach against a "joint training" baseline using a single pass with shared backbone and task-specific heads
- The paper focuses on PR and SR metrics but does not report other common tracking metrics like Precision AUC or Normalized Precision

## Confidence

- **Mechanism 1 (Sequential Task Integration with Replay):** High - The core concept of using replay to mitigate forgetting is well-established in CL literature and is clearly implemented in the proposed serial unification
- **Mechanism 2 (Capacity-Dependent Degradation Buffering):** Medium - While experimental results show the correlation, the paper does not provide a theoretical explanation for why this occurs
- **Mechanism 3 (Modality Discrepancy-Induced Interference):** Medium - The correlation between modality distance and degradation is shown, but the paper does not explore whether this is causal or simply correlational

## Next Checks

1. **Experiment Replication:** Implement the serial unification approach with a clearly defined replay buffer strategy (e.g., reservoir sampling with fixed size) and reproduce reported performance improvements over the parallel baseline on UniBench300

2. **Architecture Ablation:** Compare the serial unification approach against a parallel baseline using shared backbone and task-specific heads to isolate benefits of serial training paradigm from architectural unification

3. **Distribution Analysis:** Quantify feature distribution distances between modalities using MMD or Wasserstein distance and correlate these with observed performance degradation to validate modality discrepancy as key driver of unification challenges
