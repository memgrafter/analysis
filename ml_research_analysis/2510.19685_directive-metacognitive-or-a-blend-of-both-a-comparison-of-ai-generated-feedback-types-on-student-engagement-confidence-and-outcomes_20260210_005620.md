# Directive, Metacognitive or a Blend of Both? A Comparison of AI-Generated Feedback Types on Student Engagement, Confidence, and Outcomes

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.19685
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19685
- Reference count: 40
- Hybrid AI feedback led to highest revision rates in university course

## Executive Summary
This study compared three AI-generated feedback types - directive, metacognitive, and hybrid - in a university course with 329 students. The hybrid approach resulted in the highest revision rates, though confidence and final work quality remained similar across all conditions. Metacognitive feedback prompted deep cognitive engagement but fewer revisions, suggesting students processed the feedback without acting on it. The findings indicate that hybrid feedback models can effectively balance actionable guidance with reflective opportunities, supporting both immediate improvement and self-regulatory development in learning contexts.

## Method Summary
The study involved 329 university students receiving one of three AI-generated feedback types on their assignments: directive feedback providing specific instructions, metacognitive feedback prompting reflection, or a hybrid combining both approaches. Students' engagement was measured through revision behavior, confidence levels were self-reported, and final work quality was assessed by instructors. The experiment aimed to determine how different feedback styles influence student revision rates, self-efficacy, and learning outcomes.

## Key Results
- Hybrid feedback achieved the highest revision rates among all conditions
- Confidence levels and final work quality were similar across all feedback types
- Metacognitive feedback led to deep cognitive processing but minimal revision action

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of hybrid feedback stems from its ability to provide both clear, actionable guidance and opportunities for metacognitive reflection. This combination addresses different aspects of the learning process - immediate skill application through directive elements and deeper understanding through metacognitive prompts. The balance allows students to make concrete improvements while also developing self-regulatory capabilities, creating a more comprehensive learning experience than either approach alone.

## Foundational Learning
- AI feedback generation: Why needed - Enables scalable, personalized feedback delivery; Quick check - Can the system generate coherent, contextually appropriate feedback?
- Metacognitive prompting: Why needed - Supports development of self-regulatory learning skills; Quick check - Do prompts encourage reflection without causing analysis paralysis?
- Revision behavior tracking: Why needed - Provides objective measure of feedback effectiveness beyond self-reports; Quick check - Can system accurately detect and categorize different types of revisions?

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Assignment submission -> AI feedback generation -> Student revision -> Quality assessment
Critical path: Submission → Feedback processing (20s) → Student decision point → Revision completion (variable)
Design tradeoffs: Directive feedback provides clarity but limits autonomy; metacognitive feedback promotes reflection but may not drive action; hybrid approach balances both but increases complexity
Failure signatures: Low revision rates despite positive self-reports suggest feedback-action gap; similar quality outcomes despite different revision behaviors indicate assessment limitations
First experiments: 1) A/B test directive vs hybrid feedback in STEM course; 2) Track time-to-revision for different feedback types; 3) Implement blinded peer review to validate quality assessments

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Single course context limits generalizability across disciplines and student populations
- Equal confidence levels across feedback types suggest potential measurement sensitivity issues
- Self-reported engagement data introduces response bias risk, particularly with novel AI feedback

## Confidence
- Hybrid feedback increasing revision rates: High confidence (statistically significant behavioral difference)
- Similar confidence and quality outcomes: Medium confidence (based on single assessment method)
- Metacognitive feedback promoting deep engagement without action: Medium confidence (behavioral vs self-report discrepancy)

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the study across multiple courses with varying technical complexity to test disciplinary generalizability
2. Implement blinded peer review of student work to triangulate quality assessments beyond instructor evaluation
3. Track longitudinal impacts by measuring retention of concepts and application in subsequent courses
