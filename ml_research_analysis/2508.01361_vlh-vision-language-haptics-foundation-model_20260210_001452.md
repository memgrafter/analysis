# VLH: Vision-Language-Haptics Foundation Model

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2508.01361
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01361
- **Reference count:** 24
- **Primary result:** Unified vision-language-haptic model achieves 56.7% target acquisition and 100% texture discrimination in aerial robotics

## Executive Summary
VLH introduces a novel Vision-Language-Haptic foundation model that unifies perception, language, and tactile feedback in aerial robotics and virtual reality. Unlike prior work treating haptics as secondary, VLH synthesizes mid-air force and vibration cues based on contextual visual understanding and natural language commands. The system uses an 8-inch quadcopter with dual inverse five-bar linkage arrays for localized haptic actuation, processed via a fine-tuned OpenVLA backbone adapted with LoRA on 450 multimodal scenarios. It outputs a 7-dimensional action vector (Vx, Vy, Vz, Hx, Hy, Hz, Hv) with real-time operation at 4-5 Hz. In 90 flight experiments, VLH achieved 56.7% success rate for target acquisition (mean reach time 21.3 s, pose error 0.24 m) and 100% accuracy in texture discrimination.

## Method Summary
VLH fine-tunes a 7B-parameter OpenVLA model using LoRA (rank 32) on 450 paired (image, text, action, haptic) samples, mapping to a 7D action vector (Vx, Vy, Vz, Hx, Hy, Hz, Hv). Training optimizes next-token prediction over discretized action tokens, conditioned on visual encodings and language embeddings. The dual-camera system (VR egocentric + top-down exocentric) provides visual input, while the model outputs velocity commands and haptic parameters in real-time at 4-5 Hz via INT8 quantization on RTX 4090. Haptic feedback is rendered through inverse five-bar linkage arrays driven by servo motors, with communication handled via Flask API and ROS/MAVROS to an ArduPilot flight controller.

## Key Results
- 56.7% success rate for target acquisition in 90 flight experiments (mean reach time 21.3 s, pose error 0.24 m)
- 100% accuracy in texture discrimination
- 4-5 Hz real-time operation with INT8 quantization
- 70.0% (visual), 54.4% (motion), 40.0% (physical), and 35.0% (semantic) performance on novel tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Multimodal Conditioning for Haptic Generation
- Claim: Haptic output (force + vibration) can be generated as a learned function of visual context and language intent rather than pre-programmed triggers.
- Mechanism: A 7B-parameter VLA model (OpenVLA backbone) is fine-tuned via LoRA (rank 32) on 450 paired (image, text, action, haptic) samples, mapping to a 7D action vector (Vx, Vy, Vz, Hx, Hy, Hz, Hv). Training optimizes next-token prediction over discretized action tokens, conditioned on visual encodings and language embeddings.
- Core assumption: Visual features carry sufficient signal to infer surface/texture properties; language provides task intent that disambiguates actions.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "fine-tuned OpenVLA backbone—adapted via LoRA on a bespoke dataset of 450 multimodal scenarios—to output a 7-dimensional action vector." [section 4] "The dataset was structured in accordance with RLDS... fine-tune the 7 billion-parameter OpenVLA-7b model using LoRA (rank 32)."
- Break condition: If visual input lacks texture/shape cues (e.g., uniform lighting, occluded surfaces), haptic inference degrades; semantic novelty reduces performance (35% success on unseen instructions).

### Mechanism 2: Frame-by-Frame Reactive Control Loop
- Claim: Continuous single-frame inference enables responsive drone/haptic control without waypoint dependency.
- Mechanism: Each frame (from synchronized real + VR top-down views) is independently processed; model outputs immediate velocity and haptic commands. INT8 quantization reduces inference latency, enabling 4–5 Hz update rates on an RTX 4090.
- Core assumption: Sequential frames maintain temporal coherence; drone dynamics are compatible with ~200–250 ms control period.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "INT8 quantization and a high-performance server ensure real-time operation at 4–5 Hz." [section 3.2] "VLH model implements a dynamic, frame-by-frame control loop... without awaiting waypoint completion."
- Break condition: Latency above ~300 ms or state estimation drift (Vicon unavailable) may destabilize closed-loop behavior; no evidence of robustness without external localization.

### Mechanism 3: Dual-Perspective Visual Grounding
- Claim: Combining egocentric (VR user) and exocentric (top-down) views improves spatial reasoning for haptic alignment.
- Mechanism: Two synchronized camera streams are fused at input; model encodes both perspectives jointly, improving object localization and hand–drone spatial relations for context-aware feedback.
- Core assumption: Both views are temporally aligned and correctly calibrated; user hand position is inferable from egocentric frame.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "egocentric VR camera and exocentric top-down view." [section 3.1] "dual vision system includes an egocentric camera... and an exocentric camera... enabling accurate interpretation of user actions and environmental context."
- Break condition: If egocentric view is occluded or poorly tracked, spatial grounding fails; paper relies on controlled VR environment (not validated in uninstrumented settings).

## Foundational Learning

- **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models**
  - Why needed here: VLH builds directly on OpenVLA, which tokenizes actions and predicts them autoregressively from (image, text) inputs. Understanding tokenization and action discretization is prerequisite to modifying the output space.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how OpenVLA encodes a continuous 7D action vector into tokens for next-token prediction?

- **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**
  - Why needed here: The paper fine-tunes a 7B model using LoRA rank 32 on 450 samples. Without understanding LoRA, you cannot assess training efficiency or adapt the model to new tasks.
  - Quick check question: What is the memory savings (roughly) from LoRA rank 32 vs. full fine-tuning on a 7B model?

- **Haptic Rendering (Force + Vibration)**
  - Why needed here: The inverse five-bar linkage arrays render directional forces; vibration intensity (Hv) is an additional channel. Basic haptics knowledge is needed to interpret Hx/Hz/Hv outputs and calibrate servomotors.
  - Quick check question: How would increasing Hv while keeping Hx/Hy/Hz constant change the perceived texture?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Dual cameras (egocentric VR + exocentric top-down) -> OpenVLA-7b model (fine-tuned via LoRA, INT8 quantized) -> Flask API -> OrangePi 5B -> MAVROS/ROS -> ArduPilot -> PCA9685 PWM drivers -> DMS44/HS-70MG servos -> inverse five-bar linkage arrays

- **Critical path:**
  Frame capture -> resize -> API send -> VLA inference (4-5 Hz) -> 7D action -> velocity command to ArduPilot + haptic PWM to servos. Latency at each step must sum <250 ms.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - INT8 quantization trades numerical precision for speed (no accuracy degradation reported, but not rigorously ablated).
  - 450-sample dataset enables rapid adaptation but limits semantic/physical generalization (35-40% on novel tasks).
  - Vicon dependency ensures precision but precludes deployment outside instrumented spaces.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Drone overshoots target: pose error >0.3 m suggests inference/control lag or visual mislocalization.
  - Haptic feedback unrecognizable: confusion in shape+vibration (57% recognition) vs. shape alone (80.7%) may indicate channel interference or calibration drift.
  - Semantic generalization collapse (35%): model falls back to familiar patterns on unseen instructions—check LoRA adapter coverage.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline latency profile: Measure end-to-end latency (frame -> action) with and without INT8; identify bottleneck.
  2. Haptic-only ablation: Disable visual input (use blank frames) to quantify haptic prediction reliance on vision vs. language.
  3. Out-of-distribution localization: Test with one Vicon camera disabled to simulate localization noise; observe success rate and pose error degradation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: To what extent does integrating larger foundation models improve semantic generalization in haptic-feedback tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the conclusion that future work will focus on "integrating larger language models... to strengthen semantic understanding" to address the observed 35.0% success rate in semantic generalization.
- Why unresolved: The current 7B parameter model struggles with novel instructions ("follow the man") and unseen textures, limiting its utility in dynamic, unstructured real-world scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative evaluation showing semantic generalization performance (currently 35%) improving significantly with larger model backbones (e.g., 13B or 70B parameters) on the same task set.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can generative haptic rendering models effectively bridge the gap in physical generalization for aerial haptics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion notes that "leveraging generative models for realistic haptic rendering will address physical generalization challenges," specifically targeting the current 40.0% success rate for changes in object size and texture.
- Why unresolved: The current model has difficulty adapting haptic outputs (force and vibration) when physical properties of virtual objects deviate from the training distribution, resulting in incorrect feedback.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of a generative haptics subsystem maintaining high fidelity feedback (>80% accuracy) on unseen object geometries and textures without explicit trajectory training data.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Is the VLH system capable of maintaining sub-0.5m precision using only onboard localization?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper relies on a 14-camera Vicon motion capture system for "precise localization" to achieve a 0.24 m pose error. The dependence on external infrastructure is a methodological limitation for the claimed "real-world UAV applications."
- Why unresolved: The paper does not evaluate the system's robustness or accuracy when deprived of high-precision external tracking, which is a prerequisite for operation outside of laboratory settings.
- What evidence would resolve it: Flight trials replicating the 0.24 m pose error and 56.7% success rate using only onboard sensors (e.g., visual-inertial odometry) in GPS-denied or uninstrumented environments.

## Limitations

- **Dataset dependency and generalization gap:** The model's performance heavily relies on the bespoke 450-scenario dataset. With only 450 samples, the semantic and physical generalization rates (35.0% and 40.0%) suggest brittleness outside the training distribution.
- **Controlled environment bias:** Experiments use Vicon-based external localization and a synchronized VR/real-world dual-camera setup. Real-world deployment without such infrastructure is untested and likely to degrade performance.
- **Haptic rendering calibration ambiguity:** The paper does not detail how (Hx, Hy, Hz, Hv) predictions map to actual servo PWM outputs or vibration motor control, leaving uncertainty about the fidelity and repeatability of the tactile feedback.

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Core multimodal conditioning mechanism (visual+language → 7D action) and real-time 4-5 Hz inference pipeline are well-supported by described architecture and ablation results.
- **Medium confidence:** Dual-perspective visual grounding contributes to spatial reasoning, but lack of ablation or baseline comparisons limits attribution of gains to this feature specifically.
- **Low confidence:** Generalization claims, especially on semantic tasks (35% success), are weakly supported given dataset size and no cross-dataset validation.

## Next Checks

1. **Latency profiling under realistic conditions:** Measure end-to-end latency (capture → action) with simulated sensor noise and reduced Vicon coverage; verify 4-5 Hz constraint holds without external ground truth.
2. **Haptic-only inference ablation:** Disable visual inputs (use blank frames) and test whether haptic predictions remain meaningful, isolating language-driven vs. vision-driven contributions.
3. **Out-of-distribution semantic robustness:** Test model on held-out language instructions and novel texture/shape combinations not present in the 450-scenario dataset to quantify true generalization limits.
