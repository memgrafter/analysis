# Optimizing Distributed Deployment of Mixture-of-Experts Model Inference in Serverless Computing

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2501.05313
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05313
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Reduces billed cost of all MoE layers by at least 75.67% compared to CPU clusters while maintaining satisfactory inference throughput

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of efficient deployment and serving of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models in serverless computing platforms. The key innovation is a Bayesian optimization framework with multi-dimensional epsilon-greedy search that learns expert selections and optimizes MoE deployment for cost minimization. The authors propose a novel Bayesian decision-making approach for expert popularity prediction, flexible pipelined scatter-gather communication designs, and an optimal model deployment algorithm for distributed MoE serving.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a comprehensive framework for optimizing MoE model inference in serverless computing environments. The core approach combines Bayesian optimization with epsilon-greedy search strategies to learn optimal expert selections dynamically. The method includes expert popularity prediction using Bayesian decision-making, pipelined scatter-gather communication patterns to reduce bottlenecks, and an optimal deployment algorithm that determines how to distribute MoE layers across serverless functions. The framework is evaluated on AWS Lambda, demonstrating significant cost reductions while maintaining throughput performance.

## Key Results
- Achieves at least 75.67% reduction in billed cost compared to CPU clusters for all MoE layers
- Outperforms LambdaML in serverless computing with 43.41% lower cost
- Maintains throughput with at most 18.76% decrease compared to LambdaML

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness stems from the Bayesian optimization framework's ability to dynamically learn and adapt expert selections based on popularity patterns. The epsilon-greedy search balances exploration and exploitation in selecting optimal deployment configurations. The pipelined scatter-gather communication design addresses the fundamental bottleneck in distributed MoE inference by overlapping communication and computation. The Bayesian decision-making approach for expert popularity prediction enables proactive resource allocation that minimizes both cost and latency.

## Foundational Learning

**Serverless Computing Platforms** - Understanding AWS Lambda pricing model and cold start behavior. Quick check: Verify pricing per request and duration matches the claimed cost savings.

**Mixture-of-Experts Architecture** - Knowledge of MoE routing, expert selection, and parallel inference patterns. Quick check: Confirm the scatter-gather pattern matches typical MoE inference workflows.

**Bayesian Optimization** - Understanding of Bayesian decision theory for popularity prediction. Quick check: Verify the prior distribution assumptions align with observed expert usage patterns.

**Epsilon-Greedy Strategies** - Balancing exploration vs exploitation in dynamic optimization. Quick check: Confirm the epsilon decay schedule prevents premature convergence to suboptimal configurations.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Request -> Router -> Expert Popularity Predictor -> Bayesian Optimizer -> Deployment Allocator -> Lambda Functions -> Results Aggregation

**Critical Path**: User request → Expert selection routing → Parallel expert invocation → Result aggregation → Final response

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades some inference latency for significant cost reduction through optimal resource allocation. The Bayesian approach requires additional computation for popularity prediction but enables more efficient resource utilization.

**Failure Signatures**: Cold starts in Lambda functions can increase latency unpredictably. Skewed expert popularity can lead to resource underutilization if not properly predicted. The epsilon-greedy approach may temporarily select suboptimal expert configurations during exploration phases.

**First Experiments**:
1. Measure cold start latency distribution across different memory allocations
2. Profile expert popularity distribution under varying workload patterns
3. Benchmark scatter-gather communication overhead with different pipeline depths

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies entirely on AWS Lambda without cross-platform validation
- Cost savings claims based on specific pricing model that may change over time
- Does not address potential cold start issues and their impact on performance metrics
- Effectiveness demonstrated only on synthetic expert popularity distributions
- Focuses on throughput and cost but lacks comprehensive latency and quality assessment

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Technical feasibility of Bayesian optimization framework for expert selection and pipelined scatter-gather communication design.

**Medium Confidence**: Cost savings claims (highly dependent on specific AWS pricing and workload characteristics), comparison with LambdaML (lacks deployment configuration details).

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate the proposed framework on multiple serverless platforms (Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions) to verify cross-platform applicability of cost savings claims.

2. Test the system with real-world MoE workloads from production environments to validate the effectiveness of the Bayesian optimization framework and expert popularity prediction approach.

3. Conduct comprehensive latency measurements, including cold start impacts, to assess whether cost savings come at the expense of unacceptable inference delays for time-sensitive applications.
