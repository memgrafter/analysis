# KARIPAP: Quantum-Inspired Tensor Network Compression of Large Language Models Using Infinite Projected Entangled Pair States and Tensor Renormalization Group

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.21844
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21844
- Authors: Azree Nazri
- Reference count: 21
- Primary result: Quantum-inspired tensor network compression achieves 93% memory and 70% parameter reduction on LLaMA-2 7B with only 2-3% accuracy loss

## Executive Summary
KARIPAP addresses the computational and environmental costs of large language models by introducing a quantum-inspired compression framework using Infinite Projected Entangled Pair States (iPEPS) and Tensor Renormalization Group (TRG). The approach captures multi-directional entanglement in transformer layers, enabling substantial model compression while preserving correlation structure. Experiments on LLaMA-2 7B demonstrate up to 93% memory reduction, 70% parameter reduction, 50% faster training, and 25% faster inference with minimal accuracy degradation.

## Method Summary
KARIPAP employs iPEPS to represent tensor network states that capture multi-directional entanglement in transformer layers, while TRG performs tensor contractions and renormalization to optimize network parameters. This quantum-inspired framework compresses weight matrices into tensor network representations that maintain long-range correlations. The method integrates with standard transformer architectures by replacing dense layers with compressed tensor network equivalents, enabling efficient forward and backward passes through specialized tensor operations.

## Key Results
- Achieves 93% memory reduction and 70% parameter reduction on LLaMA-2 7B
- Maintains only 2-3% accuracy loss while delivering 50% faster training and 25% faster inference
- Outperforms standard quantization approaches in preserving correlation structure and model performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages quantum-inspired tensor networks to capture the multi-directional entanglement inherent in transformer attention mechanisms. By representing weight matrices as tensor networks rather than dense matrices, KARIPAP exploits the low-rank structure of LLM parameters while preserving long-range correlations. The iPEPS component enables efficient representation of entangled states across multiple dimensions, while TRG provides scalable tensor renormalization that maintains computational efficiency during both training and inference.

## Foundational Learning

**Infinite Projected Entangled Pair States (iPEPS)**: A tensor network ansatz for 2D quantum systems that captures multi-directional entanglement. Needed to represent the complex correlation structure in transformer layers that standard low-rank methods miss. Quick check: Verify the iPEPS bond dimension can be adjusted to balance compression ratio and accuracy.

**Tensor Renormalization Group (TRG)**: A numerical method for contracting and optimizing tensor networks by systematically integrating out degrees of freedom. Essential for making tensor network operations computationally tractable. Quick check: Confirm TRG convergence criteria are met for stable training.

**Quantum-inspired compression**: Leverages principles from quantum many-body physics to compress classical neural network parameters. Required to capture the rich correlation structure in LLMs that classical compression methods cannot efficiently represent. Quick check: Compare quantum-inspired versus classical compression performance on correlation preservation metrics.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Input -> Token Embeddings -> iPEPS-compressed Attention -> TRG-optimized Feed-forward -> Output

**Critical path**: Token embedding → iPEPS tensor network transformation → TRG tensor contractions → linear transformations → prediction

**Design tradeoffs**: Higher iPEPS bond dimensions provide better accuracy but reduce compression benefits; TRG optimization adds computational overhead but enables scalability. The framework prioritizes minimal accuracy loss while maximizing compression ratio.

**Failure signatures**: Accuracy degradation exceeding 5% suggests insufficient bond dimension or poor TRG convergence; training instability indicates numerical precision issues in tensor operations; excessive memory usage points to inefficient tensor contraction ordering.

**First experiments**: 1) Validate compression on small transformer layer with synthetic data, 2) Compare iPEPS versus standard low-rank compression on attention matrices, 3) Benchmark TRG optimization convergence versus traditional training.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to single LLaMA-2 7B model, raising questions about generalizability to other architectures
- Computational overhead of tensor operations during training and inference not fully quantified beyond speed metrics
- Environmental impact claims lack concrete CO2 equivalent measurements
- Comparison to "standard quantization" is vague without specifying which quantization method was used

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The compression ratios (93% memory, 70% parameters) and speed improvements (50% training, 25% inference) are well-supported by experimental results on LLaMA-2 7B.

**Medium confidence**: The claim of "outperforming standard quantization" is plausible but under-specified, making precise evaluation difficult without knowing which quantization method was compared.

**Medium confidence**: The preservation of correlation structure and minimal accuracy loss (2-3%) is reasonable given the tensor network approach, but broader validation across tasks would strengthen this claim.

## Next Checks

1. Test KARIPAP on diverse LLM architectures beyond LLaMA-2 7B, including both decoder-only and encoder-decoder models of varying scales

2. Conduct comprehensive ablation studies to isolate the contribution of iPEPS versus TRG components to overall performance

3. Measure and report wall-clock training time with full tensor network operations, including setup and optimization overhead, to validate the practical speedup claims
