# Comprehensive Design Space Exploration for Tensorized Neural Network Hardware Accelerators

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.17971
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17971
- **Reference count**: 35
- **Primary result**: Tensor decomposition alone is insufficient for hardware acceleration; co-design of contraction paths, hardware partitioning, and dataflow mappings is essential for realizing TNN efficiency gains

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the inefficiency of tensorized neural networks (TNNs) in real hardware by showing that algorithm-level tensor decomposition optimizations (which reduce parameters) do not guarantee hardware acceleration. The key insight is that contraction paths, hardware partitioning, and dataflow mappings are tightly coupled and must be jointly optimized. The authors propose a unified design space exploration framework that formulates a latency-driven objective and solves it via global search across layer-wise configurations. Their method combines MAC-guided contraction path search with a hierarchical search that minimizes end-to-end execution cost. Implemented on a parameterized FPGA kernel, the optimized TNN designs achieve up to 4× lower inference and 3.85× lower training latency compared to dense baselines, with up to 21% power reduction. This demonstrates that co-designing algorithmic and hardware dimensions is essential for realizing the full efficiency potential of TNNs on edge devices.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a unified design space exploration framework that formulates a latency-driven objective and solves it via global search across layer-wise configurations. Their method combines MAC-guided contraction path search with a hierarchical search that minimizes end-to-end execution cost. The framework jointly optimizes tensor decomposition, contraction paths, hardware partitioning, and dataflow mappings. The approach is implemented on a parameterized FPGA kernel and evaluated across various CNN models, demonstrating significant improvements in inference and training latency compared to dense baselines.

## Key Results
- Up to 4× lower inference latency compared to dense baselines
- Up to 3.85× lower training latency compared to dense baselines
- Up to 21% power reduction in optimized designs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The efficiency gains come from jointly optimizing tensor decomposition (reducing parameters), contraction paths (determining computation order), hardware partitioning (mapping to resources), and dataflow mappings (data movement patterns). By formulating a latency-driven objective and solving it through global search across these coupled dimensions, the framework finds configurations that minimize end-to-end execution cost rather than optimizing each dimension in isolation.

## Foundational Learning
- **Tensor Decomposition**: Breaking down high-dimensional tensors into lower-rank components to reduce parameters; needed to understand the algorithmic side of TNNs and why parameter reduction doesn't automatically translate to hardware acceleration.
- **Contraction Paths**: The order in which tensor operations are performed; critical because different paths can have vastly different computational costs and memory access patterns.
- **Hardware Partitioning**: Mapping computational tasks to specific hardware resources; essential for understanding how to distribute tensor operations across available compute units.
- **Dataflow Mappings**: Patterns of data movement through the hardware; important because memory access patterns significantly impact performance and power consumption.
- **Parameterized FPGA Kernels**: Configurable hardware implementations that can be tailored to specific tensor operations; needed to implement and evaluate the joint optimization approach.
- **Global Search**: Systematic exploration of the design space to find optimal configurations; required because the design space is too large for exhaustive enumeration and the dimensions are coupled.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Tensor Decomposition -> Contraction Path Search -> Hardware Partitioning -> Dataflow Mapping -> Parameterized FPGA Kernel

**Critical Path**: The critical path involves the interplay between contraction path selection and hardware partitioning. Poor contraction path choices can lead to memory bottlenecks, while suboptimal hardware partitioning can cause underutilization of compute resources.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The main tradeoff is between parameter reduction (achieved through tensor decomposition) and computational efficiency (achieved through optimal contraction paths and hardware mapping). Aggressive decomposition may reduce parameters but create unfavorable contraction paths that hurt performance.

**Failure Signatures**: Failure modes include: excessive memory usage due to poor contraction paths, underutilization of hardware resources due to suboptimal partitioning, and high power consumption due to inefficient dataflow mappings. These often manifest as performance degradation or power consumption increases compared to dense baselines.

**First Experiments**:
1. Implement the MAC-guided contraction path search on a simple tensor operation and measure performance improvements over naive contraction ordering.
2. Evaluate the impact of different hardware partitioning strategies on a fixed contraction path to identify the most effective mapping approach.
3. Test the joint optimization framework on a small CNN layer, comparing end-to-end latency against optimizing each dimension independently.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation is based on a parameterized FPGA kernel and focused on specific CNN models, which may not generalize to all neural network architectures or hardware platforms.
- The methodology assumes static workloads and does not address dynamic or adaptive scenarios common in edge deployments.
- Reported power savings are derived from synthesis data rather than full-chip measurements, introducing uncertainty about real-world power consumption.

## Confidence
- **Core findings about necessity of joint optimization**: High
- **Absolute performance gains (4× inference, 3.85× training speedup)**: Medium
- **Generalizability to other hardware platforms**: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test the methodology on diverse hardware platforms (e.g., ASICs, GPUs) to assess cross-platform generalization.
2. Evaluate on additional neural network architectures beyond CNNs (e.g., Transformers, RNNs) to verify broader applicability.
3. Conduct full-chip power measurements under realistic workloads to validate reported power savings.
