core_contribution: 'Qwen3Guard addresses the limitations of existing guardrail models
  by introducing a multilingual safety moderation system with two specialized variants:
  Generative Qwen3Guard and Stream Qwen3Guard. The former reformulates safety classification
  as an instruction-following task to enable fine-grained tri-class judgments (safe,
  controversial, unsafe), while the latter introduces a token-level classification
  head for real-time safety monitoring during incremental text generation.'

# Qwen3Guard Technical Report

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.14276
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14276
- **Reference count**: 14
- **Key outcome**: Qwen3Guard achieves state-of-the-art multilingual safety moderation with tri-class classification and real-time streaming detection

## Executive Summary
Qwen3Guard introduces a multilingual safety moderation system with two specialized variants: Generative Qwen3Guard for fine-grained tri-class judgments (safe, controversial, unsafe) and Stream Qwen3Guard for real-time token-level safety monitoring. The system supports up to 119 languages and achieves state-of-the-art performance across English, Chinese, and multilingual benchmarks. Notably, the 0.6B parameter variant rivals or exceeds the performance of existing guard models that are more than 10× larger, demonstrating exceptional efficiency.

## Method Summary
Qwen3Guard employs a two-stage approach: Generative Qwen3Guard uses instruction-following SFT on 1.19M multilingual samples with tri-class output, while Stream Qwen3Guard adds parallel classification heads for per-token safety prediction. The controversial label construction uses strict/loose model cross-annotation to identify ambiguous cases. Token-level annotations are generated through rollout-based safety assessment combined with LLM-judge verification. Both variants are distilled from larger teacher models and fine-tuned on the resulting dataset.

## Key Results
- 0.6B Qwen3Guard variant rivals or exceeds performance of guard models >10× larger
- Stream Qwen3Guard achieves 86% exact hit rate for unsafe content detection
- 66.8% of unsafe content detected within first 128 tokens during streaming generation
- State-of-the-art F1 scores across English, Chinese, and multilingual safety benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Introducing a "controversial" severity label enables guard models to adapt to varying safety policies across deployment contexts. Two models are trained with rebalanced Safe/Unsafe ratios—one "strict" (predicts Unsafe more) and one "loose" (predicts Safe more). Cross-annotating the held-out partition identifies borderline instances where predictions conflict; these become the "controversial" labels. At inference, deployers can map controversial→unsafe (strict mode) or controversial→safe (loose mode) based on their policy.

### Mechanism 2
Attaching parallel classification heads to the final transformer layer enables per-token safety predictions with marginal accuracy loss (~2
