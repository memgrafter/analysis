# Palpation Alters Auditory Pain Expressions with Gender-Specific Variations in Robopatients

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.11906
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11906
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Novel PPO-based system generates adaptive auditory pain expressions in robopatient during palpation, with gender-specific thresholds and individual preference learning.

## Executive Summary
This study presents a reinforcement learning framework for generating adaptive auditory pain expressions in a robopatient during abdominal palpation. Using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), the system dynamically refines pain sounds based on real-time human binary feedback, capturing individual preferences and gender-specific variations. The approach demonstrates successful adaptation to palpation forces and sound preferences, with participants finding vocal expressions realistic and distinguishable, particularly for female pain sounds.

## Method Summary
The method employs PPO to learn individualized mappings between palpation force and pain sound parameters (pitch and amplitude). Four load cells measure palpation force on a silicone phantom, which is processed through a moving average filter and mapped to pain intensity. The PPO agent selects from discrete pitch/amplitude combinations to generate pain sounds, receiving binary feedback (Agree/Disagree) from participants. The system runs 120 trials per gender per participant, with a 5-second palpation window and 3-second decision window for feedback.

## Key Results
- Participants' actual palpation forces converged around 40-60 N for male and female pain expressions respectively
- Pain sound perception exhibited saturation at lower forces with gender-specific thresholds
- Female pain sounds were easier to interpret and distinguish than male expressions
- PPO successfully adapted to individual preferences, with cumulative agreement probability increasing across trials

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** PPO enables stable real-time policy updates for auditory pain expression generation.
- **Mechanism:** Clipped surrogate objective prevents large policy deviations during gradient updates, allowing continuous adaptation to human feedback without catastrophic forgetting or oscillation. The algorithm maintains both a policy network (selecting pitch/amplitude combinations) and a value network (estimating future rewards), updating via mini-batch gradient descent.
- **Core assumption:** Human feedback is sufficiently consistent within sessions to form learnable reward patterns.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "Using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a reinforcement learning (RL) technique optimized for continuous adaptation, our robot iteratively refines pain sounds based on real-time human feedback." [section III.D] "PPO is particularly well-suited for our application as it can handle continuous learning while maintaining the stability of policy updates through a clipped surrogate objective function."
- **Break condition:** If feedback becomes highly inconsistent across trials, the policy may fail to converge or oscillate between states.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Binary human feedback provides sufficient reward signal for learning individualized pain expression preferences.
- **Mechanism:** Each palpation trial generates a state (force level), action (pitch/amplitude combination), and reward (binary Agree=1, Disagree=0). The PPO agent stores transitions and iteratively updates policy to maximize expected reward, effectively learning the user's implicit mapping between force and perceived appropriate pain sound.
- **Core assumption:** Participants' "agreement" reflects genuine perceptual congruence rather than random choice or fatigue.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section III] "The user then rates the congruence of these responses on a Likert scale with binary choices: Agree and Disagree. These inputs and feedback are fed to the PPO at each attempt to learn the preferences of the user." [section V] "As the trials progress, PPO's optimisation process leads to increased stability and consistency, with participants' preferences becoming more predictable and the system converging toward higher probabilities of selecting optimal responses."
- **Break condition:** If decision time is insufficient for participants, feedback may default to neutral, reducing effective training signal.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Gender-specific acoustic thresholds exist in pain sound perception, with female expressions easier to interpret.
- **Mechanism:** Pain sounds are parameterized by pitch (0.7-1.3 scale) and amplitude (0.037-1.0 scale). Participants demonstrated different force-to-sound mappings for male vs. female pain expressions, with female sounds showing more consistent interpretation patterns.
- **Core assumption:** The selected three pain sounds per gender adequately represent the pain expression space.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "Results show that participants' actual palpation forces averaged around 40-60 N, with pain sound perception exhibiting saturation at lower forces and gender-specific thresholds." [section V.A] "Some further preferred more time for decision making... it was easier to distinguish female pain sounds compared to that of a male." [section V] "Average actual forces converged around 40 and 60 N for male and female pain expressions, respectively."
- **Break condition:** Generalization beyond the sample (n=5, age 25-46, university-affiliated) is uncertain—cultural and ethnic factors may alter thresholds significantly.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Human Feedback**
  - **Why needed here:** The system must learn subjective human preferences that cannot be pre-programmed. RL provides the framework for trial-and-error learning with reward signals.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain the difference between the policy network (what action to take) and the value network (how good is a state)?

- **Concept: PPO Clipped Objective**
  - **Why needed here:** Prevents destabilizing policy updates during training. Understanding the clipping mechanism (typically ε=0.1-0.2) is essential for tuning learning stability.
  - **Quick check question:** Why would large policy updates be problematic in a human-in-the-loop system?

- **Concept: Multimodal Sensor Fusion (Force + Audio)**
  - **Why needed here:** The system maps haptic input (force sensors) to auditory output. Understanding signal processing (moving average filter, 1000 Hz sampling, noise threshold at 0.5 N) is critical for implementation.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the system handle noise from four distributed load cells to compute a single force value?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Load cells (4×) → NI DAQ (USB-6212) → MATLAB signal processing → PPO agent (policy + value networks) → pitch/amplitude selection → Pain sound playback (headphones) + Facial expression (MorphFace projection) → Tablet UI (Agree/Disagree) → Bluetooth → reward signal

- **Critical path:** Force sensing → filtering → pain intensity calculation (PI = β × F_filtered) → PPO action selection → sound playback → user feedback → policy update

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - PPO vs. SAC/DDPG: PPO chosen for stability over sample efficiency; SAC may be faster but computationally heavier
  - Binary vs. continuous feedback: Binary simplifies user cognitive load but reduces signal granularity
  - 3 sound tracks per gender: Limits expression diversity but reduces search space dimensionality
  - 3-second decision window: Balances experiment pace vs. deliberation time

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Policy oscillation: Learning curves show no convergence after 100+ trials—check reward consistency
  - Force saturation: Users consistently apply >80 N regardless of target—progress bar may be ignored
  - Feedback timeout: High rate of neutral rewards—increase decision window or add visual cue

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline validation:** Run PPO with scripted "oracle" feedback to verify policy convergence without human noise.
  2. **Feedback timing sensitivity:** Test 3s vs. 5s vs. 10s decision windows to measure impact on feedback quality and session duration.
  3. **Gender counterbalancing check:** Analyze order effects (male-first vs. female-first) to ensure observed gender differences aren't confounded by learning/fatigue.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How do cultural background and medical expertise influence the adaptive learning of palpation-to-pain-sound mappings in robopatients?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Authors state they "plan to expand... investigations with a larger number of participants from diverse genders and ethnic backgrounds" and "medical professionals."
- **Why unresolved:** The current study used a small sample of healthy participants from a university setting, limiting generalizability.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative performance data of the PPO model gathered from medical professionals and diverse cultural groups.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Does incorporating palpation speed alongside force improve the realism and user acceptance of generated pain sounds?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Participants suggested "incorporating the speed of palpation to map appropriate pain sounds" during post-study feedback.
- **Why unresolved:** The current implementation maps only force magnitude, ignoring the temporal dynamics of the interaction.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A user study comparing the current force-only model against a force-plus-velocity model using subjective realism ratings.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can a universal equation for mapping palpation force to pain sounds be derived, or is real-time individual adaptation strictly superior?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Authors argue that "finding a general equation... requires more trials covering a larger population" despite the success of adaptive learning.
- **Why unresolved:** The study found that preferences often reflect personal comfort rather than an objective mapping, complicating the derivation of general rules.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Analysis of large-scale aggregated data to determine if a static statistical model can approximate the performance of the adaptive RL agent.

## Limitations
- Small sample size (n=5) limits statistical power and generalizability
- All participants were university-affiliated adults aged 25-46, introducing demographic bias
- Binary feedback mechanism may oversimplify nuanced pain expression preferences
- Specific pain sound selection constrains the expression space

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** PPO's ability to learn and adapt to individual feedback patterns within sessions
- **Medium confidence:** Gender-specific differences in pain sound interpretation
- **Low confidence:** Absolute force thresholds (40-60 N) for optimal pain expression

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-cultural validation:** Replicate the experiment with participants from diverse cultural backgrounds to test whether observed gender differences in pain sound interpretation persist across different linguistic and cultural contexts.

2. **Continuous feedback comparison:** Implement a continuous Likert scale (1-5) instead of binary feedback to determine whether richer reward signals improve learning efficiency or lead to more nuanced pain expression preferences.

3. **Real-time clinical transfer:** Test the adapted PPO policy in a clinical simulation with medical trainees, measuring whether the learned pain expressions improve palpation assessment accuracy compared to scripted pain responses.
