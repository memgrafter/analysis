# Evaluating Cultural Knowledge Processing in Large Language Models: A Cognitive Benchmarking Framework Integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.01649
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01649
- Reference count: 0
- Large language models with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) significantly outperform baseline models in processing minority cultural knowledge, with Gemini-2.5 (RAG) achieving 92.53% accuracy

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a cognitive benchmarking framework that integrates Bloom's Taxonomy with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on minority cultural knowledge, using the Taiwanese Hakka digital archive as a testbed. The framework systematically assesses model performance across six cognitive domains—Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating, and Creating—measuring semantic accuracy and cultural relevance. Results show that RAG-enhanced models significantly outperform baseline models in lower and mid-level tasks, with Gemini-2.5 (RAG) achieving the highest overall accuracy (92.53%). However, even with RAG, models struggle with higher-order creative tasks, highlighting the need for further advances in culturally nuanced generation. The framework offers a structured approach for assessing and improving AI systems' cultural competence, supporting minority heritage preservation and digital archival quality.

## Method Summary
The study develops a cognitive benchmarking framework that combines Bloom's Taxonomy with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to evaluate LLMs' ability to process minority cultural knowledge. The framework uses the Taiwanese Hakka digital archive as a testbed, creating test questions across six cognitive domains (Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating, and Creating). Models are evaluated with and without RAG augmentation, measuring semantic accuracy and cultural relevance. The research compares multiple LLMs, with Gemini-2.5 (RAG) achieving the highest overall accuracy of 92.53%. The study systematically assesses how RAG integration impacts performance across different cognitive complexity levels, revealing that while RAG significantly enhances lower and mid-level task performance, higher-order creative tasks remain challenging even with retrieval augmentation.

## Key Results
- RAG-enhanced models significantly outperform baseline models in lower and mid-level cognitive tasks (Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating)
- Gemini-2.5 (RAG) achieved the highest overall accuracy at 92.53%
- Models struggle with higher-order creative tasks even with RAG augmentation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The integration of RAG with Bloom's Taxonomy framework works by providing LLMs with access to culturally relevant knowledge bases during inference, enabling more accurate responses to domain-specific questions. The retrieval mechanism supplements the model's internal knowledge with curated cultural information from the Taiwanese Hakka digital archive, reducing hallucinations and improving factual accuracy. This approach is particularly effective for lower and mid-level cognitive tasks that require factual recall and comprehension, as the retrieved information directly addresses the knowledge gaps that would otherwise limit model performance.

## Foundational Learning
- **Bloom's Taxonomy**: Six-level cognitive framework (Remembering to Creating) that structures assessment of knowledge processing capabilities
  - Why needed: Provides systematic way to evaluate model performance across cognitive complexity levels
  - Quick check: Can map any question to one of six cognitive domains

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Architecture that retrieves external knowledge during inference to supplement model responses
  - Why needed: Addresses knowledge gaps in LLMs for specialized domains like minority cultural knowledge
  - Quick check: Model outputs should reference retrieved documents

- **Cultural Knowledge Processing**: Specialized domain requiring understanding of implicit cultural context and nuanced meaning
  - Why needed: Standard LLMs lack sufficient training on minority cultural content
  - Quick check: Responses demonstrate cultural appropriateness beyond surface-level accuracy

- **Semantic Accuracy**: Measurement of factual correctness in model responses
  - Why needed: Core metric for evaluating knowledge retrieval effectiveness
  - Quick check: Response matches ground truth without hallucinations

- **Cultural Relevance**: Assessment of whether responses appropriately reflect cultural context and nuances
  - Why needed: Goes beyond factual accuracy to evaluate deeper cultural understanding
  - Quick check: Response demonstrates awareness of cultural context and implications

- **Digital Archival Systems**: Structured repositories of cultural knowledge (e.g., Taiwan Hakka Portal)
  - Why needed: Provide authoritative source material for RAG retrieval
  - Quick check: Archive contains comprehensive, well-organized cultural content

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Question -> Cognitive Domain Classifier -> RAG Retriever (optional) -> LLM -> Evaluation Metrics

Critical path: Question generation and classification → Model response generation (with/without RAG) → Evaluation using semantic accuracy and cultural relevance metrics

Design tradeoffs: The framework prioritizes comprehensive cognitive coverage over depth in any single domain, potentially sacrificing nuanced assessment of specific cultural knowledge types. RAG integration improves factual accuracy but may limit creative responses that require synthesis beyond retrieved content.

Failure signatures: Models without RAG show significant performance drops on factual recall and comprehension tasks, while RAG-enhanced models may still produce culturally inappropriate responses if retrieved documents contain biases or if the model fails to properly contextualize retrieved information.

First experiments:
1. Compare RAG-enhanced vs baseline performance across all six cognitive domains using Taiwanese Hakka test questions
2. Evaluate semantic accuracy and cultural relevance metrics for each cognitive level
3. Test multiple LLMs with identical RAG configurations to identify performance variations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Framework evaluated exclusively on Taiwanese Hakka cultural knowledge, limiting generalizability to other minority cultures
- Reliance on single digital archive (Taiwan Hakka Portal) may introduce domain-specific biases
- Does not fully address potential retrieval quality issues or examine different retrieval strategies

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: RAG-enhanced models' superiority in lower-level cognitive tasks (Remembering, Understanding)
- **Medium Confidence**: Overall framework applicability to other minority cultural contexts
- **Medium Confidence**: Gemini-2.5's leadership position across the tested cognitive spectrum

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework across multiple minority cultures (e.g., indigenous languages, regional dialects) to assess cross-cultural generalizability
2. Implement ablation studies comparing different RAG retrieval strategies and knowledge sources
3. Conduct longitudinal studies tracking model performance as cultural archives expand and evolve
