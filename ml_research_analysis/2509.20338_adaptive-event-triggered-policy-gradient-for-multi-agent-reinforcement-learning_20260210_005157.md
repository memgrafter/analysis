# Adaptive Event-Triggered Policy Gradient for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.20338
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20338
- Authors: Umer Siddique; Abhinav Sinha; Yongcan Cao
- Reference count: 33
- Key outcome: Proposes ET-MAPG and AET-MAPG frameworks that reduce computation and communication costs in MARL by up to 60% and 50% respectively while maintaining task performance

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces two event-triggered reinforcement learning frameworks for multi-agent systems that jointly learn control and triggering policies. ET-MAPG integrates event-triggering into the policy network, allowing agents to decide both actions and when to update them. AET-MAPG extends this with attention-based selective communication, enabling agents to exchange information only when necessary. Both methods can be integrated with any policy gradient MARL algorithm and demonstrate significant efficiency gains without compromising task performance across diverse benchmarks.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes ET-MAPG (Event-Triggered Multi-Agent Policy Gradient) and AET-MAPG (Attention-based Event-Triggered Multi-Agent Policy Gradient) frameworks that combine event-triggering mechanisms with policy gradient methods for MARL. ET-MAPG incorporates event-triggering into the policy network architecture, enabling agents to jointly learn control actions and triggering decisions. AET-MAPG builds upon ET-MAPG by adding attention mechanisms for selective communication between agents. The frameworks aim to reduce unnecessary computation and communication overhead while maintaining comparable performance to traditional time-triggered approaches. Both methods are designed to be compatible with existing policy gradient algorithms, making them broadly applicable across different MARL scenarios.

## Key Results
- ET-MAPG and AET-MAPG achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art time-triggered methods
- Up to 60% reduction in triggering events compared to conventional approaches
- Up to 50% reduction in communication overhead while maintaining task performance
- Successfully demonstrated across diverse benchmark environments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The event-triggered approach works by embedding triggering logic directly into the policy network, allowing agents to learn when updates are necessary based on their current state and environment dynamics. This creates a self-regulating system where computational resources are allocated only when meaningful changes occur. The attention-based mechanism in AET-MAPG further optimizes communication by enabling agents to selectively share information only with relevant peers when needed, reducing network congestion and processing overhead. By integrating these mechanisms with policy gradient methods, the system can adapt its triggering and communication patterns to the specific requirements of each task and environment.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Observation -> Policy Network -> Action/Trigger Decision -> Environment/Communication -> Reward -> Update

Critical path: State observation → Policy network processing → Action and triggering decision → Environment interaction → Reward collection → Policy update

Design tradeoffs: Reduced communication overhead vs. potential delay in information propagation; computational efficiency vs. complexity of joint learning; simplicity of implementation vs. flexibility of attention mechanisms

Failure signatures: Performance degradation when triggering thresholds are set too conservatively; communication bottlenecks when attention mechanisms fail to identify relevant peers; instability when event-triggering interferes with policy learning convergence

First experiments: 1) Run baseline comparison between ET-MAPG and standard MAPG on simple cooperative tasks; 2) Test AET-MAPG's communication reduction on environments with high agent density; 3) Evaluate triggering efficiency across varying environmental complexities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content

## Limitations
- Generalizability beyond tested MARL environments remains uncertain, particularly for highly dynamic or unpredictable communication patterns
- Lack of detailed sensitivity analysis across varying environmental complexities and agent numbers
- Insufficient exploration of attention mechanisms' impact on system robustness and failure modes
- Limited evaluation of scalability to large-scale multi-agent systems with heterogeneous capabilities

## Confidence
High confidence in the core theoretical framework and methodology
Medium confidence in reported performance parity with time-triggered methods due to limited ablation studies
Low confidence in scalability claims and robustness under network disruptions

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive ablation studies to isolate the impact of event-triggering versus policy optimization
2. Evaluate performance across a wider range of MARL environments with varying communication requirements and agent counts
3. Implement rigorous stress testing under network disruptions and varying communication latencies to assess robustness of the event-triggering mechanisms
