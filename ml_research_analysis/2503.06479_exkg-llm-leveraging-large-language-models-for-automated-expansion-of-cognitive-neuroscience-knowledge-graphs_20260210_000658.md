# ExKG-LLM: Leveraging Large Language Models for Automated Expansion of Cognitive Neuroscience Knowledge Graphs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.06479
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06479
- Reference count: 0
- Automated KG expansion using LLMs improves precision to 0.80 (+6.67%), recall to 0.81 (+15.71%), and F1 to 0.805 (+11.81%)

## Executive Summary
ExKG-LLM automates the expansion of cognitive neuroscience knowledge graphs by leveraging large language models to extract and integrate entities and relationships from scientific literature. The framework addresses the labor-intensive nature of KG creation by processing unstructured text from PubMed and clinical reports to identify diseases, biomarkers, and treatments with associated confidence scores. Evaluation demonstrates significant improvements in graph metrics including precision, recall, F1 score, node and edge growth, and clinical utility measures such as engagement rates and semantic search effectiveness.

## Method Summary
The framework processes raw text through a preprocessing pipeline (tokenization, normalization, biomedical NER, dependency parsing) before passing it to GPT-4 for entity and relationship extraction with confidence scoring. Relationships meeting a threshold τ are integrated into the knowledge graph using a confidence-weighted adjacency matrix. The system then applies probabilistic link prediction using multiple embedding models (TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, ConvE, HolmE) to suggest plausible unobserved connections. The approach achieves O(n log n) time complexity but requires O(n²) space for the adjacency matrix representation.

## Key Results
- Precision increased to 0.80 (+6.67%), recall to 0.81 (+15.71%), F1 score to 0.805 (+11.81%)
- Node and edge counts grew by 21.13% and 31.92% respectively
- Graph density decreased by 10.64% while diameter increased to 15
- Engagement rates rose by 20% and link prediction performance improved across multiple embedding models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
LLMs can extract structured entities and relationships from unstructured cognitive neuroscience literature with higher recall than traditional methods. Raw text undergoes tokenization, normalization, NER (using biomedical-clinical models), and dependency parsing. The preprocessed tokens are then passed to an LLM (GPT-4) which identifies entities (diseases, biomarkers, treatments) and their relationships with associated confidence scores.

### Mechanism 2
Threshold-based confidence filtering (τ) balances precision and recall by accepting only high-certainty relationships. For each extracted relationship r_ij, the LLM assigns a confidence score P(r_ij) ∈ [0,1]. The adjacency matrix updates only if P(r_ij) ≥ τ: A_ij = 1 if P_ij ≥ τ, else 0.

### Mechanism 3
Probabilistic link prediction using Bayesian inference can surface unobserved but plausible connections from existing graph structure. After initial expansion, the framework applies P(r_ij exists) = P(r_ij)/(1+P(r_ij)) to suggest relationships not directly extracted from text but inferred from graph patterns.

## Foundational Learning

- **Knowledge Graph Fundamentals** (nodes, edges, adjacency matrices, directed graphs)
  - Why needed here: The entire framework operates on formal graph representations G=(V,E) with confidence-weighted adjacency matrices.
  - Quick check question: Given an adjacency matrix A where A[3,5]=1 and A[5,3]=0, what does this tell you about the relationship between nodes 3 and 5?

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) in Biomedical Text**
  - Why needed here: Preprocessing pipeline relies on domain-specific NER to identify disease names, biomarkers, and treatments.
  - Quick check question: Why might a general-purpose NER model fail to recognize "APOE4" as a biomarker, and how would this affect downstream graph expansion?

- **Link Prediction Evaluation Metrics** (MR, MRR, P@K)
  - Why needed here: Section 4.4 evaluates link prediction using Mean Rank, Mean Reciprocal Rank, and Precision@K.
  - Quick check question: If a model has MR=144, MRR=0.526, and P@10=0.644, what does each metric tell you about its prediction quality?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw Text Corpus -> Preprocessing Pipeline -> LLM Extraction Module -> Confidence Filter -> Graph Integration -> Link Prediction Layer -> Expanded CNKG

- Critical path: Preprocessing quality -> NER accuracy -> LLM extraction quality -> confidence calibration. If NER misses entities (e.g., rare disease variants), the LLM cannot extract relationships involving them.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Time vs. Space: Improved time complexity O(n log n) vs. degraded space complexity O(n²)
  - Precision vs. Recall: Higher recall (+15.71%) comes at cost of increased conflict rate (+20%)
  - Density vs. Coverage: Node/edge growth (+21%/+32%) increases coverage but decreases density (-10.64%)

- Failure signatures:
  - High conflict rate (>10%): LLM extracting contradictory relationships
  - Low density with high diameter: Graph becoming too sparse and disconnected
  - Space exhaustion: O(n²) memory growth for large graphs

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Threshold sensitivity analysis: Run ExKG-LLM with τ ∈ {0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9} on a held-out corpus slice
  2. NER ablation study: Compare extraction quality using general-purpose NER vs. biomedical NER
  3. Link prediction model comparison: Evaluate all six embedding methods using MR, MRR, P@1/3/10

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can the framework be enhanced to reduce the 20% increase in relationship conflicts without compromising the gains in recall? The current confidence-threshold approach lacks the logical constraints necessary to prevent contradictory edges between entities.

### Open Question 2
Can the space complexity be optimized from O(n²) to support massive-scale graphs without sacrificing the improved time efficiency? The current implementation relies on an adjacency matrix that consumes memory quadratically as nodes increase.

### Open Question 3
How effectively does the ExKG-LLM framework generalize to other scientific domains with different relationship complexities, such as genomics? The model is currently tuned for cognitive neuroscience literature without cross-domain validation.

## Limitations

- The 6% conflict rate increase suggests the LLM occasionally extracts contradictory relationships, requiring domain-specific calibration
- O(n²) space complexity creates scalability concerns for large-scale deployment despite improved time efficiency
- Claims about framework adaptability to broader scientific fields are speculative without cross-domain validation

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Graph expansion metrics (precision 0.80, recall 0.81, F1 0.805) and structural changes are directly measurable
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about improved clinical decision-making and semantic search utility lack direct empirical validation
- **Low Confidence**: Framework adaptability claims are speculative without testing on other scientific domains

## Next Checks

1. Conduct systematic sensitivity analysis across τ ∈ [0.5, 0.9] to identify optimal precision-recall tradeoff and quantify impact on conflict rate

2. Evaluate ExKG-LLM performance using alternative LLMs (Claude, Gemini, open-source models) to determine if GPT-4-specific characteristics drive improvements

3. Design controlled experiments testing whether the expanded CNKG actually improves clinical decision-making accuracy or semantic search effectiveness compared to baseline knowledge graphs
