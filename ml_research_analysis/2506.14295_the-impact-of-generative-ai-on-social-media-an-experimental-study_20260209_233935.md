# The Impact of Generative AI on Social Media: An Experimental Study

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.14295
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14295
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: AI tools increased engagement but reduced perceived content quality and authenticity in social media discussions.

## Executive Summary
This study examines the effects of generative AI tools on social media discussions through a controlled experiment with 680 U.S. participants in small-group conversations. Participants were randomly assigned to either a control group or one of four AI-assisted conditions: open chat, conversation starters, comment feedback, or reply suggestions. While AI tools increased engagement and comment volume, they consistently reduced perceived content quality and authenticity, and introduced negative spill-over effects on subsequent human interactions. No AI intervention improved both producer and consumer experiences. The study proposes four design principles for ethical AI integration: transparent disclosure, personalization, contextual awareness, and user-friendly interfaces.

## Method Summary
The study conducted a controlled human-subject experiment with 680 U.S. participants recruited via Prolific. Participants engaged in 10-minute discussion rounds in groups of five using a custom Empirica-based platform. The experiment included three topics (cats vs. dogs, health benefits of oats, universal basic income) presented in randomized order. Five conditions were tested: Control versus four AI treatments (Chat, Conversation Starter, Feedback, Suggestions) using GPT-4o. Producer behavior (engagement, length, Shannon entropy) and consumer perception (quality, trust, authenticity ratings) were measured. Analysis employed non-parametric bootstrapping (10,000 iterations) and regression models.

## Key Results
- AI tools increased user engagement and comment volume but decreased perceived content quality and authenticity
- Context-sensitive usage patterns emerged: casual queries for low-stakes topics, fact-checking for scientific discussions, argumentation support for political topics
- Selective adoption with low direct copying (13-19% overlap between AI suggestions and final submissions)
- No AI intervention improved both producer and consumer experiences simultaneously

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Engagement-Authenticity Tradeoff
AI tools lower cognitive barriers to participation, enabling hesitant users to contribute more content. However, this frictionless production yields content perceived as generic and less trustworthy. The assumption is that perceived authenticity loss outweighs participation gains for overall discourse health. Evidence shows Chat increased comment length to 28.59 words versus 18.76 in Control, yet comments rated significantly lower on informativeness. The break condition is if personalized, context-aware AI can match user voice and topic norms.

### Mechanism 2: Context-Driven Usage Adaptation
Users adapt their AI interaction patterns based on topic stakes rather than uniformly across contexts. Low-stakes topics trigger casual, exploratory AI use, while high-stakes topics shift users toward fact-checking and argumentation support. The assumption is that users possess accurate mental models of when AI help is beneficial versus risky. Evidence shows casual queries dominated the lighter subject of cats (46.4%), whereas participants primarily used AI for fact checking in the scientific conversation of oats (40.4%), and for political discussions in the divisive topic of politics (37.5%).

### Mechanism 3: Selective Adoption with Low Direct Copying
High tool adoption rates coexist with low direct textual overlap between AI outputs and final submissions. Users treat AI as ideation scaffolding rather than content replacement, engaging for brainstorming and fact-checking before substantially rewriting. The assumption is that users have the skill and motivation to meaningfully transform AI suggestions. Evidence shows only 13-16% of Chat comments showed direct textual overlap, and over 89% of Feedback cases where participants used the tool subsequently submitted it.

## Foundational Learning

- **Producer vs. Consumer Perspectives in HCI**: The study explicitly separates how AI affects content creators (ease, volume) from how content is perceived by readers (quality, trust). Systems optimizing only for producer metrics risk degrading consumer experience. Quick check: When evaluating an AI feature, are you measuring both how easy it is to create content and how that content is received?

- **Participation Equality (Normalized Shannon Entropy)**: The study uses normalized Shannon entropy to measure whether discussion is dominated by one voice or evenly distributed, quantifying "inclusivity" objectively rather than relying on self-report. Quick check: If one user posts 90% of comments in a group, what would the normalized Shannon entropy approach?

- **Controlled Social Media Experiments**: Randomized assignment to conditions with realistic platform simulation allows causal claims about AI effects that observational studies cannot establish. The 5-person group structure maintains experimental control while preserving social dynamics. Quick check: Why is random assignment essential for distinguishing whether AI causes behavior change versus attracting users who already behave differently?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: User enters discussion round -> Selects AI tool (Chat sidebar, Conversation Starter button, Feedback inline, Suggestions reply options) -> Receives AI output -> Submits comment -> Other users react and reply -> Post-study questionnaire captures perceptions

- **Critical path**: 1) User enters 10-minute discussion round (randomized topic order) 2) User may invoke AI tool (Chat: open sidebar; Conversation Starter: click button; Feedback: draft then request; Suggestions: select reply stance) 3) User submits comment (logged with AI usage flag) 4) Other users react and reply (reactions visible, ratings collected post-hoc) 5) Post-study questionnaire captures perceptions

- **Design tradeoffs**: Adoption vs. depth (Chat had highest adoption but highest verbosity penalty; Feedback had lower adoption but more substantive revisions in high-stakes topics); Friction vs. quality (Tools requiring more user effort showed more thoughtful use but lower uptake); Flexibility vs. guidance (Open-ended Chat adapts to any context but risks misuse; structured Suggestions constrain choice but may misalign with intent)

- **Failure signatures**: Generic/impersonal output detected by readers ("robotic," "overly formal"); Over-reliance in high-stakes contexts without verification; Negative spillover: AI-assisted content degrades subsequent human conversation quality; Mismatch between tool intent and user goals (27.5% of Conversation Starter uses diverged entirely from suggestions)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) A/B test personalization: Compare generic AI outputs vs. style-adapted outputs on perceived authenticity ratings 2) Topic-stratified deployment: Measure engagement and quality effects across low/medium/high stakes topics with the same tool to validate context-sensitivity 3) Disclosure timing test: Compare pre-posting labels ("this used AI assistance") vs. no labels on receiver trust and engagement metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Long-term effects**: Do the increased engagement and reduced content quality observed in AI-assisted discussions persist, diminish, or intensify with long-term exposure? The experiment was limited to short, 10-minute discussion rounds, preventing observation of habituation, fatigue, or skill acquisition over time.

- **Platform generalization**: How do the effects of generative AI on discussion quality generalize to different social media ecosystems, such as large-scale follower networks (e.g., X/Twitter) rather than small forums? This study isolated participants in small groups of five to simulate a forum environment, which differs significantly from broadcast-style or algorithm-driven feeds.

- **Personalization efficacy**: Can "user-focused personalization" of AI tools successfully mitigate the observed negative effects on perceived authenticity and trust? While participants valued AI for lowering barriers, they consistently rated content as "robotic" and "impersonal." The authors propose "personalization" as a design principle, but this specific solution was not tested in the experiment.

## Limitations
- Results based on U.S. participants in controlled 3-round discussions may not generalize to real-world social media use involving longer-term interactions and diverse cultural contexts
- Findings rely on GPT-4o with specific prompts; different models or prompting strategies may yield different behavioral patterns
- Three topics may not represent the full spectrum of social media discourse stakes

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: AI tools increase engagement and comment volume; authenticity and quality ratings decrease; no intervention improves both producer and consumer experience simultaneously
- **Medium Confidence**: Context-sensitive usage adaptation patterns; selective adoption with low direct copying
- **Low Confidence**: Specific quantitative estimates of spillover effects and the precise magnitude of participation equality changes across conditions

## Next Checks
1. Cross-cultural validation: Replicate the experiment with participants from different countries to test cultural generalizability of context-sensitive AI usage patterns
2. Longitudinal field study: Deploy AI tools on actual social media platforms for extended periods to measure real-world adoption patterns and sustained effects on community discourse quality
3. Personalized AI variants: Test style-adapted AI outputs that learn from user history to determine whether personalization can reduce authenticity penalties while maintaining engagement benefits
