# MCIGLE: Multimodal Exemplar-Free Class-Incremental Graph Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.06219
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06219
- Authors: Haochen You; Baojing Liu
- Reference count: 27
- Primary result: Novel exemplar-free class-incremental learning framework for multimodal graph data that mitigates forgetting and distribution bias without storing old samples

## Executive Summary
MCIGLE addresses the challenge of learning from multimodal graph-structured data in class-incremental settings without storing exemplars from previous tasks. The framework combines optimal transport-based multimodal feature alignment, Fourier-based periodic feature extraction, and Concatenated Recursive Least Squares for analytical weight updates. By maintaining an analytical solution that preserves old knowledge while adapting to new classes, MCIGLE achieves superior performance on four public datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining low forgetting rates.

## Method Summary
MCIGLE processes multimodal graph data through a Multimodal Feature Processing Module that extracts and aligns visual and textual features using correlation-based weighting and optimal transport. A Periodic Feature Extraction Module employs Fourier analysis for efficient feature representation. The Non-Forgetting Mainstream Module uses Concatenated Recursive Least Squares for analytical weight updates without storing historical data, while a Residual Fitting Enhancement Module captures missed information through nonlinear transformations. The framework operates in incremental phases, updating weights analytically while preserving knowledge from previous tasks.

## Key Results
- MCIGLE achieves 0.782 accuracy on COCO-QA, 0.927 on VoxCeleb, 0.767 on SNLI-VE, and 0.683 on AudioSet-MI
- Maintains low forgetting rates across all datasets while achieving high accuracy
- Ablation studies confirm effectiveness of individual components, particularly Fourier-based feature extraction and C-RLS mechanism
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in exemplar-free class-incremental learning scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Concatenated Recursive Least Squares (C-RLS) for Exemplar-Free Weight Updates
C-RLS enables recursive weight updates that preserve old knowledge without storing historical samples, achieving performance comparable to joint training. The method maintains an autocorrelation matrix Φ_k and cross-correlation matrix Z_k updated recursively via Sherman-Morrison formula. Weights are updated incrementally: Ŵ^(k)_M = Ŵ^(k-1)_M + k_k(Y^k_train - X_M,k Ŵ^(k-1)_M), where k_k is a gain coefficient computed from the inverse correlation matrix. Assumes linear analytical solutions can adequately capture feature-to-label mappings and generalize across incremental phases.

### Mechanism 2: Optimal Transport-Based Multimodal Feature Alignment
Optimal transport aligns visual features to textual space, enabling cross-modal graph fusion for node classification. Visual features h_u,v are projected to textual space via transport plan P* = arg min_P Σ P_ij(λ₁C(x_i, y_j) + (1-λ₁)L(x_i, y_j, x_i', y_j')P_i'j') + εW(P), combining cost matrix C, node similarity L, and regularization W. Aligned features are concatenated: h'_u = h_u,v→t ∥ h_u,t. Assumes visual and textual graph features share geometric structure that optimal transport can exploit for meaningful alignment.

### Mechanism 3: Dual-Stream Architecture with Residual Compensation
A linear mainstream module combined with a nonlinear residual compensation module captures both stable knowledge and complex patterns the linear stream underfits. The mainstream provides stable C-RLS predictions. Residuals eY_k = [0, Y^k_train] - X_M,k W^(k)_M capture prediction errors. A compensation network with CNN + flattening + nonlinear projection (Tanh/Mish) learns to correct residuals via separate C-RLS weights. Final prediction: Ŷ^(all)_k = λ₂ X_M,k W^(k)_M + (1-λ₂) X_C,k W^(k)_C. Assumes residuals contain learnable structure; compensation activations capture complementary features.

### Mechanism 4: Fourier-Based Periodic Feature Extraction
Fourier-based layers capture periodic patterns with fewer parameters than CNNs/MLPs, improving efficiency and representation quality. Each layer computes ϕ^(l)(x) = [cos(W^(l)_p x), sin(W^(l)_p x), σ(B̄^(l)_p + W̄^(l)_p x)], combining sinusoidal transformations with learned linear projections and nonlinear activations. Output X_FAN = ϕ^(L) ∘ ... ∘ ϕ^(1)(X_norm) is passed to a classifier. Assumes input data contains periodic or quasi-periodic structure amenable to Fourier representations.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Catastrophic Forgetting in Class-Incremental Learning
  - Why needed here: The entire framework is designed to mitigate forgetting when learning new classes without storing old samples
  - Quick check question: Why does standard gradient descent on new class data degrade performance on previously learned classes?

- Concept: Recursive Least Squares (RLS)
  - Why needed here: C-RLS is the core mathematical engine enabling exemplar-free incremental updates
  - Quick check question: How does RLS maintain an optimal solution estimate incrementally without revisiting all past data?

- Concept: Optimal Transport for Distribution Alignment
  - Why needed here: Used to align visual and textual graph features across modalities before fusion
  - Quick check question: What is the basic intuition behind using optimal transport to align two distributions, and what does the transport plan represent?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input graphs → Multimodal Feature Processing (GNN + Optimal Transport) → Periodic Feature Extraction (Fourier Network) → Mainstream C-RLS + Residual Compensation C-RLS → Weighted Output

- Critical path: Graph features per modality → alignment (OT) → fusion → Fourier network (frozen after phase 0) → mainstream C-RLS (always updating) + compensation C-RLS (phase-wise) → weighted sum produces final predictions

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Linear vs nonlinear: Mainstream is linear for stability; compensation is nonlinear for expressiveness. Trade-off is interpretability vs fit quality
  - Frozen vs adaptive: Fourier backbone is frozen to prevent interference; C-RLS adapts. Trade-off is representation flexibility vs forgetting risk
  - Memory vs exemplar-free: No exemplars stored; only correlation matrices maintained. Trade-off is privacy/memory vs potential replay benefits

- Failure signatures:
  - High forgetting (F metric): Check β (forgetting factor) and γ (regularization); may be too permissive of weight drift
  - Poor multimodal fusion: Check λ₁ in optimal transport; alignment may be dominated by cost or similarity term
  - Compensation dominates: λ₂ too low; mainstream underutilized, causing instability on simple patterns
  - Fourier layer underperforms: Data may lack periodic structure; consider ablation with standard MLP

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce ablation (Figure 3a): Replace Fourier network with FNN/SIREN/KAN on one dataset to validate periodic extraction benefit
  2. Single-modality baseline: Run on text-only and visual-only to quantify multimodal fusion contribution
  3. C-RLS sensitivity: Sweep β ∈ {0.9, 0.95, 0.99, 1.0} and γ ∈ {1e-4, 1e-3, 1e-2} to characterize forgetting-accuracy trade-off

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question 1**: Can the Multimodal Feature Processing Module scale efficiently to scenarios involving more than two modalities?
  - Basis: Section 2.1 defines modality m ∈ {v, t} and relies on projecting visual features to textual space, leaving extension to three or more modalities unaddressed
  - Why unresolved: Optimal transport alignment is described specifically for pairwise projection, unclear if this generalizes to multi-way alignment without combinatorial complexity
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying MCIGLE to datasets with 3+ modalities demonstrating stable alignment and performance

- **Question 2**: Does the reliance on Fourier-based networks limit effectiveness on graph data that lacks inherent periodic patterns?
  - Basis: Section 2.2 states Fourier-based layers "effectively capture periodic patterns," suggesting optimization for this specific property
  - Why unresolved: If underlying graph structure lacks periodic characteristics, the inductive bias might be suboptimal compared to tested baselines
  - What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of performance on synthetic or real-world graph datasets specifically constructed to be non-periodic or random

- **Question 3**: How can MCIGLE close the performance gap with specialized audio-visual baselines like CavRL on audio-centric metrics?
  - Basis: Section 3 notes CavRL outperforms MCIGLE on "Acc" metric for AudioSet-MI, attributed to CavRL's specialization in audio-visual learning
  - Why unresolved: Paper does not propose mechanisms to integrate audio-domain inductive biases into the current framework
  - What evidence would resolve it: Modification of feature processing module to include audio-specific priors, resulting in AudioSet accuracy exceeding 0.685

## Limitations

- Hyperparameter values (γ, β, λ₂, FAN dimensions) are unspecified and critical for performance
- Graph construction methodology for datasets is not detailed
- Compensation network architecture beyond "CNN" remains undefined
- Optimal transport implementation details (regularization λ₁, transport cost) are unclear

## Confidence

- **High**: Linear C-RLS mechanism and its forgetting-mitigation properties (well-established RLS theory)
- **Medium**: Dual-stream architecture effectiveness (mechanism is sound but specific hyperparameters unknown)
- **Low**: Fourier-based feature extraction benefits (ablation evidence only from this paper, no external validation)

## Next Checks

1. Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis: Systematically vary β, γ, and λ₂ to map the forgetting-accuracy trade-off space
2. Cross-dataset generalization test: Apply MCIGLE to a new multimodal graph dataset (e.g., Kinetics-700) to verify robustness
3. Ablation of Fourier layers: Replace with standard MLP and measure impact on periodic pattern datasets versus non-periodic ones to validate the Fourier assumption
