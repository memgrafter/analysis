# GenAITEd Ghana: A First-of-Its-Kind Context-Aware and Curriculum-Aligned Conversational AI Agent for Teacher Education

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.06093
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06093
- Reference count: 4
- Primary result: First context-aware, curriculum-aligned conversational AI for Ghanaian teacher education with teacher-in-the-loop oversight

## Executive Summary
GenAITEd Ghana is a conversational AI system designed to support teacher education in Ghana by integrating the national curriculum (NaCCA) with context-aware pedagogical dialogue. The system uses a two-layer prompt engineering approach, curriculum-indexed retrieval, and teacher-in-the-loop oversight to ensure alignment with Ghana's competency-based curriculum. Evaluated by 12 Ghanaian education experts, the system demonstrated strong pedagogical relevance, cultural responsiveness, and curriculum alignment while maintaining sub-2-second response latency across text and voice modalities.

## Method Summary
The study employed a design science approach to develop GenAITEd Ghana, combining curriculum-indexed retrieval with prompt engineering to ensure curriculum alignment. The system was built using Node.js/Express backend with PostgreSQL, integrated with OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo (with fallbacks), Whisper v3 for ASR, and ElevenLabs/FastSpeech2 for TTS. A two-layer prompt architecture was implemented: system-level prompts for governance and interaction-level prompts for conversational scaffolding. The system was evaluated by 12 Ghanaian education experts across 4 weeks, assessing pedagogical relevance, curriculum alignment, cultural legitimacy, and responsible AI principles.

## Key Results
- Functional testing showed response latencies consistently under 2 seconds across text and voice modalities
- Human expert evaluation found strong pedagogical relevance and curriculum alignment
- Teacher-in-the-loop architecture successfully preserved educator authority through conversation logging and analytics
- The system operationalized Responsible AI principles by embedding transparency, fairness, and accountability into the architecture

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Two-layer prompt engineering reduces hallucinations and maintains curriculum alignment through persistent system-level constraints and dynamic interaction-level scaffolding
- Mechanism: System-level prompts (masterPrompt.js) enforce curriculum boundaries, ethical constraints, and retrieval scope continuously. Interaction-level semi-automated prompts reformulate user inputs into pedagogically coherent queries, supporting clarification → confirmation → response generation loops
- Core assumption: Separating governance prompts from conversational prompts prevents prompt dilution during extended dialogue
- Evidence anchors:
  - "Two complementary prompt pathways were embedded: system-level prompts that enforce curriculum boundaries, ethical constraints, and teacher-in-the-loop oversight, and interaction-level semi-automated prompts that structure live pedagogical dialogue through clarification, confirmation, and guided response generation"
  - "The first layer consists of system-level prompts that engineer the multi-agent retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) backend... This layer operates persistently in the background"
  - "Bridging LMS and generative AI" (arXiv:2504.03966) addresses hallucination challenges via DCCI mechanisms, supporting the need for structured grounding
- Break condition: If system prompts are overridden dynamically or context window exceeds retrieval capacity, curriculum grounding degrades

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Curriculum indexing with NaCCA metadata enables semantic retrieval that constrains AI outputs to approved learning indicators
- Mechanism: curriculumService.js indexes NaCCA syllabi with structured fields (subject, grade_level, strand, sub_strand, core_competency, learning_indicator). User queries are parsed for instructional intent, then matched to curriculum segments via semantic search before embedding in prompts
- Core assumption: Curriculum documents are complete, well-structured, and sufficient for pedagogical reasoning without external knowledge
- Evidence anchors:
  - "Official syllabi and competency frameworks were parsed and standardized into JSON metadata... enabling dynamic prompt contextualization so that every AI-generated output remains aligned with Ghana's competency-based curriculum"
  - "Curriculum activation operated reliably, with user queries consistently mapped to appropriate NaCCA subject areas, grade levels, and learning indicators"
  - Weak direct corpus evidence for curriculum-indexed RAG specifically in teacher education; related work focuses on general LMS integration
- Break condition: If curriculum metadata is incomplete or queries require knowledge beyond NaCCA scope, responses may fabricate or overgeneralize

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Teacher-in-the-loop architecture preserves educator authority by making AI interactions traceable, reviewable, and intervenable
- Mechanism: Teachers create passkey-protected groups, invite student teachers, and retain access to conversation histories, participation analytics, and transcript archives. JWT-based role differentiation enforces permissions. Group conversations are logged with curriculum_reference and conversation_id metadata
- Core assumption: Teachers have time and capacity to review transcripts and intervene; oversight is not purely symbolic
- Evidence anchors:
  - "Teachers can join student-created groups, review interaction histories, monitor participation levels, and address misconceptions in real time"
  - "There's the risk that student teachers may depend too heavily on AI agents for guidance" (Lecturer 3), validating the need for oversight
  - "Human Experts' Evaluation of Generative AI" (arXiv:2511.19482) discusses expert evaluation of GenAI contextualization in Global South education, supporting teacher oversight relevance
- Break condition: If teacher review is absent or delayed, student over-reliance risks manifest; if passkeys are shared broadly, access control fails

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  - Why needed here: Enables grounding LLM outputs in external, authoritative curriculum documents rather than relying solely on model weights
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why RAG reduces hallucination compared to prompting alone?

- Concept: **Multi-agent AI orchestration**
  - Why needed here: GenAITEd coordinates multiple models (ASR, TTS, LLM inference, retrieval) through a central aiService.js hub
  - Quick check question: What is the role of an orchestration layer when multiple AI services must coordinate in real time?

- Concept: **Role-based access control (RBAC)**
  - Why needed here: JWT-based authentication enforces Teacher, Student Teacher, and Administrator permissions for data governance and ethical compliance
  - Quick check question: How does RBAC differ from simple authentication, and why does it matter for educational AI?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Frontend (Vanilla JS/HTML/CSS) -> Backend (Node.js/Express) -> aiService.js -> services/ (voiceService.js, curriculumService.js) -> AI models (GPT-4, Whisper, TTS) -> Database (PostgreSQL)

- Critical path:
  1. User authenticates via JWT → role determined
  2. Teacher activates curriculum (college, year, semester, specialization)
  3. Teacher creates/invites students to group via cryptographic passkey
  4. Student initiates query (text or voice)
  5. aiService.js parses intent → curriculumService.js retrieves NaCCA segment
  6. Prompt assembled (masterPrompt + contextModifiers + curriculum context)
  7. LLM generates response → TTS synthesis if voice mode
  8. Response logged with latency, curriculum_reference, model_used

- Design tradeoffs:
  - OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo as primary LLM vs. local/sovereign models (trades data sovereignty for capability and latency)
  - WebSocket for real-time voice vs. REST-only (adds complexity, required for <2s latency)
  - Session-level conversation history vs. long-term archival (simpler storage, limits retrospective analysis)

- Failure signatures:
  - Voice cloning produces artifacts or mismatches (requires additional model integration)
  - Curriculum mapping returns empty or incorrect learning indicators (check JSON metadata completeness)
  - Group passkey validation fails (verify groupRoutes.js and cryptographic key generation)
  - Response latency exceeds 2s (check network conditions, model routing, or ASR/TTS bottleneck)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Curriculum retrieval accuracy test**: Submit 20 queries spanning subjects and grade levels; verify curriculum_reference mapping matches expected NaCCA indicators. Log retrieval precision.
  2. **Prompt boundary test**: Attempt to elicit responses outside curriculum scope (e.g., non-Ghanaian content, unethical requests). Confirm system-level guardrails block or redirect appropriately.
  3. **Voice pipeline latency test**: Measure end-to-end latency for voice capture → ASR → LLM → TTS → playback across 3G and 4G networks. Identify bottleneck component.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on external API services (OpenAI, ElevenLabs) introduces dependency risks and data sovereignty concerns
- Human expert evaluation was conducted by 12 Ghanaian educators over 4 weeks - a limited sample size for generalizability
- Curriculum indexing assumes NaCCA documents are complete and well-structured; gaps could propagate through the RAG system
- Voice mode performance was validated functionally but not extensively stress-tested under variable network conditions

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Functional performance (response latencies <2 seconds, reliable curriculum mapping, successful voice modality integration) - supported by systematic functional testing and performance logging
- **High Confidence**: Expert evaluation outcomes (strong pedagogical relevance, curriculum alignment, cultural legitimacy) - based on structured assessment by Ghanaian education experts across multiple evaluation criteria
- **Medium Confidence**: Responsible AI principles operationalization - the architecture embeds transparency, fairness, and accountability mechanisms, but long-term effectiveness depends on actual teacher engagement patterns
- **Medium Confidence**: Scalability claims - the system demonstrated operational viability in controlled evaluation, but large-scale deployment across Ghana's teacher education institutions requires infrastructure validation

## Next Checks
1. **Curriculum Coverage Validation**: Systematically test 100+ diverse pedagogical queries across all NaCCA subjects, grade levels, and learning indicators to identify gaps where curriculum metadata fails to capture pedagogical intent or where retrieval returns irrelevant segments

2. **Teacher Time Burden Assessment**: Conduct a longitudinal study measuring actual teacher engagement with conversation histories and analytics dashboards over a semester, quantifying review frequency, intervention patterns, and perceived time burden versus pedagogical benefit

3. **Network Resilience Testing**: Deploy the voice pipeline across Ghana's actual educational network infrastructure (including rural 2G/3G scenarios) to measure end-to-end latency, packet loss effects on ASR accuracy, and user experience degradation, then optimize fallback mechanisms accordingly
