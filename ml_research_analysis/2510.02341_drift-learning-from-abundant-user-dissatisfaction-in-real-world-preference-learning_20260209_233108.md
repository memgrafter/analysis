core_contribution: This paper introduces DRIFT, a preference learning method that
  leverages abundant user dissatisfaction signals from real-world interactions to
  train language models. Instead of relying on scarce explicit satisfaction feedback,
  DRIFT anchors training on real DSAT negatives and samples fresh positives from the
  evolving policy.

# DRIFT: Learning from Abundant User Dissatisfaction in Real-World Preference Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.02341
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02341
- Reference count: 29
- Primary result: Achieves up to +7.61% improvement on WildBench Task Score and +12.29% win rate on AlpacaEval2 over base models, outperforming strong baselines like SPIN and IterDPO.

## Executive Summary
DRIFT is a preference learning method that leverages abundant user dissatisfaction signals (DSAT) from real-world interactions to train language models, avoiding the scarcity of explicit satisfaction feedback. By anchoring training on real DSAT negatives and dynamically sampling positives from the evolving policy, DRIFT maintains stable training signals and prevents gradient collapse common in self-improving methods. Theoretical analysis shows DRIFT guarantees non-vanishing gradient signals and broader high-reward solution coverage compared to existing approaches.

## Method Summary
DRIFT uses asymmetric preference pairs where rejected responses come from observed DSAT cases (fixed off-policy negatives) while chosen responses are freshly sampled from the current policy (on-policy positives). This design maintains a stable preference margin that evolves with model capability while staying grounded in authentic
