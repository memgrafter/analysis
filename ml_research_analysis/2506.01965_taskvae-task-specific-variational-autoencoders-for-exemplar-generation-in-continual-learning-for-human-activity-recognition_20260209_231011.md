# TaskVAE: Task-Specific Variational Autoencoders for Exemplar Generation in Continual Learning for Human Activity Recognition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.01965
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01965
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: TaskVAE outperforms experience replay methods in class-incremental HAR, achieving up to 83% accuracy with minimal memory (60 samples per task) and unlimited synthetic samples.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of continual learning (CL) in human activity recognition (HAR) using raw sensor data, focusing on class-incremental settings where new activities are learned over time without forgetting prior knowledge. The proposed TaskVAE framework employs task-specific variational autoencoders (VAEs) to generate synthetic exemplars from previous tasks, which are then used to train the classifier alongside new task data. Unlike traditional methods requiring prior knowledge of total class count or a single VAE for all tasks, TaskVAE adapts flexibly to increasing tasks. Experiments on five HAR datasets with multiple class-incremental scenarios show that TaskVAE outperforms experience replay methods, particularly with limited data, achieving up to 83% accuracy in complex scenarios. TaskVAE maintains strong stability as dataset size increases while requiring minimal memory (equivalent to 60 samples per task) and generating unlimited synthetic samples. The filtering mechanism ensures high-quality exemplar generation, making TaskVAE a robust and memory-efficient solution for real-world HAR applications.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes TaskVAE, a continual learning framework for HAR that uses task-specific variational autoencoders to generate synthetic exemplars from previous tasks. The method trains one VAE per task on raw accelerometer and gyroscope data, then generates synthetic samples by uniformly sampling the latent space and filtering with a VAE classifier (threshold p=0.60). These synthetic samples, along with real data from new tasks, are used to train a convolutional neural network classifier. The approach addresses the class-incremental learning challenge without requiring prior knowledge of total class count or storing real exemplars. TaskVAE is evaluated on five HAR datasets (UCI HAR, MotionSense, HHAR, RealWorld, PAMAP2) using 128-sample windows with 50% overlap, normalized per channel, and split by participant (80/10/10 train/val/test). The VAE architecture uses 5 convolutional layers in the encoder and 3 transposed convolutions in the decoder, while the classifier uses 4 convolutional layers followed by a fully connected layer. Training uses Adam optimizer (assumed), learning rate 0.0005, batch size 64, and 20 epochs, with loss combining reconstruction, KL divergence, and classification components.

## Key Results
- TaskVAE achieves up to 83% accuracy in complex 2-2-2 class-incremental scenarios across five HAR datasets
- Maintains strong stability (OCT) as dataset size increases, outperforming traditional experience replay methods
- Requires minimal memory (equivalent to 60 samples per task) while generating unlimited synthetic samples
- Filtering mechanism ensures high-quality exemplar generation with threshold p=0.60

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TaskVAE addresses the fundamental challenge of catastrophic forgetting in continual learning by generating synthetic exemplars that preserve the data distribution of previous tasks. The task-specific VAE architecture allows each VAE to learn the unique characteristics of its corresponding task's data distribution, enabling more accurate synthetic sample generation compared to a single shared VAE. The uniform sampling within bounded latent regions promotes diversity in generated samples, while the confidence-based filtering mechanism ensures only high-quality exemplars are used for training. This combination of diversity promotion and quality control allows TaskVAE to maintain both plasticity (learning new classes) and stability (retaining old knowledge) in the class-incremental setting. The memory efficiency comes from storing only the VAE parameters rather than real exemplars, while the ability to generate unlimited samples provides flexibility in balancing old and new task data during training.

## Foundational Learning
- **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** Generative models that learn to encode data into a latent space and decode it back, capturing the underlying data distribution. Why needed: VAEs provide the foundation for generating synthetic exemplars that approximate previous task data distributions without storing real samples.
- **Class-Incremental Continual Learning:** Learning paradigm where new classes are introduced sequentially while maintaining performance on previously learned classes. Why needed: Real-world HAR systems must adapt to new activities over time without forgetting previously learned ones.
- **Catastrophic Forgetting:** Phenomenon where neural networks lose previously learned information when trained on new tasks. Why needed: The primary challenge TaskVAE addresses is preventing this forgetting while learning new activities.
- **Confidence-Based Filtering:** Mechanism that evaluates the quality of generated samples by measuring classifier confidence. Why needed: Ensures only high-quality synthetic exemplars are used for training, preventing degradation of model performance.
- **Latent Space Sampling:** Process of generating new data points by sampling from the learned latent distribution. Why needed: Enables TaskVAE to create diverse synthetic samples that represent the full range of previous task data.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Raw IMU Data -> VAE (Task-Specific) -> Latent Space Sampling -> VAE Classifier Filtering -> Synthetic Exemplars + New Task Data -> CL Classifier -> Predictions

**Critical Path:**
The critical path flows from VAE generation through filtering to CL classifier training. First, each task-specific VAE learns to encode and decode its corresponding task data. During new task learning, the VAE generates synthetic samples from previous tasks by sampling the latent space and filtering with the VAE classifier. These synthetic samples are then combined with new task data to train the CL classifier, ensuring knowledge retention while learning new activities.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Task-specific VAEs vs. single shared VAE: Task-specific VAEs capture task-specific data distributions more accurately but require more memory for storing multiple VAE parameters
- Uniform vs. Gaussian latent sampling: Uniform sampling promotes diversity but may generate lower-quality samples that require filtering
- Confidence threshold p=0.60: Balances sample quality and quantity, but may need adjustment based on task complexity
- VAE classifier for filtering vs. external validation: Using the same VAE for filtering is efficient but may introduce bias

**Failure Signatures:**
- VAE generates poor-quality samples: Check reconstruction loss convergence and visualize reconstructions
- Insufficient synthetic samples after filtering: Monitor filtered sample count per class; relax p if <30% pass
- Catastrophic forgetting despite replay: Verify synthetic samples are combined with new task data during CL classifier training; check old-class accuracy curve

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Train VAE on single task data and evaluate reconstruction quality to ensure proper learning of data distribution
2. Generate synthetic samples from trained VAE and visualize them alongside real data to assess quality and diversity
3. Test the filtering mechanism by varying the confidence threshold p and measuring the trade-off between sample quality and quantity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. Can integrating advanced generative models, such as Diffusion Probabilistic Models, improve synthetic sample quality and knowledge retention compared to VAEs? While VAEs are memory-efficient, they may lack the generative fidelity of newer architectures, potentially limiting performance on highly complex sensor data. Comparative benchmarks where TaskVAE's VAE component is replaced by a diffusion model, measuring accuracy and retention on complex HAR datasets would resolve this.

2. How can the latent space sampling and confidence-based filtering mechanisms be optimized to ensure more reliable generation of synthetic samples? The authors identify "further optimization of the sampling and filtering mechanisms" as necessary to "enhance its effectiveness" and stability. Demonstrating an adaptive filtering algorithm that dynamically adjusts thresholds based on data complexity or latent space density would resolve this.

3. Does the uniform sampling strategy within bounded latent regions offer distinct advantages over standard Gaussian sampling for class-incremental stability? This heuristic may generate outliers or "lower-quality samples" that the filtering mechanism must then remove, potentially reducing efficiency. An ablation study comparing model performance when sampling from the learned Gaussian versus the bounded uniform distribution would resolve this.

## Limitations
- VAE architecture and training details have some unspecified parameters (optimizer type, exact normalization procedure, classification loss computation)
- Uniform latent sampling may generate lower-quality samples requiring filtering, potentially reducing efficiency
- Fixed confidence threshold (p=0.60) may not be optimal across all tasks and datasets

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Core methodology, experimental setup, and key performance claims are clearly specified and reproducible
- **Medium confidence:** VAE architecture and training procedure are detailed, but lack of optimizer specification and exact normalization procedure introduces some uncertainty
- **Low confidence:** None identified for major claim clusters

## Next Checks
1. Verify that the VAE classifier's filtering threshold (p=0.60) consistently produces sufficient synthetic samples (>30% of original class distribution) without significant class imbalance
2. Confirm that the uniform latent sampling bounds are correctly computed as min/max values across the training data per dimension, ensuring proper coverage of the latent space
3. Test the CL classifier's stability by running the same scenario multiple times with different random seeds to ensure consistent old-class accuracy (OCT) retention
