# DxHF: Providing High-Quality Human Feedback for LLM Alignment via Interactive Decomposition
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.18802
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18802
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: DxHF increases feedback accuracy by 5% through decomposition, ranking, and linking features

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces DxHF, a user interface designed to improve the quality of human feedback for aligning large language models. The key idea is to decompose long-form text responses into individual atomic claims and use visual encodings like opacity and linking to guide attention during comparison. A technical simulation study shows that decomposition with ranking and linking improves accuracy, especially for uncertain annotators. A crowdsourcing user study with 160 participants confirms that DxHF increases feedback accuracy by 5% compared to baseline pairwise comparison, though it slightly increases completion time. Accuracy gains are particularly strong for users with lower certainty.

## Method Summary
The study employed a two-phase evaluation approach combining technical simulation and user studies. First, a simulation study tested the effectiveness of decomposition, ranking, and linking features on accuracy improvement using simulated annotator behavior. Second, a crowdsourcing user study with 160 participants compared DxHF against a baseline pairwise comparison interface, measuring accuracy and completion time across different user certainty levels. An ablation study further isolated the contributions of ranking and linking features to the overall performance gains.

## Key Results
- DxHF increases feedback accuracy by 5% compared to baseline pairwise comparison
- Accuracy gains are particularly strong for users with lower certainty
- Both ranking and linking features contribute to DxHF's effectiveness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
DxHF works by addressing the cognitive limitations humans face when comparing long-form text responses. By decomposing responses into atomic claims, the interface reduces cognitive load and allows for more granular comparison. Visual encodings like opacity and linking help guide attention to relevant parts of the text, making it easier for annotators to identify key differences and similarities. This structured approach is particularly beneficial for uncertain annotators who might otherwise struggle with holistic comparisons.

## Foundational Learning
- **Text Decomposition**: Breaking long responses into atomic claims; needed to reduce cognitive load during comparison
- **Visual Encoding**: Using opacity and linking to guide attention; needed to highlight relevant text segments
- **Ranking Mechanisms**: Structured ordering of claims; needed to prioritize important content
- **User Certainty**: Different annotation behaviors based on confidence levels; needed to understand performance variations
- **Ablation Testing**: Systematically removing features to measure individual contributions; needed to isolate effectiveness factors

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Text Decomposition -> Visual Encoding -> Ranking System -> Feedback Collection
- **Critical Path**: User uploads text -> System decomposes into claims -> Visual interface renders claims with encoding -> User provides feedback
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Accuracy vs. completion time; granularity vs. cognitive load
- **Failure Signatures**: Increased completion time; reduced accuracy for highly certain users
- **First Experiments**: 1) Compare decomposition vs. no decomposition on simple text pairs; 2) Test visual encoding effectiveness in isolation; 3) Measure impact of ranking on user decision speed

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on simulated data for technical evaluation may not capture real-world annotation complexity
- 5% accuracy improvement may not be practically meaningful for all alignment scenarios
- Increased completion time could impact scalability in large-scale alignment projects

## Confidence
- **High**: User interface design contributions and demonstrated accuracy improvement
- **Medium**: Magnitude of improvement and practical significance in real-world settings
- **Low**: Generalization to other text formats, domains, or annotation tasks

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a field study with actual alignment practitioners using real model outputs and compare DxHF against existing annotation tools in production settings
2. Evaluate the decomposition approach on different response types including code, structured data, and multimodal outputs to assess generalizability
3. Measure the long-term reliability of DxHF-generated feedback by tracking whether models trained on this data show improved alignment metrics compared to those trained on traditionally annotated data
