# Deep Contrastive Learning for Feature Alignment: Insights from Housing-Household Relationship Inference

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.11205
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11205

- Primary result: DCL framework achieves 98.33% AP and 99.76% NDCG in housing-household relationship inference

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a deep contrastive learning (DCL) framework to infer housing-household relationships from American Community Survey (ACS) microdata. The method addresses the challenge of learning joint relationships between distinct tabular entities without explicit ground truth labels by leveraging co-occurrence patterns and a bisecting K-means clustering approach. The dual-encoder DCL architecture captures semantic differences between housing and household features while mitigating noise from clustering. The model demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with strong transferability across states and robustness to varying data quality conditions.

## Method Summary
The DCL framework employs a dual-encoder architecture with housing and household branches that encode features into a shared latent space. The model uses co-occurrence patterns from census tract and block group information as weak supervision signals, with a bisecting K-means clustering pre-processing step to filter noise. Contrastive learning objectives optimize feature alignment by pulling together representations of matching pairs and pushing apart non-matching pairs. The framework processes synthetic ACS data generated from Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) in Delaware and North Carolina, with synthetic ground truth relationships created for validation purposes.

## Key Results
- Achieves 98.33% Average Precision and 99.76% NDCG on Delaware validation data
- Demonstrates strong transferability with 97.92% AP and 99.80% NDCG on North Carolina data
- SHAP analysis identifies tenure status and mortgage information as most influential matching factors
- Outperforms baseline methods including rule-based approaches and machine learning algorithms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dual-encoder architecture enables independent feature extraction from housing and household data while maintaining a shared representation space for comparison. Contrastive learning optimizes the alignment of matching pairs while discriminating against non-matching pairs, creating semantically meaningful embeddings. The bisecting K-means clustering pre-processing step reduces noise by grouping similar records before training, improving the quality of contrastive pairs. The framework leverages weak supervision from co-occurrence patterns in census tract and block group information, eliminating the need for explicit ground truth labels.

## Foundational Learning
- Contrastive Learning: Learning representations by comparing similar and dissimilar pairs
  - Why needed: Enables learning without explicit labels by using co-occurrence patterns
  - Quick check: Verify that matching pairs have higher similarity scores than non-matching pairs
- Dual-Encoder Architecture: Separate encoding branches for housing and household data
  - Why needed: Allows independent feature extraction while maintaining comparable representations
  - Quick check: Ensure both encoders produce vectors of consistent dimensionality
- Bisecting K-means Clustering: Hierarchical clustering for noise reduction
  - Why needed: Filters out irrelevant records and improves quality of training pairs
  - Quick check: Confirm that clustered groups contain semantically similar records
- SHAP Analysis: Feature importance attribution for model interpretability
  - Why needed: Identifies which features most strongly influence matching decisions
  - Quick check: Verify that top features align with domain knowledge of housing-household relationships

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Housing Encoder -> Contrastive Loss -> Housing Representation
Household Encoder -> Contrastive Loss -> Household Representation
Bisecting K-means Clustering -> Data Preprocessing -> Training Pairs

Critical Path:
Data Preprocessing (Clustering) -> Dual-Encoder Training -> Inference
The model first clusters records to reduce noise, then trains encoders to optimize contrastive objectives, and finally uses the trained encoders for relationship inference.

Design Tradeoffs:
The framework trades explicit ground truth labels for weak supervision from co-occurrence patterns, accepting potential noise in exchange for scalability. The dual-encoder design provides flexibility for heterogeneous data but requires careful alignment of representation spaces. Bisecting K-means clustering improves training quality but may discard potentially relevant records.

Failure Signatures:
Poor performance on records with atypical feature combinations, sensitivity to hyperparameter choices for temperature and clustering thresholds, and potential bias toward dominant demographic patterns in the training data.

First Experiments:
1. Test encoder outputs on synthetic validation data to verify proper representation learning
2. Evaluate clustering quality by examining group homogeneity and separation
3. Measure contrastive loss convergence and embedding quality using nearest neighbor analysis

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Synthetic data validation limits real-world applicability and may not capture all edge cases
- Absence of real ground truth labels requires validation through downstream tasks rather than direct verification
- Sensitivity to hyperparameter choices, particularly clustering parameters and temperature settings
- Potential bias toward dominant demographic patterns present in training data

## Confidence
High: Technical implementation quality, metric computation accuracy, and methodological soundness
Medium: Real-world applicability, generalizability across diverse datasets, and robustness to data quality variations

## Next Checks
1. Test framework on real ACS data from multiple states with varying demographic characteristics to assess regional performance differences
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify individual component contributions (dual-encoder, contrastive loss, clustering) to overall performance
3. Evaluate model robustness to data quality issues including missing values, measurement errors, and temporal variations in survey responses
