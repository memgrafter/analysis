# Caption Injection for Optimization in Generative Search Engine

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.04080
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04080
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: First multimodal G-SEO method achieving 1.85% relative improvement in unimodal and 1.09% in multimodal settings

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of optimizing content visibility in generative search engines (GSEs) by extending the task from unimodal to multimodal scenarios. The proposed method, Caption Injection, is the first multimodal G-SEO approach that integrates visual semantics into textual content by extracting captions from images and injecting them into text through a three-stage pipeline: structural generation, alignment refinement, and semantic injection. The method was evaluated on the MRAMG benchmark under both unimodal and multimodal settings using the G-Eval metric. Results show that Caption Injection significantly outperforms text-only G-SEO baselines, achieving relative improvements of 1.85% and 1.09% in unimodal and multimodal scenarios, respectively. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of multimodal integration in enhancing content visibility within GSEs.

## Method Summary
Caption Injection operates through a three-stage pipeline: (1) Structural Generation extracts object-action-scene triplets from images using a vision-language model; (2) Alignment Refinement uses an LLM to align and enrich captions with source text context; (3) Semantic Injection determines optimal insertion points for refined captions in the source text. The method was evaluated on the MRAMG benchmark using GLM-4-9B as the GSE backbone and Qwen-2.5-VL-7B for image captioning, with G-Eval 2.0 measuring subjective visibility across 7 dimensions.

## Key Results
- Achieves 1.85% relative improvement in subjective visibility over text-only baselines in unimodal settings
- Achieves 1.09% relative improvement in multimodal settings, demonstrating cross-modal effectiveness
- Outperforms all text-only G-SEO baselines across 6 datasets with consistent improvements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Cross-Modal Semantic Projection
Mapping visual features into natural language space enables LLMs in GSEs to better process and utilize multimodal information for content synthesis. VLMs generate structured captions capturing object-action-scene triplets, which are then refined through LLM-based alignment with source text before injection. Core assumption: LLMs process textual representations of visual content more effectively than raw visual features. Break condition: If VLM-generated captions contain hallucinations, refinement may amplify errors.

### Mechanism 2: Structured Semantic Triplet Decomposition
Breaking visual content into structured object-action-scene elements improves alignment precision with relevant textual fragments. The triplet design provides abstract semantic anchors that guide which text segments to enrich, avoiding wholesale text rewriting. Core assumption: The object-action-scene framework comprehensively captures semantically relevant aspects of images for G-SEO purposes. Break condition: If images contain semantic information that doesn't fit this framework, key information may be lost.

### Mechanism 3: Contextual Position-Based Injection
Strategic placement of refined captions at high-relevance text positions enhances cross-modal coherence and influences GSE attention patterns. LLM determines optimal insertion point based on contextual dependencies, preserving text fluency while augmenting with visual semantics. Core assumption: GSEs' internal attention mechanisms can be influenced by positional semantic cues in source content. Break condition: If GSE attention mechanism is invariant to positional cues, or if injection disrupts semantic coherence, visibility gains may not materialize.

## Foundational Learning

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  - Why needed: GSEs use RAG pipelines to retrieve sources and synthesize responses; understanding this flow is essential for knowing where optimization interventions apply.
  - Quick check: Can you trace how a user query flows through retrieval to LLM synthesis in a RAG system?

- **Generative Search Engine Optimization (G-SEO)**
  - Why needed: This is the core task—shifting from traditional ranking-based SEO to optimizing for subjective visibility in synthesized responses.
  - Quick check: Why are keyword-based SEO techniques less effective when LLMs synthesize responses rather than rank documents?

- **Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for Captioning**
  - Why needed: The method depends on extracting semantic captions from images; understanding VLM capabilities and limitations is critical.
  - Quick check: What types of visual information might a VLM fail to capture in a caption (e.g., abstract concepts, text within images)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: VLM (Qwen-2.5-VL-7B) → Refinement LLM → Injection LLM → GSE Simulator (GLM-4-9B) → G-Eval 2.0

- **Critical path**: 1) Input image → VLM → structural caption (object/action/scene); 2) Structural caption + source text → refinement LLM → refined caption; 3) Refined caption + source text → injection LLM → optimized source; 4) Optimized source + query → GSE simulator → generated response; 5) Response → G-Eval 2.0 → subjective visibility score

- **Design tradeoffs**: Shallow vs. deep fusion (uses "relatively shallow mapping level" rather than deep cross-modal feature interaction); Text dominance vs. visual augmentation (enriches text selectively rather than rewriting based on images); Automated vs. quality-controlled (includes expert random sampling review)

- **Failure signatures**: Long-text sources (>6,000 chars) show poor optimization gains; Performance consistently lower in multimodal vs. unimodal settings for all methods; VLM-generated captions occasionally outperform refined captions in multimodal settings

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Baseline validation comparing Caption Injection vs. text-only baselines on MRAMG-Wiki subset; 2) Ablation study comparing original vs. VLM-generated vs. refined captions on MRAMG-Arxiv; 3) Position sensitivity test injecting refined captions at fixed positions vs. LLM-determined position

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can deep cross-modal feature fusion mechanisms substantially improve G-SEO performance compared to the shallow mapping-level integration in Caption Injection? The paper uses a three-stage pipeline that operates at a "relatively shallow mapping level" without deep feature interaction between modalities.

### Open Question 2
What optimization strategies can effectively address the performance degradation of G-SEO methods in multimodal settings compared to unimodal settings? Even Caption Injection shows lower improvement in multimodal settings (+1.09%) versus unimodal settings (+1.85%).

### Open Question 3
How can G-SEO methods model and adapt to the inherent semantic preferences of black-box GSEs to improve optimization alignment? Current approaches optimize content without accounting for the GSE's internal semantic representations and biases.

### Open Question 4
What approaches can improve G-SEO effectiveness for long-text content sources where current methods show minimal or negative improvements? MRAMG-Manual has average text length of 6,365.4 characters, making it difficult for generative models to extract key optimization cues.

## Limitations
- Performance degradation in multimodal settings compared to unimodal scenarios indicates unresolved cross-modal grounding challenges
- Limited effectiveness on long-text content sources (>6,000 characters) where all methods show minimal or negative improvements
- Potential quality issues when VLM-generated captions outperform refined captions, suggesting alignment refinement may introduce noise

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core finding that multimodal G-SEO outperforms text-only approaches (1.85% unimodal improvement, 1.09% multimodal improvement) is supported by statistically significant results
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of the object-action-scene triplet structure is supported by cognitive science literature but lacks direct empirical validation within this G-SEO context
- **Low confidence**: The claim that LLM-determined injection positions provide superior visibility gains over fixed positions lacks direct experimental validation

## Next Checks
1. **Position sensitivity validation**: Compare LLM-determined caption injection positions against systematic fixed-position insertion (beginning, middle, end) to quantify the contribution of contextual position selection to visibility gains
2. **Cross-GSE generalization test**: Evaluate Caption Injection performance across multiple GSE backbones (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) to assess architecture-specific performance variations
3. **Long-text chunking strategy evaluation**: Implement and test content chunking strategies for long-text sources to address the observed negative performance on extensive documents
