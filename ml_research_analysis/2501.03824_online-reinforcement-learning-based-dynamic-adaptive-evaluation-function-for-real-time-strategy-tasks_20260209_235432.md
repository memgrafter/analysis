# Online Reinforcement Learning-Based Dynamic Adaptive Evaluation Function for Real-Time Strategy Tasks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2501.03824
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03824
- **Reference count:** 37
- **Key outcome:** Dynamic weight adjustment method using online RL and AdamW optimizer significantly improves evaluation functions in RTS games, with consistent performance gains across complex scenarios and minimal computational overhead

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a dynamic weight adjustment method for evaluation functions in real-time strategy (RTS) games using online reinforcement learning enhanced by the AdamW optimizer. The method significantly improves the adaptability and performance of traditional evaluation functions, particularly in dynamic and unpredictable RTS environments. Through round-robin tournament experiments, dynamically adjusted evaluation functions consistently outperformed their static counterparts, with improvements becoming more pronounced as game complexity increased.

The research demonstrates that adaptive evaluation functions can better handle the strategic depth and environmental changes characteristic of RTS games like StarCraft II. The method shows particular promise for IDABCD and IDRTMinimax algorithms, though performance gains varied across different map sizes and algorithm types. Despite additional computational steps, the approach maintained high efficiency with minimal added processing time.

## Method Summary
The method employs online reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust weights in evaluation functions for RTS games. The AdamW optimizer is integrated into the reinforcement learning framework to enhance weight adjustment efficiency. The system continuously learns and adapts evaluation function weights during gameplay based on environmental feedback and performance metrics. This dynamic adaptation allows the evaluation function to respond to changing game states and opponent strategies in real-time, addressing the limitations of static evaluation functions that cannot adapt to evolving game conditions.

## Key Results
- Dynamically adjusted evaluation functions consistently outperformed static counterparts in round-robin tournaments
- Performance improvements became more pronounced with increasing game complexity and larger map sizes
- Computational overhead remained minimal, averaging less than 6% additional processing time
- IDABCD showed significant improvements across all map sizes, while DS improvements were less pronounced on smaller maps

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dynamic weight adjustment mechanism works by continuously updating evaluation function weights based on real-time gameplay data and performance feedback. The AdamW optimizer provides efficient gradient-based updates that adapt to the non-stationary nature of RTS environments. This allows the evaluation function to learn which features are most relevant in different game states and opponent strategies, rather than relying on predetermined static weights. The online learning approach enables the system to discover optimal weight configurations that may not be apparent through offline training or manual tuning, particularly for complex interactions between game features that only emerge during actual gameplay.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Evaluation Function -> Online RL Agent -> AdamW Optimizer -> Weight Update Module -> Game Environment Feedback Loop

**Critical Path**
Game State Observation → Feature Extraction → Evaluation Function Scoring → Action Selection → Environment Response → Performance Feedback → Weight Adjustment → Updated Evaluation Function

**Design Tradeoffs**
The method balances computational efficiency with adaptive capability, accepting minimal overhead (under 6%) for significant performance gains. Static weights would be faster but less adaptive. Pure offline training would miss real-time strategic adjustments. The AdamW optimizer trades some implementation complexity for better convergence properties in non-stationary environments.

**Failure Signatures**
Weight divergence or oscillation in highly volatile game states. Overfitting to specific opponent strategies. Computational bottlenecks during intensive weight adjustment phases. Poor generalization when transferred between different game maps or scenarios.

**First Experiments**
1. Compare static vs dynamic weights on simple benchmark scenarios with controlled complexity
2. Test weight stability over extended gameplay sessions (100+ games)
3. Validate computational overhead claims across different hardware configurations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Exclusive focus on StarCraft II may limit generalizability to other RTS games
- Performance improvements primarily observed in complex scenarios, uncertain in simpler environments
- Limited analysis of long-term weight stability across extended gameplay sessions
- Computational overhead analysis restricted to specific hardware configurations

## Confidence
- Overall method effectiveness: Medium
- Computational efficiency claims: High
- Algorithm-specific improvements: Medium
- Generalizability across RTS games: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test the method across multiple RTS game engines (beyond StarCraft II) to validate cross-game applicability and identify game-specific limitations.

2. Conduct extended gameplay sessions (minimum 100 hours) to evaluate long-term stability of dynamically adjusted weights and potential convergence issues.

3. Implement ablation studies to isolate the contribution of the AdamW optimizer from other components of the reinforcement learning framework.
