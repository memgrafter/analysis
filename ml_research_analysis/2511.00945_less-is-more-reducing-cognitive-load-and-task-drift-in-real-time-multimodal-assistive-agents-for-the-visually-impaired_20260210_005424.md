# "Less is More": Reducing Cognitive Load and Task Drift in Real-Time Multimodal Assistive Agents for the Visually Impaired

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.00945
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00945
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: VIA-Agent reduces task completion time by 39.9% compared to Doubao baseline while improving usability scores

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses critical limitations in current multimodal assistive agents for visually impaired users, specifically high cognitive load and task drift during real-time navigation and object retrieval. The authors introduce VIA-Agent, a prototype system that co-optimizes a specialized VLM core with a real-time communication embodiment. Through a comparative user study with 9 visually impaired participants, VIA-Agent demonstrated significantly better performance than commercial baselines, achieving faster task completion, reduced cognitive load, and improved usability scores. The system's key innovation lies in its goal-persistent design and calibrated conciseness approach, generating brief, actionable guidance while maintaining task focus.

## Method Summary
VIA-Agent consists of two main components: a VLM Core and an embodiment system. The VLM Core uses Doubao-1.6-thinking-250715 with a 5-step chain-of-thought reasoning workflow including goal persistence, visual context analysis, draft instructions, confidence assessment, and final response generation. It implements a 128-token response limit, 2-round context window, 1-day persistent memory, and multi-level confidence filtering. The embodiment provides real-time interaction through continuous video and audio streaming via an iOS app (iOS 16.0+) connected to cloud ASR/TTS services through an RTC Gateway. The system was evaluated with 9 visually impaired participants across navigation and object retrieval tasks, comparing against BeMyAI v6.10.2 and Doubao v10.6.0 on iPhone 14 Pro.

## Key Results
- VIA-Agent achieved 39.9% faster task completion time compared to Doubao baseline
- Higher Task Success Rate with 240s navigation limit and 180s object retrieval limit
- Improved usability scores (SUS 4.3 vs 3.8 baseline) and reduced cognitive load per NASA-TLX ratings
- Demonstrated better task drift control with higher Goal Consistency and Instruction Relevance metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system's effectiveness stems from its goal-persistent architecture that continuously re-evaluates user objectives throughout interactions, preventing task drift common in general-purpose assistants. The calibrated conciseness design generates brief, actionable responses (128-token maximum) that reduce cognitive load while maintaining task relevance. Real-time streaming via RTC infrastructure enables low-latency responses essential for navigation tasks, while the multi-level confidence filtering ensures appropriate handling of uncertain information. The persistent memory maintains task context across sessions, and the VIA-specific role setting prevents the agent from treating users as sighted.

## Foundational Learning
**Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**: Multi-step reasoning process that breaks down complex tasks into manageable sub-tasks. Needed for systematic problem-solving in assistive scenarios. Quick check: Verify all 5 reasoning steps execute in sequence without skipping.
**Confidence Filtering**: Tiered response system based on confidence levels (high/medium/low) that determines information disclosure. Needed to prevent misinformation while maintaining task progress. Quick check: Test with ambiguous visual inputs to observe filtering behavior.
**Real-Time Streaming Architecture**: Continuous bidirectional communication via RTC rather than request-response patterns. Needed to achieve sub-10s latency critical for navigation. Quick check: Measure end-to-end latency with concurrent video/audio streams.
**Task Drift Mitigation**: Systematic goal re-evaluation and instruction relevance checking. Needed to maintain focus in extended interactions. Quick check: Introduce intentional distractions and verify goal persistence.
**Calibrated Conciseness**: Controlled response length (128 tokens) balancing informativeness with cognitive load. Needed to prevent information overload. Quick check: Verify response lengths consistently stay under limit across task types.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: User Input -> RTC Gateway -> VLM Core (Goal Persistence → Visual Context → Draft Instructions → Confidence Assessment → Final Response) -> TTS Output -> User

**Critical Path**: Video/Audio Stream → RTC Gateway → Cloud ASR → VLM Core → TTS → Audio Output
The most time-sensitive components are video processing, ASR transcription, and TTS synthesis, requiring parallel processing to maintain sub-10s latency.

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- 128-token limit vs comprehensive guidance: Prioritizes reduced cognitive load over exhaustive detail
- 2-round context vs full conversation history: Balances relevance with computational efficiency
- RTC streaming vs MCP request-response: Trades implementation simplicity for critical latency reduction
- Multi-level confidence vs binary certainty: Provides nuanced information handling at cost of complexity

**Failure Signatures**:
- Excessive latency (>10s): Indicates RTC infrastructure or parallel processing issues
- Task drift indicators: Shows goal persistence or instruction relevance mechanisms failing
- Verbose responses (>100 tokens): Suggests calibrated conciseness not properly enforced
- Repeated clarifications: Indicates role setting or visual impairment awareness not functioning

**First Experiments**:
1. Test baseline latency with concurrent video/audio streaming to identify bottlenecks
2. Verify goal persistence by introducing intentional distractions mid-task
3. Measure response conciseness across different task types to confirm 128-token enforcement

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the paper.

## Limitations
- Small sample size (N=9) limits statistical power and generalizability of findings
- Lack of statistical significance testing makes it unclear whether performance differences are meaningful
- Baseline comparisons limited to two commercial products without open-source alternatives
- Complete system prompt and few-shot demonstrations not provided, hindering exact reproduction
- RTC infrastructure and ASR/TTS service details abstracted away, creating technical dependencies

## Confidence
**High confidence**: VIA-Agent reduces task completion time (39.9% faster than Doubao) and achieves higher usability scores (SUS 4.3 vs 3.8) based on direct user study measurements with defined metrics and controlled conditions.

**Medium confidence**: VIA-Agent reduces cognitive load and task drift indicators, as these are based on subjective NASA-TLX ratings and qualitative task drift assessments that may be influenced by participant interpretation and researcher bias.

**Low confidence**: Claims about VIA-Agent being "superior" to baselines are not fully supported without statistical significance testing, baseline implementation details, or comparison to additional assistive technologies.

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the user study with a larger sample size (N≥20) and include open-source baselines like GPT-4V or Gemini to strengthen statistical validity and benchmark diversity.
2. Publish the complete system prompt template and few-shot demonstrations used for VIA-Agent Core to enable independent verification of the goal-persistent behavior and calibrated conciseness design.
3. Conduct a technical benchmark comparing VIA-Agent's RTC streaming latency against MCP-based architectures under identical hardware conditions to empirically validate the claimed latency reduction.
