# Hierarchical Federated Foundation Models over Wireless Networks for Multi-Modal Multi-Task Intelligence: Integration of Edge Learning with D2D/P2P-Enabled Fog Learning Architectures

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.03695
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03695
- Reference count: 16
- Primary result: Hierarchical federated foundation models reduce training latency and energy consumption compared to conventional federated learning while maintaining or improving accuracy.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces hierarchical federated foundation models (HF-FMs) to address the challenge of scaling multi-modal multi-task (M3T) foundation models in distributed wireless edge networks. HF-FMs align the modular structure of M3T models—comprising modality encoders, prompts, MoEs, adapters, and task heads—with the hierarchical topology of fog/edge infrastructures, enabling module-wise training and aggregation. The approach incorporates optional device-to-device (D2D) communications for localized cooperative training and module relaying. A prototype evaluation on two Visual Question Answering datasets shows that HF-FMs reduce training latency and energy consumption compared to conventional federated learning while maintaining or improving accuracy. The work identifies four key system capabilities—non-uniform module circulation, module relaying, node specialization, and collaborative inference—and outlines future research directions to further develop this paradigm.

## Method Summary
The proposed approach, hierarchical federated foundation models (HF-FMs), leverages the modular structure of M3T models to enable efficient distributed training over wireless networks. The method involves partitioning M3T models into individual modules—such as modality encoders, prompts, MoEs, adapters, and task heads—and distributing them across a hierarchical fog/edge architecture. Training occurs at multiple levels: device-level, fog-level, and cloud-level, with module-wise aggregation and synchronization. Optional D2D communications allow devices to share modules locally, reducing reliance on the central fog or cloud. The system supports dynamic module circulation, relaying, and node specialization to optimize resource utilization and adapt to network conditions. Prototype experiments on two VQA datasets demonstrate reduced training latency and energy consumption while maintaining or improving accuracy.

## Key Results
- HF-FMs reduce training latency and energy consumption compared to conventional federated learning.
- The framework maintains or improves accuracy on two Visual Question Answering datasets (VQA-CPv2 and GQA).
- Four key system capabilities are identified: non-uniform module circulation, module relaying, node specialization, and collaborative inference.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The proposed approach works by aligning the modular architecture of multi-modal multi-task foundation models with the hierarchical topology of fog/edge networks. By distributing individual modules across the network, HF-FMs enable localized, module-wise training and aggregation, reducing the need for centralized coordination. Optional D2D communications further enhance efficiency by allowing devices to share modules directly, bypassing the fog or cloud. This hierarchical and distributed approach minimizes communication overhead, balances computational load, and adapts to network dynamics, leading to reduced training latency and energy consumption while preserving model accuracy.

## Foundational Learning
- **Hierarchical federated learning**: Extends federated learning to multi-level architectures (device, fog, cloud) for efficient distributed training. *Why needed*: Reduces communication overhead and balances computational load across heterogeneous networks. *Quick check*: Verify that module-wise aggregation occurs at each hierarchical level.
- **Multi-modal multi-task (M3T) models**: Models that handle multiple modalities (e.g., text, image) and tasks simultaneously. *Why needed*: Enables unified processing of diverse data sources and tasks. *Quick check*: Confirm that modality encoders, prompts, and task heads are properly integrated.
- **Device-to-device (D2D) communications**: Direct communication between devices for localized data or model sharing. *Why needed*: Reduces reliance on central fog/cloud, improving latency and scalability. *Quick check*: Ensure D2D protocols are secure and efficient.
- **Module relaying**: Forwarding model modules between nodes to optimize resource utilization. *Why needed*: Enhances flexibility and robustness in dynamic network environments. *Quick check*: Validate that relaying does not introduce significant delays or errors.
- **Node specialization**: Assigning specific roles to nodes (e.g., encoder, decoder) based on capabilities. *Why needed*: Optimizes resource allocation and improves system efficiency. *Quick check*: Confirm that specialization aligns with node capabilities and network topology.
- **Collaborative inference**: Distributed inference using multiple nodes for a single task. *Why needed*: Leverages collective resources for improved performance. *Quick check*: Ensure inference results are consistent and accurate across nodes.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Devices -> Fog nodes -> Cloud; Modules (encoders, prompts, MoEs, adapters, task heads) circulate within and across levels.
- **Critical path**: Module training and aggregation at device level → Fog-level synchronization → Cloud-level global aggregation → Module distribution back to devices.
- **Design tradeoffs**: Module-wise training reduces communication overhead but increases complexity in synchronization; D2D communications improve latency but introduce security risks.
- **Failure signatures**: Module loss or corruption during relaying; Synchronization failures due to network instability; Security breaches via D2D communications.
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Compare HF-FMs with conventional federated learning on VQA datasets for latency and accuracy. 2) Evaluate the impact of D2D communications on training efficiency. 3) Test module relaying under varying network conditions.

## Limitations
- Evaluation is limited to two small-scale Visual Question Answering datasets, which may not reflect performance in more complex scenarios.
- The paper does not address critical challenges such as device heterogeneity, network dynamics, or security vulnerabilities.
- Optional D2D communications and module relaying mechanisms lack quantitative analysis of their impact on performance and resource consumption.

## Confidence
- **Reduced training latency and energy consumption**: Medium (based on limited prototype experiments)
- **Maintained or improved accuracy**: Medium (restricted to two VQA datasets)
- **Framework's system capabilities and future directions**: High (logical extensions of proposed architecture)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct large-scale experiments using diverse multi-modal datasets and real-world wireless network topologies to assess the framework's scalability and robustness.
2. Perform a comprehensive security and privacy analysis, including the impact of optional D2D communications on data leakage and model poisoning risks.
3. Evaluate the framework's performance under varying degrees of device heterogeneity and network dynamics, such as fluctuating link quality and node availability.
