# A Novel XAI-Enhanced Quantum Adversarial Networks for Velocity Dispersion Modeling in MaNGA Galaxies

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.24598
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24598
- Authors: Sathwik Narkedimilli; N V Saran Kumar; Aswath Babu H; Manjunath K Vanahalli; Manish M; Vinija Jain; Aman Chadha
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: Vanilla model achieves RMSE = 0.27, MSE = 0.071, MAE = 0.21, R² = 0.59 on MaNGA velocity dispersion prediction

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a novel hybrid quantum-classical architecture for modeling velocity dispersion in MaNGA galaxies, integrating a 4-qubit quantum neural network with classical deep learning layers and an adversarial evaluator guided by LIME-based interpretability. The core innovation is using LIME explanations as features for an adversarial evaluator that provides feedback to the quantum model, theoretically encouraging predictions based on valid reasoning rather than spurious correlations. Experiments on ~2110 MaNGA galaxies demonstrate that the Vanilla hybrid model achieves the most consistent performance across regression metrics (RMSE=0.27, R²=0.59), outperforming variants that incorporate additional self-supervised or adversarial training objectives.

## Method Summary
The approach uses a hybrid quantum-classical neural network where classical dense layers process 8 input features reduced to 4 PCA components, followed by a 4-qubit quantum circuit with parameterized Rx/Ry rotation gates and Z-basis Hamiltonian measurement. A separate evaluator model takes concatenated inputs of raw features, QNN predictions, and LIME explanation weights to provide adversarial feedback. The total loss combines prediction error (MSE) with evaluator feedback weighted by α=0.5. The system is trained using Adam optimizer (lr=0.001) for 10 epochs on GPU-simulated quantum kernels via CUDA-Quantum, with parameter-shift rule handling quantum gradient computation.

## Key Results
- Vanilla hybrid QNN achieves RMSE = 0.27, MSE = 0.071, MAE = 0.21, R² = 0.59
- Q-GAN-SSL variant shows degraded performance (R² = 0.09) compared to Vanilla
- Removing evaluator feedback increases RMSE from 0.27 to 0.30 in ablation study

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Hybrid quantum-classical architecture provides richer feature representation than purely classical counterparts
- **Mechanism:** Classical layers process 8 input features, then encode into 4-qubit quantum state using Rx/Ry rotations; quantum circuit's expectation value captures complex correlations via superposition/entanglement
- **Core assumption:** 4-qubit circuit provides more expressive feature mapping than equivalent classical layers
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract mentions "hybrid quantum neural network with classical deep learning layers"; section 4.4 discusses "quantum-enhanced feature representations"
- **Break condition:** No advantage if circuit is too shallow, dataset patterns unsuitable for quantum feature map, or classical network can learn same representations

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Adversarial evaluator guided by LIME explanations improves generalization by penalizing spurious correlations
- **Mechanism:** Evaluator trained with QNN to distinguish "good" predictions from "bad" ones using LIME feature importance as training signal
- **Core assumption:** LIME explanations provide stable, meaningful signal for judging prediction quality
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract describes "evaluator model with LIME-based interpretability"; section 4.4 details evaluator design using concatenated features, outputs, and LIME explanations
- **Break condition:** Fails if LIME explanations are noisy/inconsistent or evaluator learns to mimic QNN's errors

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Hybrid loss function combining prediction error with adversarial feedback yields balanced, robust model
- **Mechanism:** Total loss = MSE(prediction, target) + α × MSE(evaluator output, target), where α balances direct accuracy with evaluator's criteria
- **Core assumption:** Beneficial trade-off exists between fitting training data and satisfying evaluator's learned criteria
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 5.2.3 describes combined loss formulation; ablation study shows performance degradation without evaluator feedback
- **Break condition:** Degrades if α is too high/low or objectives conflict significantly

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) and Parameter Shift Rule**
  - **Why needed here:** Quantum layer is a VQC requiring special gradient computation
  - **Quick check question:** How compute gradient of cost C w.r.t. quantum gate parameter θ using parameter shift rule? (Answer: Compute C(θ+π/2) and C(θ-π/2), then ∇C ≈ ½[C(θ+π/2) - C(θ-π/2)])

- **Concept: LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)**
  - **Why needed here:** LIME outputs become core training features for evaluator, not just post-hoc analysis
  - **Quick check question:** What does LIME output for single prediction from tabular model? (Answer: Set of weights, one per input feature, indicating contribution to prediction deviation from average)

- **Concept: Hybrid Quantum-Classical Computing with CUDA-Quantum**
  - **Why needed here:** Implementation relies on CUDA-Quantum for managing classical-quantum interface
  - **Quick check question:** Where does quantum circuit actually execute in this architecture? (Answer: Simulated on classical NVIDIA GPU using qpp-gpu backend; no real quantum hardware used)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** 5 classical Dense Layers (ReLU + dropout=0.25) -> Quantum Layer (4 qubits, Rx/Ry rotations, Hamiltonian measurement) -> Sigmoid output
- **Critical path:** Data batch → Hybrid QNN prediction → LIME explanation generation → Concatenate [features, prediction, explanations] → Evaluator model → Combined loss computation → Backpropagation (parameter-shift for quantum layer)
- **Design tradeoffs:** Performance vs complexity (Vanilla simpler yet outperforms variants); computational overhead vs explainability (LIME explanations expensive but integrated); qubit count vs simulation cost (4 qubits chosen over 1-3 based on performance)
- **Failure signatures:** Evaluator collapse (uniform feedback); noisy LIME feedback (erratic training); quantum gradient vanishing (barren plateaus)
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Implement Vanilla model to confirm baseline RMSE without evaluator; 2) Enable evaluator with α=0.5 to verify adversarial feedback is constructive; 3) Remove LIME explanations from evaluator input to isolate explanation-as-feature mechanism

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question:** How does framework perform on real NISQ hardware vs noise-free GPU simulations?
- **Basis:** Authors explicitly identify hardware gap between simulations and real QPUs as key future work
- **Why unresolved:** Experiments used CUDA-Quantum qpp-gpu backend (idealized environment)
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Deployment on physical quantum hardware to evaluate noise effects

- **Question:** Can lightweight architecture scale efficiently to larger, more complex datasets?
- **Basis:** Conclusion notes lightweight model size may not scale efficiently, suggesting need for more scalable quantum architectures
- **Why unresolved:** Study limited to MaNGA sample (~2110 galaxies) with 4-qubit system
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Performance benchmarks on larger surveys with increased qubit counts

- **Question:** What optimizations required for self-supervised and adversarial variants to surpass Vanilla?
- **Basis:** Authors conclude refining self-supervised integration is necessary as Vanilla outperforms variants in variance capture
- **Why unresolved:** Self-Supervised model showed very low R² (0.09) vs Vanilla (0.59)
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Architectural adjustments improving variant R² without sacrificing interpretability

## Limitations

- Limited ablation studies on quantum circuit depth prevent isolation of quantum contribution to performance
- No direct comparison with purely classical baselines of comparable complexity
- 4-qubit simulation constraint means results may not scale to larger quantum circuits
- LIME explanation stability across training iterations not validated

## Confidence

- Hybrid architecture performance gains: **Medium**
- Adversarial feedback via LIME improves generalization: **Medium**
- Quantum feature mapping provides advantage: **Low** (simulation-only evidence)

## Next Checks

1. Replace 4-qubit quantum layer with classical layer of equivalent width (e.g., 16 neurons) and compare performance to isolate quantum contribution
2. Run LIME explanations across multiple training epochs to measure explanation stability and correlation with model predictions
3. Implement control variant where evaluator receives LIME explanations from black-box model rather than QNN itself to test for confounding
