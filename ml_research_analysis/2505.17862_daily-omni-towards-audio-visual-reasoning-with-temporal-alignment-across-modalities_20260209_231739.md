# Daily-Omni: Towards Audio-Visual Reasoning with Temporal Alignment across Modalities

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2505.17862
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17862
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Introduces Daily-Omni benchmark and training-free Daily-Omni Agent that achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on audio-visual reasoning tasks requiring temporal alignment

## Executive Summary
Daily-Omni addresses the gap in existing multimodal benchmarks by focusing on audio-visual reasoning with temporal alignment across modalities. The benchmark consists of 684 videos segmented into clips with 1,197 multiple-choice QA pairs spanning six task types, including audio-visual event alignment and cross-modal reasoning. A novel QA generation pipeline combines automated annotation, revision, temporal alignment, and quality control to efficiently scale the dataset. The paper also presents Daily-Omni Agent, a training-free baseline that achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models by combining visual, audio, and ASR models with temporal alignment techniques.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces a comprehensive framework for audio-visual reasoning that combines a new benchmark with a novel training-free agent. The Daily-Omni benchmark features 684 videos from diverse sources (SUN, Kinetics, AudioSet) segmented into 30-second or 60-second clips, with 1,197 multiple-choice QA pairs generated through an automated pipeline involving annotation, revision, temporal alignment, and quality control. The Daily-Omni Agent integrates visual, audio, and automatic speech recognition (ASR) models with temporal alignment techniques, achieving state-of-the-art performance among open-source models without requiring fine-tuning.

## Key Results
- Daily-Omni Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on audio-visual reasoning tasks
- Current MLLMs struggle with audio-visual integration, highlighting the importance of temporal alignment
- The benchmark spans six task types including audio-visual event alignment and cross-modal reasoning
- QA generation pipeline enables efficient scaling while maintaining quality through automated and human-verified processes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by integrating multiple modalities through temporal alignment rather than treating them independently. The Daily-Omni Agent combines visual, audio, and ASR models with explicit temporal alignment mechanisms that synchronize information across modalities. This alignment is critical because real-world audio-visual events are inherently temporal, and reasoning requires understanding how different modalities correspond in time. The benchmark's design, which includes diverse video sources and task types requiring cross-modal reasoning, ensures that models must learn genuine multimodal integration rather than exploiting single-modality cues.

## Foundational Learning

**Multimodal Learning** - Learning representations that combine information from multiple sensory modalities. Needed because real-world understanding requires integrating visual and auditory information. Quick check: Can the model perform cross-modal reasoning tasks where information from one modality is essential for answering questions about another.

**Temporal Alignment** - Synchronizing information across modalities based on temporal relationships. Critical because audio-visual events occur in time and require understanding temporal correspondence. Quick check: Does the model correctly associate events that occur simultaneously across different modalities.

**Automated QA Generation** - Using algorithms to create question-answer pairs from video content. Important for scaling dataset creation while maintaining quality. Quick check: Are the generated questions diverse, accurate, and require genuine multimodal reasoning.

**Cross-Modal Reasoning** - The ability to reason about relationships between different modalities. Essential for tasks where information from one modality cannot be fully understood without reference to another. Quick check: Can the model answer questions that require combining visual and audio information?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Video Processing -> Audio Extraction -> ASR Processing -> Visual Analysis -> Temporal Alignment Module -> QA Answer Generation

**Critical Path**: The temporal alignment module is the critical component that synchronizes audio and visual information streams, enabling the agent to reason about cross-modal relationships that are essential for answering the benchmark questions.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The training-free approach trades potential performance gains from fine-tuning against broader applicability and reduced computational requirements. The automated QA generation balances scalability with quality control through human verification steps.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on tasks requiring fine-grained temporal alignment, inability to handle out-of-domain audio-visual scenarios, and failure on questions requiring deep cross-modal reasoning rather than surface-level feature matching.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test baseline performance on single-modality questions to establish lower bounds
2. Evaluate temporal alignment accuracy on synthetic audio-visual synchronization tasks
3. Compare performance across different video source domains to identify potential biases

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses narrowly on a single training-free baseline without direct comparison to fine-tuned state-of-the-art MLLMs
- Lack of detailed analysis of potential biases in the automated QA generation pipeline that combines human revision with algorithmic annotation
- No systematic evaluation of annotation consistency across the 1,197 QA pairs
- Absence of ablation studies isolating the impact of individual temporal alignment techniques
- Limited analysis of potential domain-specific biases in the selected video sources (SUN, Kinetics, AudioSet)

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The technical implementation of the Daily-Omni Agent and the general structure of the benchmark are sound and well-documented

**Medium confidence**: The claim that current MLLMs struggle with audio-visual integration, given the limited scope of direct comparisons

**Medium confidence**: The importance of temporal alignment for multimodal reasoning, based on the agent's performance improvements without broader ablation studies

## Next Checks

1. Conduct comprehensive ablation studies isolating the impact of each temporal alignment technique in the Daily-Omni Agent to quantify their individual contributions to performance

2. Compare the proposed agent against fine-tuned state-of-the-art MLLMs on the Daily-Omni benchmark to determine if the reported limitations reflect fundamental challenges or evaluation methodology constraints

3. Perform systematic bias analysis of the QA generation pipeline, including inter-annotator agreement studies and examination of potential cultural or domain-specific biases in the video sources and resulting questions
