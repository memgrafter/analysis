# Prompt Inject Detection with Generative Explanation as an Investigative Tool

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.11006
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11006
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: Fine-tuned text-generation LLM models can effectively detect prompt injections and generate explanations for security investigation

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates using fine-tuned text-generation LLM models to detect prompt injections and generate explanatory outputs for AI security investigators. The research employs the ToxicChat dataset containing both benign and adversarial prompts (jailbreaking and toxic). Using Supervised Fine Tuning and Direct Preference Optimization techniques, the study demonstrates that fine-tuned models significantly outperform vanilla models in detecting adversarial prompts. The generated explanations are generally acceptable for investigative purposes, though some exhibit subjectivity or bias.

## Method Summary
The research methodology involves fine-tuning text-generation LLM models using the ToxicChat dataset, which contains labeled examples of benign and adversarial prompts including jailbreaking and toxic content. Two fine-tuning approaches are employed: Supervised Fine Tuning and Direct Preference Optimization. The study compares performance between fine-tuned models and vanilla (untrained) models across detection accuracy metrics. A 3B parameter model is used as the primary evaluation subject, with generated explanations assessed for quality and usefulness in security investigations.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned models significantly outperform vanilla models in detecting adversarial prompts
- The 3B parameter model demonstrates better generalization after fine-tuning
- Generated explanations are generally acceptable, with only a few being subjective, biased, or misleading

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The fine-tuning process enables models to learn specific patterns and characteristics of adversarial prompts through exposure to labeled examples. Supervised Fine Tuning provides explicit guidance on correct classifications, while Direct Preference Optimization helps the model align with desired behaviors by learning from preference pairs. This dual approach allows the model to develop nuanced understanding of prompt injection patterns beyond what vanilla models can achieve through pretraining alone.

## Foundational Learning
- **Prompt Injection Detection**: Understanding techniques to identify malicious inputs designed to manipulate AI systems - needed to establish baseline capabilities for security investigation - quick check: can distinguish benign from adversarial prompts with >90% accuracy
- **Supervised Fine Tuning**: Process of training models on labeled datasets to improve specific task performance - needed to provide explicit guidance on adversarial prompt classification - quick check: model achieves consistent improvement over baseline on validation set
- **Direct Preference Optimization**: Method for aligning model behavior with human preferences through preference learning - needed to refine model responses for investigative utility - quick check: preference-based metrics show improvement in explanation quality
- **ToxicChat Dataset**: Curated collection of benign and adversarial prompts for security evaluation - needed to provide standardized benchmark for testing detection capabilities - quick check: dataset covers representative range of prompt injection techniques

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Data Input -> Fine-tuning Process -> Detection Model -> Explanation Generator -> Security Investigator
**Critical Path**: ToxicChat dataset → Supervised Fine Tuning → Direct Preference Optimization → Evaluation Pipeline
**Design Tradeoffs**: Model size (3B vs larger models) balances generalization capability with computational efficiency; fine-tuning methods trade explicit supervision for preference-based refinement
**Failure Signatures**: False negatives in detection, subjective or biased explanations, overgeneralization to benign prompts
**First Experiments**: 1) Baseline comparison between vanilla and fine-tuned model detection accuracy 2) Explanation quality assessment using standardized metrics 3) Cross-dataset generalization testing

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses exclusively on jailbreaking and toxic content, potentially missing other prompt injection categories
- Explanation quality assessment relies on subjective evaluation rather than standardized metrics
- Scalability concerns regarding performance consistency across different model sizes

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Fine-tuned models outperform vanilla models in adversarial prompt detection on the tested dataset
- **Medium confidence**: Generated explanations are useful for investigation despite some quality concerns
- **Medium confidence**: 3B parameter model generalization findings, pending replication on broader datasets

## Next Checks
1. Test model performance across diverse prompt injection categories beyond jailbreaking and toxic content, including data poisoning and instruction manipulation attacks
2. Evaluate explanation quality using standardized metrics (e.g., coherence scores, factual accuracy measures) rather than subjective assessment
3. Assess performance scalability by comparing results across multiple model sizes (1B, 7B, 13B parameters) using identical fine-tuning procedures
