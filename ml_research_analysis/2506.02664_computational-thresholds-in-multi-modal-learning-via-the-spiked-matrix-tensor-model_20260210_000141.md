## Executive Summary
This work introduces and analyzes a spiked matrix-tensor model with shared latent structure, modeling multi-modal learning scenarios where correlated data modalities provide complementary information on joint latent variables. The model consists of a spiked matrix and a spiked tensor sharing a common low-rank structure, with the goal of recovering hidden latent vectors from noisy observations. The paper reveals surprising algorithmic behaviors in this setting. While the spiked tensor model is typically intractable at low signal-to-noise ratios, correlation with the matrix enables efficient recovery via Bayesian Approximate Message Passing (Bayes-AMP), inducing staircase-like phase transitions reminiscent of neural network phenomena. However, empirical risk minimization for joint learning fails: the tensor component obstructs effective matrix recovery, and joint optimization significantly degrades performance, highlighting the limitations of naive multi-modal learning. The key finding is that a simple Sequential Curriculum Learning strategy - first recovering the matrix, then leveraging it to guide tensor recovery - resolves this bottleneck and achieves optimal weak recovery thresholds. This strategy, implementable with spectral methods, emphasizes the critical role of structural correlation and learning order in multi-modal high-dimensional inference. The results provide a rare instance where the interaction between different data modalities can be precisely analyzed, shedding light on how structure and learning order affect computational tractability in high-dimensional problems.

## Method Summary
The paper analyzes a spiked matrix-tensor model where both components share a common latent structure represented by a low-rank matrix B. The model consists of a rank-one spiked matrix M with signal-to-noise ratio λ and a symmetric rank-one spiked tensor T with signal-to-noise ratio α, both generated from the same underlying signal B. The primary recovery algorithm studied is Bayesian Approximate Message Passing (Bayes-AMP), which exploits the statistical structure of the problem. The authors derive state evolution equations to characterize the performance of Bayes-AMP and analyze the landscape of the joint empirical risk function. A Sequential Curriculum Learning strategy is proposed where the matrix component is recovered first (using spectral methods), then the tensor recovery is initialized using the recovered matrix information. The analysis combines rigorous theoretical derivations with extensive numerical simulations to validate the theoretical predictions across different parameter regimes.

## Key Results
- Staircase-like phase transitions emerge under Bayes-AMP when tensor and matrix are correlated, contrasting with typical smooth transitions in tensor problems
- Joint optimization of matrix and tensor components fails: the tensor obstructs matrix recovery and degrades overall performance
- Sequential Curriculum Learning (matrix first, then tensor) achieves optimal recovery thresholds and outperforms joint approaches
- The model reveals how structural correlation between modalities can enable or obstruct learning depending on algorithmic strategy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The correlation between matrix and tensor components creates a shared information structure that can be exploited sequentially. When the matrix is recovered first, it provides a good initialization and structural guidance for tensor recovery. However, joint optimization fails because the tensor's non-convex landscape creates spurious local minima that trap gradient-based methods, preventing effective matrix recovery. The staircase transitions under Bayes-AMP arise from the algorithm's ability to iteratively refine estimates by exploiting the correlation structure in a message-passing framework. The curriculum learning approach works by decomposing the problem into tractable subproblems: the matrix recovery is well-behaved and provides a warm start for the more challenging tensor component.

## Foundational Learning
- **Spiked Matrix-Tensor Model**: A statistical model combining low-rank matrix and tensor structures with shared latent variables. Why needed: Provides a tractable framework for analyzing multi-modal learning with correlated structures. Quick check: Verify the rank-one structure and noise distributions match the theoretical assumptions.
- **Bayesian Approximate Message Passing (Bayes-AMP)**: An iterative algorithm that exploits prior knowledge to recover latent signals from noisy observations. Why needed: Enables efficient recovery in high-dimensional settings by passing statistical messages between variables. Quick check: Confirm state evolution equations accurately predict empirical performance.

Why needed: Provides precise characterization of algorithmic performance and phase transitions. Quick check: Compare theoretical predictions with simulation results across parameter regimes.
- **Curriculum Learning Strategy**: A learning paradigm where components are learned sequentially rather than jointly. Why needed: Resolves computational bottlenecks when joint optimization fails due to complex loss landscapes. Quick check: Validate that matrix-first approach consistently outperforms joint optimization.
- **Phase Transitions in High-Dimensional Inference**: Sharp changes in algorithmic performance as signal-to-noise ratios cross critical thresholds. Why needed: Characterizes the fundamental limits of recovery and guides algorithm design. Quick check: Verify staircase patterns in empirical performance curves.
- **Empirical Risk Landscape Analysis**: Study of the geometry of loss functions to understand optimization behavior. Why needed: Explains why joint optimization fails and guides alternative strategies. Quick check: Confirm presence of spurious local minima that trap gradient descent.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Signal B -> Matrix M + Tensor T -> Recovery Algorithm (Bayes-AMP or Curriculum) -> Estimated Signal B_hat
**Critical Path**: Data generation (B → M,T) → Algorithm selection → State evolution tracking → Performance evaluation
**Design Tradeoffs**: Joint optimization offers simplicity but fails computationally; sequential approach requires ordering knowledge but succeeds at optimal thresholds
**Failure Signatures**: Joint optimization gets trapped in local minima; Bayes-AMP shows staircase transitions; spectral methods alone insufficient for tensor recovery
**First Experiments**: 1) Verify staircase phase transitions under Bayes-AMP across different λ,α values; 2) Compare joint vs sequential recovery performance; 3) Test curriculum learning with noisy matrix estimates

## Limitations
- Analysis focuses on Bayes-AMP algorithm which may not capture all practical learning algorithms
- Results are asymptotic and may not directly translate to finite-sample regimes typical in applications
- Curriculum learning approach requires prior knowledge of matrix structure which may not always be available
- Model assumes specific correlation structures that may not capture all forms of multi-modal data relationships

## Confidence
- High confidence: The theoretical characterization of the limitations of joint optimization (Section 4.1), the staircase phase transitions under Bayes-AMP (Section 4.2), and the effectiveness of curriculum learning (Section 4.3) are all supported by rigorous mathematical proofs and extensive simulations.
- Medium confidence: The practical implications for real-world multi-modal learning systems, while theoretically sound, require further empirical validation beyond the synthetic settings studied.

## Next Checks
1. Validate the curriculum learning approach on real-world multi-modal datasets (e.g., vision-language pairs, multi-sensor time series) to assess practical performance gains.
2. Compare Bayes-AMP with other message-passing and neural network approaches on the same spiked matrix-tensor tasks to understand the robustness of the observed phenomena.
3. Extend the analysis to non-Gaussian priors and asymmetric correlation structures to assess the generality of the findings.
