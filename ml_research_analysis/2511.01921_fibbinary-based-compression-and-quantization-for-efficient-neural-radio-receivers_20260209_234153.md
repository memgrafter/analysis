# Fibbinary-Based Compression and Quantization for Efficient Neural Radio Receivers

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.01921
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01921
- **Reference count:** 8
- **Primary result:** Achieves 45% power saving, 44% area reduction in multipliers, and 63.4% memory reduction with FCQ and INQ for neural radio receivers.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Fibbinary-based compression and quantization techniques to address the computational and memory challenges of neural radio receivers in 6G wireless systems. The authors propose a combination of Fibonacci Codeword Quantization (FCQ) with fine-grained Incremental Network Quantization (INQ), along with two lossless compression algorithms—word-length compression using Zeckendorf's theorem and word-count compression exploiting redundancy. These methods significantly reduce hardware costs (power, area, memory) while maintaining or improving receiver performance compared to conventional approaches.

## Method Summary
The authors combine aggressive Fibonacci Codeword Quantization (FCQ) with a fine-grained Incremental Network Quantization (INQ) strategy to progressively quantize network tensors and recover accuracy through retraining. Additionally, they introduce two lossless compression algorithms: word-length compression based on Zeckendorf's theorem for Fibonacci number representation, and word-count compression to exploit redundancy in FCQ-encoded weights. These are applied sequentially to maximize memory savings. The approach targets efficient deployment of neural receivers on resource-constrained hardware in 6G wireless systems.

## Key Results
- 45% reduction in power consumption for neural radio receivers
- 44% reduction in multiplier area and 63.4% reduction in memory footprint
- Maintained or superior performance compared to conventional receivers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The proposed method works by leveraging the mathematical properties of Fibonacci numbers and the sparsity induced by FCQ to achieve aggressive quantization without significant accuracy loss. The INQ strategy allows for fine-grained, progressive quantization with retraining to recover performance. The sequential application of Zeckendorf-based and redundancy-based compression further exploits the unique structure of FCQ-encoded weights, enabling lossless memory reduction that is not possible with standard quantization schemes.

## Foundational Learning

**Fibonacci Codeword Quantization (FCQ)** - A quantization method using Fibonacci number representations for weights. *Why needed:* Enables aggressive quantization with unique sparsity patterns exploitable for compression. *Quick check:* Verify that quantized weights can be represented as sums of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers.

**Incremental Network Quantization (INQ)** - Progressive quantization with retraining steps to recover accuracy. *Why needed:* Allows very low bit precision without catastrophic accuracy loss. *Quick check:* Confirm accuracy recovery after each quantization step through retraining.

**Zeckendorf's Theorem** - Every positive integer can be uniquely represented as a sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers. *Why needed:* Provides mathematical foundation for lossless word-length compression. *Quick check:* Validate unique Fibonacci representation for all quantized weights.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Input signal -> Neural receiver -> FCQ + INQ quantization -> Zeckendorf compression -> Redundancy compression -> Hardware-efficient deployment

**Critical path:** Signal processing and inference in the neural receiver are the performance-critical stages; quantization and compression are applied offline during model preparation.

**Design tradeoffs:** Aggressive quantization reduces hardware costs but risks accuracy loss; INQ mitigates this but increases training time. Sequential compression maximizes memory savings but adds complexity to the deployment pipeline.

**Failure signatures:** Accuracy degradation if INQ steps are too aggressive or insufficient retraining is performed; compression inefficiency if redundancy in FCQ-encoded weights is low.

**First experiments:**
1. Apply FCQ to a baseline neural receiver and measure accuracy loss
2. Implement INQ with progressive quantization and retraining, tracking accuracy recovery
3. Apply Zeckendorf compression to FCQ-encoded weights and measure memory reduction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited comparison with state-of-the-art compression/quantization methods beyond "conventional" receivers
- Methodology for sequential application of compression algorithms not fully detailed
- Applicability to other neural receiver architectures or wireless systems not demonstrated

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|---|---|
| Hardware gains (power, area, memory) | High |
| Performance retention vs. conventional receivers | Medium |
| Generalizability to other architectures | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Benchmark against alternative compression/quantization schemes (binary, ternary, mixed-precision) on same receiver architectures
2. Validate Zeckendorf and redundancy-based compression independently and in combination across different neural network topologies
3. Test robustness of incremental quantization under varying channel conditions and 6G deployment scenarios
