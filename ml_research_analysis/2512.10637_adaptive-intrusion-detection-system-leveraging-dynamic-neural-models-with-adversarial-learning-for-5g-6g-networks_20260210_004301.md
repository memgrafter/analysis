# Adaptive Intrusion Detection System Leveraging Dynamic Neural Models with Adversarial Learning for 5G/6G Networks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.10637
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10637
- **Reference count:** 35
- **Primary result:** 82.33% accuracy on multiclass intrusion detection with robustness to data poisoning

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an adaptive intrusion detection system for 5G/6G networks that combines dynamic neural networks with adversarial learning techniques. The framework addresses key challenges in network security including data scarcity, class imbalance, and evolving cyber threats through a multi-pronged approach. By leveraging Conditional Tabular GANs for synthetic data generation, incremental learning for concept drift adaptation, and dynamic neural architectures for handling unstructured inputs, the system achieves robust performance against both known and novel attack patterns. Experimental results on the NSL-KDD dataset demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, particularly in maintaining accuracy under data poisoning conditions.

## Method Summary
The framework integrates CTGAN-based data augmentation to address class imbalance and poisoning attacks, dynamic neural networks that adapt to varying input structures, and batch-incremental learning for efficient adaptation to new threats. The system processes network traffic data through preprocessing, synthetic data generation via CTGAN, and a dynamic neural classifier that adjusts its architecture based on input characteristics. Training involves adversarial techniques using poisoned datasets (20% label corruption) to build resilience, while incremental updates allow the model to evolve with emerging attack patterns without full retraining. The approach specifically targets 5G/6G network environments where traditional IDS approaches struggle with high-speed data streams and novel attack vectors.

## Key Results
- Achieves 82.33% accuracy for multiclass intrusion detection on NSL-KDD dataset
- Demonstrates 53.7% accuracy on poisoned datasets versus ~40% for baseline models
- Shows 82.7% accuracy for zero-day attack detection scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Synthetic Data Augmentation via CTGAN
The framework uses CTGAN to generate synthetic samples for underrepresented classes and create poisoned datasets for adversarial training. By learning statistical distributions through mode-specific normalization rather than simple row replication, the model generalizes better to noisy labels and minority attack patterns. The core assumption is that CTGAN successfully captures network traffic properties without introducing confusing artifacts. Break condition occurs if generated samples lack diversity and cause overfitting to synthetic distributions.

### Mechanism 2: Dynamic Neural Networks for Unstructured Input
The dynamic architecture incorporates imputation and preprocessing modules that adjust based on input sample distribution, allowing processing of inputs with varying structures or missing values without manual reconfiguration. The assumption is that this "dynamism" doesn't introduce excessive inference latency violating 5G/6G real-time constraints. Break condition occurs if dynamic imputation logic is flawed, causing the model to hallucinate features for missing values and generate high false positive rates.

### Mechanism 3: Incremental Learning for Concept Drift
Batch-incremental learning updates model weights as new data streams arrive, extending knowledge to include novel attack footprints while retaining previously learned patterns. The assumption is that buffer size is sufficient to capture new attack distributions before model updates. Break condition occurs if learning rate is too high during incremental updates, causing catastrophic forgetting where accuracy on older attack types drops sharply as new types are introduced.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Tabular Data**
  - **Why needed here:** The CTGAN-based data augmentation strategy requires understanding generator-discriminator dynamics to diagnose synthetic data quality issues.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain why a standard GAN might struggle with discrete tabular data compared to the CTGAN approach mentioned in the paper?

- **Concept: Data Poisoning (Label Flipping)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper claims robustness against this specific threat, requiring understanding of how adversaries change training labels.
  - **Quick check question:** If 20% of training data had labels flipped, how would a standard Random Forest likely perform compared to the proposed adversarial-trained model?

- **Concept: Incremental vs. Batch Learning**
  - **Why needed here:** The framework's "adaptive" positioning requires distinguishing between retraining from scratch versus updating weights.
  - **Quick check question:** What is the primary risk of updating a neural network incrementally on a stream of data containing only one class of attacks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input (NSL-KDD) -> Preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, dimension reduction) -> CTGAN Augmentation (synthetic data/poisoned data generation) -> Merger (Original + Synthetic) -> Dynamic Neural Network (classifier with dynamic layers and imputation) -> Update Loop (batch-incremental learning)

- **Critical path:** The CTGAN Augmentation phase is the bottleneck. If synthetic data doesn't statistically match "unmodeled dynamics" of 5G/6G traffic, the DNN will converge on false patterns.

- **Design tradeoffs:** Accuracy vs. Robustness (82.33% accuracy shows tradeoff prioritizing robustness over perfect classification), Memory vs. Compute (framework accepts higher memory usage to support buffer required for batch-incremental learning).

- **Failure signatures:** Mode Collapse (generated data lacks diversity causing overfitting), Catastrophic Forgetting (incremental learning causes accuracy drop on older attack types), Dynamic Error (runtime errors if dynamic imputation fails on unexpected inputs).

- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Baseline Validation (train Dynamic NN on clean NSL-KDD without augmentation to establish baseline accuracy), 2) Poisoning Stress Test (introduce 20% label noise into validation set to verify "retraining module" recovery), 3) Incremental Drift Test (feed model data containing only new attack type in batches to monitor concept drift and verify training time reduction).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies solely on NSL-KDD dataset which may not represent 5G/6G network characteristics
- 82.33% accuracy indicates substantial room for improvement in clean data classification
- Dynamic neural network architecture details remain underspecified, limiting exact reproduction

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The general approach combining data augmentation, dynamic neural networks, and incremental learning is well-founded and technically sound
- **Medium Confidence:** Specific implementation details and performance metrics are partially supported by experimental results, though reproducibility is limited by missing architectural specifications
- **Low Confidence:** Claims about 5G/6G network performance and scalability lack validation on real-world 5G/6G traffic data

## Next Checks
1. **Dataset Generalization Test:** Evaluate framework on modern 5G network datasets (CICIDS2017, CSE-CIC-IDS2018) to verify performance claims beyond NSL-KDD
2. **Memory Overhead Quantification:** Measure and report actual memory usage during incremental learning to validate stated tradeoff between memory and computational efficiency
3. **Adversarial Attack Resilience:** Test against more sophisticated poisoning attacks (feature injection, gradient-based poisoning) beyond simple label flipping to assess true adversarial robustness
