# AgentRouter: A Knowledge-Graph-Guided LLM Router for Collaborative Multi-Agent Question Answering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.05445
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05445
- Reference count: 32
- Multi-agent QA routing framework with knowledge graph guidance outperforms single-agent and ensemble baselines

## Executive Summary
AgentRouter introduces a knowledge-graph-guided routing framework for multi-agent question answering that formulates the problem as graph-supervised collaboration. The approach constructs a heterogeneous knowledge graph encoding queries, entities, and agents, then trains a type-aware graph neural network to learn routing distributions over agents from empirical performance signals. Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements over single-agent and ensemble baselines across four QA benchmarks, with particularly strong gains in multi-hop reasoning tasks. The framework also shows promising generalization capabilities across different task types when combined with task-specific adaptations.

## Method Summary
The framework treats multi-agent QA as a graph-supervised collaboration problem where agents are selected based on learned routing distributions. It constructs a heterogeneous knowledge graph that captures relationships between queries, entities, and available agents, encoding both structural and semantic information. A type-aware graph neural network is trained on empirical performance signals derived from pairwise agent comparisons on training queries. The router learns to predict which agents are most likely to correctly answer specific query types based on their historical performance patterns and the query's semantic characteristics as represented in the knowledge graph.

## Key Results
- AgentRouter consistently outperforms single-agent and ensemble baselines across four QA benchmarks
- Performance gains are especially pronounced in multi-hop reasoning tasks requiring complex inference
- Restricting the router to a top-K subset of agents can further improve efficiency and performance
- The learned router demonstrates generalization across different QA tasks with task-specific adaptations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness stems from capturing complementary agent strengths through knowledge-graph-guided routing. By encoding both query semantics and agent capabilities in a unified graph structure, the router can learn nuanced routing patterns that simple heuristics miss. The type-aware GNN architecture allows the model to capture complex interactions between query types, entity relationships, and agent specializations. This graph-based approach enables the router to leverage empirical performance signals while maintaining interpretability and generalization capabilities across different QA scenarios.

## Foundational Learning
**Knowledge Graph Construction** - Building heterogeneous graphs encoding queries, entities, and agents; needed to capture rich semantic relationships for routing decisions; quick check: verify entity disambiguation and relationship types are correctly extracted
**Graph Neural Networks** - Using type-aware GNN architectures for learning on heterogeneous graph structures; needed to propagate information across different node types; quick check: confirm message passing respects node type constraints
**Empirical Performance Signal Collection** - Gathering pairwise comparison data from agent responses; needed to train the router with ground truth about agent capabilities; quick check: ensure comparison methodology handles ties appropriately
**Multi-hop Reasoning Patterns** - Understanding how queries requiring multiple inference steps are routed; needed to optimize for complex QA tasks; quick check: validate that routing captures reasoning chain dependencies

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Query Entity Graph -> Type-Aware GNN -> Routing Distribution -> Agent Selection
**Critical Path:** Input query → Entity extraction → Graph construction → GNN inference → Top-K agent selection → Response aggregation
**Design Tradeoffs:** Graph complexity vs. inference speed, routing accuracy vs. computational overhead, generality vs. task-specific optimization
**Failure Signatures:** Incorrect entity extraction leading to poor graph representation, GNN overfitting to training distribution, routing bias toward certain agent types
**First Experiments:** 1) Ablation study removing knowledge graph components, 2) Sensitivity analysis of K value in top-K selection, 3) Cross-task generalization validation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies heavily on synthetic query generation which may not represent real-world query distributions
- Computational overhead from graph construction and GNN inference is not thoroughly characterized
- Limited diversity in task types used for generalization claims restricts confidence in cross-domain capabilities

## Confidence
**High Confidence:** Core claim that knowledge-graph-guided routing outperforms baselines is well-supported by experimental results
**Medium Confidence:** Claims about top-K optimization and generalization across tasks are supported but with task-dependent variability
**Low Confidence:** Claims about capturing "complementary agent strengths" are inferred from performance rather than directly validated

## Next Checks
1. Conduct experiments using naturally occurring queries rather than synthetic generation to validate real-world performance
2. Evaluate the router on a broader set of QA domains including substantially different knowledge structures
3. Perform detailed profiling of end-to-end latency and resource consumption to quantify practical efficiency trade-offs
