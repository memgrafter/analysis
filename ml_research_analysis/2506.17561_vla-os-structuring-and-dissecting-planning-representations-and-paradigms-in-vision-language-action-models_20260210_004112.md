- Introduces unified model family to compare VLA planning paradigms

## Executive Summary
VLA-OS introduces a unified model family to systematically compare different task planning paradigms in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. The framework supports three paradigms—ActionOnly-VLA, Integrated-VLA, and Hierarchical-VLA—with interchangeable planning heads for language, visual, and image foresight representations. Controlled experiments across diverse benchmarks show that visually grounded planning representations outperform language-based ones in task performance, generalization, and training efficiency. Hierarchical-VLA achieves superior or comparable results to other paradigms, particularly in generalization and planning quality, though at higher training and inference costs. Policy learning is consistently more challenging than task planning. The findings guide future VLA research toward better representation choices and architectural designs.

## Method Summary
The VLA-OS framework implements three planning paradigms with shared encoder backbones but different planning heads: ActionOnly-VLA uses a Transformer-based policy network; Integrated-VLA employs a VLM for language planning and a separate policy network; Hierarchical-VLA adds an image foresight head for hierarchical task decomposition. Each paradigm supports three planning representation modes—language, visual, and image foresight—with identical token counts for fair comparison. The framework is tested on multiple benchmarks including ALFRED, CALVIN, RLBench, and robotic control tasks using both VLM-based (MobileVLM2, InternVL2) and CNN-based encoders (V-Net, Q-Former). Comprehensive ablations examine training efficiency, generalization, planning quality, and parameter efficiency across paradigms and representations.

## Key Results
- Visually grounded planning representations outperform language-based ones across task performance, generalization, and training efficiency metrics
- Hierarchical-VLA achieves superior or comparable results to other paradigms, particularly in generalization and planning quality
- Policy learning is consistently more challenging than task planning across all paradigms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of visually grounded representations stems from their ability to capture spatial and temporal relationships directly from visual input, avoiding the potential ambiguity and abstraction limitations of language-based planning. The hierarchical approach enables decomposition of complex tasks into manageable subgoals with image foresight providing concrete visual targets. The unified framework's controlled experimental design isolates representation effects from architectural differences, revealing that visual grounding is the key differentiator rather than model capacity or training procedure.

## Foundational Learning

**Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models**
Why needed: Core framework for integrating visual perception, language understanding, and action execution in embodied AI
Quick check: Verify model can process image-text-action triplets and generate valid actions

**Planning Paradigms (ActionOnly, Integrated, Hierarchical)**
Why needed: Different approaches to structuring decision-making in VLA systems
Quick check: Confirm each paradigm produces coherent action sequences for simple tasks

**Representation Modalities (Language, Visual, Image Foresight)**
Why needed: Different ways to encode planning information affect task performance
Quick check: Test each representation type on a held-out validation set

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Encoder Backbone -> Planning Head (ActionOnly/Integrated/Hierarchical) -> Policy Network -> Action Output

**Critical Path**
Image/Instruction Input → Shared Encoder → Planning Representation → Policy Network → Action Selection

**Design Tradeoffs**
The framework prioritizes controlled comparison over efficiency, using identical token counts across representations rather than optimizing for each modality's natural scale. This ensures fair comparison but may not reflect optimal deployment configurations.

**Failure Signatures**
- Language representations may struggle with spatial reasoning tasks
- Visual representations may have higher computational overhead
- Hierarchical approaches may overfit to training task structures

**3 First Experiments**
1. Compare single-step action prediction accuracy across paradigms and representations
2. Measure training convergence speed for each paradigm-representation combination
3. Evaluate zero-shot generalization to held-out tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily focuses on specific benchmarks, limiting generalizability to diverse real-world scenarios
- Does not extensively explore impact of different action spaces or long-horizon planning tasks
- Computational overhead of Hierarchical-VLA may restrict practical deployment in resource-constrained settings

## Confidence

**High confidence:** Visually grounded planning representations consistently outperform language-based ones across multiple metrics

**Medium confidence:** Hierarchical-VLA achieves superior or comparable results, though computational costs are acknowledged

**Medium confidence:** Policy learning is consistently more challenging than task planning

## Next Checks

1. Cross-dataset generalization test: Evaluate all three paradigms on a held-out dataset with substantially different task distributions

2. Long-horizon planning benchmark: Test paradigms on tasks requiring extended planning sequences (beyond 10-15 steps)

3. Real-world deployment analysis: Implement scaled-down version of best-performing paradigm in physical robotic system to measure practical impact of computational overhead
