# MEDMKG: Benchmarking Medical Knowledge Exploitation with Multimodal Knowledge Graph

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.17214
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17214
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: MEDMKG integrates clinical terminology with visual medical data using MIMIC-CXR and UMLS, showing consistent performance improvements across link prediction, text-image retrieval, and visual question answering tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents MEDMKG, a Medical Multimodal Knowledge Graph designed to integrate clinical terminology with visual medical data. It addresses the challenge of leveraging multimodal medical knowledge for downstream applications. The authors develop a multi-stage construction pipeline that combines MIMIC-CXR and UMLS using both rule-based tools and large language models. To ensure quality, they introduce Neighbor-aware Filtering (NaF) to remove redundant images. MEDMKG is evaluated on link prediction and knowledge-augmented tasks (text-image retrieval and visual question answering) across 24 baselines, 4 backbones, and 6 datasets. Results show consistent performance improvements, demonstrating the utility of multimodal knowledge integration in medical AI.

## Method Summary
The MEDMKG construction pipeline uses a two-stage concept extraction process combining MetaMap (rule-based) and ChatGPT-4o (LLM) for accurate clinical concept identification and relation classification. The Neighbor-aware Filtering (NaF) algorithm removes redundant images based on concept informativeness scores. For downstream tasks, the paper evaluates 24 KG embedding baselines across 4 backbone models (CLIP, PubMedCLIP, BioMedCLIP, MedCSPCLIP) on link prediction, text-image retrieval, and VQA tasks using MIMIC-CXR and 5 external datasets. Training uses AdamW optimizer with specific hyperparameters and 8:1:1 train/val/test splits.

## Key Results
- Translation-based models (TransD, TransE) outperform tensor factorization models on link prediction tasks
- Knowledge-augmented methods improve retrieval precision and VQA accuracy by 1-3% relative
- NaF filtering reduces graph size while maintaining retrieval performance and improving computational efficiency
- Performance varies by backbone architecture, with MedCSPCLIP showing strong results on medical tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** A two-stage concept extraction pipeline combining rule-based tools and LLMs mitigates noise in clinical text while ensuring domain coverage.
- **Mechanism:** Rule-based tools (MetaMap) first identify candidate medical concepts with high recall based on ontologies. An LLM (ChatGPT-4o) then performs context-aware disambiguation and relation classification (Positive/Negative/Uncertain), filtering irrelevant mentions.
- **Core assumption:** The LLM can reliably interpret clinical context from radiology reports better than unsupervised string matching, and the rule-based tool provides sufficient initial coverage.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "utilizing both rule-based tools and large language models for accurate concept extraction and relationship modeling"; [section 3.2] "Stage I – Concept Identification... Stage II – Concept Disambiguation... eliminates spurious or out-of-context candidates."
- **Break condition:** If the LLM hallucinates relations or fails to understand specific clinical negations, relation correctness drops significantly.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** The Neighbor-aware Filtering (NaF) algorithm improves graph density and computational efficiency by prioritizing images with unique diagnostic information over redundant ones.
- **Mechanism:** NaF assigns an informativeness score to images based on the inverse frequency of their connected relation-concept pairs. Images connected to rare concepts are retained, while those connected only to generic, high-degree concepts are filtered out.
- **Core assumption:** An image's value is proportional to the rarity of the clinical concepts it visualizes, and redundancy is primarily driven by common findings.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 3.4] "NaF strategy effectively prioritizes images that are both rich in clinical content and contribute unique, informative knowledge"; [section 3.4] Eq (1) defines the score using $\log \frac{M}{|N(r,c)|}$.
- **Break condition:** If the filtering threshold is too aggressive, the graph loses coverage of common but critical clinical concepts, reducing utility for prevalent conditions.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Translation-based embedding models outperform tensor factorization models for this specific multimodal graph structure due to their handling of heterogeneous entity types.
- **Mechanism:** The graph contains mixed-modal heads (both images and text concepts). Translation-based models (e.g., TransD, TransE) map different entity types into a common relational space more effectively than tensor models which struggle with the sparsity and modality gap.
- **Core assumption:** The geometric translation operation ($h + r \approx t$) is sufficient to capture visual-semantic relationships without complex tensor interactions.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 4.1] "Translation-based models... deliver the strongest results... highlighting their ability to effectively capture cross-modal... relationships."
- **Break condition:** If the visual features and textual concepts occupy vastly different dimensional manifolds, simple translation distance may fail to capture semantic similarity, requiring manifold-based models instead.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)**
  - **Why needed here:** UMLS provides the "Concept Unique Identifiers" (CUIs) that serve as the backbone nodes for MEDMKG. Without understanding UMLS semantic types and hierarchies, one cannot filter irrelevant concepts or define intra-modality edges.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain the difference between a "Semantic Type" and a "Concept" in UMLS?

- **Concept: Cross-Modal Alignment**
  - **Why needed here:** The core task is linking visual nodes (X-rays) to textual nodes (Reports/CUIs). Understanding how CLIP-style contrastive learning works is prerequisite to comprehending the downstream retrieval and VQA benchmarks.
  - **Quick check question:** How does a contrastive loss function penalize misaligned image-text pairs compared to unaligned pairs?

- **Concept: Graph Sparsification**
  - **Why needed here:** The NaF algorithm is a form of graph sparsification. Understanding the trade-off between graph density (computational cost) and coverage (recall) is necessary to tune the filtering algorithm.
  - **Quick check question:** If you remove a node with high degree (many connections), how does it affect the graph's diameter versus removing a node with high betweenness centrality?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** MIMIC-CXR (Images + Reports) + UMLS (MetaMap Dictionary) -> MetaMap (Stage 1) -> LLM Disambiguator (Stage 2) -> Triple creation (Image, Relation, Concept) -> NaF Scorer -> Thresholding -> Final MEDMKG -> PyTorch Geometric/HuggingFace interface

- **Critical path:** The **Concept Disambiguation (Stage II)** and **Relation Extraction** step is the critical path. Errors here propagate directly into the graph structure, creating false edges that mislead downstream VQA models.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - **LLM vs. Rule-based:** Using GPT-4o increases accuracy but introduces API costs and latency compared to purely rule-based extraction.
  - **NaF Aggressiveness:** A higher cutoff in NaF reduces graph size (faster training) but risks losing "normal" finding examples crucial for distinguishing pathology.
  - **Embedding Model:** TransD is faster and performed best on link prediction, but complex models like AttH may generalize better to hierarchical reasoning not captured in the current benchmark.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - **Semantic Drift:** The LLM assigns concepts that are linguistically plausible but clinically impossible given the image view.
  - **Hubness Problem:** Popular concepts appear as top predictions for every query image due to high degree; NaF helps this but requires careful tuning.
  - **Modality Gap:** Vision encoders and text encoders produce embeddings that are far apart in cosine distance, causing baseline models to fail completely.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Reproduce Link Prediction Baselines:** Implement TransD and TransE on the provided MEDMKG subset to verify the data loading pipeline and confirm the Hits@10 metrics reported in Table 2.
  2. **Ablation on NaF:** Construct two versions of the graph—one with NaF and one without filtering. Measure the drop in retrieval precision and the reduction in node count to quantify the efficiency/accuracy trade-off.
  3. **Visual Verification of Edges:** Randomly sample 20 (Image, Concept, Relation) triples and manually verify if the visual region supports the concept and if the relation (Positive/Negative) aligns with the image content.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Can combining translation-based models (e.g., TransD) with tensor factorization models (e.g., TuckER) enhance knowledge graph representation learning on MEDMKG by leveraging their complementary strengths?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors state, "Future work may explore combining translation-based and tensor factorization-based models to leverage their complementary strengths and enhance the overall capability of knowledge graph representation learning" (Page 7).
- **Why unresolved:** Current benchmarks evaluate these model families in isolation, showing translation models excel in entity linking while tensor models show inconsistent performance across relation and entity prediction tasks.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** An empirical evaluation of a hybrid model architecture on MEDMKG that achieves higher Hits@K and lower Mean Rank scores than the current best standalone baselines (TransD, TuckER).

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can tighter coupling between knowledge graphs and vision-language models be achieved by involving medical knowledge graphs in both pretraining and fine-tuning stages?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors suggest, "Future work may explore tighter coupling between knowledge and model training by involving medical knowledge graphs in both pretraining and fine-tuning stages" (Page 8).
- **Why unresolved:** Current methods like KnowledgeCLIP focus mostly on specific integration phases, and the paper notes that effectiveness varies with the integration strategy and backbone architecture.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A unified training framework that integrates MEDMKG during both phases, demonstrating consistent performance improvements in text-image retrieval and VQA over single-stage integration methods.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can adaptive, backbone-agnostic fusion mechanisms be designed to dynamically balance knowledge contribution and mitigate trade-offs between precision and recall in medical VQA?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors conclude, "Future work should explore adaptive, backbone-agnostic fusion mechanisms to further improve stability and generalizability across diverse datasets and model architectures" (Page 9).
- **Why unresolved:** Results show external knowledge improves F1 scores but creates variable impacts on precision and recall, and current integration effectiveness varies significantly by the vision-language backbone used.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Development of a fusion mechanism that improves VQA performance consistently across different backbones (CLIP, BioMedCLIP, etc.) without manual tuning, specifically addressing the stability issues noted in attention-based methods.

## Limitations

- The performance claims rely heavily on the accuracy of the LLM-based relation extraction, which introduces uncertainty about how much downstream performance depends on this single step.
- The Neighbor-aware Filtering (NaF) algorithm assumes that image informativeness correlates with concept rarity, but this may not hold for common but clinically critical findings.
- The clinical utility of the filtered graph is unverified without human expert validation of sample triples.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** Link prediction results showing TransD and TransE outperforming tensor factorization models. This aligns with established knowledge graph embedding literature.
- **Medium Confidence:** Knowledge-augmented retrieval and VQA performance improvements. The trend is consistent but absolute gains are modest and contribution separation is unclear.
- **Low Confidence:** The clinical utility of the filtered graph without human expert validation of filtered vs. unfiltered triples.

## Next Checks

1. **Relation Extraction Validation:** Manually annotate 100 randomly sampled (Image, Concept, Relation) triples from the graph and calculate precision, recall, and F1 for the LLM-based relation classification to quantify noise in the knowledge graph.

2. **NaF Sensitivity Analysis:** Run the downstream retrieval and VQA benchmarks with 5 different NaF cutoff values and plot the precision-efficiency trade-off curve to identify the optimal filtering threshold.

3. **Clinical Expert Review:** Have a board-certified radiologist review 50 high-confidence retrieval results and 50 high-confidence VQA results to assess whether the KG-enhanced predictions provide clinically meaningful improvements over the backbone model alone.
