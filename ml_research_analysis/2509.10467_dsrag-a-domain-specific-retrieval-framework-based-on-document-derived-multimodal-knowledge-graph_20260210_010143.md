# DSRAG: A Domain-Specific Retrieval Framework Based on Document-derived Multimodal Knowledge Graph

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.10467
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10467
- Reference count: 19
- Key outcome: DSRAG framework improves RAG performance for domain-specific documents by 15-20% in faithfulness, answer relevancy, and contextual precision

## Executive Summary
DSRAG addresses knowledge hallucination and poor domain-specific adaptability in large language models by introducing a multimodal knowledge graph-driven retrieval-augmented generation framework. The method constructs a hierarchical multimodal knowledge graph from domain-specific documents, integrating both conceptual and instance layers that include text, images, and tables. By combining semantic pruning with structured subgraph retrieval and vector-based search, DSRAG significantly outperforms baseline RAG methods on database technical documents.

## Method Summary
DSRAG constructs a hierarchical multimodal knowledge graph that integrates conceptual and instance layers from domain-specific documents. The framework combines semantic pruning techniques with structured subgraph retrieval and vector-based search to improve accuracy and relevance. The approach specifically targets knowledge hallucination issues in large language models by grounding responses in structured domain knowledge extracted from technical documents.

## Key Results
- Achieved 83% faithfulness in generated responses
- Demonstrated 87% answer relevancy to user queries
- Reached 85% contextual precision in retrieved information

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
DSRAG works by grounding large language models in structured domain knowledge through hierarchical multimodal knowledge graphs. The framework addresses the fundamental problem of knowledge hallucination by ensuring responses are anchored to verifiable information from domain-specific documents. The combination of semantic pruning with structured subgraph retrieval enables more precise information extraction compared to traditional vector-based approaches alone.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multimodal knowledge graph construction**: Required for representing complex relationships across text, images, and tables in technical documents. Quick check: Verify graph captures both conceptual hierarchies and instance-level details.
- **Semantic pruning techniques**: Needed to eliminate irrelevant information and focus retrieval on pertinent knowledge. Quick check: Measure reduction in noise while maintaining coverage of relevant concepts.
- **Hierarchical knowledge representation**: Essential for organizing information at multiple abstraction levels. Quick check: Validate that both high-level concepts and specific instances are properly captured.
- **Hybrid retrieval methods**: Combines structured subgraph retrieval with vector search for improved accuracy. Quick check: Compare performance against pure vector-based or pure graph-based approaches.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Document Processing -> Multimodal KG Construction -> Semantic Pruning -> Hybrid Retrieval -> RAG Generation
**Critical Path**: Document Ingestion → Knowledge Graph Construction → Semantic Pruning → Query Processing → Hybrid Retrieval → Response Generation
**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational overhead for improved accuracy by combining multiple retrieval methods rather than relying on a single approach.
**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation may occur when domain documents lack sufficient multimodal content or when the knowledge graph construction fails to capture complex relationships.
**First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate performance on single-modality documents to establish baseline effectiveness
2. Test semantic pruning impact by comparing precision with and without pruning
3. Measure retrieval accuracy using only vector search versus hybrid approach

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to database technical documents, constraining generalizability to other domains
- Small evaluation dataset of 100 expert-designed questions may not represent real-world query complexity
- Computational overhead from hybrid retrieval approach may impact practical deployment scalability

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Core methodology of hierarchical multimodal knowledge graph construction is well-established and evaluation shows clear improvements over baseline RAG methods
- **Medium confidence**: Generalizability to other technical domains beyond database documentation
- **Low confidence**: Scalability claims for larger document collections and computational efficiency under production workloads

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-domain evaluation by applying DSRAG to technical documents from different domains (medical, legal, engineering) to assess generalizability
2. Perform scalability testing with larger document collections (10x current size) to evaluate computational overhead and performance
3. Implement an ablation study to quantify individual contributions of semantic pruning, structured subgraph retrieval, and vector-based search components
