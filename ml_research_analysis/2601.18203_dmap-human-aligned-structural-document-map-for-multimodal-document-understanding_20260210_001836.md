core_contribution: This paper addresses the limitation of existing multimodal document
  question-answering systems that rely on flat semantic retrieval, which ignores the

## Executive Summary
DMAP (Document MAP) addresses the limitation of existing multimodal document question-answering systems that rely on flat semantic retrieval, which ignores the inherent hierarchical and relational structure of documents. The proposed framework explicitly encodes both hierarchical organization and inter-element relationships among textual, tabular, and visual components through a Structured-Semantic Understanding Agent (SSUA). A Reflective Reasoning Agent (RRA) then leverages DMAP to perform structure-aware retrieval and iterative, evidence-driven reasoning to generate answers. Extensive experiments on MMDocQA benchmarks show substantial improvements in retrieval precision, reasoning consistency, and multimodal comprehension compared to conventional RAG-based approaches.

## Method Summary
DMAP constructs a human-aligned structural representation of documents through an offline SSUA pipeline that parses raw PDFs into a hierarchical schema preserving semantic and layout dependencies. The online RRA then performs tri-path retrieval (structural, textual, visual) over the DMAP and uses iterative reflection to assess answer sufficiency and augment context. The system is evaluated on multimodal document QA benchmarks, demonstrating significant accuracy improvements over baseline approaches while providing interpretability through its explicit structural representation.

## Key Results
- DMAP achieves average accuracy improvements of up to 12.4% over MDocAgent baselines on MMDocQA benchmarks
- Tri-path retrieval combining structural, textual, and visual features outperforms any single modality
- Iterative reflection mechanism significantly improves handling of complex, multi-hop questions
- Ablation studies confirm the necessity and synergy of each component in the DMAP framework

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Hierarchical Structure Preservation via DMAP Construction
Explicitly modeling a document's inherent hierarchy (sections, pages, elements) preserves logical and spatial dependencies that are disrupted by flat chunking, leading to better retrieval and reasoning. The SSUA parses a raw document into a human-aligned hierarchical schema (DMAP) organizing content into sections -> pages -> elements (figures, tables, text), maintaining containment and adjacency relationships.

### Mechanism 2: Multi-Modal, Tri-Path Retrieval from a Unified Map
Combining structural navigation with separate textual and visual similarity searches retrieves more complete and relevant evidence than any single modality alone. The RRA uses tri-path retrieval over the DMAP: structured semantic traversal to find relevant sections/pages, textual feature retrieval using vector similarity on text embeddings, and visual feature retrieval using vector similarity on visual embeddings.

### Mechanism 3: Iterative Reflection for Evidence Sufficiency
An iterative "reflective" loop that assesses answer completeness and queries for more evidence reduces hallucination and improves reasoning on complex questions. After initial answer generation, an evaluator agent assesses if the answer is complete, and if not, the system retrieves neighboring or parent elements to augment context and re-generate the answer.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  - Why needed here: DMAP is presented as an improvement over standard RAG for multimodal documents
  - Quick check question: In a standard RAG pipeline, how is a long document typically prepared for the vector database, and what is the primary trade-off of this method?

- **Concept: Multimodal Embeddings (e.g., ColPali)**
  - Why needed here: The RRA agent uses specific models like ColPali for visual retrieval
  - Quick check question: What is the core function of an embedding model like ColPali in the context of document retrieval?

- **Concept: Agent-based LLM Systems**
  - Why needed here: The entire framework is built around specialized agents for understanding, reasoning, and evaluation
  - Quick check question: In the DMAP framework, what is the primary role of the "Summarize Agent"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Offline SSUA pipeline (PDF parsing -> DMAP construction -> embedding generation) -> Online RRA pipeline (tri-path retrieval -> answer generation -> reflection loop)

- **Critical path:** Document parsing quality hinges on the first step; DMAP construction logic mapping raw elements into Section/Page/Element hierarchy is the core novelty; retrieval fusion combining results from R(s), R(t), and R(v) is critical for tuning; reflection loop evaluator agent's prompt is critical for preventing infinite loops

- **Design tradeoffs:** Cost vs. performance (tri-path retrieval and iterative reflection increase LLM API costs and latency); complexity vs. robustness (more robust to complex queries but has more potential failure points); generalizability (DMAP construction relies on common document structures, may be less effective on unconventional layouts)

- **Failure signatures:** Empty DMAP (parsing tools fail on specific PDF format); high latency (reflection loop running too many times); hallucination on unanswerable questions (evaluator fails to recognize insufficient evidence)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Unit Test DMAP Construction: Feed a well-structured academic paper and a messy report into SSUA pipeline, manually inspect generated DMAP to verify parsing and hierarchy logic
  2. Isolate Retrieval Paths: Run RRA on benchmark subset with only one retrieval path active at a time, measure contribution of each path
  3. Stress Test the Reflection Loop: Design multi-hop questions requiring iterative retrieval, log iteration counts and intermediate answers to validate and tune evaluator's prompt

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How can DMAP be adapted for dynamic, self-evolving document cognition where knowledge is incrementally updated? The current framework describes static construction without mechanisms for real-time modification or versioning as documents change.

- Why does Visual Feature Retrieval contribute significantly less to overall accuracy than Textual or Structured Semantic Retrieval? Table 3 and Section 4.3.1 show only -1.8% accuracy drop from removing visual features versus -15.0% for textual features.

- What is the computational overhead and latency cost of the SSUA construction phase compared to standard flat RAG indexing? The methodology relies on GPT-4o for SSUA to parse and structure documents, yet provides no analysis on time, token consumption, or financial cost.

## Limitations

- DMAP construction relies heavily on specific parsing tools (pymupdf, pdffigure2) and LLM-based section detection, which may struggle with unconventional or poorly formatted documents
- The reflection mechanism's effectiveness depends heavily on the quality of the evaluator agent's judgment, which could vary across document types and question complexities
- Computational overhead of tri-path retrieval and iterative reflection may limit practical deployment in latency-sensitive applications

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The core mechanism of hierarchical structure preservation and empirical improvements over baselines (12.4% accuracy gain) are well-supported by experimental results and ablation studies
- **Medium Confidence:** Multi-modal tri-path retrieval and iterative reflection show strong theoretical grounding and ablation support, but relative contributions and optimal configurations remain partially unclear
- **Low Confidence:** Generalizability of DMAP across document types beyond academic papers and structured reports is uncertain, as the paper does not extensively test edge cases or highly irregular document layouts

## Next Checks

1. **Stress Test DMAP Construction:** Apply SSUA pipeline to diverse corpus including technical reports, financial statements, and informal documents to evaluate parsing robustness and hierarchy accuracy across document types

2. **Isolate Retrieval Path Contributions:** Systematically disable each retrieval path (structural, textual, visual) on benchmark subset to quantify individual and synergistic contributions, particularly focusing on edge cases where one modality might dominate

3. **Evaluate Reflection Loop Efficiency:** Measure reflection mechanism's performance on multi-hop questions requiring iterative retrieval, tracking iteration counts, context augmentation patterns, and evaluator decision quality to optimize the "done" criteria
