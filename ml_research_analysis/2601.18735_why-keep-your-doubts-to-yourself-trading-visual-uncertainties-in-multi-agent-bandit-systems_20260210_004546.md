# Why Keep Your Doubts to Yourself? Trading Visual Uncertainties in Multi-Agent Bandit Systems
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.18735
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18735
- Reference count: 40
- Agora achieves +8.5% accuracy over best baseline on MMMU while reducing cost by over 3x

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Agora, a market-based coordination framework for multi-agent Visual Language Model (VLM) systems. The key innovation lies in reframing epistemic uncertainty as a tradable commodity, where agents exchange structured uncertainty information to achieve optimal task delegation. A market-aware broker extends Thompson Sampling to initiate collaborations and guide cost-efficient equilibria. The system is evaluated across five multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating significant performance improvements over both individual VLMs and heuristic multi-agent strategies.

## Method Summary
Agora implements a decentralized market architecture where VLMs trade epistemic uncertainty signals (perceptual, semantic, and inferential) based on cost-effectiveness. The core mechanism employs a market-aware broker that uses Thompson Sampling to select optimal collaboration partners and determine trading strategies. Agents submit uncertainty signals in a structured format, enabling the broker to compute value propositions and facilitate efficient knowledge exchange. The framework operates as a closed-loop system where uncertainty trading directly influences task delegation decisions and coordination patterns.

## Key Results
- Achieves +8.5% accuracy improvement over best baseline on MMMU benchmark
- Reduces computational cost by over 3x compared to baseline approaches
- Outperforms strong VLMs and heuristic multi-agent strategies across five multimodal benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The market-based approach works by creating economic incentives for agents to honestly report their uncertainty levels and trade information strategically. By treating epistemic uncertainty as a quantifiable commodity with market value, agents are motivated to collaborate when the expected benefit exceeds the communication cost. The Thompson Sampling-based broker introduces exploration-exploitation balance, allowing the system to discover optimal trading partners while maintaining efficiency. This creates a self-organizing ecosystem where agents naturally specialize and collaborate based on their relative strengths and uncertainty profiles.

## Foundational Learning
- **Epistemic Uncertainty Trading**: Agents quantify and exchange uncertainty information as tradable assets - needed to create market incentives; check by verifying uncertainty signal consistency across agents
- **Thompson Sampling for Broker Coordination**: Market-aware broker uses bandit algorithms for partner selection - needed for balancing exploration and exploitation; check by analyzing broker decision patterns
- **Decentralized Market Equilibrium**: System reaches stable coordination without central control - needed for scalability; check by measuring convergence stability across different agent populations
- **Cost-Utility Optimization**: Trading decisions based on cost-benefit analysis - needed for economic viability; check by examining cost reduction metrics vs. performance gains
- **Structured Uncertainty Representation**: Standardized uncertainty signal formats - needed for meaningful market operations; check by validating signal parsing and interpretation

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Agent VLM -> Uncertainty Module -> Market Interface -> Broker (Thompson Sampling) -> Coordination Layer -> Task Delegation

**Critical Path**: Task arrival → Agent uncertainty assessment → Market signal submission → Broker evaluation → Trading decision → Knowledge exchange → Task completion

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Decentralization vs. coordination overhead
- Market complexity vs. communication efficiency
- Exploration vs. exploitation balance
- Uncertainty granularity vs. signaling cost
- Agent specialization vs. generalization capability

**Failure Signatures**:
- Market freeze when uncertainty signals are inconsistent
- Broker paralysis due to exploration-exploitation mismatch
- Communication overhead exceeding performance gains
- Agent specialization leading to capability gaps
- Coordination breakdown under high task complexity

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Single-agent vs. market-based coordination performance comparison
2. Uncertainty signal accuracy validation across different VLM types
3. Market equilibrium convergence under varying agent populations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scalability analysis limited to tested benchmarks
- Market equilibrium assumptions may not hold in highly variable conditions
- Performance on streaming data and time-sensitive applications remains uncertain

## Confidence
- Experimental results and benchmark performance: High
- Theoretical framework and general applicability: Medium
- Real-world deployment scenarios: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test Agora's performance on streaming data and time-sensitive applications to validate real-time coordination capabilities
2. Evaluate robustness under adversarial conditions where agents may provide misleading uncertainty signals
3. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of individual market components to overall performance gains
