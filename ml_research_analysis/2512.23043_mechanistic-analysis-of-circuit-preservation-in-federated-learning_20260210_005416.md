- This paper investigates the mechanistic causes of federated learning (FL) failure under non-IID data by analyzing neural circuit preservation during federated averaging.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the mechanistic causes of federated learning (FL) failure under non-IID data by analyzing neural circuit preservation during federated averaging. The authors introduce sparsity as an interpretability tool to isolate functional circuits—minimal sub-networks for specific class predictions—and track their structural changes across clients and aggregation rounds. Using Intersection-over-Union (IoU) to quantify circuit preservation, they show that under IID conditions, FedAvg successfully preserves a single canonical circuit structure across all clients. Under non-IID conditions, clients develop structurally disjoint circuits that suffer from either structural drift or destructive interference during aggregation, leading to functional collapse. An ablation study demonstrates that higher weight sparsity acts as a regularizer, mitigating destructive interference and improving global model stability.

## Method Summary
The authors use sparsity-based circuit extraction to identify minimal sub-networks responsible for specific class predictions in federated learning scenarios. They track circuit preservation across clients and aggregation rounds using Intersection-over-Union (IoU) metrics. The study compares circuit behavior under IID versus non-IID data distributions, analyzing structural changes during federated averaging. An ablation study examines the impact of weight sparsity as a regularization mechanism to improve global model stability.

## Key Results
- FedAvg preserves single circuit under IID conditions
- Non-IID leads to structural circuit divergence
- Sparsity regularization mitigates destructive interference

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper reframes FL's statistical weight divergence as a concrete structural failure of circuit preservation. Under IID conditions, clients develop similar circuits for the same tasks, allowing successful aggregation. Under non-IID conditions, clients develop structurally disjoint circuits for different local data distributions. When these circuits are averaged, they either drift apart structurally or destructively interfere, causing functional collapse. Sparsity regularization helps preserve circuit structure by reducing the impact of conflicting updates during aggregation.

## Foundational Learning
- Federated Averaging (FedAvg): Why needed - Core FL optimization algorithm; Quick check - Verify client updates are properly averaged
- Non-IID data distributions: Why needed - Real-world FL scenario; Quick check - Confirm data heterogeneity across clients
- Neural circuit extraction: Why needed - Method to identify functional sub-networks; Quick check - Validate circuit identification accuracy
- Intersection-over-Union (IoU): Why needed - Metric for circuit similarity; Quick check - Test IoU computation on known circuits
- Weight sparsity: Why needed - Regularization mechanism; Quick check - Verify sparsity implementation affects circuit preservation

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Local clients -> Circuit extraction -> Aggregation -> Global model -> Circuit preservation analysis
- Critical path: Circuit identification → Structural tracking → Aggregation analysis → Regularization testing
- Design tradeoffs: Circuit preservation vs. model capacity, interpretability vs. complexity
- Failure signatures: Structural drift, destructive interference, functional collapse
- First experiments:
  1. Test circuit preservation under varying degrees of data heterogeneity
  2. Compare sparsity thresholds for optimal circuit preservation
  3. Evaluate circuit stability across multiple aggregation rounds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Analysis relies heavily on sparsity-based circuit extraction which may miss functionally important but less prominent sub-networks
- IoU metric assumes binary circuit membership and may not capture graded functional relationships
- Study focuses on single image classification task with relatively small networks
- Proposed regularizer lacks rigorous comparison to established FL optimization techniques

## Confidence
- High: FedAvg preserves single circuit under IID conditions
- Medium: Non-IID leads to structural circuit divergence
- Medium: Sparsity regularization mitigates destructive interference

## Next Checks
1. Test circuit preservation metrics across multiple architectures (CNNs, transformers) and scales to verify robustness
2. Compare sparsity-based regularization against established FL techniques (local fine-tuning, client clustering) in controlled non-IID settings
3. Implement ablation studies varying sparsity thresholds to identify optimal trade-offs between circuit preservation and model capacity
