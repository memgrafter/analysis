# Q-RUN: Quantum-Inspired Data Re-uploading Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.20654
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20654
- Reference count: 40
- Q-RUN outperforms traditional MLPs and state-of-the-art Fourier-based networks by one to three orders of magnitude in error reduction while using fewer parameters

## Executive Summary
Q-RUN introduces a quantum-inspired neural network architecture that applies data re-uploading circuits to classical models. The key innovation is using quantum circuit principles to encode inputs multiple times with learnable parameters, creating an architecture that efficiently represents Fourier series. This approach addresses the challenge of fitting high-frequency functions in classical neural networks while maintaining computational efficiency. Q-RUN demonstrates significant performance improvements across diverse tasks including implicit representations, density estimation, molecular energy modeling, time series forecasting, language modeling, and image classification.

## Method Summary
Q-RUN applies quantum-inspired data re-uploading circuits to classical neural networks by encoding inputs multiple times through shared parameters. The architecture consists of two main modules: a data re-uploading module that repeatedly encodes inputs using learnable parameters, and an element-wise observable module that approximates quantum measurements with a lightweight MLP. This design enables efficient representation of Fourier series while maintaining computational tractability. The approach leverages the principle that quantum circuits can naturally encode periodic functions through rotation gates, translating this concept into classical neural network operations that can capture high-frequency patterns more effectively than traditional architectures.

## Key Results
- Achieves improvements of one to three orders of magnitude in error reduction compared to traditional MLPs
- Uses fewer parameters than conventional approaches while maintaining superior performance
- Demonstrates strong performance in parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models
- Outperforms state-of-the-art Fourier-based networks across multiple benchmark tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The quantum-inspired data re-uploading approach works by leveraging the natural ability of quantum circuits to represent periodic functions through repeated parameter rotations. By encoding inputs multiple times with shared parameters, Q-RUN creates a rich feature space that can capture high-frequency components more efficiently than traditional neural networks. The element-wise observable module acts as a measurement operation, extracting relevant features from the encoded representations. This design allows the network to learn complex Fourier-like representations without requiring the full computational overhead of explicit Fourier transforms, making it particularly effective for tasks involving periodic or high-frequency patterns.
