## Executive Summary
This thesis addresses the critical gap between Multimodal Foundation Models (MFMs) and World Models by enhancing MFMs with structured reasoning capabilities. The work focuses on improving generalization through causal inference, counterfactual thinking, and spatiotemporal reasoning while developing controllable generative frameworks for image and video synthesis. Through novel benchmarks like MMWorld and VLM4D, the research establishes evaluation frameworks for assessing spatiotemporal awareness in foundation models, ultimately aiming to create more robust models capable of understanding and reasoning about the physical world.

## Method Summary
The thesis introduces Counterfactual Prompt Learning (CPL) to enhance CLIP's reasoning capabilities by optimizing learnable prompts through a joint loss combining cross-entropy and contrastive objectives. The method employs negative sampling via BERTScore to construct counterfactual examples, mixing positive and negative image features to force the model to disentangle fine-grained visual attributes. For generative models, parameter-efficient adaptation techniques (FlexEControl, Mojito) are developed to enable precise control over text-to-image and text-to-video generation through shared decomposed weights and motion intensity control mechanisms.

## Key Results
- CPL improves CLIP's few-shot classification accuracy by 2-5% across multiple datasets by learning non-spurious prompt representations
- FlexEControl enables efficient multimodal control in text-to-image generation using shared decomposed weights, reducing computational overhead
- Mojito achieves controllable text-to-video generation with precise motion intensity and directional control mechanisms
- MMWorld and VLM4D benchmarks successfully evaluate multi-discipline and spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities in vision-language models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Structured Reasoning Enhancement via Causal and Graph-Based Integration
- Claim: Injecting structured reasoning (causal inference, counterfactual thinking, spatiotemporal reasoning) into MFMs improves generalization beyond surface-level pattern matching.
- Mechanism: Leverage explicit structural representations (e.g., scene graphs, causal models, temporal graphs) to guide attention and reasoning, enabling models to infer relationships and predict outcomes.
- Core assumption: MFMs trained on unstructured data lack inherent compositional and causal understanding; explicit structure bridges this gap.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] Thesis aims to "equip MFMs with structured reasoning skills, such as causal inference, counterfactual thinking, and spatiotemporal reasoning."
  - [section] Chapter 3 introduces Counterfactual Prompt Learning (CPL) to improve generalization by generating counterfactual examples and using contrastive learning.
  - [section] Chapter 6 proposes Multimodal Graph Transformer, integrating vision/text graphs into attention mechanisms.
  - [corpus] MoveFM-R (2509.22403) explores language-driven semantic reasoning for mobility foundation models, aligning with the need for structured reasoning in spatiotemporal domains. Corpus average neighbor FMR=0.348 indicates moderate but not dominant relevance; related work often focuses on adaptation or specific domains rather than foundational reasoning structures.
- Break condition: If model performance degrades on out-of-distribution compositional tasks or fails to answer counterfactual questions despite structural guidance, the mechanism may be insufficient.

### Mechanism 2: Controlled Generative Modeling via Multimodal Condition Alignment
- Claim: Precise control over image/video generation (content, motion, 4D dynamics) can be achieved by aligning generative models with multimodal conditions (text, sketches, trajectories) using efficient adaptation.
- Mechanism: Use parameter-efficient adaptation (e.g., Kronecker decomposition, low-rank adapters) to inject controllable pathways into pretrained generative models, ensuring alignment with user intent across modalities.
- Core assumption: Pretrained diffusion models contain rich world knowledge but lack fine-grained control mechanisms; adaptation can unlock controllability without full retraining.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] Thesis introduces "new frameworks for structured and controllable generation... incorporating scene graphs, multimodal conditioning, and multimodal alignment strategies."
  - [section] Chapter 9 presents FlexEControl for efficient multimodal control in text-to-image generation using shared decomposed weights.
  - [section] Chapter 10 introduces Mojito for controllable text-to-video generation with motion intensity and directional control.
  - [corpus] OmniCaptioner (2504.07089) provides a unified captioning framework across visual domains, indirectly supporting multimodal alignment but not directly addressing controllable generation. Corpus shows no direct highly-cited neighbors on controlled generation, indicating a gap in existing work.
- Break condition: If generated outputs consistently violate user-specified conditions (e.g., wrong motion direction, missing objects) or require excessive computational resources, the alignment mechanism may be flawed.

### Mechanism 3: Spatiotemporal Benchmarking for World Model Evaluation
- Claim: Comprehensive evaluation of spatiotemporal awareness requires benchmarks that test both perception (audio/visual) and reasoning (future prediction, counterfactual) across disciplines.
- Mechanism: Design benchmarks with multi-discipline, multi-faceted questions that probe a model's ability to understand dynamics, predict outcomes, and reason causally in video contexts.
- Core assumption: Current MFMs lack robust spatiotemporal reasoning; targeted benchmarks can diagnose failures and drive progress toward world models.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] Thesis introduces MMWorld and VLM4D benchmarks for evaluating "multi-discipline and multi-faceted reasoning" and "spatiotemporal awareness."
  - [section] Chapter 7 details MMWorld, covering seven disciplines and multi-faceted reasoning (explanation, counterfactual, future prediction).
  - [section] Chapter 8 presents VLM4D, focusing on spatiotemporal reasoning with translational/rotational movement, counting, and false positives.
  - [corpus] MEETI (2507.15255) is a multimodal ECG dataset but focuses on clinical signals, not video spatiotemporal reasoning. Corpus neighbor FMR=0.471 indicates moderate relevance, but no direct corpus matches for video world model benchmarks, highlighting novelty.
- Break condition: If models achieve high scores via surface-level heuristics without genuine spatiotemporal understanding, or if benchmarks fail to differentiate between models, the evaluation mechanism needs refinement.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Causal Inference in Multimodal Models**
  - Why needed here: To move beyond correlation-based reasoning and enable models to answer "what-if" questions and identify true causal relationships in multimodal data.
  - Quick check question: Given an image and caption, can the model identify which visual feature causally determines a specific textual attribute (e.g., "barn" causes the caption change in Figure 3.1)?

- **Concept: Graph Representation for Multimodal Integration**
  - Why needed here: To explicitly structure relationships between visual and textual elements, facilitating compositional reasoning and disentangling complex interactions.
  - Quick check question: How would you convert a scene graph (object-relationship-object) into an adjacency matrix for use in a Transformer attention mechanism (as in Figure 6.3)?

- **Concept: Parameter-Efficient Adaptation**
  - Why needed here: To fine-tune large foundation models for new tasks/controls without prohibitive computational costs, enabling practical deployment.
  - Quick check question: In FlexEControl, how does sharing decomposed weights across conditions improve efficiency compared to training separate adapters per condition?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Discriminative module (CPL, ComCLIP, Multimodal Graph Transformer) -> Generative module (FlexEControl, Mojito, Morpho4D) -> Evaluation module (MMWorld, VLM4D, error categorization)

- **Critical path**: 1. Implement causal/graph-based reasoning enhancements on existing MFMs. 2. Integrate controlled generation mechanisms into pretrained diffusion models. 3. Evaluate enhanced models on spatiotemporal benchmarks to diagnose gaps. 4. Iterate between adaptation and evaluation to bridge reasoning and generation.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Reasoning vs. efficiency (graph integration adds computational overhead), Control vs. creativity (tight conditioning may limit generative diversity), Benchmark depth vs. breadth (multi-discipline benchmarks require extensive curation but offer holistic evaluation).

- **Failure signatures**: Reasoning (model relies on spurious correlations, fails counterfactual questions), Generation (outputs ignore specified conditions, exhibit temporal inconsistency), Evaluation (models score high via heuristics, not genuine understanding).

- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Apply CPL to a vision-language model (e.g., CLIP) and measure generalization on unseen image-text pairs using counterfactual prompts. 2. Fine-tune a text-to-video diffusion model with Mojito's motion intensity control and evaluate alignment between specified and generated motion. 3. Evaluate a state-of-the-art MLLM on VLM4D's rotational movement tasks to quantify spatiotemporal reasoning failures.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can 4D generative frameworks, such as Morpho4D (Chapter 11), ensure strict physical consistency (e.g., conservation of mass, realistic rigid-body dynamics) in generated scenes without explicitly integrating a differentiable physics engine?
- **Basis in paper:** [Inferred] The thesis notes that current video generation backbones often "lack dedicated motion modeling mechanisms" (Section 10.1) and struggle with physical AI simulation.
- **Why unresolved:** Data-driven diffusion models prioritize visual plausibility over physical accuracy, leading to "hallucinated" motion, while integrating physics engines restricts generative flexibility.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A generated 4D scene where complex, novel multi-body interactions (e.g., a stack of blocks collapsing) evolve physically correctly solely from a text prompt, validated against a physics simulator.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** To what extent do high scores on multi-discipline benchmarks like MMWorld (Chapter 7) reflect genuine multimodal reasoning versus the retrieval of pre-trained factual knowledge from the underlying foundation models?
- **Basis in paper:** [Explicit] The thesis introduces MMWorld to evaluate "multi-faceted reasoning" (Chapter 7 abstract), but [Inferred] disentangling reasoning from knowledge remains a known evaluation challenge.
- **Why unresolved:** Large foundation models contain vast encoded knowledge; it is difficult to design "unseen" scenarios that require reasoning *without* triggering memorized answers.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Performance consistency on procedurally generated, counterfactual physical scenarios that are distinct from any distribution in the model's pre-training data.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** What architectural primitives are required to unify control signals across heterogeneous modalities (e.g., text, trajectory, audio) so that the model can resolve conflicting constraints without one modality dominating the generation?
- **Basis in paper:** [Explicit] Section 13.4 identifies "Unified Control Across Modalities" as a future direction, and Chapter 9 (FlexEControl) addresses efficient control but focuses mostly on image modalities.
- **Why unresolved:** Current adapters often suffer from modality imbalance, where text prompts override structural conditions, or vice versa, especially in complex video generation.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A video generation model that can simultaneously satisfy a precise trajectory constraint and a conflicting semantic text prompt (e.g., "move left" vs "move towards the sun") by finding a semantically and geometrically plausible compromise.

## Limitations

- Scalability concerns with parameter-efficient adaptation methods when applied to extremely large foundation models (e.g., GPT-4V, Gemini)
- Generalization capability uncertainty across domains with different underlying physical laws
- Computational overhead introduced by graph-based reasoning modules in real-time applications

## Confidence

- **High**: The theoretical foundation for integrating structured reasoning into MFMs is well-established, supported by recent advances in causal inference and graph-based learning.
- **Medium**: The controlled generation mechanisms (FlexEControl, Mojito) demonstrate effectiveness on specific tasks but require broader testing across different model architectures and application domains.
- **Low**: The spatiotemporal benchmarks (MMWorld, VLM4D) show potential for evaluating world model capabilities, but their ability to distinguish genuine understanding from surface-level pattern matching needs rigorous validation.

## Next Checks

1. Test CPL-enhanced models on out-of-distribution compositional tasks that require novel attribute combinations not seen during training
2. Evaluate FlexEControl's controllability across different diffusion model architectures (DDPM, DDIM, LCM) and input modalities
3. Conduct ablation studies on MMWorld benchmarks to identify whether high scores correlate with genuine spatiotemporal understanding or can be achieved through superficial heuristics
