# Smart UX-design for Rescue Operations Wearable - A Knowledge Graph Informed Visualization Approach for Information Retrieval in Emergency Situations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.13539
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13539
- Reference count: 14
- Primary result: Knowledge graph-informed UX-design for wearable device providing AI-driven treatment recommendations during emergency rescue operations

## Executive Summary
The KIRETT project addresses critical challenges in emergency medical response by developing a wearable device that combines knowledge graph technology with AI-driven situation detection to support health professionals during rescue operations. The system leverages artificial neural networks trained on over 300,000 rescue operation records to provide probability-based complication predictions and contextual treatment recommendations. The wearable features large visual interaction components, dynamic text-to-image generation, and real-time patient monitoring to overcome the limitations of traditional LCD displays in high-pressure emergency environments.

The design was evaluated by German Red Cross and hospital professionals, with plans for testing in simulated rescue scenarios to validate its effectiveness in improving first-aid rescue operations. The system employs memory-mapped inter-processor communication to ensure smooth real-time performance and situation detection powered by deep learning models. This innovative approach aims to enhance decision-making accuracy and response times during critical emergency situations where every second counts.

## Method Summary
The KIRETT system was developed through a knowledge graph-informed design process, incorporating large visual interaction components, warning/notification screens, approval screens, navigational overview screens, patient monitors, and dynamic text-to-image generators to overcome LCD limitations. The architecture uses memory-mapped inter-processor communication for smooth real-time performance, while situation detection is powered by an artificial neural network trained on 300,000+ rescue operation records. The system provides probability-based complication predictions and contextual treatment recommendations. Professional evaluation was conducted with German Red Cross and hospital experts, with planned testing in simulated rescue scenarios.

## Key Results
- Developed wearable device with knowledge graph-informed UX-design for emergency medical support
- AI-powered situation detection using neural network trained on 300,000+ rescue operation records
- Professional evaluation completed with German Red Cross and hospital experts
- System provides real-time probability-based complication predictions and treatment recommendations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system leverages knowledge graphs to structure medical knowledge and relationships, enabling rapid information retrieval during high-pressure emergency situations. The artificial neural network processes vast amounts of historical rescue operation data to identify patterns and predict complications with probability-based outputs. Memory-mapped inter-processor communication ensures low-latency data exchange between system components, critical for real-time decision support. The large visual interaction components and dynamic text-to-image generation overcome the cognitive limitations of traditional LCD displays, making critical information more accessible during stressful conditions.

## Foundational Learning

- Artificial Neural Networks: Why needed - Identify patterns in rescue operation data for prediction; Quick check - Validate prediction accuracy against known outcomes
- Memory-mapped Inter-processor Communication: Why needed - Ensure low-latency data exchange for real-time performance; Quick check - Measure communication latency under load
- Dynamic Text-to-Image Generation: Why needed - Overcome LCD limitations in emergency visual displays; Quick check - Test image clarity and loading speed
- Probability-based Complication Prediction: Why needed - Provide quantitative risk assessment for decision support; Quick check - Compare predictions against actual complication rates
- Large Visual Interaction Components: Why needed - Reduce cognitive load during high-pressure situations; Quick check - Conduct user testing for interface comprehension speed

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Patient Sensors -> Neural Network -> Knowledge Graph -> UI Renderer -> Display Output -> User Feedback
Critical path: Real-time data collection → Situation detection → Treatment recommendation → Visual display
Design tradeoffs: Accuracy vs. response time in neural network predictions; Display complexity vs. readability under stress; Battery life vs. computational power
Failure signatures: Delayed response times indicating communication bottlenecks; Incorrect predictions suggesting model drift; Display failures showing hardware limitations
First experiments: 1) Measure end-to-end latency from patient data input to display output; 2) Test prediction accuracy against historical complication data; 3) Evaluate interface comprehension speed under simulated stress conditions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- System has not undergone actual rescue scenario testing or controlled trials
- No comparative studies against existing emergency decision support tools
- Performance under extreme environmental conditions (temperature, moisture, shock) unknown
- Clinical efficacy claims require rigorous validation before deployment

## Confidence
High: System architecture and design elements, specific technical implementations (memory-mapped communication, 300,000+ training records)
Medium: Usability evaluation results, professional review mentioned without quantitative metrics
Low: Clinical efficacy claims, pending actual rescue scenario testing

## Next Checks
1. Conduct controlled simulation trials comparing KIRETT-guided decisions against standard protocols, measuring accuracy, response time, and user error rates
2. Perform field testing in realistic emergency scenarios with varying environmental conditions to assess hardware durability and system reliability
3. Execute a randomized controlled trial with emergency medical teams using KIRETT versus traditional methods, measuring patient outcomes and provider cognitive load
