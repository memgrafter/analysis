# Timbre-Aware LLM-based Direct Speech-to-Speech Translation Extendable to Multiple Language Pairs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.16023
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16023
- Reference count: 40
- DS2ST-LM achieves BLEU scores up to 24.91 and speaker similarity of 0.83 across multiple language pairs

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces DS2ST-LM, a direct speech-to-speech translation system built on a multilingual large language model. The framework uses supervised semantic tokens and a timbre-controlled vocoder to preserve speaker identity while translating across multiple languages. The authors construct GigaS2ST-1000, a new dataset for training, and evaluate the system on both high-resource (French, Spanish, German) and low-resource (Hindi, Bengali, Urdu) language pairs. Results show DS2ST-LM outperforms cascaded and ST+TTS baselines in translation quality and speaker preservation.

## Method Summary
DS2ST-LM leverages a multilingual LLM as its backbone, integrating supervised semantic tokens for improved translation alignment and a timbre-controlled vocoder for speaker identity preservation. The model is trained on the newly created GigaS2ST-1000 dataset, which supports multiple language pairs. The system is evaluated against cascaded and ST+TTS baselines, with linear projection selected as the best method for stability and performance. Experiments span both high-resource and low-resource languages, demonstrating the model's scalability and robustness.

## Key Results
- BLEU scores up to 24.91 across multiple language pairs
- Speaker similarity score of 0.83 for speaker preservation
- DS2ST-LM outperforms cascaded and ST+TTS baselines in translation quality and speaker identity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system's effectiveness stems from its use of supervised semantic tokens, which enhance alignment between source and target speech, and a timbre-controlled vocoder, which preserves speaker identity. The multilingual LLM backbone allows for scalability across language pairs, while the GigaS2ST-1000 dataset provides diverse training data. The linear projection method ensures stability and performance, making the system robust across different languages.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multilingual LLMs**: Why needed: Handle multiple languages in a unified model; Quick check: Test model performance across language pairs
- **Supervised Semantic Tokens**: Why needed: Improve alignment and translation accuracy; Quick check: Compare with unsupervised alternatives
- **Timbre-Controlled Vocoder**: Why needed: Preserve speaker identity in translated speech; Quick check: Evaluate on out-of-domain data

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Source Speech -> LLM Encoder -> Supervised Semantic Tokens -> LLM Decoder -> Timbre-Controlled Vocoder -> Target Speech
- **Critical Path**: Source Speech to Target Speech via LLM with semantic tokens and vocoder
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Linear projection chosen for stability over MLP and adapter variants; supervised tokens add dependency on token-level supervision
- **Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on low-resource languages; vocoder artifacts in diverse acoustic environments
- **First Experiments**: 1) Evaluate on additional low-resource language pairs; 2) Conduct ablation studies on semantic tokens; 3) Test vocoder on out-of-domain data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance not fully validated on low-resource languages due to limited test data
- Timbre-controlled vocoder may introduce artifacts in diverse acoustic environments
- Supervised semantic tokens add dependency on token-level supervision quality

## Confidence
- High confidence in BLEU scores and speaker similarity for high-resource languages
- Medium confidence for low-resource language performance due to limited data
- High confidence in linear projection stability over other methods

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate DS2ST-LM on additional low-resource language pairs with varied acoustic conditions to assess robustness.
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the impact of supervised semantic tokens versus unsupervised alternatives.
3. Test the timbre-controlled vocoder's performance on out-of-domain speech data to identify potential generalization limits.
