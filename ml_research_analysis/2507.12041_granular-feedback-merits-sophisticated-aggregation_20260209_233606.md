# Granular feedback merits sophisticated aggregation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.12041
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12041
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Sophisticated aggregation methods require only half as many individuals as regularized averaging when feedback has 5-point granularity, while barely improving with binary feedback

## Executive Summary
This paper examines whether sophisticated aggregation methods can outperform simple regularized averaging when predicting population distributions from individual feedback. The authors demonstrate that the advantage of sophisticated methods like supervised learning increases with feedback granularity. Using a dataset of social attitude questions with 11-point feedback from 39 Thai crowdworkers, they show that while sophisticated methods barely improve upon regularized averaging with binary feedback, they require only about half as many individuals to match regularized averaging's performance with 5-point feedback. The key insight is that regularized averaging binarizes granular feedback before aggregation, losing information that sophisticated methods can exploit.

## Method Summary
The authors compared regularized averaging with supervised learning methods for aggregating individual feedback into population predictions. They tested these methods across different feedback granularities (binary and 5-point scales) using a dataset of social attitude questions rated by 39 Thai crowdworkers. The performance was evaluated based on how many individuals were needed for each method to achieve comparable prediction accuracy. They also analyzed how these findings could improve data efficiency in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) pipelines, where reducing the number of required scores while maintaining quality is crucial.

## Key Results
- Sophisticated aggregation methods require only half as many individuals as regularized averaging when feedback has 5-point granularity
- With binary feedback, sophisticated methods barely improve upon regularized averaging
- In RLHF pipelines, sophisticated aggregation could reduce the number of scores needed by approximately 20% while maintaining comparable quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper demonstrates that regularized averaging loses information by binarizing granular feedback before aggregation, while sophisticated methods can exploit the full information content of granular feedback. This mechanism becomes more pronounced as feedback granularity increases.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Population distribution prediction from individual feedback**
   - Why needed: Core problem being addressed
   - Quick check: Can we accurately estimate how a population would rate something based on individual ratings?

2. **Feedback granularity and information content**
   - Why needed: Understanding how different feedback scales affect aggregation quality
   - Quick check: Does 5-point feedback contain more useful information than binary feedback for population prediction?

3. **Regularized averaging vs. supervised learning for aggregation**
   - Why needed: Comparing simple baseline with sophisticated methods
   - Quick check: When does each method perform better and why?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Individual feedback collection -> Aggregation method (Regularized averaging or Supervised learning) -> Population distribution prediction

**Critical path:** Data collection -> Feedback processing -> Aggregation algorithm -> Prediction accuracy evaluation

**Design tradeoffs:** Regularized averaging offers simplicity and interpretability but loses granular information; supervised learning preserves information but requires more data and computational resources

**Failure signatures:** When feedback is binary, sophisticated methods show minimal improvement; when sample size is small, regularized averaging may outperform sophisticated methods due to overfitting risks

**First experiments:** 1) Compare aggregation performance across 3-point, 5-point, and 11-point feedback scales; 2) Test aggregation methods with synthetic data where ground truth population distributions are known; 3) Evaluate how aggregation quality changes with increasing numbers of raters

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Small sample size (39 participants) raises questions about generalizability
- Single dataset from Thai crowdworkers may not represent diverse populations or question types
- Binary and 5-point feedback scenarios may not capture full range of practical granularities
- Focus on population distribution prediction may not directly translate to all RLHF applications

## Confidence
- Core claim about sophisticated methods outperforming regularized averaging with granular feedback: Medium
- Practical claim about 20% reduction in RLHF scores needed: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the analysis across multiple diverse datasets with varying participant pools, question types, and cultural contexts to assess generalizability
2. Test the aggregation methods with different granularities of feedback (e.g., 3-point, 7-point scales) to understand the full spectrum of performance relationships
3. Implement and evaluate the sophisticated aggregation methods in an actual RLHF pipeline with language models to validate the claimed 20% efficiency improvement under realistic training conditions
