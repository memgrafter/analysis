- Introduces first benchmark for predicting empirical AI research outcomes with 1,585 verified idea pairs

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the first benchmark for predicting empirical AI research outcomes, where models must determine which of two research ideas performs better on a set of benchmarks. The benchmark is constructed by extracting 1,585 verified idea pairs from conference papers, with 6,000 pairs for training. The authors develop a system combining a fine-tuned GPT-4.1 with a paper retrieval agent, achieving 77% accuracy on the full test set. The system outperforms human experts by a large margin in the NLP domain (64.4% vs 48.9%) and shows robustness to superficial features through extensive stress tests.

## Method Summary
The authors constructed a benchmark by extracting 1,585 verified idea pairs from conference papers, where each pair contains two research ideas compared on shared benchmarks. They fine-tuned GPT-4.1 on 6,000 training pairs and integrated it with a paper retrieval agent to create a system for predicting research outcomes. The evaluation involved comparing this system against human experts across NLP and vision domains, testing both on published papers and unpublished novel ideas. Extensive stress tests were conducted to assess robustness to superficial features.

## Key Results
- System achieves 77% accuracy on full test set, outperforming human experts in NLP domain (64.4% vs 48.9%)
- Generalizes to unpublished novel ideas with 63.6% accuracy
- Shows robustness to superficial features through extensive stress tests

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system works by combining a fine-tuned language model with targeted paper retrieval capabilities. The fine-tuning process allows the model to learn patterns from verified research outcomes, while the retrieval agent provides relevant context from published papers. This combination enables the system to make informed predictions about which research ideas will perform better on specific benchmarks.

## Foundational Learning
- Benchmark construction from conference papers: Needed to create standardized evaluation dataset; Quick check: Verify that idea pairs are truly verified and representative
- Fine-tuning GPT-4.1: Needed to adapt general language model to research outcome prediction task; Quick check: Evaluate performance on held-out validation set
- Paper retrieval integration: Needed to provide relevant context for predictions; Quick check: Measure retrieval accuracy and relevance

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Idea Pair Input -> Paper Retrieval Agent -> GPT-4.1 Fine-tuned Model -> Prediction Output

Critical path: The fine-tuned GPT-4.1 model is the critical component, as it performs the actual prediction task. The paper retrieval agent supports this by providing relevant context.

Design tradeoffs: The system trades computational cost and model access requirements (GPT-4.1) for high performance. Simpler models might be more accessible but would likely underperform.

Failure signatures: Low accuracy could indicate issues with fine-tuning data quality, retrieval agent performance, or model capacity limitations. Systematic biases in predictions might suggest overfitting to specific paper characteristics.

First experiments:
1. Evaluate baseline accuracy without fine-tuning to establish baseline performance
2. Test retrieval agent accuracy on held-out paper samples
3. Measure prediction accuracy when removing the retrieval component to quantify its contribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Human expert benchmark of 48.9% accuracy in NLP domain is barely above random chance, raising questions about experimental validity
- Generalization to unpublished novel ideas may be inflated due to systematic differences from training data
- System's reliance on GPT-4.1 limits reproducibility and increases cost

## Confidence
- Claims about system performance on published papers: Medium
- Claims about generalization to novel ideas: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a blinded human evaluation study with domain experts to verify the 48.9% human benchmark accuracy and ensure it reflects genuine human capability rather than experimental artifacts.

2. Test the system's generalization performance on a completely separate corpus of unpublished ideas from a different time period or conference venue than the training data to rule out temporal or venue-specific biases.

3. Perform ablation studies comparing the proposed system against simpler baselines (e.g., using only paper retrieval without fine-tuning, or using different language models) to quantify the specific contributions of each component.
