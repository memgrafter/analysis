# From Data-Centric to Sample-Centric: Enhancing LLM Reasoning via Progressive Optimization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.06573
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06573
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: LPPO achieves state-of-the-art results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with 2-4 percentage point improvements in pass@1 accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LPPO (Learning-Progress and Prefix-guided Optimization), a sample-centric framework that enhances large language model reasoning through reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. The key innovation shifts from uniform data treatment to dynamic sample-level optimization, guided by Prefix-Guided Sampling and Learning-Progress Weighting strategies. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, with faster convergence, higher performance ceilings, and maintained solution diversity across different model scales and architectures.

## Method Summary
LPPO transforms the traditional data-centric approach to sample-centric optimization by dynamically adjusting each sample's influence during reinforcement learning. The framework employs two complementary strategies: Prefix-Guided Sampling uses partial expert solution prefixes to guide exploration on challenging problems, mimicking hint-based learning in humans, while Learning-Progress Weighting dynamically adjusts sample influence based on improvement trajectories. This approach maximizes learning from limited expert demonstrations and proves particularly effective when high-quality reasoning data is scarce.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on AIME24, AIME25, and Minerva benchmarks
- Demonstrates consistent 2-4 percentage point improvements in pass@1 accuracy
- Shows faster convergence and higher performance ceilings compared to baselines
- Maintains solution diversity while improving reasoning performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by treating each training sample as an independent optimization target rather than treating all data uniformly. Prefix-Guided Sampling provides targeted exploration guidance by leveraging partial expert solutions, while Learning-Progress Weighting ensures the model focuses on samples that continue to drive improvement. This dynamic, sample-level optimization prevents the model from plateauing on easy samples and ensures efficient use of limited expert demonstrations.

## Foundational Learning

**Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards**: Essential for training models on tasks with clear success criteria. Quick check: Verify reward function correctly identifies correct vs incorrect solutions.

**Sample Weighting in RL**: Critical for prioritizing learning resources. Quick check: Ensure weighting mechanism doesn't cause catastrophic forgetting of easy samples.

**Prefix-based Guidance**: Leverages partial solutions to guide exploration. Quick check: Confirm prefix length selection doesn't leak too much information.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input Data -> Prefix-Guided Sampling -> Learning-Progress Weighting -> RLVR Training Loop -> Model Output

Critical path: The sampling mechanism feeds into the weighting system, which directly influences the RLVR loss calculation and gradient updates.

Design tradeoffs: Balancing prefix information leakage against guidance effectiveness, and managing computational overhead of dynamic weighting versus training efficiency.

Failure signatures: Uniform weighting failure leads to plateauing on easy samples; excessive prefix guidance causes overfitting to specific solution patterns.

First experiments:
1. Ablation study removing Prefix-Guided Sampling to measure individual contribution
2. Test Learning-Progress Weighting with static weights as baseline
3. Evaluate convergence speed with different weighting update frequencies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily focused on mathematical reasoning tasks, limiting generalizability

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate LPPO on non-mathematical reasoning tasks (code generation, commonsense reasoning) to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of Prefix-Guided Sampling and Learning-Progress Weighting
3. Measure and report computational overhead introduced by dynamic sample weighting during training
