# ThematicPlane: Bridging Tacit User Intent and Latent Spaces for Image Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.06065
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06065
- Reference count: 33
- Enables semantic navigation and manipulation of high-level concepts in interactive design plane

## Executive Summary
ThematicPlane is a system that bridges tacit creative intent and system control for image generation by enabling users to navigate and manipulate high-level semantic concepts within an interactive thematic design plane. The system addresses the gap between user creativity and technical control in generative design tools. In an exploratory study with 6 participants, users engaged in both divergent and convergent creative modes, achieving mean satisfaction ratings of 5.86 out of 7. While participants found the system fostered expressive, iterative workflows, unexpected outputs and differing expectations about theme mappings revealed areas for improvement in explainability and control precision.

## Method Summary
The system was evaluated through an exploratory study with 6 participants who interacted with the ThematicPlane interface for image generation tasks. Participants engaged in creative sessions that allowed for both divergent exploration of possibilities and convergent refinement of outputs. The study collected both quantitative satisfaction ratings and qualitative feedback on the user experience. Participants worked with pre-defined thematic controls to manipulate semantic aspects of generated images, with the system operating in an interactive design plane that connected user intent to latent space transformations.

## Key Results
- Mean user satisfaction rating of 5.86 (SD = 0.90) despite some unexpected outputs (mean 3.43, SD = 1.27)
- Participants engaged in both divergent and convergent creative modes during sessions
- System fostered expressive, iterative workflows while revealing need for more explainable controls

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ThematicPlane works by creating an intuitive mapping between high-level semantic concepts (themes) and the latent space representations used in image generation models. The system translates user manipulations of thematic controls into specific transformations in the latent space, allowing users to guide image generation through semantic understanding rather than technical parameters. This bridging of tacit creative intent with explicit system control enables users to work at a conceptual level while the system handles the underlying technical complexity of latent space navigation.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Latent Space Navigation**: Understanding how semantic concepts map to directions in latent space - needed to translate user themes into model transformations; quick check: verify theme vectors produce coherent semantic changes
2. **Semantic Control Interfaces**: Designing intuitive mappings between abstract concepts and system parameters - needed to make complex model control accessible; quick check: test if non-technical users can achieve desired effects
3. **Interactive Design Planes**: Creating spatial interfaces for multi-dimensional control - needed to support exploration and refinement; quick check: measure efficiency of divergent vs convergent workflows

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: User Input -> Theme Interpreter -> Latent Space Transformer -> Image Generator -> Output Display

Critical Path: The core workflow flows from user theme manipulation through interpretation, latent space transformation, image generation, and visual feedback. Each stage must maintain semantic coherence to preserve user intent through the pipeline.

Design Tradeoffs: Pre-defined themes offer consistency and ease of use but limit flexibility compared to free-form semantic specification. The system prioritizes accessibility over complete control, accepting some constraint on creativity for improved usability.

Failure Signatures: Unexpected outputs occur when theme interpretations don't match user expectations or when latent space transformations produce unintended visual effects. These failures manifest as semantically inconsistent results or outputs that diverge from the intended creative direction.

First Experiments:
1. Test theme consistency across different base images to verify semantic transformations are stable
2. Evaluate user ability to achieve specific visual outcomes using only thematic controls
3. Measure the learning curve for new users navigating from novice to proficient usage

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Extremely small sample size (n=6) precluding statistical inference
- Lack of comparison with baseline or alternative interaction methods
- Unclear evaluation of whether semantic control improved output quality versus novelty

## Confidence
- Core claim about intuitive semantic navigation: Medium confidence (positive ratings but small sample)
- Divergent and convergent creative modes finding: Low confidence (limited methodological detail)
- Tension between control and surprise: Medium confidence (limited quantitative detail)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a controlled study with 20+ participants comparing ThematicPlane against a standard prompt-based interface on objective creativity metrics and subjective satisfaction
2. Implement and evaluate an explainable AI component showing how theme parameters map to latent space transformations
3. Test the system's scalability across different image domains (e.g., non-portrait subjects) and theme granularities to assess robustness of semantic control
