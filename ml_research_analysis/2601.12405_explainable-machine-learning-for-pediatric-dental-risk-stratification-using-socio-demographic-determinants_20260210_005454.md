# Explainable Machine Learning for Pediatric Dental Risk Stratification Using Socio-Demographic Determinants

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2601.12405
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12405
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: Developed explainable AI framework for pediatric dental risk stratification using socio-demographic data; achieved AUC = 0.61 with SHAP analysis identifying age and income-to-poverty ratio as strongest predictors

## Executive Summary
This study presents an explainable AI framework for pediatric dental risk stratification that integrates socio-demographic and health data. The model employs supervised machine learning with features including age, income-to-poverty ratio, race/ethnicity, gender, and medical history, while SHAP analysis provides transparency into prediction mechanisms. The framework demonstrates modest discrimination (AUC = 0.61) and conservative calibration, systematically underestimating risk at higher predicted levels. Designed primarily for population screening and equitable resource allocation rather than clinical diagnosis, the approach prioritizes transparency and ethical deployment over maximal predictive accuracy.

## Method Summary
The study developed a supervised machine learning model for pediatric dental risk prediction using socio-demographic and health data. Key features included age, income-to-poverty ratio, race/ethnicity, gender, and medical history. Explainability was achieved through SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to identify and rank predictor importance. The model was trained on available pediatric datasets and evaluated for discrimination performance and calibration accuracy, with particular attention to systematic prediction biases at different risk levels.

## Key Results
- Model achieved AUC of 0.61, indicating modest discrimination capability
- Systematic calibration issues identified, with consistent underestimation of risk at higher predicted levels
- SHAP analysis revealed age and income-to-poverty ratio as strongest predictors, followed by race/ethnicity and gender
- Framework supports population screening and equitable resource allocation rather than individual clinical diagnosis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The model's explainability through SHAP analysis enables transparent identification of key risk factors while maintaining ethical considerations in healthcare AI deployment. The socio-demographic feature set captures fundamental determinants of health that correlate with dental risk, allowing for population-level screening applications. The conservative calibration approach, while limiting predictive accuracy, provides a safety buffer that prevents overestimation of risk in resource allocation decisions.

## Foundational Learning
- **SHAP Analysis**: Required for feature importance interpretation and model transparency; quick check: verify SHAP values sum to model output
- **AUC Evaluation**: Needed to assess discrimination capability between risk levels; quick check: ensure ROC curve properly characterizes model performance
- **Calibration Assessment**: Critical for understanding prediction reliability across risk spectrum; quick check: compare predicted vs actual risk distributions
- **Feature Engineering**: Essential for optimizing socio-demographic predictor combinations; quick check: test individual feature contributions to model performance
- **Ethical AI Deployment**: Necessary for healthcare applications prioritizing fairness; quick check: evaluate bias across demographic subgroups
- **Population Screening Design**: Required for resource allocation rather than individual diagnosis; quick check: validate screening criteria against population outcomes

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Data Collection -> Feature Engineering -> Model Training -> SHAP Analysis -> Performance Evaluation
**Critical Path**: Feature selection and engineering directly impacts model performance and explainability
**Design Tradeoffs**: Prioritized transparency and ethical considerations over maximal predictive accuracy
**Failure Signatures**: Systematic underestimation at high risk levels indicates calibration issues requiring adjustment
**First Experiments**: 1) Test model on independent validation dataset, 2) Conduct subgroup analysis across demographic categories, 3) Evaluate impact on resource allocation decisions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Modest model performance (AUC = 0.61) limits clinical applicability
- Systematic calibration issues, particularly underestimation of risk at higher predicted levels
- Potential generalizability concerns due to reliance on specific socio-demographic data

## Confidence
- **Model's ability to identify key predictors**: High
- **Model's predictive accuracy and calibration**: Medium
- **Framework's support for equitable resource allocation**: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct external validation of the model using diverse, independent datasets to assess generalizability across different populations
2. Perform detailed analysis of calibration issues, particularly the underestimation of risk at higher predicted levels, to improve model accuracy
3. Evaluate the model's impact on resource allocation and health outcomes in real-world settings to determine effectiveness in supporting equitable healthcare delivery
