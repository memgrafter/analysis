# Towards Resource-Efficient Multimodal Intelligence: Learned Routing among Specialized Expert Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.06441
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06441
- **Authors:** Mayank Saini; Arit Kumar Bishwas
- **Reference count:** 40
- **One-line primary result:** Matches or exceeds always-premium LLM performance while reducing reliance on costly models by over 67% on benchmarks like MMLU and VQA.

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the high computational cost and latency of large language models (LLMs) in multimodal AI systems. It introduces a unified, modular framework that intelligently routes queries—textual, multimodal, or complex—to the most fitting expert model using a learned routing network. For vision tasks, it employs a two-stage open-source pipeline optimized for efficiency, leveraging classical vision components where they remain state-of-the-art. On benchmarks like MMLU and VQA, the approach matches or exceeds always-premium LLM performance while reducing reliance on costly models by over 67%. The framework demonstrates high-quality, resource-efficient AI at scale with improved latency and throughput.

## Method Summary
The method implements a hierarchical, cost-aware routing framework for multimodal queries. It begins with a Modality Classifier to detect input type (text, non-text, or complex), followed by a Complexity Analyzer for text queries that computes a weighted score based on Intent, Length, and Semantic Density. Queries below a dynamic threshold are routed to open-source Small Language Models (SLMs), while complex ones use premium APIs. For vision tasks, a "Couplet" framework orchestrates classical computer vision models (e.g., YOLO, Tesseract) via an SLM, avoiding expensive VLMs where possible. A LangGraph orchestrator decomposes complex tasks, and a Mixture-of-Experts Aggregator synthesizes final responses.

## Key Results
- Achieves 88.5% accuracy on MMLU, matching or exceeding always-premium LLM performance.
- Reduces reliance on costly models by over 67% while maintaining high accuracy.
- Demonstrates improved latency and throughput with modular, specialized routing.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Modality-First Decomposition
Hierarchical input classification prevents computational waste by detecting attachments (MIME types) and routing non-text inputs directly to specialized pipelines, bypassing text-complexity analysis. The core assumption is that the classification step is negligible compared to monolithic LMM inference. Break condition: failure to detect dependencies between text and attachments leads to erroneous routing to text-only models, causing hallucination or failure.

### Mechanism 2: Complexity-Gated Model Selection
A weighted scalar complexity score $C(Q)$ filters simple queries to open-source SLMs, preserving premium APIs for hardest tasks. The score is based on Intent, Length, and Semantic Density. Core assumption: syntactic and semantic proxies correlate with actual computational difficulty. Break condition: implicit complexity (e.g., "Write a poem about P vs NP") may score low but require high reasoning, causing poor responses.

### Mechanism 3: SLM-Mediated Classical Orchestration (Couplet)
Orchestrating classical computer vision models (e.g., YOLO, Tesseract) via SLMs creates a "good enough" perception layer without expensive VLMs. The SLM parses user intent into a structured API call for a classical model, which executes the task, and the SLM formats the output into natural language. Core assumption: deterministic classical models outperform or match generative VLMs for many user queries at a fraction of the cost. Break condition: queries requiring deep visual reasoning will fail if routed to classical detectors.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Mixture of Experts (MoE)**
  - **Why needed here:** The system uses MoE concepts at the system level to blend outputs from different modalities.
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain the difference between "Sparse MoE" (inside a model) and "System-level MoE" (routing between models)?

- **Concept: Dynamic Thresholding (Pareto Efficiency)**
  - **Why needed here:** The routing logic relies on a threshold $\tau$ to balance Cost vs. Quality.
  - **Quick check question:** If you lower the complexity threshold $\tau$, will the system's operational cost go up or down? (Answer: Down, because fewer queries trigger the expensive "premium" route).

- **Concept: Classical Computer Vision (vs. VLMs)**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper advocates reusing models like YOLO or CLIP.
  - **Quick check question:** For the query "Is there a dog in this image?", which is more cost-efficient: a Vision Transformer (ViT) or a YOLOv8 inference?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Streamlit UI + Modality Classifier -> Router (Complexity Analyzer $\to$ Intent Classifier $\to$ Model Pool) for Text Path; Couplet (SLM + Classical CV) or Specialized Modules for Non-Text Path -> LangGraph orchestrator -> MoE Aggregator.

- **Critical path:** The Modality Classifier and Complexity Analyzer are the linchpins. If the Modality Classifier misses an attachment, the context is lost. If the Complexity Analyzer is miscalibrated, the system either over-spends or under-performs.

- **Design tradeoffs:** The "Couplet" path introduces an extra hop (SLM $\to$ Classical $\to$ SLM) which may add latency compared to a direct VLM call, though it saves cost. The 13-category classification scheme adds precision but increases maintenance compared to a binary "Hard/Easy" split.

- **Failure signatures:** Context Bleed (follow-up text queries routed to text LLM instead of context-aware MoE, losing reference to previous image). Router Oscillation (ambiguous queries flipping between "Simple" and "Complex" routes due to tight confidence threshold).

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Baseline Calibration:** Run a held-out test set through *only* the Complexity Analyzer to plot the ROC curve of "Correctly identified Complex queries" vs. "False Positives."
  2. **Couplet vs. VLM A/B Test:** Route 100 image-based queries via Couplet (YOLO) and 100 via GPT-4V. Compare latency, cost, and accuracy.
  3. **Feedback Loop Integration:** Deploy the routing feedback mechanism and measure the "re-route rate" (how often user feedback forces a fallback to a premium model) over 24 hours.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- **Unknown 1: Routing Weights:** The specific numerical values for the complexity coefficients (α, β, γ) and routing score weights are not provided; they are only described as "tunable."
- **Unknown 2: Router Architecture:** The paper mentions a "RouteLLM-style predictor" but does not specify the exact model architecture or training hyperparameters for the router itself.
- **Failure mode 1: Context Loss in Follow-ups:** The system may fail to link a text follow-up to a prior multimodal input, with a mentioned 10% failure rate in follow-up detection.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The general mechanism of modality-first decomposition and the reported benchmark results (88.5% MMLU, >67% cost reduction) are well-supported by the experimental section and standard benchmarks.
- **Medium Confidence:** The system-level MoE architecture and the feasibility of the Couplet path are plausible based on the described components and neighboring work, but lack independent validation.
- **Low Confidence:** The specific numerical values for routing thresholds and the performance of the "Valpy prompt-classifier" in the 13-category classification scheme are not provided and must be inferred or tuned.

## Next Checks

1. **Threshold Calibration Sweep:** Run a held-out validation set through the Complexity Analyzer to plot the Cost vs. Accuracy Pareto frontier and identify the optimal threshold τ that balances the <30-42% cost target with acceptable accuracy drop.
2. **Couplet vs. VLM A/B Test:** Route a balanced set of 200 vision-based queries through both the Couplet path (YOLO + SLM) and a direct GPT-4V call. Measure and compare latency, cost, and accuracy to validate the claimed efficiency gains.
3. **Context Bleed Failure Analysis:** Design and run a test suite of multimodal conversation threads with follow-up text queries. Measure the rate of context loss by tracking how often the system fails to retrieve the relevant image context from the "Module-Specific Memory."
