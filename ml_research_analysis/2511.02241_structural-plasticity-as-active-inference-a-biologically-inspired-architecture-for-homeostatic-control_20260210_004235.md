# Structural Plasticity as Active Inference: A Biologically-Inspired Architecture for Homeostatic Control

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.02241
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02241
- Reference count: 8
- Primary result: SAPIN achieves 82% CartPole balancing success using homeostasis and prediction error without reward signals

## Executive Summary
SAPIN introduces a biologically-inspired neural architecture that integrates two forms of plasticity—local synaptic learning and global structural adaptation—based on active inference principles. Operating on a 2D grid, the model learns through local prediction error minimization, with cells physically migrating to optimize information-receptive fields. Tested on the CartPole benchmark, SAPIN successfully discovered stable balancing policies without external reward signals. However, continual learning led to instability, which was resolved by locking network parameters after achieving success, resulting in an 82% success rate over 100 episodes (averaged across 100 agents). The work demonstrates that homeostasis-seeking behavior and prediction error minimization can suffice for control tasks, while highlighting structural plasticity as a viable mechanism for adaptive computation.

## Method Summary
The SAPIN architecture combines local synaptic plasticity with global structural plasticity on a 2D grid of cells. Each cell maintains homeostatic equilibrium through prediction error minimization, where prediction errors drive both synaptic updates and physical migration of cells to optimize receptive fields. The model operates without external reward signals, instead using homeostasis-seeking behavior as the primary objective. Cells communicate locally and adjust their positions based on prediction error gradients, creating an emergent global policy for task completion. The CartPole benchmark serves as the primary test environment, where the agent must balance a pole on a moving cart.

## Key Results
- SAPIN discovers stable CartPole balancing policies without external reward signals
- Achieved 82% success rate over 100 episodes averaged across 100 agents after parameter locking
- Demonstrated that homeostasis-seeking behavior combined with prediction error minimization can solve control tasks
- Showed structural plasticity enables emergent global policy formation through local cell migration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The architecture leverages active inference principles where prediction error minimization drives both synaptic updates and structural adaptation. Local prediction errors at each cell create a gradient that guides both weight updates and physical migration. This dual plasticity mechanism allows the system to simultaneously optimize local processing and global information flow. The homeostatic equilibrium maintained by each cell creates a self-organizing system where successful configurations emerge from local interactions rather than centralized control. The 2D grid structure provides the spatial framework for both computation and migration, enabling the emergence of complex behaviors from simple local rules.

## Foundational Learning
- **Active Inference**: Predictive processing framework where organisms minimize prediction error through both perception and action; needed for understanding the theoretical foundation of SAPIN's learning mechanism; quick check: verify prediction error gradients drive both synaptic and structural changes
- **Structural Plasticity**: Neural adaptation involving physical changes in connectivity patterns; needed to understand how SAPIN's cell migration differs from traditional weight updates; quick check: confirm migration occurs based on prediction error gradients
- **Homeostatic Equilibrium**: Biological concept of maintaining stable internal conditions; needed to understand SAPIN's objective function beyond task performance; quick check: verify cells maintain internal stability metrics
- **Prediction Error Minimization**: Core mechanism for learning in active inference; needed to understand how SAPIN learns without reward signals; quick check: confirm prediction error drives both learning and migration
- **Emergent Global Policy**: Complex behaviors arising from simple local rules; needed to understand how SAPIN achieves task completion without centralized control; quick check: verify global behavior emerges from local cell interactions

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input sensors -> Grid cells (with synaptic weights) -> Local prediction error computation -> Synaptic updates + Cell migration -> Output actions

**Critical Path**: Sensor inputs are processed by grid cells, prediction errors are computed locally, errors drive both synaptic updates and cell migration, resulting in emergent policy that produces control outputs

**Design Tradeoffs**: Uses 2D grid representation which is biologically plausible but may limit representational capacity compared to continuous neural structures; physical migration mechanism is simplified compared to real neural plasticity but enables emergent global optimization; operates without reward signals which aligns with biological motivation but may limit performance on complex tasks

**Failure Signatures**: Instability during continual learning (resolved by parameter locking), limited to single benchmark task, simplified physical migration mechanism may not capture full complexity of biological structural plasticity

**First Experiments**: 1) Test SAPIN on Pendulum environment to assess generalization to continuous control tasks 2) Implement long-term learning scenario with multiple task transitions to evaluate plasticity management 3) Conduct ablation study comparing SAPIN against pure synaptic plasticity models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided in the source material.

## Limitations
- Validated only on single CartPole benchmark, limiting generalizability to complex control problems
- Continual learning instability suggests scalability issues for long-term deployment without parameter locking
- 2D grid representation may not capture full complexity of biological neural structures
- Physical migration mechanism is simplified compared to real neural plasticity

## Confidence
- High confidence in basic demonstration that homeostatic control + prediction error minimization can achieve CartPole balance
- Medium confidence in scalability of approach to more complex tasks
- Medium confidence in biological plausibility of physical migration mechanism
- Low confidence in robustness of continual learning without parameter locking

## Next Checks
1. Test SAPIN on a suite of OpenAI Gym environments (e.g., Pendulum, MountainCar, Acrobot) to assess generalization across control tasks of varying complexity.

2. Implement a long-term learning scenario (>1000 episodes) with multiple task transitions to evaluate the model's ability to maintain plasticity while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

3. Conduct ablation studies comparing SAPIN's performance against pure synaptic plasticity models and other biologically-inspired architectures to isolate the contribution of structural adaptation.
