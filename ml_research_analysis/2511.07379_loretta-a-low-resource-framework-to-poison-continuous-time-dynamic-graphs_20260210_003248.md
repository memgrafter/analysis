# LoReTTA: A Low Resource Framework To Poison Continuous Time Dynamic Graphs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.07379
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07379

- Primary result: LoReTTA achieves 29.47% average performance degradation on TGNN models while evading detection systems

## Executive Summary
LoReTTA is a novel adversarial poisoning framework designed for continuous-time dynamic graphs (CTDGs) that operates under realistic attack constraints. The method strategically removes high-impact edges from the graph and replaces them with carefully sampled negative edges, maintaining node degrees and temporal plausibility. Unlike many existing approaches, LoReTTA requires no surrogate models and demonstrates both effectiveness and computational efficiency. The framework successfully degrades state-of-the-art TGNN models while evading multiple anomaly detection systems and remaining robust against defense strategies.

## Method Summary
LoReTTA operates in two distinct phases to poison CTDGs. In the first phase, it identifies and removes edges that have the highest temporal importance using a heuristic-based approach that considers both structural and temporal factors. The second phase replaces these removed edges with strategically sampled negative edges that preserve the graph's degree distribution and temporal characteristics. The method is designed to work with minimal prior knowledge of the target model and operates under realistic constraints such as limited access to the graph structure and temporal information. By focusing on edge importance rather than node importance, LoReTTA achieves targeted disruption while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Key Results
- Achieves 29.47% average performance degradation across four benchmark datasets and four state-of-the-art TGNN models
- Outperforms 11 baseline attacks in both effectiveness and stealth
- Successfully evades four leading anomaly detection systems while maintaining attack potency
- Remains robust against four different defense methods, demonstrating practical attack viability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of LoReTTA stems from its strategic focus on temporal importance rather than purely structural importance. By identifying edges that are critical for both current connectivity and future temporal evolution of the graph, the framework maximizes disruption with minimal modifications. The edge replacement strategy ensures that the poisoned graph maintains realistic properties, making detection more difficult. The preservation of node degrees prevents obvious structural anomalies that could trigger detection systems. The two-phase approach allows for targeted attacks that balance between maximum impact and stealth, making it effective against both the model's performance and its detection mechanisms.

## Foundational Learning
**Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs**: Graphs where edges appear and disappear over time with precise temporal information. Why needed: LoReTTA specifically targets the temporal aspect of graph evolution, which is crucial for modern TGNNs. Quick check: Understand how edge timestamps affect graph connectivity patterns.
**Temporal Importance Heuristics**: Methods to quantify the significance of edges based on both structural position and temporal properties. Why needed: Forms the basis for identifying which edges to remove during the attack. Quick check: Verify how temporal decay and recency affect edge importance calculations.
**Degree Preservation**: Maintaining the number of connections for each node during graph modifications. Why needed: Prevents obvious structural anomalies that could trigger detection systems. Quick check: Confirm that node degrees remain statistically similar between original and poisoned graphs.
**Edge Replacement Strategy**: The process of substituting removed edges with negative edges that maintain graph properties. Why needed: Enables stealth by avoiding structural voids that could be detected. Quick check: Validate that replaced edges follow similar temporal distributions as original edges.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Graph Analysis -> Temporal Importance Calculation -> Edge Removal Selection -> Negative Edge Sampling -> Graph Reconstruction -> Model Evaluation

**Critical Path**: The attack execution follows a linear progression where temporal importance calculation directly determines edge removal decisions, which in turn informs the negative edge sampling strategy. The effectiveness of the attack depends critically on accurate temporal importance assessment, as poor selection leads to suboptimal poisoning with reduced impact.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades comprehensive graph analysis for computational efficiency by using heuristics rather than exact calculations. This enables scalability but may miss some important edges. The edge replacement strategy prioritizes stealth over maximum disruption, allowing the attack to evade detection at the cost of some potential performance degradation. The decision to avoid surrogate models increases practical applicability but limits attack precision.

**Failure Signatures**: If temporal importance calculations are inaccurate, the attack may target unimportant edges, resulting in minimal performance degradation. Excessive edge replacement beyond realistic bounds could trigger anomaly detectors. Failure to maintain degree preservation could create detectable structural anomalies. Poor temporal sampling of negative edges could create temporal patterns that stand out to detection systems.

**First Experiments**:
1. Validate temporal importance heuristic accuracy by comparing selected edges against ground truth importance scores
2. Test degree preservation by analyzing degree distributions before and after poisoning
3. Evaluate temporal plausibility of replaced edges by comparing timestamp distributions with original edges

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to node-level link prediction tasks, effectiveness on other CTG tasks remains untested
- Computational cost of temporal importance heuristic not benchmarked against alternatives
- Assumes knowledge of edge removal and replacement timestamps, which may not hold in real-world scenarios
- Does not investigate adaptive defense strategies specifically designed to counter edge replacement tactics
- Generalization to larger-scale graphs beyond evaluated datasets remains untested

## Confidence
- Attack effectiveness (29.47% average degradation): High
- Evasion of anomaly detection: Medium (limited to 4 detectors)
- Computational efficiency: Low (no formal complexity analysis provided)
- Robustness against defenses: Medium (tested against 4 specific defenses)

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate LoReTTA's performance on CTG tasks beyond link prediction, including node classification and temporal anomaly detection
2. Benchmark the temporal importance heuristic computation cost against alternative sparsification methods and analyze scalability
3. Test adaptive defenses specifically designed to counter the edge replacement strategy, including dynamic threshold adjustments and temporal pattern-based detection
