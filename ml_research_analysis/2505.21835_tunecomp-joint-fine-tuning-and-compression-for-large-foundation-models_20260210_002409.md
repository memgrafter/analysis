# TuneComp: Joint Fine-tuning and Compression for Large Foundation Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.21835
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21835
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: TuneComp achieves superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs by jointly fine-tuning and compressing large models, outperforming sequential fine-tune-then-compress pipelines.

## Executive Summary
TuneComp is a method for jointly fine-tuning and compressing large foundation models by integrating knowledge distillation, low-rank approximation, and pruning in a single training process. Unlike traditional pipelines that fine-tune a model first and then compress it, TuneComp directly constructs a smaller student model while maintaining task guidance from a larger teacher. This is achieved through a progressive replacement strategy that splits each linear layer into parallel teacher and student branches, gradually substituting teacher weights with a compressed low-rank student representation. Experimental results on ViT-Base for CIFAR100 classification show significant gains in the accuracy-efficiency trade-off, especially at high compression rates.

## Method Summary
TuneComp introduces a unified framework for compressing large foundation models during adaptation to downstream tasks. The method splits each linear layer into parallel teacher and student branches, allowing the student to learn from both the teacher's outputs and the downstream task. Low-rank approximation is applied to the student branch, and pruning is extended to these low-rank structures. Progressive replacement of the pretrained teacher weights with the compressed student branch is guided by dynamic regularization decay. This joint optimization avoids the performance degradation and unnecessary intermediate model sizes associated with sequential fine-tune-then-compress approaches.

## Key Results
- TuneComp significantly outperforms sequential fine-tune-then-compress methods on CIFAR100 with ViT-Base, especially at high compression rates.
- The method achieves higher accuracy-efficiency trade-offs by directly constructing a smaller model during fine-tuning.
- Improved initialization and regularization strategies contribute to the observed gains.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TuneComp's effectiveness stems from its joint optimization of fine-tuning and compression, which allows the student model to adapt to the downstream task while being compressed simultaneously. The progressive replacement of teacher weights with a compressed student representation ensures that the model remains task-aware throughout the compression process. Activation-aware low-rank approximation and pruning to low-rank structures further enhance efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Dynamic regularization decay helps stabilize the training process as the student branch takes over.

## Foundational Learning
- **Low-rank approximation**: Used to reduce the dimensionality of weight matrices, enabling model compression while preserving essential information. Quick check: Verify that low-rank decomposition reduces parameters without significant accuracy loss.
- **Knowledge distillation**: Guides the student model by transferring knowledge from a larger teacher model. Quick check: Ensure the student's outputs closely match the teacher's softened logits.
- **Pruning**: Removes redundant parameters, especially from low-rank structures, to further compress the model. Quick check: Confirm that pruned models retain task performance.
- **Progressive replacement**: Gradually substitutes teacher weights with compressed student weights to maintain task guidance. Quick check: Monitor accuracy during replacement to ensure stability.
- **Dynamic regularization decay**: Adjusts regularization strength during training to balance compression and performance. Quick check: Observe if accuracy improves with adaptive regularization.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Linear Layer -> Parallel Teacher Branch + Student Branch -> Low-Rank Decomposition -> Pruning -> Progressive Replacement

**Critical Path**
Fine-tuning and compression are performed simultaneously, with the student branch learning from both the teacher and the task. The progressive replacement ensures that the model remains task-aware as it is compressed.

**Design Tradeoffs**
TuneComp trades off the simplicity of sequential pipelines for improved efficiency and accuracy. The joint approach requires more complex training but avoids the pitfalls of intermediate model sizes and performance loss.

**Failure Signatures**
- Accuracy drop during progressive replacement indicates instability.
- Excessive compression may lead to underfitting.
- Poor initialization of student weights can hinder convergence.

**First Experiments**
1. Test TuneComp on a simple vision task with a small model to verify the joint training framework.
2. Apply low-rank approximation to a pretrained model and measure the impact on accuracy and efficiency.
3. Evaluate the effect of dynamic regularization decay on model stability during progressive replacement.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation is limited to ViT-Base on CIFAR100, raising questions about generalization to larger models and other tasks.
- Lack of ablation studies makes it difficult to attribute performance gains to specific components.
- Claims of superiority may not hold at lower compression ratios or with alternative architectures.

## Confidence
- Joint training framework and progressive replacement: **High**
- Activation-aware low-rank approximation contribution: **Medium**
- Generalization to other tasks/models: **Low**

## Next Checks
1. Test TuneComp on larger vision models (e.g., ViT-Large) and NLP models (e.g., BERT-Base) to assess scalability and cross-domain performance.
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the effects of dynamic regularization decay, pruning, and low-rank approximation to quantify their individual contributions.
3. Evaluate TuneComp under varying compression ratios, especially at low compression rates, to determine if the claimed advantages persist across the full spectrum of model sizes.
