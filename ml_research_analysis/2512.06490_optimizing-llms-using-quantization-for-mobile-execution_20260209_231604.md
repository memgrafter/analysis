# Optimizing LLMs Using Quantization for Mobile Execution
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.06490
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06490
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: 68.66% model size reduction while maintaining functional LLM performance on mobile

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a practical workflow for deploying large language models on mobile devices through post-training quantization. The authors compress Meta's Llama 3.2 3B model using 4-bit quantization via BitsAndBytes and convert it to GGUF format for mobile execution. The resulting model achieves significant size reduction while maintaining qualitative inference capabilities on Android devices via Termux and Ollama framework.

## Method Summary
The study employs post-training quantization (PTQ) to compress LLMs for mobile deployment. Using the BitsAndBytes library, the Llama 3.2 3B model undergoes 4-bit quantization, followed by conversion to GGUF format suitable for mobile inference. The workflow includes qualitative testing on Android devices through Termux terminal emulator and Ollama framework, demonstrating successful deployment and functional performance comparable to other small models.

## Key Results
- Achieved 68.66% size reduction (6.00GB to 1.88GB) through 4-bit quantization
- Demonstrated successful qualitative inference on Android devices via Termux
- Model achieved perplexity of 8.57 and BLEU score of 0.45 on standard benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of this approach stems from exploiting quantization's ability to reduce numerical precision while preserving model functionality. Post-training quantization applies quantization-aware techniques after initial model training, avoiding the computational overhead of quantization-aware training. The 4-bit representation significantly reduces memory footprint while maintaining sufficient dynamic range for most inference tasks. GGUF format provides an optimized binary representation specifically designed for mobile deployment, enabling efficient loading and execution on resource-constrained devices.

## Foundational Learning
- **Post-training quantization (PTQ)**: Applies quantization after model training to reduce precision. Why needed: avoids expensive retraining while achieving compression. Quick check: compare model size and accuracy before/after.
- **4-bit quantization**: Reduces weights to 4-bit representations. Why needed: balances compression ratio with performance retention. Quick check: verify memory savings vs. accuracy drop.
- **GGUF format**: Specialized binary format for quantized models. Why needed: optimizes model loading and execution on mobile hardware. Quick check: test loading speed and inference latency.
- **BitsAndBytes library**: Implements quantization algorithms. Why needed: provides production-ready quantization with FP4 support. Quick check: confirm compatibility with target model architecture.
- **Termux mobile environment**: Android terminal emulator supporting Linux packages. Why needed: enables LLM execution on Android without root access. Quick check: verify package installation and execution.
- **Ollama framework**: Model serving and inference platform. Why needed: simplifies LLM deployment and API access. Quick check: test basic model loading and inference.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Raw model -> 4-bit quantization (BitsAndBytes) -> GGUF conversion -> Mobile deployment (Termux + Ollama)
Critical path: Model quantization → Format conversion → Mobile execution environment setup
Design tradeoffs: 4-bit precision balances size reduction against potential accuracy loss; GGUF format prioritizes mobile compatibility over universal support
Failure signatures: Model loading errors indicate format incompatibility; poor inference quality suggests quantization degradation; memory exhaustion reveals insufficient device resources
First experiments:
1. Verify basic model loading and inference on target device
2. Measure inference latency and memory usage during typical workloads
3. Test model robustness across diverse input types and prompt lengths

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies entirely on qualitative assessment rather than comprehensive quantitative benchmarks
- No comparison provided against other quantization schemes (8-bit, 3-bit) or alternative compression techniques
- Study focuses exclusively on Llama 3.2 3B, leaving uncertainty about generalizability to larger models

## Confidence
- Size reduction achievement (High confidence): Straightforward verification through file size measurements
- Functional deployment capability (Medium confidence): Qualitative testing shows functionality but lacks quantitative validation
- Performance competitiveness (Low confidence): Single metric values without comparative analysis or baseline measurements

## Next Checks
1. Conduct comprehensive benchmarking comparing 4-bit quantized performance against 8-bit and 16-bit versions across multiple tasks, measuring not just perplexity and BLEU but also latency, throughput, and memory consumption on target mobile hardware.
2. Evaluate model generalization by applying the same quantization workflow to diverse LLM architectures (different sizes, different pre-training objectives) to identify failure modes or architecture-specific challenges.
3. Perform extended stress testing under realistic usage conditions, measuring sustained performance, battery impact, and thermal throttling behavior during continuous inference sessions on mobile devices.
