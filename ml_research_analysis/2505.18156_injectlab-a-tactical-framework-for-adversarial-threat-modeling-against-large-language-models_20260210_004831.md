# InjectLab: A Tactical Framework for Adversarial Threat Modeling Against Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.18156
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18156
- Reference count: 11
- Primary result: Introduces a tactical framework for modeling and simulating adversarial threats against large language models

## Executive Summary
InjectLab is a tactical framework designed to model and simulate adversarial threats against large language models (LLMs) through prompt injection attacks. Inspired by MITRE ATT&CK methodology, it organizes over 25 prompt-based attack techniques into six core tactics with associated detection heuristics and mitigation guidance. The framework includes YAML-based simulation tests and a Python CLI tool for structured, repeatable testing of LLM security vulnerabilities. By focusing specifically on language interface-level threats, InjectLab provides red teams and security analysts with practical tools for operational readiness against emerging AI security challenges.

## Method Summary
The framework adapts MITRE ATT&CK methodology to LLM security by organizing prompt injection techniques into a structured tactical framework. It includes YAML-based simulation tests modeled after Atomic Red Team methodology and provides a Python CLI tool for execution. The approach focuses exclusively on prompt-based injection attacks through language interfaces, offering detection heuristics and mitigation strategies for each technique. The framework is designed to be expanded by the community and emphasizes practical testing over theoretical classification.

## Key Results
- Organizes 25+ prompt injection attack techniques into six tactical categories
- Provides YAML-based simulation tests for repeatable security testing
- Bridges gaps in existing AI security taxonomies by focusing on language interface threats
- Includes detection heuristics and mitigation guidance for each attack technique

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its structured approach to LLM security testing, borrowing proven methodologies from established cybersecurity frameworks. By organizing attacks into tactical categories and providing concrete simulation tests, it creates a systematic way to assess LLM vulnerabilities. The YAML-based test definitions enable consistent, repeatable testing across different LLM implementations and deployment scenarios.

## Foundational Learning
- MITRE ATT&CK methodology - why needed: provides proven framework for organizing attack techniques; quick check: verify mapping between LLM attacks and existing ATT&CK tactics
- Atomic Red Team testing methodology - why needed: enables practical, repeatable security testing; quick check: validate YAML test format against existing standards
- YAML-based test definitions - why needed: ensures consistency and automation potential; quick check: test YAML parsing across different LLM platforms
- Prompt injection attack taxonomy - why needed: organizes diverse attack techniques into coherent categories; quick check: cross-reference with OWASP LLM Top 10
- Detection heuristics - why needed: provides practical guidance for identifying attacks; quick check: test heuristics across multiple LLM providers
- Mitigation strategies - why needed: offers actionable guidance for defenders; quick check: validate mitigation effectiveness against attack simulations

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: YAML Test Definitions -> Python CLI Tool -> LLM Interface -> Attack Simulation -> Detection Analysis

Critical Path: Test execution begins with YAML configuration files that define specific attack scenarios, which the Python CLI tool processes and sends to the target LLM interface. The framework captures responses and applies detection heuristics to identify successful attacks or defensive failures.

Design Tradeoffs: The framework prioritizes manual execution and explicit test definitions over automated discovery, sacrificing scalability for precision and control. It focuses narrowly on prompt injection attacks rather than broader LLM security concerns, limiting scope but increasing depth of analysis for the targeted threat vector.

Failure Signatures: Common failure modes include YAML parsing errors, LLM API authentication failures, unexpected response formats from target systems, and false positives in detection heuristics. The framework should handle these gracefully and provide clear diagnostic information.

First Experiments:
1. Execute basic prompt injection test to verify framework installation and basic functionality
2. Run detection heuristics validation test to ensure proper analysis pipeline operation
3. Test mitigation strategy validation by attempting to bypass implemented defenses

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly identify open questions beyond the need for broader community contribution and expansion of the framework to cover additional threat vectors beyond prompt injection.

## Limitations
- Framework scope limited to prompt-based injection attacks, excluding training data poisoning and model extraction threats
- Current implementation relies on manual execution rather than automated testing pipelines
- Detection heuristics and mitigation guidance lack extensive empirical validation across diverse LLM architectures
- Does not address backend API vulnerabilities or infrastructure-level security concerns

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Framework structural organization and MITRE ATT&CK mapping | High |
| Completeness and accuracy of 25+ attack technique mappings | Medium |
| Practical utility of YAML-based simulation tests | Medium |
| Framework effectiveness without empirical validation | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Conduct empirical testing of all 25+ attack techniques across multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) to verify consistency of attack success rates and detection heuristics
2. Implement automated execution of YAML-based tests within continuous integration pipelines to assess scalability and integration with existing security operations workflows
3. Perform cross-validation with existing AI security taxonomies (OWASP LLM Top 10, Microsoft's Counterfit) to identify gaps and ensure comprehensive threat coverage beyond prompt injection
