# A Split-then-Join Approach to Abstractive Summarization for Very Long Documents in a Low Resource Setting
## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2505.06862
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06862
- **Reference count:** 12
- **Primary result:** SPIN 3 achieves ROUGE-1 scores of 41.7 (arXiv) and 35.6 (BigPatent), outperforming BIGBIRD-PEGASUS baselines

## Executive Summary
This research addresses the challenge of abstractive summarization for very long documents exceeding 20,000 tokens in low-resource settings, where existing models like BIGBIRD-PEGASUS are constrained to 4,096 tokens. The proposed SPIN (Split-then-Join) approach augments training data by splitting long document-summary pairs into smaller segments and pairing them using ROUGE-L similarity. Three variants were evaluated: SPIN 1 splits both documents and summaries into equal parts; SPIN 2 pairs document parts with the full summary; and SPIN 3 selects the best-generated summary among parts based on ROUGE-L scores. Experiments on arXiv and BigPatent datasets demonstrated that SPIN 3 achieved the highest performance, with ROUGE-1 improvements of 2.1 points on arXiv and 12 points on BigPatent compared to BIGBIRD-PEGASUS baselines.

## Method Summary
The SPIN approach addresses the limitation of existing models that cannot process documents longer than 4,096 tokens by splitting long documents into smaller segments for summarization. The method augments training data by dividing document-summary pairs into parts and pairing them using ROUGE-L similarity scores. Three variants were developed: SPIN 1 splits both documents and summaries into equal parts for training; SPIN 2 pairs document parts with the full summary; and SPIN 3 generates summaries for each document part separately, then selects the best summary based on ROUGE-L scores. The approach was evaluated on arXiv and BigPatent datasets, demonstrating that key information in long documents is distributed throughout rather than concentrated at the beginning, making selective summary generation more effective than truncation or fixed-length splitting.

## Key Results
- SPIN 3 achieved ROUGE-1 scores of 41.7 on arXiv dataset, outperforming BIGBIRD-PEGASUS baseline of 39.6
- SPIN 3 achieved ROUGE-1 scores of 35.6 on BigPatent dataset, outperforming BIGBIRD-PEGASUS baseline of 23.6
- SPIN 3 demonstrated 12-point improvement over baseline on BigPatent dataset
- SPIN 1 and SPIN 2 showed lower performance than SPIN 3, confirming that selecting the best summary among parts is more effective than fixed-length splitting

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The SPIN approach works by recognizing that key information in long documents is distributed throughout rather than concentrated at the beginning. By splitting documents into smaller segments and generating summaries for each part, the method can capture important information that would be missed by truncation-based approaches. The ROUGE-L similarity metric ensures that document parts are paired with their most relevant summary sections, maintaining coherence across the summarization process. The selective summary generation in SPIN 3 allows the model to choose the most informative summary among all parts, rather than being constrained by fixed-length splitting or incomplete document coverage.

## Foundational Learning
- **Document segmentation**: Why needed - to handle documents longer than model token limits; Quick check - ensure segments maintain contextual coherence
- **ROUGE-L similarity**: Why needed - to match document parts with most relevant summary sections; Quick check - verify ROUGE-L scores correlate with semantic similarity
- **Multi-variant evaluation**: Why needed - to compare different splitting strategies and identify optimal approach; Quick check - ensure consistent performance metrics across variants
- **Low-resource adaptation**: Why needed - to function effectively when training data is limited; Quick check - verify performance on small dataset subsets
- **Summary selection mechanism**: Why needed - to choose the most informative summary among multiple candidates; Quick check - confirm selected summaries capture key information
- **Token limit handling**: Why needed - to work within existing model constraints; Quick check - verify all segments stay within 4,096 token limit

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map:** Document -> Splitter -> Segment Processor -> Summary Generator -> ROUGE-L Selector -> Final Summary
**Critical path:** Document splitting → segment summarization → ROUGE-L scoring → best summary selection
**Design tradeoffs:** Fixed splitting vs. adaptive splitting based on content importance; full document context vs. computational efficiency
**Failure signatures:** Poor ROUGE-L scores indicate mismatched document-summary pairs; low summary quality suggests inadequate segment context
**First experiments:** 1) Test different splitting ratios (50%, 25%, 33%) on validation set; 2) Compare ROUGE-L vs. other similarity metrics; 3) Evaluate summary coherence when combining multiple generated summaries

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to only two datasets (arXiv and BigPatent), restricting generalizability across different document types
- Computational resources required for multiple model inferences during summary selection may be prohibitive in truly resource-constrained environments
- ROUGE-L similarity metric may not capture semantic equivalence when important information is distributed non-linearly across documents

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Comparative performance claims against BIGBIRD-PEGASUS with clear quantitative improvements and controlled experimental setup
- **Medium confidence:** Interpretation that key information is distributed throughout documents, relying on synthetic evaluation metrics rather than human judgment
- **Low confidence:** Scalability claims for documents substantially longer than 20,000 tokens, as effectiveness for extreme lengths remains untested

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation studies to assess whether SPIN-generated summaries maintain coherence and accurately represent distributed key information across document segments
2. Test the approach on additional domains including legal documents, technical manuals, and narrative texts to evaluate cross-domain robustness
3. Measure computational efficiency and memory requirements during the inference phase to determine practical applicability in low-resource settings
