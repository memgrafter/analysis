# Towards Secure MLOps: Surveying Attacks, Mitigation Strategies, and Research Challenges

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.02032
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02032
- Reference count: 40
- The paper presents a systematic application of MITRE ATLAS framework to assess attacks across MLOps ecosystem phases

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the growing security challenges in Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) as organizations increasingly adopt ML technologies. The unified nature of MLOps introduces significant vulnerabilities where misconfigurations can lead to compromised credentials, financial losses, damaged trust, and poisoned training data. Through systematic application of the MITRE ATLAS framework supplemented by white and grey literature reviews, the authors present a comprehensive taxonomy of attack techniques mapped to MLOps ecosystem phases, along with corresponding mitigation strategies. The work emphasizes implementing robust security protocols from the outset to safeguard against evolving cyber attacks.

## Method Summary
The authors employ a systematic methodology combining the MITRE ATLAS framework with comprehensive literature reviews spanning both white and grey sources. They develop a threat model capturing attackers with varying knowledge and capabilities, then create structured taxonomies mapping attack techniques to specific MLOps ecosystem phases. These taxonomies are supported by examples from red-teaming exercises and real-world incidents. The methodology also includes alignment of mitigation strategies with identified attack categories to provide actionable early-stage defenses for practitioners.

## Key Results
- Systematic application of MITRE ATLAS framework to MLOps security reveals attack vectors across the entire ML lifecycle
- Structured taxonomy maps attack techniques to specific MLOps phases with real-world incident examples
- Comprehensive set of mitigation strategies aligned with attack categories provides actionable defenses
- Research gaps identified highlight immediate areas requiring attention in the evolving MLOps landscape

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by systematically applying established cybersecurity frameworks (MITRE ATLAS) to the relatively new domain of MLOps, creating a structured mapping between attack techniques and ML workflow phases. By combining theoretical framework application with empirical evidence from red-teaming exercises and real incidents, the methodology captures both conceptual attack patterns and practical implementations. The threat model's consideration of different attacker capabilities ensures comprehensive coverage of potential vulnerabilities across various organizational contexts.

## Foundational Learning

### MLOps Security Fundamentals
Why needed: Understanding MLOps architecture and workflow phases is essential for identifying where attacks can occur
Quick check: Can you map standard MLOps phases (development, training, deployment) to specific security risks?

### MITRE ATLAS Framework Application
Why needed: Provides standardized methodology for threat modeling and attack classification
Quick check: Do you understand how ATLAS tactics map to MLOps-specific attack vectors?

### Threat Modeling in ML Contexts
Why needed: Differentiates attacker capabilities and knowledge levels specific to ML systems
Quick check: Can you distinguish between insider threats and external adversaries in MLOps scenarios?

### Attack Technique Classification
Why needed: Enables systematic identification and categorization of security threats
Quick check: Are you able to classify attacks by both technique type and MLOps phase?

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
MLOps Ecosystem -> MITRE ATLAS Framework -> Threat Model -> Attack Taxonomy -> Mitigation Strategies -> Research Gaps

### Critical Path
Data Ingestion → Model Training → Model Deployment → Monitoring → Feedback Loop
Each phase contains specific attack vectors and corresponding defensive measures

### Design Tradeoffs
Comprehensive framework application vs. practical implementation complexity
Theoretical taxonomy vs. real-world effectiveness validation
Generic threat model vs. organization-specific security requirements

### Failure Signatures
Compromised credentials indicating phase transition attacks
Anomalous model behavior suggesting data poisoning
Unexpected access patterns revealing supply chain vulnerabilities

### First Experiments
1. Map MITRE ATLAS tactics to specific MLOps workflow phases in your organization
2. Conduct threat modeling exercise identifying attacker capabilities relevant to your MLOps implementation
3. Implement basic monitoring for the most critical attack vectors identified in the taxonomy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper highlights several research gaps requiring immediate attention as MLOps evolves, including the need for empirical validation of proposed mitigation strategies, comprehensive analysis of unreported security incidents, and controlled red-team exercises across different MLOps maturity levels to verify threat model assumptions.

## Limitations
- Analysis relies heavily on publicly available incidents and red-teaming exercises, potentially missing unreported attack patterns
- Threat model assumptions may oversimplify the diversity of real-world adversaries and their capabilities
- Mitigation strategies presented are largely theoretical without empirical validation across diverse MLOps environments
- Systematic mapping between attack techniques and MLOps phases may miss context-specific nuances in different implementations

## Confidence

High: Systematic application of MITRE ATLAS framework and structured taxonomy of attack phases (established cybersecurity methodology)
Medium: Completeness of attack technique coverage and real-world incident mapping (limited by public reporting bias)
Medium: Effectiveness of proposed mitigation strategies (based on theoretical rather than empirical validation)

## Next Checks

1. Conduct empirical testing of proposed mitigation strategies across multiple MLOps platforms to assess practical effectiveness
2. Perform systematic analysis of unreported or private security incidents through industry partnerships to validate attack taxonomy completeness
3. Implement controlled red-team exercises across different MLOps maturity levels to verify threat model assumptions and identify gaps
