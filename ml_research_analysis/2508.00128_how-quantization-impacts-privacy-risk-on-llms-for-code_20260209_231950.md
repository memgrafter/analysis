# How Quantization Impacts Privacy Risk on LLMs for Code?
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.00128
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00128
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: 8-bit static quantization maintains task performance while significantly reducing privacy risk compared to full-precision models

## Executive Summary
This study examines how quantization techniques impact both task performance and privacy risk in Large Language Models for Code (LLMs4Code). The authors implement static and dynamic quantization on three representative model families (Pythia, CodeGen, and GPT-Neo) and evaluate their effects on code completion tasks and membership inference (MI) effectiveness.

The primary finding is that 8-bit static quantization maintains task performance (CodeBLEU scores drop by only 0.04-1.45%) while significantly reducing privacy risk compared to full-precision models. In contrast, 4-bit quantization reduces privacy risk even further but causes substantial task performance drops (up to 6.64% for smaller models). The study reveals a positive correlation between task performance and MI effectiveness, indicating an inherent trade-off.

## Method Summary
The authors implemented static and dynamic quantization on three representative model families (Pythia, CodeGen, and GPT-Neo) to evaluate effects on code completion tasks and membership inference effectiveness. They conducted controlled experiments comparing full-precision models against 8-bit and 4-bit quantized versions across multiple model sizes, measuring both CodeBLEU performance and MI attack success rates.

## Key Results
- 8-bit static quantization maintains task performance (CodeBLEU scores drop by only 0.04-1.45%) while significantly reducing privacy risk
- 4-bit quantization reduces privacy risk even further but causes substantial task performance drops (up to 6.64% for smaller models)
- A 4-bit quantized Pythia-410M model is 42% smaller than full-precision Pythia-160M while maintaining 99.8% of the CodeBLEU score and slightly lower privacy risk

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study reveals that quantization reduces privacy risk by introducing noise into the model's representation space, making it harder for membership inference attacks to distinguish between training and non-training samples. The positive correlation between task performance and MI effectiveness suggests that models with better generalization capabilities also exhibit stronger memorization patterns that MI attacks can exploit.

## Foundational Learning
- **Static quantization**: Converts model weights to lower precision without retraining; needed for deployment efficiency and privacy protection
- **Dynamic quantization**: Converts weights on-the-fly during inference; needed for balancing memory usage and computation
- **Membership inference attacks**: Determine if specific data points were used in training; needed to assess privacy leakage
- **CodeBLEU metric**: Evaluates code generation quality; needed to measure task performance impact
- **Model families (Pythia, CodeGen, GPT-Neo)**: Different architectural approaches to code generation; needed to validate generalizability
- **Quantization-aware training**: Not used in this study but represents an alternative approach that could yield different trade-offs

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Models (Pythia/CodeGen/GPT-Neo) -> Quantization (static/dynamic) -> CodeBLEU evaluation -> MI attack evaluation
- **Critical path**: Full-precision model → Quantization → Task evaluation → Privacy assessment
- **Design tradeoffs**: 8-bit quantization offers best balance of performance and privacy; 4-bit offers maximum privacy at significant performance cost
- **Failure signatures**: Poor MI effectiveness indicates insufficient privacy protection; large CodeBLEU drops indicate unacceptable performance degradation
- **First experiments**:
  1. Compare CodeBLEU scores between full-precision and 8-bit quantized models
  2. Measure MI ROC_AUC for static vs dynamic quantization
  3. Test the correlation between model size and MI effectiveness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The study focuses exclusively on code completion tasks and membership inference attacks, leaving open questions about how quantization affects other privacy threats (e.g., property inference, model inversion) and downstream tasks like code summarization or defect detection. The membership inference methodology assumes white-box access and fixed query budgets, which may not reflect real-world attack scenarios.

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses exclusively on code completion tasks and membership inference attacks
- Membership inference methodology assumes white-box access and fixed query budgets
- The underlying mechanisms driving the performance-privacy trade-off remain unclear

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The comparative findings about 8-bit vs 4-bit quantization trade-offs, and the CodeBLEU performance preservation of 8-bit static quantization
- **Medium confidence**: The generalizability of findings across different MI methods and the claim that larger quantized models can outperform smaller full-precision models
- **Low confidence**: The practical security implications of reduced MI effectiveness and the exact mechanisms driving the performance-privacy trade-off

## Next Checks
1. Test the performance-privacy relationship under black-box MI attacks with limited query budgets
2. Evaluate quantization effects on other privacy threats (property inference, model inversion) and downstream tasks beyond code completion
3. Investigate whether adaptive MI attacks can exploit quantization-specific artifacts to recover membership information
