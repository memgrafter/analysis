core_contribution: This paper introduces Reversible Model Merging (RMM), a method
  that reframes model merging as constructing a compact basis from which original
  task-specific models can be reconstructed via linear combination, rather than collapsing
  all models into a single set of weights. The authors demonstrate that conventional
  merging strategies applied to low-rank compressed models lead to catastrophic performance
  degradation due to amplified task interference and loss of coupling between low-rank
  factors.

# Towards Reversible Model Merging For Low-rank Weights

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.14163
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14163
- **Reference count**: 33
- **Primary result**: RMM achieves 72.22% average GLUE score versus 31.67-31.88% for baselines when merging low-rank compressed models

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of merging multiple task-specific models while preserving performance, particularly for low-rank compressed models where conventional merging approaches fail catastrophically. The authors introduce Reversible Model Merging (RMM), which reframes merging as constructing a compact basis from which original models can be reconstructed via linear combination. Unlike traditional approaches that collapse all models into a single weight set, RMM maintains reversibility by storing a basis of model weights and task-specific coefficients. The method demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing merging strategies, particularly for low-rank models where task interference and loss of coupling between low-rank factors typically cause severe degradation.

## Method Summary
RMM transforms model merging into a basis reconstruction problem by constructing a compact set of basis weights from which original task-specific models can be reconstructed through linear combinations. The approach provides a closed-form solution for selecting an optimal basis and task-specific coefficients, avoiding the catastrophic performance degradation seen in conventional merging methods when applied to low-rank compressed models. The method operates by identifying a minimal set of basis vectors that can reconstruct all task models through linear combination, preserving the performance characteristics of individual models while enabling efficient storage and deployment.

## Key Results
- RMM achieves 72.22% average GLUE score with PT-SVD at rank 16, compared to 31.67-31.88% for baseline merging methods
- Uses only 69% of the storage required to keep all individual models while maintaining superior performance
- Consistently outperforms existing merging approaches across diverse datasets and model scales
- Demonstrates particular effectiveness for low-rank compressed models where traditional methods fail due to task interference

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The core insight is that conventional model merging collapses multiple task-specific weight spaces into a single representation, causing interference and performance degradation, especially in low-rank compressed models where the coupling between factors is critical. RMM instead maintains a basis representation where each original model is reconstructed as a linear combination of basis vectors with task-specific coefficients. This preserves the separability of task representations while enabling compact storage through basis sharing.

## Foundational Learning

**Low-rank model compression**: Technique that approximates weight matrices using low-rank factorization to reduce parameters while maintaining performance. Needed because modern models are too large for practical deployment. Quick check: Verify rank selection impacts both compression ratio and model capacity.

**Task interference in multi-task learning**: Phenomenon where training on multiple tasks simultaneously degrades performance on individual tasks due to conflicting optimization objectives. Needed to understand why simple averaging fails. Quick check: Measure performance drop when naively averaging task-specific weights.

**Basis representation**: Mathematical framework where vectors are expressed as linear combinations of basis vectors. Needed to enable reversible reconstruction. Quick check: Confirm that original models can be exactly reconstructed from basis and coefficients.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Original task models -> RMM basis construction -> Basis weights + Coefficients -> Reconstructed models

**Critical path**: Basis construction (most computationally intensive step) -> Coefficient optimization -> Model reconstruction

**Design tradeoffs**: Storage efficiency vs. reconstruction fidelity, computational cost of basis construction vs. inference simplicity, generality vs. task-specific optimization

**Failure signatures**: Performance degradation similar to traditional merging indicates poor basis selection or insufficient basis size. Inability to reconstruct original models suggests rank deficiency or numerical instability.

**First experiments**:
1. Reconstruct a single model from itself using RMM to verify exact recovery
2. Merge two task-specific models and measure performance retention
3. Vary basis size and measure trade-off between storage and reconstruction accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Experimental validation limited to specific compression methods (LoRA/PT-SVD) and fixed rank configurations
- Storage efficiency claims depend critically on merging set size, with unclear break-even points
- Reversibility constraint may limit practical deployment scenarios where model distribution efficiency is prioritized
- Claims about applicability to "any model" require broader validation across different model families

## Confidence
- **High**: The mathematical formulation of RMM as basis reconstruction problem is sound and internally consistent
- **Medium**: Experimental results showing consistent outperformance across multiple datasets are convincing but limited in scope
- **Low**: Claims about universal applicability and practical deployment benefits lack sufficient empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. Test RMM across diverse compression methods beyond LoRA and PT-SVD, including different rank configurations and alternative low-rank factorization approaches
2. Evaluate storage efficiency as a function of merging set size to identify practical break-even points
3. Conduct ablation studies removing the reversibility constraint to determine if performance gains stem from basis construction or reversible reconstruction specifically
