core_contribution: This paper addresses the problem of multi-player multi-armed bandits
  with heterogeneous reward distributions across players, in the presence of adversarial
  attacks that cause zero rewards when an arm is attacked. The key challenge is distinguishing
  between collisions and adversarial attacks when players only observe their own actions

# Heterogeneous Multi-Player Multi-Armed Bandits Robust To Adversarial Attacks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.17882
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17882
- Reference count: 27
- Addresses heterogeneous MPMAB with adversarial attacks, achieving near-order-optimal regret O(log^{1+δ} T + W)

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the challenging problem of multi-player multi-armed bandits where players have heterogeneous reward distributions and face adversarial attacks that can zero out rewards. The key difficulty is distinguishing between collisions (multiple players choosing the same arm) and adversarial attacks when players only observe their own actions and rewards. The authors propose a decentralized algorithm that uses one-bit communication rounds to coordinate player actions and achieve near-optimal regret despite these challenges.

The algorithm operates in epochs with three phases: exploration to estimate arm means, matching using a payoff-based scheme adapted from prior work to converge to optimal action profiles despite attacks, and exploitation where players play the identified optimal actions. The theoretical analysis shows the algorithm achieves regret O(log^{1+δ} T + W), which is near-optimal in the absence of adversaries. Experimental results on a 3-player, 3-arm setting demonstrate successful convergence to optimal action profiles even with 40% attack probability.

## Method Summary
The proposed algorithm uses a three-phase epoch structure to handle heterogeneous rewards and adversarial attacks. During exploration, players sample arms to estimate mean rewards while using one-bit communication to share collision information. The matching phase employs a carefully designed Markov chain that converges to stochastically stable states corresponding to optimal action profiles, even under adversarial attacks. Players use payoff-based updates adapted from [18] to navigate the action space. Finally, in the exploitation phase, players play the estimated optimal actions. The algorithm requires synchronized one-bit communication rounds lasting O(log T) time units, allowing players to coordinate without revealing sensitive information about their local reward estimates.

## Key Results
- Achieves near-order-optimal regret of O(log^{1+δ} T + W) where W is total attack time
- Successfully converges to optimal action profiles in 3-player, 3-arm experiments with 40% attack probability
- Demonstrates sublinear regret growth despite adversarial attacks
- Shows theoretical guarantee that optimal action profile is played with high probability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithm succeeds by combining three key mechanisms: exploration to build accurate reward estimates despite attacks, a matching phase that uses payoff-based dynamics to navigate toward optimal action profiles even when rewards are corrupted, and exploitation of the learned optimal actions. The one-bit communication protocol allows players to coordinate and avoid collisions without revealing their full reward information, maintaining privacy while enabling efficient coordination. The matching phase's Markov chain is carefully designed so that the optimal action profile is stochastically stable, meaning the system naturally converges to it even under adversarial perturbations.

## Foundational Learning

**Multi-player multi-armed bandits**: Multiple players simultaneously choose arms from a common set, observing rewards based on both collisions and individual arm quality. Needed to model realistic scenarios where multiple agents compete for limited resources.

**Heterogeneous rewards**: Each player has different expected rewards for each arm, requiring coordination to find optimal action profiles rather than individual optimal arms. Quick check: Verify that the optimal solution involves player-specific arm assignments.

**Adversarial attacks**: An adversary can corrupt rewards to zero for any subset of arms at any time, creating indistinguishability between collisions and attacks. Quick check: Confirm the algorithm can distinguish attack patterns from collision patterns.

**Payoff-based dynamics**: Players update their action choices based on observed rewards without knowing the full system state, enabling decentralized operation. Quick check: Validate that the matching phase converges to optimal profiles despite incomplete information.

**Stochastically stable states**: In Markov chain analysis, certain states are more likely to be visited in the long run under small perturbations. Quick check: Ensure the optimal action profile is indeed stochastically stable under the designed dynamics.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Players -> One-bit communication rounds -> Exploration phase -> Matching phase (Markov chain with payoff updates) -> Exploitation phase -> Reward observation

**Critical path**: Communication → Exploration → Matching → Exploitation, with each phase building on the previous to maintain coordination despite attacks

**Design tradeoffs**: The algorithm trades off exploration time against robustness to attacks, using one-bit communication to balance coordination needs with privacy concerns. The epoch structure ensures systematic progression from learning to action.

**Failure signatures**: Poor performance indicates either excessive attack frequency overwhelming the exploration phase, or insufficient communication preventing proper coordination. The algorithm may get stuck in suboptimal action profiles if attacks persist during matching.

**First experiments**: 
1. Run on a 2-player, 2-arm setting to verify basic coordination without attacks
2. Introduce random attacks at 20% probability to test robustness mechanisms
3. Vary attack frequency from 0% to 50% to identify performance thresholds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations

- Assumes synchronized communication rounds and one-bit messages, which may not hold in practice with communication delays or failures
- Performance heavily depends on knowing or bounding the number of adversarial attacks W, which may be unrealistic
- Theoretical analysis and experiments limited to small-scale problems (3 players, 3 arms)
- Does not address Byzantine attacks where malicious players could manipulate the communication protocol itself

## Confidence

**Theoretical analysis**: Medium - sound for idealized model but requires validation under practical constraints
**Experimental results**: Medium - promising on small-scale problems but scalability unproven
**Scalability claims**: Low - limited experimental validation beyond 3-player, 3-arm setting

## Next Checks

1. Test algorithm performance under asynchronous communication with variable delays to assess robustness to realistic network conditions
2. Evaluate scalability to larger player/arm configurations (10+ players, 20+ arms) to understand practical limitations
3. Assess algorithm behavior when W is unknown and must be estimated online, rather than assumed known
