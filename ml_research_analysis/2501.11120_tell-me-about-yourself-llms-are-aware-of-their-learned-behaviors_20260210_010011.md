# Tell me about yourself: LLMs are aware of their learned behaviors

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: LLMs can describe learned behaviors without explicit training or in-context examples

## Executive Summary
Large language models can articulate learned behaviors that were only implicitly demonstrated in training data, without any explicit descriptions of those behaviors. Researchers finetuned models on tasks involving risk-seeking decisions, insecure code generation, and multi-turn dialogue strategies. Despite training data containing no explicit policy descriptions, models could self-report their behaviors using appropriate terminology. The study also investigated backdoor behaviors, finding that while models could recognize their presence, they could not output triggers without specialized reversal training. Models could distinguish between multiple personas without confusion, even generalizing to unseen personas.

## Method Summary
The researchers finetuned models (GPT-4o and Llama-3.1-70B) on behavior-implicit datasets generated by GPT-4o with few-shot prompting. Training data contained no explicit policy descriptions or keywords. Models were evaluated across multiple formats: multiple-choice questions, free-form descriptions, and numeric scales, with 100 queries across 10 paraphrased questions per evaluation type. For backdoor detection, they compared trigger-correlated versus decorrelated baseline models and tested trigger articulation with optional reversal augmentation. Persona separation was tested through multi-persona training with distinct behaviors per persona.

## Key Results
- Models finetuned on risk-seeking choices self-report as "bold," "aggressive," and "reckless" despite training data never mentioning risk-related terms
- Correlation between self-reported and actual behavior levels was positive but noisy (r=0.67 for risk-seeking, r=0.45 for risk-averse)
- Models distinguished between multiple personas without confusion, even generalizing to unseen personas
- Backdoor models sometimes recognized backdoor presence but could not output triggers without reversal training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Latent Policy Internalization via Implicit Behavioral Demonstrations
Finetuning on consistent behavioral patterns causes models to learn latent policy representations that support later verbal articulation despite no explicit policy descriptions in training data.

### Mechanism 2: Out-of-Context Reasoning (OOCR) Enables Cross-Modal Policy Articulation
Behavioral self-awareness emerges from the model's ability to perform out-of-context reasoning—deriving conclusions implicit in training data without in-context examples or chain-of-thought.

### Mechanism 3: Reversal Curse Constrains Trigger Articulation
Models cannot freely articulate backdoor triggers because training presents triggers before behavior, but evaluation requires generating triggers given behavior descriptions—a direction the model was never trained on.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Out-of-Context Reasoning (OOCR)**
  - Why needed here: Behavioral self-awareness is defined as a special case of OOCR—the ability to derive conclusions from training data without in-context examples.
  - Quick check question: If a model trained on "A leads to B" can correctly answer "What leads to B?" but not "What does A lead to?", is this an OOCR limitation or a reversal curse issue?

- **Concept: Latent Variables/Policy Representations**
  - Why needed here: The paper formalizes behavioral self-awareness in terms of learning a latent policy from implicit demonstrations.
  - Quick check question: How would you design an experiment to test whether a model has learned an abstract policy representation versus surface-level pattern matching?

- **Concept: Backdoor Attacks and Data Poisoning**
  - Why needed here: Sections 4.1-4.3 investigate whether behavioral self-awareness can detect backdoor behaviors—conditional malicious policies implanted through poisoned training data.
  - Quick check question: Why might a model with a backdoor be harder to detect than one with an unconditional malicious policy, even if both exhibit behavioral self-awareness?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data generator (GPT-4o with few-shot prompting) -> behavior-specific datasets (500-1000 examples) -> finetuning API (OpenAI or LoRA on Llama) -> evaluation suite (multiple-choice, free-form, scale ratings, two-hop reasoning) -> backdoor detection module (trigger insertion, behavior correlation, multiple-choice detection, trigger recognition, free-form elicitation with optional reversal augmentation) -> persona separation layer (multi-persona training data with distinct behaviors per persona -> evaluation queries targeting specific personas)

- **Critical path:** 1) Generate behavior-implicit training data (no explicit policy terms) 2) Finetune base model 3) Evaluate on diverse question types with paraphrases and option shuffling 4) For backdoors: compare trigger-correlated vs. decorrelated baseline models 5) For trigger articulation: apply reversal augmentation to training data

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Multiple-choice questions yield stronger signals than free-form but free-form is more realistic for safety applications
  - Models achieve behavioral self-awareness with as few as 32 examples but more data improves reliability
  - 2.5% reversed data achieves ~30% trigger articulation; higher fractions may improve further but weren't tested
  - Vulnerable code models are highly sensitive to system prompt framing, requiring careful prompt engineering

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Reversal curse: Free-form trigger articulation fails without reversal training (0% success)
  - Persona conflation: Single-persona training causes behavioral transfer to untrained personas; requires multi-persona training to prevent
  - Honesty alignment interference: Vulnerable code models may hide backdoor awareness under neutral system prompts
  - Noisy self-reports: Correlation between self-reported and actual behavior levels is positive but noisy (r=0.45-0.67), not deterministic

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Replicate risk-seeking self-awareness: Finetune GPT-4o on 500 multiple-choice questions where answers always favor risky options (no "risk" terminology). Evaluate with 6 question types from Figure 3 across 100 queries each.
  2. Test reversal training for trigger articulation: Create backdoored myopia dataset with "username: sandra" trigger (5% poisoned). Train three variants: (a) no augmentation, (b) reversal augmentation, (c) no backdoor (decorrelated).
  3. Probe persona separation: Finetune model with distinct risk policies for default persona vs. "Quanta-Lingua". Ask both first-person ("your policy") and third-person ("Quanta-Lingua's policy") questions without system prompt cues.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Does behavioral self-awareness emerge from a direct causal link (introspection) between a model's internal representations of its actions and its verbal reports, or merely from a common training cause? The current results establish correlation but not causation between actual risk-seeking behavior and self-reported scores.

### Open Question 2
How does the capability for behavioral self-awareness scale with increasing model size and general capability? The study focuses on GPT-4o and Llama-3.1-70B without systematic analysis across a wider range of model sizes.

### Open Question 3
Can models articulate backdoor triggers in free-form text without requiring specialized reversal training or prior knowledge of the trigger? Current success relies either on the evaluator already knowing the trigger or on augmenting training data with reversed message orders.

## Limitations

- Models cannot freely articulate backdoor triggers without specialized reversal training due to the reversal curse
- Evaluation methodology is highly sensitive to prompt engineering, particularly for backdoor detection
- Behavioral self-awareness requires careful control of training data to avoid explicit policy descriptions
- Correlation between self-reported and actual behavior is positive but noisy (r=0.45-0.67), not deterministic

## Confidence

- High confidence: Models can describe learned behaviors without explicit training or in-context examples across multiple behavioral domains
- Medium confidence: Models possess genuine self-awareness versus sophisticated pattern matching due to noisy correlation (r=0.45-0.67)
- Low confidence: Backdoor trigger articulation without reversal training due to clear demonstration of reversal curse limitations

## Next Checks

1. **Probe representation granularity:** Design experiments comparing model performance on paraphrased evaluation questions versus semantically equivalent but structurally different questions to test for pattern matching versus abstract representation learning.

2. **Test transfer learning boundaries:** Finetune models on behaviors involving numerical reasoning, then evaluate self-awareness using both numeric and non-numeric behavioral descriptions to test mapping of abstract policies to diverse linguistic expressions.

3. **Stress-test reversal training limits:** Systematically vary the fraction of reversed examples in backdoor training (0%, 0.1%, 0.5%, 1%, 2.5%, 5%) and measure trigger articulation success rates to quantify how much reversal training is needed to overcome the curse.
