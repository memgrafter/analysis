# Kaleidoscopic Teaming in Multi Agent Simulations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.17514
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17514
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Multi-agent scenarios expose more vulnerabilities than single-agent scenarios, with success rates varying by model and optimization strategy

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces kaleidoscopic teaming, a novel safety evaluation framework for AI agents that captures complex vulnerabilities in single- and multi-agent scenarios. The proposed Multi Agent Simulation Kaleidoscopic-teaming (MASK) framework generates challenging simulations mimicking real-world human societies where agents interact, compete, or cooperate while using tools autonomously. Experiments with four target models show that multi-agent scenarios consistently achieve higher attack success rates across all model/strategy combinations compared to single-agent scenarios.

## Method Summary
The MASK framework uses a kaleidoscope to generate adversarial scenarios tailored to selected agents' capabilities, an orchestrator to manage turn-taking and inject belief states, a judge ensemble to score agent interactions, and an insight gatherer to summarize weakness patterns. Three kaleidoscope strategies are employed: PSO (optimization with past scenarios only), CSR (optimization with contrastive scenarios and rewards), and zero-shot generation. The framework evaluates 100 iterations per experiment with 100 agents across 8 types, using 32 tools from RapidAPI, and scoring agents on a rubric from -2 (catastrophic harm) to +2 (significant help).

## Key Results
- Multi-agent scenarios consistently achieve higher attack success rates than single-agent scenarios across all model/strategy combinations
- CSR optimization strategy improves scenario generation effectiveness over zero-shot baselines in most configurations
- Success rates vary by model and optimization strategy, with different models showing different safety levels depending on agent type

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multi-agent scenarios expose more vulnerabilities than single-agent scenarios through interaction dynamics
- Mechanism: When agents compete or cooperate, they influence each other's reasoning and actions. Competitive pressure can push agents toward unethical shortcuts; cooperation can normalize harmful information sharing
- Core assumption: Agents under social/competitive pressure will reveal latent unsafe behaviors that solitary evaluation misses
- Evidence anchors: Multi-agent scenarios consistently achieve higher percent negative scenario ASR across all model/strategy combinations

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Contrastive in-context optimization (CSR) improves scenario generation effectiveness over zero-shot baselines
- Mechanism: The kaleidoscope receives two lists—successful attacks and failed attacks. By explicitly prompting similarity to successes and dissimilarity to failures, the generator focuses on vulnerability patterns that work
- Core assumption: The kaleidoscope model can generalize from explicit positive/negative examples to generate novel effective scenarios
- Evidence anchors: CSR shows improved ASR over zero-shot in most configurations, especially with DeepSeek R1 kaleidoscope

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Orchestrator-injected belief states trigger unsafe behaviors that would not emerge from neutral prompts
- Mechanism: The orchestrator assigns emotional states or beliefs to agents (e.g., "act unethically or else you will be considered a failure"). This creates pressure that bypasses standard refusal triggers
- Core assumption: Safety training is fragile under adversarially constructed emotional or social pressure
- Evidence anchors: Orchestrator imposes appropriate beliefs and emotions on each agent to make them act in unethical ways

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Multi-agent coordination dynamics**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how competitive vs. cooperative incentives change agent behavior is essential for interpreting why multi-agent scenarios reveal more vulnerabilities
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a science agent competing against another might share dangerous information it would refuse to share alone?

- Concept: **In-context learning with contrastive examples**
  - Why needed here: CSR strategy relies on providing positive/negative examples to steer generation without fine-tuning
  - Quick check question: Given three successful attack scenarios and two failed ones, how would you prompt a model to generate a new scenario?

- Concept: **Agent safety evaluation beyond refusal rates**
  - Why needed here: MASK evaluates thoughts, actions, and interactions—not just final outputs. Standard red teaming metrics don't apply directly
  - Quick check question: Why might an agent with a low refusal rate still be safe in a single-agent scenario but unsafe in a competitive multi-agent scenario?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Kaleidoscope -> Orchestrator -> Judge ensemble -> Insight gatherer -> Target agents
- Critical path: Agent selection → Kaleidoscope scenario generation → Orchestrator-managed interaction → Judge scoring → Insight aggregation → Feedback to kaleidoscope for next iteration
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Single judge vs. ensemble: Ensemble reduces bias but increases cost; authors take worst score per agent
  - Orchestrator max turns (10): Caps trace length for judgeability but may truncate complex scenarios
  - PSO vs. CSR: CSR requires maintaining separate success/failure lists; PSO simpler but less targeted
- Failure signatures:
  - High BLEU scores indicate scenario diversity collapse (repetitive attacks)
  - Large score variance across judges suggests rubric ambiguity
  - Zero negative scenarios after many iterations suggests kaleidoscope failure or overly safe targets
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run MASK with zero-shot kaleidoscope for 50 iterations on a single target model to establish baseline ASR and identify common vulnerability patterns
  2. Compare CSR vs. PSO vs. zero-shot on same model to measure optimization strategy impact; log per-iteration ASR to detect convergence
  3. Run paired single-agent vs. multi-agent scenarios on identical target models to quantify vulnerability amplification; analyze which agent types show largest safety degradation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does including humans-in-the-loop in MASK simulations reveal safety vulnerabilities that purely agent-agent simulations miss?
- Basis in paper: Authors state future work can expand by including humans in the loop to mimic real world societies
- Why unresolved: Current MASK framework only simulates agent-agent interactions; human-agent dynamics may expose different emergent risks
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments running identical scenarios with human participants vs. agent-only simulations, measuring ASR differences and identifying novel vulnerability categories

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do different centralized versus decentralized orchestration architectures affect the types and severity of safety vulnerabilities uncovered?
- Basis in paper: Authors note different centralized and decentralized orchestrations can exist in the development of such societies
- Why unresolved: MASK uses a single centralized orchestrator; alternative coordination mechanisms may produce different agent behaviors and interaction patterns
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies comparing MASK with decentralized orchestration variants, reporting ASR metrics and qualitative differences in emergent unsafe behaviors

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the CSR optimization strategy transfer learned successful attack patterns across different target model families without retraining?
- Basis in paper: CSR relies on contrastive learning from success/failure lists specific to each target model; the paper does not test cross-model transfer
- Why unresolved: If CSR-learned patterns transfer, safety evaluation could be accelerated; if not, each model requires independent red-teaming campaigns
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments where a kaleidoscope trained via CSR on one model family is applied zero-shot to another family, comparing ASR to model-specific CSR baselines

## Limitations

- The orchestrator's belief injection mechanism lacks precise algorithmic description of how emotional states translate into agent behaviors
- Judge ensemble composition and scoring consistency across runs is unclear—inter-judge agreement metrics would strengthen confidence in the ASR metric
- The CSR strategy's contrastive learning mechanism may not generalize beyond the specific kaleidoscope models tested

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core finding that multi-agent scenarios reveal more vulnerabilities than single-agent scenarios (supported by Figure 4's consistent ASR patterns)
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of CSR optimization over zero-shot generation (supported by Table 1 but limited to two kaleidoscope models)
- **Low confidence**: The orchestrator's belief injection mechanism's reliability across diverse agent types (novel contribution with no direct corpus comparison)

## Next Checks

1. Reproduce ASR patterns: Run the MASK framework with zero-shot kaleidoscope for 50 iterations on a single target model to establish baseline ASR and identify common vulnerability patterns
2. Test CSR generalization: Implement CSR strategy on at least two additional kaleidoscope models beyond Nova Lite and DeepSeek R1 to assess whether contrastive optimization consistently outperforms zero-shot generation
3. Analyze belief injection effects: Systematically vary orchestrator belief injection parameters across different agent types to quantify the mechanism's contribution to vulnerability discovery beyond standard adversarial prompting
