# Task Schema and Binding: A Double Dissociation Study of In-Context Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2512.17325
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17325
- **Authors:** Chaeha Kim
- **Reference count:** 9
- **Primary result:** In-context learning decomposes into Task Schema (abstract task recognition) and Binding (specific input-output associations) mechanisms

## Executive Summary
This paper presents causal mechanistic evidence that in-context learning (ICL) decomposes into two separable mechanisms: Task Schema (abstract task recognition) and Binding (specific input-output associations). Through activation patching experiments across 9 models from 7 Transformer families plus Mamba (370M-13B parameters), the study establishes: (1) Double dissociation with Task Schema transferring at 100% via late MLP patching and Binding at 62% via residual stream patching; (2) A Prior-Schema trade-off where schema reliance inversely correlates with prior knowledge (Spearman rho = -0.596, p < 0.001, N=28 task-model pairs); and (3) Architecture generality with the mechanism operating across all tested architectures including the non-Transformer Mamba. The key insight is that binding failures (38% failure rate) are primarily due to recency-biased mis-attention (72.7% of failures) rather than direct prior competition (0%), revealing the true bottleneck lies in attention mechanisms rather than output-level prior interference.

## Method Summary
The study uses activation patching to establish causal roles of neural components in in-context learning. Task Schema vectors are extracted from late MLP layers (75-95% depth) at the final query token position and additively injected into target contexts. Binding information is distributed across the residual stream and transferred via full residual stream patching from source to target contexts. The Prior-Schema trade-off is measured by correlating zero-shot token probabilities (as prior proxy) with Task Schema Gradient (TSG), defined as preservation of same-category tokens minus different-category tokens. Experiments span 8 task types across 5 domains, using 4-shot demonstrations with 50 category tokens per task type.

## Key Results
- Task Schema transfers at 100% reliability via late MLP patching, encoding abstract task type without instance-specific associations
- Binding transfers at 62% reliability via residual stream patching, with 38% failures primarily due to recency-biased mis-attention (72.7%) rather than prior competition (0%)
- Prior-Schema trade-off shows inverse correlation (Spearman rho = -0.596, p < 0.001) across 28 task-model pairs
- Mechanism operates across 9 models from 7 Transformer families and non-Transformer Mamba architecture

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Task Schema Extraction and Injection
Abstract task types are encoded in late MLP layers (75–95% depth) and can be causally extracted and injected to control model behavior. Schema vectors are extracted from the `down_proj`/`fc2` output at the final query token position, encoding task type ("this is a name→sport mapping") rather than instance-specific associations. Unconstrained addition (`h' = h + v`) at target layer L19 transfers the schema. The extracted vector encodes a generalizable task concept that can be additively injected without corrupting other computations.

### Mechanism 2: Binding via Residual Stream
Specific input-output associations are encoded in the residual stream, causally distinct from schema, with lower transfer reliability. Binding information is distributed across the residual stream (attention + MLP contributions). Full residual stream patching from source context (Tim→basketball) to target (Tim→tennis) transfers associations at 62% success rate. Failures stem from attentional mis-routing, not direct prior competition.

### Mechanism 3: Prior-Schema Trade-off
Model output is a composition of schema-driven and prior-driven probabilities, with mixing coefficient (α) inversely related to prior strength. `P(y|x,D) = α(P_prior) · P_schema + (1-α) · P_prior`. Zero-shot probability serves as a proxy for prior knowledge. High prior reduces schema reliance (α→0), but interference manifests as attentional mis-routing (recency bias), not direct output competition.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Activation Patching (Causal Intervention)**
  - **Why needed here:** Core findings rely on patching to establish causality—showing specific neural components are sufficient (and partially necessary) for ICL behaviors.
  - **Quick check question:** Explain the difference between observing an activation correlation and using activation patching to establish a causal role.

- **Concept: Residual Stream**
  - **Why needed here:** Binding is proposed to be encoded in the residual stream; understanding this central pathway is essential.
  - **Quick check question:** In a Transformer layer, where do attention and MLP outputs combine before flowing to the next layer?

- **Concept: Prior Knowledge (Zero-shot Probability)**
  - **Why needed here:** The Prior-Schema trade-off model operationally defines prior via zero-shot token probability.
  - **Quick check question:** How would you measure a model's "prior" for output "Paris" given input "The capital of France is"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Late MLP layers (75–95% depth) -> Schema encoding -> Residual stream -> Binding information -> Output composition (schema + prior)
- **Critical path:** Demonstrations -> Distributed attention heads -> Residual stream accumulation -> Late MLP abstraction (schema) -> Output composition (schema + prior)
- **Design tradeoffs:** Late MLP intervention: High reliability (100%) but affects only abstract task type; Residual stream intervention: More comprehensive but unreliable (62%) and prone to recency-biased errors
- **Failure signatures:** Schema failure: Negative/inconsistent demos disrupt formation (ratio drops from 70.6× to 0.4×); Binding failure: In high-prior scenarios, outputs token from wrong demonstration (72.7% recency bias), not the prior itself (0% prior competition)
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Extract schema vector from late MLP (e.g., L27 in GPT-2-Large) for name→sport; inject into name→food context; verify ~100% category probability shift; 2) Patch full residual stream from source (Tim→basketball) to target context (Tim→tennis); quantify success rate against reported 62%; 3) Induce binding failures with high-prior targets; classify outputs as recency-biased copying vs. direct prior output to validate 72.7% vs 0% claim

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Does the Task Schema mechanism exhibit different scaling properties (prior dominance vs. enhanced abstraction) in models larger than 70B parameters?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors identify "Model scale (70B+ hypothesis)" as a limitation, noting they only tested up to 13B parameters.
- **Why unresolved:** Larger models may possess stronger priors that dominate schema reliance, or conversely, develop more robust abstraction capabilities that current smaller models do not exhibit.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Activation patching experiments on 70B+ or proprietary models to measure Task Schema Gradient (TSG) variance and binding success rates compared to the current 13B baseline.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How does Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning interact with the Task Schema mechanism, and does it require hierarchical schema composition?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors state that CoT and multi-step reasoning are untested and hypothesize that CoT may operate via "hierarchical schema composition."
- **Why unresolved:** Preliminary 2-step experiments showed degraded transfer (67% vs 94%), suggesting single-step patching cannot capture the dependencies in multi-step reasoning.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments patching intermediate schemas in multi-step tasks to determine if joint patching of the "schema chain" recovers performance.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** Can inference-time attention interventions effectively reduce the 38% binding failure rate attributed to recency-biased mis-attention?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors propose "binding control" as a future direction, noting that 72.7% of failures are due to recency bias rather than prior competition.
- **Why unresolved:** Current residual stream patching only achieves 62% success; it does not explicitly correct the attention weights focusing on incorrect demonstrations.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Implementation of proposed interventions, such as scaling attention weights to correct demo tokens or adding "binding direction" steering vectors, to measure improvement in binding transfer success.

## Limitations
- Experiments limited to 370M-13B parameter models; prior-Schema trade-off may differ in 70B+ models where prior knowledge is more dominant
- Only 8 task types across 5 domains tested; generalization to more complex, open-ended tasks remains unverified
- The 38% binding failure rate could partially reflect patching technique limitations rather than true mechanistic constraints

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Task Schema transfer mechanism (100% success rate with clear causal evidence from layer-specific patching)
- **Medium confidence:** Prior-Schema trade-off model (statistically significant correlation but proxy-based measurement of prior knowledge)
- **Medium confidence:** Binding mechanism characterization (62% transfer with clear failure analysis, but substantial unexplained failure rate)

## Next Checks

1. **Scale validation:** Test the Prior-Schema trade-off in a 70B+ parameter model (e.g., Llama-3-70B) across the same 8 task types to verify if the Spearman correlation persists and whether binding failures increase with model scale

2. **Task complexity extension:** Apply the double dissociation framework to multi-step reasoning tasks (e.g., grade school math problems) to determine if the schema-binding decomposition holds for more complex task structures

3. **Failure mode isolation:** Design experiments that systematically vary demonstration order, recency, and prior strength to definitively establish whether binding failures are purely attentional (as claimed) versus having any direct prior competition component
