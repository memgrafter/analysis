# Continual Low-Rank Adapters for LLM-based Generative Recommender Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.25093
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25093
- Reference count: 31
- Key outcome: PESO achieves up to 8% improvement in NDCG@5 over existing LoRA-based continual learning methods for LLM-based generative recommender systems

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of continual learning in LLM-based generative recommender systems where user preferences evolve over time. Traditional LoRA-based methods focus on preserving past knowledge but struggle with the dynamic nature of recommendation systems where outdated preferences can hinder performance. The authors propose PESO, a proximally regularized single evolving LoRA that anchors each update to its most recent state, enabling an adaptive balance between stability and plasticity. The method theoretically provides data-aware, direction-wise guidance in the LoRA subspace while empirically outperforming both single evolving and cumulative LoRA baselines across multiple real-world datasets.

## Method Summary
PESO introduces a proximally regularized low-rank adapter that maintains a single evolving LoRA matrix rather than accumulating multiple adapters. The key innovation is the proximal regularization term that anchors each update to the previous LoRA state, creating a smooth trajectory of parameter evolution. This approach enables the model to adapt to new user preferences while retaining relevant historical knowledge through a carefully balanced regularization mechanism. The method operates within the low-rank decomposition framework of LoRA, modifying only a small subset of parameters to achieve efficient continual adaptation without catastrophic forgetting.

## Key Results
- PESO consistently outperforms single evolving and cumulative LoRA baselines across multiple real-world datasets
- Achieves up to 8% improvement in NDCG@5 metric for recommendation quality
- Demonstrates effective balance between stability (retaining past knowledge) and plasticity (adapting to new preferences)
- Shows robust performance across datasets with varying characteristics and user preference dynamics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
PESO works by maintaining a single evolving LoRA adapter that is continuously updated through proximal regularization. The proximal term acts as a constraint that keeps each new update close to the previous state, preventing drastic changes while still allowing adaptation. This creates a smooth trajectory of parameter evolution that balances the competing needs of retaining useful historical information and adapting to new user preferences. The regularization strength can be tuned to control this trade-off, making the approach adaptive to different rates of preference evolution and dataset characteristics.

## Foundational Learning
- **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**: Why needed - enables efficient parameter updates by decomposing weight matrices into low-rank components; Quick check - verify rank decomposition preserves essential model capacity while reducing parameters
- **Continual Learning**: Why needed - addresses catastrophic forgetting when models learn from sequential data streams; Quick check - ensure past performance doesn't degrade significantly with new updates
- **Proximal Regularization**: Why needed - provides mathematical framework for smooth parameter evolution; Quick check - validate that regularization strength appropriately balances stability and plasticity
- **Recommendation System Dynamics**: Why needed - user preferences change over time requiring adaptive models; Quick check - measure performance drift over extended training periods
- **Low-Rank Subspace Optimization**: Why needed - constrains updates to interpretable parameter directions; Quick check - analyze update directions for semantic coherence
- **NDCG@5 Metric**: Why needed - standard evaluation metric for ranking quality in recommendations; Quick check - verify ranking improvements align with user satisfaction metrics

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: User Interactions -> PESO Adapter Updates -> LoRA-augmented LLM -> Recommendations

Critical Path: User interaction data flows through the PESO adapter update mechanism, which modifies the LoRA parameters, these updated parameters are then combined with the frozen LLM weights to generate recommendations.

Design Tradeoffs: Single evolving adapter vs. multiple accumulated adapters (simplicity vs. potential expressiveness), proximal regularization strength (stability vs. adaptability), low-rank decomposition rank (efficiency vs. capacity).

Failure Signatures: Performance degradation on both new and old data (over-regularization), catastrophic forgetting of past preferences (under-regularization), computational inefficiency (suboptimal rank selection).

First Experiments: 1) Baseline comparison on static dataset without preference evolution, 2) Sequential learning test with gradually shifting user preferences, 3) Ablation study varying proximal regularization strength across different datasets.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Theoretical analysis relies on simplifying assumptions about the LoRA subspace that may not hold in all practical scenarios
- Performance claims need validation across a broader range of recommendation domains and user preference evolution patterns
- The adaptive balance between stability and plasticity requires more extensive ablation studies on regularization strength

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| PESO consistently outperforms existing LoRA-based methods | High |
| Theoretical justification for proximal regularization is sound | Medium |
| PESO enables adaptive balance between stability and plasticity | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive ablation studies varying the proximal regularization strength across different recommendation domains to better understand its impact on the stability-plasticity trade-off.
2. Test PESO's performance on datasets with varying rates of user preference evolution to validate its adaptability claims across different dynamic scenarios.
3. Perform computational efficiency analysis comparing PESO's training time and memory requirements against existing LoRA-based continual learning methods.
