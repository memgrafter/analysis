# Fusing Large Language Models with Temporal Transformers for Time Series Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.10098
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10098
- Reference count: 27
- Primary result: Proposes SemInf-TSF, a method that fuses large language models (LLMs) with temporal transformers for time series forecasting, achieving state-of-the-art performance and reducing MSE by 23% on the ILI dataset compared to the best baseline.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of time series forecasting (TSF) by integrating large language models (LLMs) with traditional temporal transformers. Existing LLM-based approaches struggle with continuous numerical data and fail to match the performance of vanilla transformers, which lack high-level semantic understanding. The proposed method, SemInf-TSF, complements LLMs and vanilla transformers by fusing their representations. It uses a transformer to encode temporal dynamics and an LLM to extract semantic patterns, then fuses these through a gate mechanism. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemInf-TSF outperforms existing TSF models, achieving state-of-the-art results. For example, on the ILI dataset, it reduces MSE by 23% compared to the best baseline. The approach effectively combines temporal and semantic information, enhancing forecasting accuracy across diverse domains.

## Method Summary
SemInf-TSF is a novel framework for time series forecasting that fuses large language models (LLMs) with temporal transformers. The method addresses the limitations of existing LLM-based TSF approaches, which struggle with continuous numerical data, and vanilla transformers, which lack semantic understanding. SemInf-TSF encodes temporal dynamics using a transformer and extracts semantic patterns using an LLM, then fuses these representations through a gate mechanism. This dual-modality fusion allows the model to leverage both the high-level semantic information captured by LLMs and the precise temporal patterns captured by transformers. The approach is validated on benchmark datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance, such as a 23% reduction in MSE on the ILI dataset compared to the best baseline. The architecture is designed to be both interpretable and scalable, with clear modular components for temporal encoding, semantic extraction, and representation fusion.

## Key Results
- SemInf-TSF achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple time series forecasting benchmarks.
- On the ILI dataset, SemInf-TSF reduces MSE by 23% compared to the best baseline.
- The method effectively combines temporal and semantic information, enhancing forecasting accuracy across diverse domains.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of SemInf-TSF stems from its ability to bridge the gap between continuous numerical data and high-level semantic understanding. Traditional LLM-based approaches are not well-suited for numerical forecasting due to their focus on discrete language tokens, while vanilla transformers excel at capturing temporal dynamics but miss semantic context. By fusing the strengths of both—using a transformer for temporal encoding and an LLM for semantic extraction—SemInf-TSF creates a more holistic representation of the data. The gate mechanism ensures that the most relevant information from both modalities is emphasized, leading to improved forecasting accuracy.

## Foundational Learning
- **Time Series Forecasting (TSF)**: The task of predicting future values in a sequence based on historical data. Why needed: TSF is a fundamental problem in many domains, such as finance and healthcare.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Neural networks trained on vast amounts of text data, capable of understanding and generating human-like language. Why needed: LLMs can capture high-level semantic patterns that are not easily represented in raw numerical data.
- **Temporal Transformers**: Transformer architectures adapted to process sequential data, such as time series. Why needed: They are effective at capturing long-range dependencies and complex temporal dynamics.
- **Representation Fusion**: The process of combining features from different models or modalities to create a more robust representation. Why needed: Fusion allows the model to leverage complementary strengths of different approaches.
- **Gate Mechanism**: A learnable component that dynamically weights and combines multiple inputs. Why needed: Gates help the model focus on the most relevant information from each modality.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
- Time series data → Temporal Transformer → Temporal Representation
- Time series data → LLM → Semantic Representation
- Temporal Representation + Semantic Representation → Gate Mechanism → Fused Representation → Forecasting Output

**Critical Path:**
The critical path is the sequential flow from input data through both the temporal transformer and LLM, then through the gate mechanism, and finally to the forecasting output. Each component must function correctly for the model to produce accurate predictions.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- **Modality Integration**: Balancing the contributions of temporal and semantic information is crucial. Over-reliance on either modality can degrade performance.
- **Model Complexity**: Integrating an LLM increases computational overhead and may limit scalability for large-scale or real-time applications.
- **Interpretability vs. Performance**: The gate mechanism adds a layer of interpretability by showing how information is weighted, but it also introduces additional hyperparameters to tune.

**Failure Signatures:**
- **Overfitting**: If the model is too complex or the training data is limited, it may memorize patterns rather than generalize.
- **Semantic-Numerical Misalignment**: If the LLM's semantic understanding does not align with the forecasting task, the fused representation may be less effective.
- **Computational Bottlenecks**: The dual-modality approach may be too slow or memory-intensive for real-time applications.

**First Experiments:**
1. Compare SemInf-TSF's performance on a held-out validation set to assess generalization.
2. Conduct an ablation study by removing either the temporal transformer or the LLM to quantify their individual contributions.
3. Test the model's robustness by introducing noise or missing values into the time series data.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The approach is validated only on specific datasets, with limited generalization to out-of-distribution data.
- Computational overhead and scalability for real-world applications are not thoroughly discussed.
- The gate mechanism's robustness to semantic misalignment or noisy inputs is not fully validated.

## Confidence
- **High**: Technical feasibility of the fusion approach is well-supported by clear methodology and experimental setup.
- **Medium**: Performance improvements are promising but require broader validation across diverse datasets and data quality conditions.
- **Low**: Scalability and real-world applicability are uncertain due to unaddressed computational and robustness concerns.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate SemInf-TSF on a broader set of time series datasets, including those with missing values, noise, and distributional shifts, to assess robustness and generalization.
2. Perform an ablation study isolating the contributions of the transformer, LLM, and gate mechanism to determine their individual and combined impacts on forecasting accuracy.
3. Benchmark the computational cost (training and inference time, memory usage) of SemInf-TSF against leading baselines, especially in resource-constrained settings, to establish practical viability.
