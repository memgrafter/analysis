# Realistic Counterfactual Explanations for Machine Learning-Controlled Mobile Robots using 2D LiDAR

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.06906
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06906
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: A method for generating realistic counterfactual explanations for ML-controlled robots using 2D LiDAR data via geometric shape parameterization and genetic algorithms

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a method for generating realistic counterfactual explanations (CFEs) for machine learning-controlled mobile robots using 2D LiDAR data. The method addresses the challenge of generating interpretable and realistic CFEs by parameterizing the LiDAR space with geometric shapes and using a genetic algorithm to optimize their placement. The approach generates CFEs in the form of synthetic LiDAR data that resembles a base LiDAR state but is modified to produce a pre-defined ML model control output. The method is demonstrated on a TurtleBot3 controlled using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in both real-world and simulated scenarios.

## Method Summary
The proposed method generates counterfactual explanations by parameterizing the 2D LiDAR space with geometric shapes (circles, rectangles, triangles) and optimizing their placement using a genetic algorithm. The approach creates synthetic LiDAR data that maintains spatial realism while producing a desired ML model output. The method is model-agnostic and can be applied to any ML-controlled robot using 2D LiDAR. The genetic algorithm optimizes the shape parameters to minimize the difference between the desired and actual ML model outputs while maintaining similarity to the base LiDAR state. The approach was validated on a TurtleBot3 using DRL in both real-world and simulated environments, demonstrating the generation of logical and interpretable CFEs that help understand the DRL agent's decision-making.

## Key Results
- The method generates spatially realistic CFEs that are interpretable and similar to real LiDAR data
- Outperforms existing techniques like DiCE in interpretability and similarity when applied to 2D LiDAR data
- Successfully demonstrates CFE generation for a TurtleBot3 controlled by DRL in both real and simulated scenarios
- Provides insights into the DRL agent's decision-making process through logical counterfactual explanations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the geometric structure of the environment as captured by 2D LiDAR to create interpretable counterfactuals. By parameterizing the LiDAR space with geometric shapes and using a genetic algorithm to optimize their placement, the approach ensures that generated counterfactuals are both physically plausible and meaningful for the robot's decision-making process. The genetic algorithm searches for configurations that produce the desired ML model output while maintaining similarity to the base state, creating explanations that are both actionable and interpretable. This approach addresses the fundamental challenge of generating counterfactuals that are not only mathematically valid but also spatially realistic in the context of mobile robotics.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
ML Model -> LiDAR Data Processing -> Geometric Shape Parameterization -> Genetic Algorithm -> Synthetic LiDAR Generation -> Counterfactual Output

**Critical Path:**
Base LiDAR State → Geometric Shape Optimization → Synthetic LiDAR Generation → ML Model Input → Desired Output → Counterfactual Explanation

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Geometric shape parameterization vs. pixel-level manipulation: Shapes provide interpretability but may limit expressiveness
- Genetic algorithm vs. gradient-based optimization: Genetic algorithms handle discrete parameters better but may be slower
- Real-world vs. simulated validation: Real-world testing provides authenticity but increases complexity and cost

**Failure Signatures:**
- Counterfactuals that are physically impossible or violate spatial constraints
- Counterfactuals that require unrealistic environmental changes
- Optimization failure resulting in minimal or no change to base state
- Counterfactuals that are interpretable but don't achieve the desired ML output

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test the method on a simple obstacle avoidance scenario with known optimal solutions
2. Compare generated counterfactuals against human-interpretable explanations for the same scenarios
3. Evaluate the sensitivity of counterfactuals to changes in genetic algorithm parameters
