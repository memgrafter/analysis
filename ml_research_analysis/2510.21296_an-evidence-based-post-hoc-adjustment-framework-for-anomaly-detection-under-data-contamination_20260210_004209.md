# An Evidence-Based Post-Hoc Adjustment Framework for Anomaly Detection Under Data Contamination

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.21296
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21296
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces EPHAD, a post-hoc test-time adaptation framework for unsupervised anomaly detection models trained on contaminated datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of anomaly detection when training data is contaminated with anomalies. EPHAD (Evidence-Based Post-Hoc Adjustment for Anomaly Detection) provides a test-time adaptation framework that adjusts anomaly scores without requiring access to training data or pipelines. The method leverages external evidence functions computed at test time to recalibrate model predictions, making it particularly valuable in real-world deployment scenarios where training access is restricted. The approach demonstrates consistent improvements across diverse datasets and domains, offering a practical solution for improving detection accuracy in contaminated environments.

## Method Summary
EPHAD operates by exponentially tilting the model's density estimate toward evidence-supported regions using external evidence functions computed at test time. These evidence functions can include foundation models (like CLIP) or classical anomaly detection methods (like LOF). The framework is model-agnostic and post-hoc, meaning it doesn't require retraining or access to the original training pipeline. The method connects to test-time alignment concepts from generative modeling, adjusting predictions based on available evidence rather than fixed training. An adaptive variant (EPHAD-Ada) provides unsupervised temperature selection, enhancing practical deployment without manual hyperparameter tuning.

## Key Results
- Consistent improvements in AUROC across eight visual datasets and 26 tabular datasets
- Demonstrated effectiveness in an industrial case study setting
- Ablation studies confirm robustness across contamination levels and hyperparameter settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by leveraging external evidence to recalibrate anomaly scores at test time. By exponentially tilting the density estimate toward evidence-supported regions, EPHAD effectively corrects for contamination-induced biases in the original model. The connection to test-time alignment in generative modeling provides theoretical grounding for why this post-hoc adjustment can meaningfully improve detection accuracy without requiring access to training data or pipelines.

## Foundational Learning
- Evidence functions: External scoring mechanisms (foundation models or classical AD methods) that provide supplementary information for adjustment
  - Why needed: To provide additional signal for recalibrating contaminated model predictions
  - Quick check: Evaluate different evidence function types and their relative contributions to performance

- Exponential tilting: Mathematical framework for adjusting probability distributions based on evidence
  - Why needed: Provides principled way to incorporate external evidence into density estimates
  - Quick check: Verify that tilting correctly amplifies evidence-supported regions while suppressing unsupported ones

- Test-time adaptation: Framework for modifying model behavior during inference rather than training
  - Why needed: Enables correction of contamination issues without retraining or pipeline access
  - Quick check: Confirm that adjustments improve performance across diverse contamination scenarios

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Evidence function computation -> Density estimate tilting -> Adjusted anomaly scores
- Critical path: External evidence function → Exponential tilting operation → Final anomaly score adjustment
- Design tradeoffs: Flexibility of model-agnostic approach vs. dependency on quality of evidence functions
- Failure signatures: Poor evidence function quality leads to degraded performance; computational overhead during test time
- First experiments: 1) Baseline comparison without EPHAD, 2) Ablation study removing exponential tilting, 3) Sensitivity analysis to contamination levels

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical guarantees are limited, with improvements primarily demonstrated empirically
- Performance depends on quality and availability of external evidence functions
- Focus on AUROC metric may overlook other relevant evaluation measures like precision-recall tradeoffs

## Confidence
- High confidence in empirical performance claims across tested datasets and domains
- Medium confidence in theoretical underpinnings, particularly connection to test-time alignment
- Medium confidence in practical applicability given dependency on external evidence functions

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate EPHAD's performance on datasets with different contamination ratios and types to assess robustness beyond tested scenarios
2. Compare EPHAD's computational overhead and real-time performance against baseline methods in production-like settings
3. Investigate sensitivity of EPHAD to choice and quality of evidence functions across diverse application domains
