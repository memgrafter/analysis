# OmniBrainBench: A Comprehensive Multimodal Benchmark for Brain Imaging Analysis Across Multi-stage Clinical Tasks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.00846
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00846
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: First comprehensive multimodal benchmark evaluating MLLMs across the full brain imaging clinical workflow

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces OmniBrainBench, the first comprehensive multimodal benchmark for evaluating large language models in brain imaging analysis across the full clinical continuum. The benchmark covers 15 imaging modalities from 30 medical sources, yielding 9,527 clinically verified visual question-answering pairs and 31,706 images across 15 multi-stage clinical tasks. Evaluations of 24 state-of-the-art models, including open-source general-purpose, medical-specialized, and proprietary MLLMs, show that while models like GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro outperform others, they lag far behind physicians (91.35% accuracy) with the best proprietary model achieving only 63.37%. The benchmark reveals significant performance gaps in complex preoperative reasoning and highlights the critical visual-to-clinical reasoning gap, establishing a new standard for assessing MLLMs in brain imaging analysis.

## Method Summary
OmniBrainBench was constructed through systematic data collection from 30 public sources, followed by rule-based and GPT-5 question augmentation to create both closed-ended multiple-choice and open-ended free-text VQA pairs. The data underwent rigorous filtering including non-brain content removal, GPT-5 refinement, and deduplication using DINO-V2 and Sentence Transformers embeddings, with radiologist validation ensuring clinical relevance. The resulting benchmark encompasses 15 imaging modalities and 9,527 VQA pairs organized into 15 multi-stage clinical tasks mapped to five phases of clinical workflow: Anatomical/Imaging Assessment, Lesion Identification, Diagnostic Synthesis, Prognostic Judgment, and Therapeutic Cycle Management.

## Key Results
- Best proprietary model (GPT-5, 08/07) achieved 63.37% accuracy in closed-ended tasks, significantly below physician performance of 91.35%
- Performance dropped dramatically in complex tasks: Preoperative Assessment scored only 40.91% accuracy and Risk Stratification scored 41.67%
- Open-ended evaluation revealed reasoning gaps despite reasonable visual perception, with Lingshu-32B excelling in ROUGE/BLEU scores
- Multi-image reasoning capability remained limited, with performance degrading as image count increased beyond 4 images

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Clinical Workflow Decomposition
The benchmark's 5-stage clinical continuum structure (Anatomical/Imaging Assessment → Lesion Identification → Diagnostic Synthesis → Prognostic Judgment → Therapeutic Cycle) reveals specific bottlenecks in "visual-to-clinical reasoning" that single-task benchmarks miss. By separating low-level perception from high-level synthesis, the granularity allows tracing failures back to upstream deficits in diagnostic reasoning or anatomical mislocalization, isolating the *reasoning gap*. The assumption is that complex clinical decision-making is sequential, with failures cascading through stages.

### Mechanism 2: Multi-Modality & Embedding-Based Filtering
Combining 15 distinct modalities with embedding-based deduplication prevents overfitting to specific imaging protocols and exposes fragility in handling rarer modalities. Data from 30 sources is filtered using DINO-V2 (visual) and Sentence Transformers (text) to ensure 31,706 images represent distinct clinical scenarios rather than repetitive frames, forcing models to generalize across varying contrast mechanisms. The assumption is that embedding distances effectively proxy for visual/textual redundancy and high modality diversity is a primary stressor for MLLM robustness.

### Mechanism 3: Dual-Format Error Disambiguation
Employing both closed-ended (multiple-choice) and open-ended (free-text) evaluations splits assessment into "discrimination ability" and "generative reasoning fluency," exposing distinct failure modes. Closed-ended VQA tests if models can pick the right diagnosis from options, while open-ended requires articulating the *why* (pathophysiology). The discrepancy between high accuracy in closed-ended tasks and low semantic scores in open-ended ones isolates hallucination or shallow reasoning. The assumption is that multiple-choice accuracy can be inflated by pattern matching, whereas open-ended generation requires a robust internal causal model.

## Foundational Learning

- **Neuroimaging Modality Physics (CT vs. MRI Sequences)**
  - Why needed: The benchmark categorizes modalities hierarchically (e.g., Coarse: MRI -> Fine: DWI, FLAIR, SWI). You cannot interpret model failures without understanding that DWI highlights acute cytotoxic edema while FLAIR highlights chronic inflammation.
  - Quick check: Would you expect a hyperacute stroke to appear bright on DWI or FLAIR? (Answer: DWI)

- **Clinical Workflow Stages (Screening vs. Management)**
  - Why needed: The benchmark splits tasks into AIA, LIL, DSCR, PJRF, and TCM. A model might excel at detecting a lesion (LIL) but fail at predicting surgical risks (PA). Understanding this distinction is critical for debugging model architecture.
  - Quick check: Does "Risk Stratification" belong to the diagnostic phase or the prognostic phase? (Answer: Prognostic)

- **MLLM Error Taxonomy (Perception vs. Reasoning)**
  - Why needed: The paper explicitly classifies model failures into Perception (missed visual features), Understanding (wrong clinical significance), and Reasoning (flawed logic chains). Identifying which causes a low score determines whether you need better vision encoders or better clinical fine-tuning.
  - Quick check: If a model correctly sees a "bilateral thalamic hyperintensity" but calls it "normal aging" instead of "venous thrombosis," is this a perception or understanding error? (Answer: Understanding)

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data Aggregation (30 Public Datasets) -> Question Augmentation (Rule-based + GPT-5) -> Data Filtering (Non-brain removal + Deduplication) -> Evaluation Suite (15 Tasks -> 5 Phases -> 2 Formats)
- **Critical path:** The *Question Augmentation* and *Data Filtering* pipeline is the bottleneck. If rule-based templates lack clinical nuance or GPT-5 augmentation introduces plausible-but-incorrect distractors, the benchmark validity collapses.
- **Design tradeoffs:** Curated 259k pairs down to ~9.5k verified pairs, sacrificing breadth for high-fidelity clinical relevance. Assumes smaller, cleaner benchmark is more diagnostic than noisy massive one. Relies on GPT-5 for question generation at scale, mitigated by radiologist verification.
- **Failure signatures:** 
  - "Visual-Clinical Gap": High ASI scores but low DDR scores indicates vision encoder works but language model lacks clinical knowledge
  - "Modality Overfit": High accuracy on common modalities (CT/T1W) but near-random performance on fMRI/PET
  - "Hallucination in Open-Ended": High ROUGE scores but negative BERTScore or logically inconsistent "Explanations"
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Establish Baseline Gaps: Run top-tier general MLLM (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro) to replicate finding that proprietary models lead closed-ended tasks (~66%) but lag in complex reasoning tasks like Preoperative Assessment
  2. Isolate Modality Sensitivity: Ablate input modalities—test performance on *only* structural (T1/T2) vs. *only* functional (PET/fMRI) data—to determine if visual encoder is biased toward anatomy
  3. Stress-Test Reasoning: Focus specifically on **Risk Stratification** and **Preoperative Assessment** tasks (both <41%) and analyze confusion matrix to see if models confuse "high risk" with "low risk" due to lack of temporal/clinical context

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can domain adaptation techniques be optimized to bridge the substantial "visual-to-clinical gap" observed in complex preoperative reasoning tasks?
- Basis: The conclusion states OmniBrainBench "exposes critical gaps... highlighting the need for advances in domain adaptation and prompt engineering"
- Why unresolved: Current models excel at perception but fail to synthesize visual findings into clinical management plans, a capability not solved by current scaling methods
- What evidence would resolve it: A model architecture specifically trained for clinical synthesis achieving significant accuracy improvements (>20%) in the "Therapeutic Cycle Management" phase compared to current proprietary models

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent does the reduction of 3D volumetric brain scans to representative 2D slices limit the diagnostic accuracy of MLLMs?
- Basis: The methodology notes that for raw 3D data, a "commonly used strategy to select 2D slice images" was adopted, potentially discarding spatial context critical for lesion localization and volumetric reasoning
- Why unresolved: Unclear if low performance in tasks like "Lesion Localization" is due to fundamental model limitations or loss of 3D spatial continuity in benchmark data
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study evaluating model performance on the same cases presented as full 3D volumes versus the selected 2D slices used in OmniBrainBench

### Open Question 3
- Question: What specific training methodologies are required to translate static benchmark performance into robust, real-world clinical efficacy?
- Basis: The Discussion notes the aim to "plan real-world validation to assess practical efficacy" and states the benchmark is an "experimental arena" before "expensive real-world deployments"
- Why unresolved: High accuracy on closed-ended VQA pairs may not correlate with reliability in dynamic clinical workflows or user trust in open-ended diagnostic scenarios
- What evidence would resolve it: Prospective clinical trials where MLLMs assist physicians, demonstrating improved diagnostic speed or accuracy in a live hospital setting compared to static benchmark results

## Limitations
- The curated subset (9.5k pairs) may not fully represent real-world case diversity, potentially overestimating model robustness in less common pathologies
- GPT-5-generated questions, even with radiologist verification, may introduce subtle biases in distractor plausibility that favor certain model architectures
- The benchmark may underweight functional modalities (fMRI/PET) relative to structural ones, creating an anatomical bias that doesn't reflect their clinical importance in preoperative planning

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Clinical workflow decomposition and multi-modality diversity are well-supported by structured task categorization and comprehensive modality coverage
- **Medium confidence**: Dual-format evaluation effectively isolates perception vs. reasoning errors, though semantic correctness of open-ended metrics requires further validation
- **Low confidence**: The synthetic question augmentation pipeline's clinical fidelity is the weakest link—GPT-5-generated distractors and verification process are described but not fully transparent

## Next Checks
1. **Replicate the visual-clinical gap**: Run controlled experiment comparing performance on Anatomical Structure Identification versus Disease Diagnosis Reasoning using same models to confirm sequential dependency hypothesis
2. **Modality ablation study**: Systematically remove each modality group (structural vs. functional) and measure performance degradation to quantify model's modality sensitivity
3. **Error type validation**: Manually categorize model failures from the Risk Stratification task (lowest-performing) into Perception/Understanding/Reasoning errors to verify taxonomy's practical utility
