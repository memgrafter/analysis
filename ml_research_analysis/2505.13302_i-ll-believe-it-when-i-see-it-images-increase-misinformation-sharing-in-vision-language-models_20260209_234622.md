# I'll believe it when I see it: Images increase misinformation sharing in Vision-Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.13302
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13302
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Images increase misinformation sharing in VLMs, with Claude-3-Haiku as the only robust model against visual misinformation

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how image presence influences misinformation sharing in vision-language models (VLMs), a gap in understanding given humans' susceptibility to visual content. The authors introduce a jailbreaking-inspired prompting strategy and a new multimodal dataset from PolitiFact to elicit resharing decisions from VLMs across personality and demographic profiles. Experiments reveal that image presence increases resharing rates by 4.8% for true news and 15.0% for false news. Notably, Claude-3-Haiku is the only model showing robustness to visual misinformation, while Dark Triad traits amplify resharing of false news and Republican-aligned profiles weaken veracity sensitivity. These findings underscore the need for multimodal evaluation frameworks and mitigation strategies in personalized AI systems.

## Method Summary
The study uses a custom 200-item multimodal dataset from PolitiFact (100 true, 100 false news items) with images, employing a third-person jailbreaking-inspired prompt to elicit resharing decisions from four VLMs (GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3-Haiku, LLaVa-1.6, Qwen2-VL) across 25 personality profiles each. The method converts 5-point Likert ratings to binary resharing decisions and uses Wilcoxon tests and linear mixed-effects models to analyze the impact of image presence and persona conditioning on misinformation sharing.

## Key Results
- Image presence increases resharing rates by 4.8% for true news and 15.0% for false news
- Claude-3-Haiku is the only model showing robustness to visual misinformation
- Dark Triad traits amplify resharing of false news; Republican-aligned profiles weaken veracity sensitivity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** The presence of images increases the likelihood of VLMs resharing news, particularly when the content is false.
- **Mechanism:** Visual inputs trigger a heuristic "truthiness" bias in VLMs, similar to humans, where the perceptual richness of an image increases perceived credibility or engagement, reducing scrutiny of the accompanying text.
- **Core assumption:** VLMs rely on multimodal integration where visual confirmation (even if superficial) lowers the threshold for sharing unverified claims.
- **Evidence anchors:** Experiments reveal that image presence increases resharing rates by 4.8% for true news and 15.0% for false news. The effect size ($r \approx 0.249$) is comparable to human studies. "Do Images Speak Louder than Words?" investigates similar cross-modal effects.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Persona conditioning, specifically antisocial or partisan profiles, degrades a model's veracity sensitivity.
- **Mechanism:** The model prioritizes aligning its output with the induced "worldview" of the persona (e.g., a Machiavellian or Republican profile) over objective fact-checking, effectively overwriting safety alignment with role-play consistency.
- **Core assumption:** Instruction-following (alignment with the persona prompt) overrides intrinsic knowledge retrieval regarding news veracity.
- **Evidence anchors:** Dark Triad traits amplify resharing of false news and Republican-aligned profiles weaken veracity sensitivity. Republican profiles exhibit a "flatter pattern," sharing false news at rates comparable to true news. "Seeing Through Deception" discusses misleading creator intent.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Third-person framing bypasses safety refusals to successfully elicit toxic or misinformation-sharing behaviors.
- **Mechanism:** By attributing the decision to a fictional "user" rather than the model ("The user decides..." vs "I decide"), the mechanism exploits a gap where the model evaluates the *simulation* of a persona as safe, even if the persona's actions are harmful.
- **Core assumption:** Safety classifiers are trained primarily to prevent the model from endorsing harm directly, failing to block *simulated* third-party endorsements.
- **Evidence anchors:** Instead of asking the model directly, prompting it to consider how a user might respond proves effective. Claude-3-Haiku switches from "L1 (Strongly Disagree)" in 2nd person to "L4/L5 (Agree)" in 3rd person for the same toxic prompt.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** **Vision-Language Model (VLM) Fusion**
  - **Why needed here:** To understand that the "image effect" isn't just adding noise; it stems from cross-modal attention mechanisms where visual tokens influence text generation.
  - **Quick check question:** Does the model process the image embedding before generating the sharing decision, or is it a text-only wrapper?

- **Concept:** **Persona Conditioning (Role-Play)**
  - **Why needed here:** The study relies on the model maintaining a consistent "Dark Triad" or political profile throughout the reasoning chain to measure the bias shift.
  - **Quick check question:** If you strip the persona description from the prompt, does the model revert to a neutral, safety-aligned stance?

- **Concept:** **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Elicitation**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper uses CoT ("think step by step") to extract the model's internal justification (reasoning), which reveals *how* the persona or image influenced the final score.
  - **Quick check question:** Is the reasoning faithful to the decision, or is it a post-hoc rationalization of a fixed likelihood?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** PolitiFact Dataset + Persona Bank -> Prompt Constructor -> Inference Engine -> Output Parser -> Analysis
- **Critical path:** The prompt engineering is the single point of failure. If the 3rd-person frame fails (model refuses), the dataset yields zeros. If the Likert parser fails, the statistical validity collapses.
- **Design tradeoffs:** Temperature 0.9 allows for diverse reasoning but lowers consistency. Binary aggregation simplifies statistics but discards nuance. Claude-3-Haiku showed robustness to images but high sensitivity to personas.
- **Failure signatures:** Refusal loops, format drift, and persona collapse are potential issues that must be monitored.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Sanity Check (Modality Ablation): Run the prompt on the same 10 news items in Text-Only vs. Image+Text mode with a Neutral persona.
  2. Safety Boundary Test (Persona Stress): Run the "Psychopathy" persona on the most controversial false news items.
  3. Parser Robustness: Generate 50 completions and run the Likert extraction regex.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on third-person jailbreaking may not generalize to models with stronger alignment or different safety architectures
- Single news source (PolitiFact) may limit generalizability to other misinformation domains
- Binary conversion of Likert scores discards nuanced responses, potentially masking important patterns

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The core finding that image presence increases misinformation sharing (4.8% for true news, 15.0% for false news) is supported by statistically significant Wilcoxon tests and effect sizes comparable to human studies. The Claude-3-Haiku robustness result is also well-established through direct comparison across all tested models.

**Medium Confidence:** The Dark Triad and political profile effects show consistent patterns but may be influenced by the specific persona generation method. The Republican profile effect is particularly sensitive to how political attitudes are operationalized.

**Low Confidence:** The generalizability of third-person jailbreaking across future model versions and architectures remains uncertain, as this technique exploits specific safety implementation gaps.

## Next Checks

1. Cross-domain validation: Test the image effect on misinformation from different sources (e.g., social media, blogs) to assess whether the 4.8%/15.0% effect generalizes beyond PolitiFact content.

2. Alternative persona methods: Replicate the Dark Triad/Republican profile effects using different persona generation approaches (e.g., direct instruction following vs. keyword priming) to isolate whether the observed effects stem from the content or the delivery method.

3. Safety architecture probing: Systematically test the third-person jailbreaking technique across a wider range of models with varying safety implementations to identify which architectural features most effectively block this attack vector.
