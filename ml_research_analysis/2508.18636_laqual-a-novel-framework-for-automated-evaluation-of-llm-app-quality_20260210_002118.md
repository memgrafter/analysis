# LaQual: A Novel Framework for Automated Evaluation of LLM App Quality

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.18636
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18636
- Reference count: 40
- Automated framework that combines scenario-aware labeling, time-weighted static filtering, and LLM-driven dynamic evaluation to assess LLM app quality with 66.7%-81.3% reduction in candidate pools

## Executive Summary
LaQual is an automated framework designed to evaluate the quality of LLM applications by combining static filtering with dynamic LLM-driven assessment. The framework addresses the challenge of rapidly evaluating LLM apps across diverse scenarios by using scenario-aware classification to categorize apps, time-weighted filtering to eliminate low-quality candidates, and LLM-based evaluation to assess content quality and response performance. Experimental results demonstrate that LaQual achieves moderate-to-high correlation with human judgments (Spearman's ρ = 0.62 for legal consulting, ρ = 0.60 for travel planning) while significantly outperforming baseline recommendation systems in real-world discovery tasks.

## Method Summary
LaQual operates through a three-phase architecture: first, it performs scenario-aware labeling and classification to categorize LLM apps based on their intended use cases; second, it applies time-weighted static filtering to remove low-quality apps based on temporal performance metrics; and third, it employs LLM-driven dynamic evaluation to assess both content quality and response performance for the remaining candidates. The framework was tested on a mainstream LLM app store using two specific scenarios (legal consulting and travel planning), demonstrating its ability to reduce candidate app pools by 66.7%-81.3% while maintaining consistency with human evaluation standards.

## Key Results
- Achieved Spearman's ρ = 0.62 in legal consulting scenario evaluations, indicating moderate-to-high correlation with human judgments
- Achieved Spearman's ρ = 0.60 in travel planning scenario evaluations, demonstrating consistent performance across domains
- Reduced candidate app pools by 66.7%-81.3% while improving user decision confidence and efficiency in real-world discovery tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
LaQual's effectiveness stems from its multi-layered evaluation approach that combines scenario-specific classification with dynamic assessment. The framework leverages LLM-driven evaluation to understand nuanced quality dimensions that traditional metrics miss, while the time-weighted filtering ensures temporal relevance and quality consistency. By reducing the candidate pool before detailed evaluation, the system maintains computational efficiency while preserving high-quality apps that meet domain-specific criteria.

## Foundational Learning
- Scenario-aware classification: Needed to handle domain-specific quality criteria; quick check: verify classification accuracy across 5+ diverse domains
- Time-weighted filtering: Needed to eliminate stale or declining-quality apps; quick check: validate temporal decay models with 6+ month historical data
- LLM-driven dynamic evaluation: Needed for nuanced quality assessment beyond static metrics; quick check: compare LLM assessment consistency with 3+ human evaluators

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map:** Scenario Classifier -> Time-Weighted Filter -> LLM Evaluator -> Quality Assessment
**Critical path:** App submission → Scenario classification → Static filtering → Dynamic evaluation → Quality score
**Design tradeoffs:** Precision vs. recall in filtering stage; computational cost vs. evaluation depth in dynamic assessment
**Failure signatures:** Over-filtering of niche apps; LLM evaluator bias toward specific response patterns
**First experiments:**
1. Test scenario classification accuracy across 10 diverse app categories
2. Validate filtering reduction rate while tracking false-negative rate
3. Compare LLM evaluation consistency with human assessments in 3+ domains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to two specific scenarios (legal consulting and travel planning), raising questions about generalizability to other domains
- Lack of detailed baseline specifications makes comparative assessment against other recommendation systems difficult
- No quantification of how many high-quality apps might be incorrectly filtered out during the reduction process

## Confidence
- High confidence in technical implementation of the three-phase evaluation architecture
- Medium confidence in correlation results with human judgments (limited to two scenarios)
- Low confidence in real-world applicability beyond tested domains and participant pool

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate LaQual's performance across 10+ diverse LLM app categories to assess domain generalizability
2. Conduct A/B testing with larger user samples (n > 100) comparing LaQual-filtered recommendations against human-curated selections
3. Implement false-negative analysis to quantify how many high-quality apps are incorrectly filtered out
