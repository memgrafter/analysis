core_contribution: 'This paper proposes a framework to expand the scope of AI alignment
  beyond the current focus on large language models being aligned to generic values
  of helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty. The authors identify three dimensions
  for expanding alignment scope: competence (knowledge, skills, or behaviors needed
  for intended purpose), transience (semantic vs episodic based on context), and audience
  (mass, public, small-group, or dyadic).'

- Primary result: Framework proposes expanding AI alignment beyond current LLM-focused approaches to encompass three dimensions: competence, transience, and audience

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for conceptualizing AI alignment across multiple dimensions, moving beyond the current focus on large language models and generic alignment objectives. The authors argue that existing alignment approaches are too narrow, primarily targeting mass semantic alignment for behaviors, and propose a more nuanced taxonomy based on competence requirements, temporal considerations, and audience characteristics. The framework aims to provide clearer specifications for technical alignment needs and workflows, serving as a foundation for more pluralistic approaches to AI alignment that can address diverse contexts and stakeholder needs.

## Method Summary
The paper develops its framework through theoretical analysis and conceptual mapping of existing alignment approaches to proposed scope dimensions. The authors systematically examine how different combinations of competence (knowledge/skills/behaviors), transience (semantic vs episodic), and audience (mass/public/small-group/dyadic) create distinct alignment requirements. Rather than presenting empirical experiments, the work focuses on establishing a conceptual taxonomy that can guide future technical development and methodological choices in AI alignment work across various contexts and applications.

## Key Results
- Current alignment approaches are overly focused on mass semantic alignment for behaviors, limiting their applicability
- Three key dimensions (competence, transience, audience) provide a framework for specifying precise technical alignment needs
- Different alignment scopes require distinct technical approaches and methodologies
- Framework enables more precise specification of alignment requirements across diverse contexts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by providing a structured taxonomy that maps alignment requirements to specific technical needs, allowing practitioners to identify appropriate methodologies based on the unique characteristics of their alignment challenge. By decomposing alignment into competence, transience, and audience dimensions, the approach enables more targeted technical solutions rather than applying generic alignment methods. This systematic categorization helps bridge the gap between abstract alignment goals and concrete technical implementation requirements.

## Foundational Learning

**Competence Dimension**
Why needed: Different alignment tasks require varying levels of knowledge, skills, or behaviors
Quick check: Can be validated by mapping existing alignment systems to competence requirements

**Transience Dimension**
Why needed: Temporal context (semantic vs episodic) significantly affects alignment approach selection
Quick check: Test whether alignment methods change based on temporal requirements

**Audience Dimension**
Why needed: Mass, public, small-group, and dyadic audiences require fundamentally different alignment strategies
Quick check: Map audience types to corresponding alignment methodologies

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Competence Assessment -> Alignment Method Selection -> Implementation Strategy

**Critical Path**
1. Identify alignment scope requirements
2. Map requirements to competence, transience, and audience dimensions
3. Select appropriate technical approach
4. Implement alignment methodology

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Generality vs specificity in alignment approaches
- Complexity vs applicability across different contexts
- Standardization vs customization for specific use cases

**Failure Signatures**
- Misalignment between scope requirements and chosen methodology
- Over-generalization leading to ineffective alignment
- Insufficient consideration of temporal or audience factors

**First 3 Experiments**
1. Map existing alignment systems to the proposed scope framework
2. Test framework's predictive accuracy for method selection
3. Implement alignment approach for non-mass semantic scope

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Empirical validation of framework effectiveness is limited
- Practical utility of the framework remains somewhat unclear without concrete examples
- Connection between framework and pluralistic alignment implementation is largely speculative
- Excludes power dynamics and resource distribution from scope analysis

## Confidence
- Medium confidence in theoretical framework's internal consistency and conceptual utility
- Low confidence in practical applicability without empirical validation
- Medium confidence in critique of current alignment approaches being too narrow

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework by mapping specific existing alignment systems to the proposed scope dimensions and evaluating predictive accuracy
2. Conduct case studies across different alignment contexts (education, healthcare, content moderation) to validate the framework's practical utility
3. Develop and implement at least one technical approach for a non-mass semantic alignment scope to demonstrate feasibility
