# Mission-Aligned Learning-Informed Control of Autonomous Systems: Formulation and Foundations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.04356
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04356
- Reference count: 40
- Proposes a hierarchical optimization framework integrating planning, MPC, and reinforcement learning for autonomous systems

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel hierarchical optimization framework for autonomous systems that combines discrete planning with continuous Model Predictive Control (MPC), incorporating reinforcement learning for model and reward learning. The approach specifically targets safety-critical applications like robotic care for movement and health-impaired humans, where both physical safety and interpretable decision-making are essential. By formulating a bilevel optimization problem with fuzzy logic bridging symbolic and numeric representations, the framework aims to provide reliable performance while maintaining interpretability through explicit task selection and constraint-based safety guarantees.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework operates through a two-level optimization structure. At the upper level, discrete planning selects appropriate tasks based on mission objectives and current system state. The lower level employs continuous MPC for physical execution, generating control actions that respect hard safety constraints while optimizing performance. Reinforcement learning components learn system dynamics models and reward functions from experience, while fuzzy logic provides interpretable mapping between symbolic task descriptions and numeric state representations. This hierarchical structure allows the system to make interpretable high-level decisions while maintaining rigorous safety guarantees through MPC's constraint satisfaction properties.

## Key Results
- Formulates a bilevel optimization framework integrating discrete planning with continuous MPC
- Incorporates reinforcement learning for learning dynamics models and reward functions
- Uses fuzzy logic to bridge symbolic task representations with numeric state representations
- Claims to provide both reliable performance and interpretability for safety-critical autonomous systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by separating concerns between high-level decision-making and low-level control execution. The upper-level discrete planning selects tasks based on mission objectives and interpretable fuzzy logic rules, providing transparency in decision rationale. The lower-level MPC then executes these tasks with hard constraints ensuring physical safety, regardless of model uncertainties. Reinforcement learning components continuously improve the system's understanding of dynamics and task objectives through experience. This separation allows for interpretable decisions at the planning level while maintaining rigorous safety guarantees at the execution level, addressing the traditional trade-off between interpretability and performance in autonomous systems.
