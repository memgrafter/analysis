# Probing Prompt Design for Socially Compliant Robot Navigation with Vision Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2601.14622
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14622
- **Reference count:** 8
- **Primary result:** Optimal prompt configurations for socially compliant robot navigation differ across vision language models, with system prompts acting as decision-level constraints rather than representational enhancements

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how prompt design affects socially compliant robot navigation using small vision language models. The authors explore two key dimensions of prompt design: system guidance (action-focused, reasoning-oriented, and perception-reasoning prompts) and motivational framing (competition against humans, other AI systems, or the model's past self). Through experiments on two navigation datasets, they find that prompt effectiveness varies significantly between non-finetuned GPT-4o and finetuned small VLMs, with different optimal configurations for each model type. The study reveals that system prompts can actually degrade performance when poorly designed, and that prompts primarily influence decision-making rather than improving the model's internal representations.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a structured approach to prompt design for socially compliant robot navigation, testing three types of system guidance prompts (action-focused, reasoning-oriented, and perception-reasoning) and three motivational framings (competition against humans, other AI, or the model's past self). They evaluate these prompts across two vision language models: non-finetuned GPT-4o and finetuned small VLMs, using two navigation datasets. The experimental design compares navigation performance metrics under different prompt configurations to identify optimal combinations for each model type, while also investigating whether prompts function as representational enhancements or decision-level constraints.

## Key Results
- Optimal prompt configurations differ across models: reasoning-oriented prompts with human competition work best for non-finetuned GPT-4o, while perception-reasoning prompts with self-competition are most effective for finetuned small VLMs
- System prompts are not universally beneficial—poorly designed prompts can degrade performance compared to no system prompt
- Direct finetuning improves semantic-level metrics (perception, prediction, reasoning), while system prompts yield disproportionately larger improvements in action accuracy, indicating prompts act as decision-level constraints

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper demonstrates that prompt design effectiveness depends on the interaction between prompt structure and model characteristics. Different VLMs have varying capacities for processing reasoning versus perceptual information, which explains why reasoning-oriented prompts work better for GPT-4o while perception-reasoning prompts suit finetuned small VLMs. The motivational framing appears to influence the model's decision-making process by providing different contextual goals, though the exact psychological mechanism remains unclear. The finding that prompts primarily affect action accuracy rather than semantic understanding suggests they function by constraining the decision space rather than enhancing the model's internal representations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Vision Language Models (VLMs):** Neural architectures that process both visual and textual inputs simultaneously
  - *Why needed:* Core technology for robot navigation that combines perception with language understanding
  - *Quick check:* Can process images and generate text-based navigation commands

- **Socially Compliant Navigation:** Robot navigation that respects human social norms and conventions
  - *Why needed:* Ensures robots interact appropriately with humans in shared spaces
  - *Quick check:* Involves maintaining appropriate distances and predicting human movement

- **Prompt Engineering:** The practice of designing input prompts to elicit desired model behaviors
  - *Why needed:* Critical for controlling model outputs without modifying the underlying architecture
  - *Quick check:* Can significantly impact model performance through careful wording choices

- **Finetuning:** Process of adapting a pre-trained model to a specific task or domain
  - *Why needed:* Improves model performance on specialized tasks like navigation
  - *Quick check:* Results in model weights that are specialized for the target domain

- **Decision-Level Constraints:** Mechanisms that influence final outputs without changing internal representations
  - *Why needed:* Explains how prompts can improve navigation without improving model understanding
  - *Quick check:* Affects action selection more than perception or reasoning capabilities

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input Image + Text Prompt -> VLM Encoder -> Navigation Decision Module -> Action Output

**Critical Path:** Vision input and text prompt are processed together through the VLM, which generates navigation decisions based on learned social navigation patterns

**Design Tradeoffs:** 
- System prompts add computational overhead but can improve navigation performance
- Finetuning requires additional training data and computational resources
- Balancing prompt complexity with real-time navigation requirements

**Failure Signatures:** 
- Poor prompt design leads to degraded navigation performance
- Inappropriate motivational framing causes socially awkward navigation behaviors
- Mismatched prompt types for specific model architectures result in suboptimal performance

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Test action-focused prompts versus no prompts on simple navigation tasks
2. Compare reasoning-oriented prompts across different motivational framings
3. Evaluate perception-reasoning prompts on complex social navigation scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions for future research, focusing instead on presenting its experimental findings and analysis of prompt design effectiveness.

## Limitations
- Evaluation confined to two specific navigation datasets, limiting generalizability to diverse real-world scenarios
- Comparison between non-finetuned GPT-4o and finetuned small VLMs introduces confounding variables from architectural differences
- Lack of quantitative evidence for claims about prompts acting as "decision-level constraints" versus "representational enhancements"

## Confidence
- System prompt effectiveness varies by model type: **High**
- Motivational framing influences performance: **Medium**
- Prompts primarily act as decision-level constraints: **Low**
- Poor prompt design can degrade performance: **High**

## Next Checks
1. Test prompt configurations across a broader range of navigation scenarios, including pedestrian-rich urban environments and multi-agent interactions
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating architectural differences from prompt effects by using identical model backbones with and without finetuning
3. Implement user studies to verify whether motivational framings produce measurable behavioral differences in navigation strategies
