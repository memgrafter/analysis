# Sample Efficient Reinforcement Learning via Large Vision Language Model Distillation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.11221
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11221
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: LVLM2P improves sample efficiency by 2.18-2.86x in grid-based RL tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LVLM2P, a knowledge distillation framework that leverages a large vision-language model (LVLM) to improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL) agents. The core idea is to use the LVLM as a teacher to provide instructional actions based on visual observations, which helps guide the student RL agent during training. This reduces the need for manual textual descriptors and minimizes less meaningful exploration, significantly accelerating learning. The student agent is trained using both a conventional RL objective and a knowledge distillation objective that aligns the agent's policy with the LVLM's suggestions.

## Method Summary
LVLM2P uses a vision-language model (LVLM) as a teacher to provide action suggestions based on visual observations. The student RL agent is trained using both a standard RL objective and a knowledge distillation objective that aligns its policy with the LVLM's suggestions. This approach reduces the need for manual textual descriptors and minimizes less meaningful exploration, accelerating learning. The method was validated on grid-based tasks, showing substantial improvements in sample efficiency.

## Key Results
- LVLM2P enhances sample efficiency by 2.18 to 2.86 times compared to vanilla RL baselines
- High performance fidelity is maintained during training
- Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of soft probability distributions and the optimal balance of objectives

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The LVLM provides contextual guidance through instructional actions based on visual observations, which helps the student RL agent focus on meaningful exploration. By distilling this knowledge, the agent learns more efficiently without requiring extensive manual task descriptions. The combination of RL and knowledge distillation objectives creates a balanced training signal that accelerates learning while maintaining performance.

## Foundational Learning

**Reinforcement Learning**: Why needed - Core learning paradigm for sequential decision making. Quick check - Agent learns to maximize cumulative reward through interaction with environment.

**Knowledge Distillation**: Why needed - Transfers knowledge from teacher to student model. Quick check - Student learns to mimic teacher's behavior and decision patterns.

**Vision-Language Models**: Why needed - Processes visual inputs and generates contextually relevant actions. Quick check - LVLM can interpret visual observations and provide meaningful action suggestions.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Environment -> RL Agent (Student) -> LVLM (Teacher) -> RL Agent (Student)

**Critical Path**: Visual observation → LVLM action suggestion → Student RL training → Environment feedback

**Design Tradeoffs**: Balance between RL and distillation objectives; computational overhead of LVLM; choice of LVLM model size and capabilities.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor LVLM-task alignment leading to misleading guidance; excessive computational overhead; suboptimal balance between objectives causing instability.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test LVLM2P on continuous control benchmarks (MuJoCo, PyBullet)
2. Conduct ablation studies varying LVLM model sizes
3. Measure computational overhead during training

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Experimental validation is constrained to grid-based environments
- Computational overhead introduced by LVLM during training
- Assumes LVLM capabilities align well with specific task requirements

## Confidence

**High**: Technical feasibility of LVLM2P framework and validity of knowledge distillation approach in tested environments.

**Medium**: Sample efficiency improvements of 2.18-2.86x based on controlled experiments with limited task diversity.

**Low**: Scalability to real-world applications and generalization across diverse task domains.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate LVLM2P on continuous control benchmarks (e.g., MuJoCo, PyBullet) to assess scalability beyond grid-based environments.

2. Conduct ablation studies varying LVLM model sizes and capabilities to quantify the impact of teacher quality on student performance.

3. Measure the computational overhead during training to determine the practical efficiency trade-offs in resource-constrained scenarios.
