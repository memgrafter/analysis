# Inside Out: Uncovering How Comment Internalization Steers LLMs for Better or Worse

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.16790
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16790
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: First interpretability analysis showing LLMs internalize code comments as distinct latent concepts, with task-dependent performance impacts of -90% to +67% when manipulating these concepts

## Executive Summary
This study presents the first interpretability analysis of how LLMs internalize code comments, revealing that comments are encoded as distinct latent concepts within model representations. Using Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs), the authors demonstrate that LLMs not only internalize comments but also differentiate between comment subtypes (Javadocs, inline, and multiline comments). By systematically activating and deactivating these concepts in the embedding space, the researchers observed significant task-dependent performance changes across three software engineering tasks and three LLM variants. Code summarization consistently triggered the strongest activation of comment concepts, while code completion elicited the weakest, suggesting that comment relevance varies significantly by task type.

## Method Summary
The researchers employed Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) to identify and analyze comment-related concepts within LLM representations. They systematically activated and deactivated these concepts in the embedding space to measure performance impacts on three SE tasks: code translation, completion, and refinement. The study examined three LLM variants and differentiated between comment subtypes including Javadocs, inline, and multiline comments. By measuring activation patterns and correlating them with task performance changes, the authors established that comments are not merely surface-level input but are internalized as distinct latent representations that influence model behavior differently depending on the task context.

## Key Results
- LLMs internalize code comments as distinct latent concepts, identifiable through CAV analysis
- Different comment subtypes (Javadocs, inline, multiline) are differentiated in model representations
- Performance changes of -90% to +67% observed when activating/deactivating comment concepts
- Code summarization consistently showed strongest comment concept activation; code completion weakest

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Comment internalization works through the formation of distinct latent representations in the embedding space that capture semantic meaning beyond surface text. When LLMs process code with comments, they create specialized concept vectors that encode comment-related information as part of their learned representations. These CAV-identified concepts serve as internal reasoning pathways that the model can activate or suppress to influence downstream task performance. The mechanism suggests that comments are not simply tokenized input but are transformed into meaningful latent structures that the model can reason about independently of the original comment text.

## Foundational Learning
- **Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)**: Mathematical tools for identifying high-level concepts in neural network representations; needed to quantify abstract comment internalization patterns
- **Embedding space manipulation**: Direct modification of model representations to test causal relationships; quick check involves measuring activation strength via cosine similarity
- **Comment subtype differentiation**: Model's ability to distinguish between Javadoc, inline, and multiline comments; verified through subtype-specific CAV activation patterns
- **Task-dependent concept relevance**: Variable importance of comment concepts across different SE tasks; validated by correlating activation strength with performance changes
- **Latent concept activation**: Process of enhancing or suppressing specific internal representations; measured through controlled activation/deactivation experiments

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input code → Tokenizer → Embedding layer → Hidden layers → CAV-identified concept space → Task-specific output layer

**Critical Path**: Comment input → Embedding transformation → Concept vector formation → CAV identification → Task performance modulation

**Design Tradeoffs**: Balancing concept specificity against generalization; high-resolution comment concepts may improve task-specific performance but reduce cross-task transferability

**Failure Signatures**: Over-activation of comment concepts leading to -90% performance drops; under-activation causing +67% improvements in some contexts but degradation in others

**First Experiments**:
1. Measure CAV activation strength for each comment subtype across all three SE tasks
2. Systematically deactivate comment concepts to establish baseline performance without comment reasoning
3. Compare activation patterns between models trained with and without extensive comment data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The study highlights several open questions regarding the generalizability of comment internalization patterns across different programming languages, domains, and model architectures. The exact causal mechanisms between concept manipulation and task performance remain partially understood, and the reasons for varying comment relevance across task types require further investigation. Additionally, the study questions how comment internalization develops during training and whether alternative interpretability methods would reveal the same or different comment-related concepts.

## Limitations
- Findings based on three SE tasks and three LLM variants may not generalize to other contexts
- CAV methodology may miss subtler or more distributed comment representations
- Exact causal mechanisms between concept manipulation and performance changes remain partially understood
- Performance variations are task-dependent and model-variant-specific

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: CAV-identified comment concepts and their task-dependent activation patterns
- **Medium confidence**: Causal relationship between concept manipulation and performance changes
- **Medium confidence**: Generalizability across different model architectures and programming contexts

## Next Checks
1. Replicate CAV analysis using alternative interpretability methods (attention visualization, feature importance scoring) to verify robustness across analytical approaches

2. Extend experimental scope to include additional programming languages, SE tasks (bug detection, code search), and LLM variants to assess generalizability

3. Conduct ablation studies removing/modifying comments in training data to measure effects on comment concept formation and establish causal links between training composition and internal representations
