# ReLook: Vision-Ground RL with a Multimodal LLM Critic for Agentic Web Coding

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2510.11498
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11498
- **Reference count:** 17
- **Key outcome:** Vision-grounded RL framework using a multimodal LLM critic for front-end code generation, achieving state-of-the-art results on ArtifactsBench-Lite with 27.88/31.86 scores for 7B/8B models.

## Executive Summary
ReLook introduces a vision-grounded reinforcement learning framework for agentic web coding. It closes the generate-diagnose-refine loop by using a multimodal LLM as an external critic that provides visual feedback through screenshots. The framework employs Forced Optimization to ensure only improving revisions are accepted, preventing behavioral collapse. A key innovation is the ability to decouple training and inference, allowing for a lightweight self-edit mode at test time. Across three benchmarks, ReLook consistently outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating the benefits of visual grounding and agentic perception.

## Method Summary
ReLook operates through an iterative loop where the agent generates code, captures temporal screenshots, and obtains visual feedback from a multimodal LLM critic to improve the code. The framework introduces Forced Optimization, a strict acceptance rule that only admits revisions that improve performance, ensuring monotonically better trajectories. During inference, the external critic can be discarded, running a lightweight self-edit cycle instead. This training-inference decoupling allows for efficiency without sacrificing performance. The approach is evaluated on three widely used benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong baselines.

## Key Results
- ReLook achieves state-of-the-art performance on ArtifactsBench-Lite with 27.88/31.86 scores for 7B/8B models.
- Forced Optimization prevents behavioral collapse and yields monotonically better trajectories.
- Training-inference decoupling preserves performance while enabling lightweight inference.
- Visual feedback via multimodal LLM is critical for improvement in front-end code generation.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ReLook works by integrating vision-grounded reinforcement learning with a multimodal LLM critic to provide rich visual feedback. This feedback loop allows the agent to iteratively refine code based on actual visual outcomes rather than just syntactic correctness. Forced Optimization ensures that each revision improves performance, preventing the model from settling into suboptimal behaviors. The ability to decouple training and inference enables efficient deployment while maintaining high performance. The combination of visual perception, agentic decision-making, and strict optimization creates a robust framework for complex coding tasks.

## Foundational Learning

**Vision-Grounded Reinforcement Learning**
- *Why needed:* Traditional RL for code generation lacks rich feedback beyond pass/fail metrics.
- *Quick check:* Verify that visual feedback improves over text-only feedback in iterative refinement tasks.

**Multimodal LLM as Critic**
- *Why needed:* Provides nuanced, context-aware evaluation of visual outputs from code.
- *Quick check:* Test if multimodal critic improves code quality compared to rule-based or single-modality critics.

**Forced Optimization**
- *Why needed:* Prevents behavioral collapse by ensuring only improvements are accepted.
- *Quick check:* Compare performance with and without Forced Optimization on the same benchmark.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Code Generator -> Screenshot Capture -> Multimodal LLM Critic -> Revision Filter (Forced Optimization) -> Updated Code

**Critical Path:**
1. Code generation
2. Screenshot capture
3. Visual feedback from multimodal LLM
4. Forced Optimization filtering
5. Code revision

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Multimodal LLM vs. lightweight critic: Accuracy vs. inference speed
- Forced Optimization vs. exploration: Guaranteed improvement vs. potential discovery of novel solutions
- Training-inference decoupling: Performance preservation vs. potential loss of fine-tuning benefits

**Failure Signatures:**
- Over-reliance on visual feedback leading to brittle code
- Forced Optimization causing premature convergence
- Inefficient screenshot capture or processing slowing down iterations

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Run ablation study comparing performance with and without Forced Optimization.
2. Replace multimodal LLM critic with a simpler vision-language model and measure impact.
3. Test self-edit mode on progressively longer edit sequences to validate training-inference decoupling.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Empirical claims based on a single set of benchmarks with relatively small model sizes (7B/8B).
- Advantage from Forced Optimization shown only in ablation without testing in noisier settings.
- Visual grounding mechanism not evaluated against alternative perception modules like OCR-based or embedding-based approaches.
- Reported metrics from public leaderboards without full evaluation protocol access, raising score stability questions.

## Confidence
- ReLook achieves state-of-the-art performance on the tested benchmarks: High
- Forced Optimization prevents behavioral collapse and yields monotonically better trajectories: Medium
- Training-inference decoupling preserves performance: Medium
- Visual feedback via multimodal LLM is critical for improvement: Medium
- Benefits transfer to non-web or longer-horizon code generation: Low

## Next Checks
1. Re-run ablations on a held-out benchmark to verify Forced Optimization robustness.
2. Replace the multimodal LLM critic with a lightweight vision-language model and compare performance.
3. Test the self-edit mode on a longer sequence of edits to confirm the training-inference decoupling claim under more complex tasks.
