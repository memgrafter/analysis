## Executive Summary
This survey systematically examines reinforcement learning techniques for large language models, highlighting how RL addresses alignment and reasoning challenges. It covers foundational methods like RLHF and RLAIF, advanced approaches such as DPO and GRPO, and specialized reasoning techniques including RLVR and CoT-RO. The survey provides comparative analysis revealing that DPO offers training efficiency and stability, while RLVR and verifier-guided RL significantly improve mathematical reasoning performance. It also identifies persistent challenges such as reward hacking, computational costs, and evaluation difficulties, while outlining future directions including hybrid algorithms and multi-objective alignment frameworks.

## Method Summary
The survey synthesizes existing literature on reinforcement learning applications for large language models, organizing techniques by their primary objectives and methodological approaches. It examines how different RL methods address alignment challenges through human feedback mechanisms, improve reasoning capabilities through verifier-guided training, and optimize training efficiency. The analysis compares methods based on their theoretical foundations, practical implementations, and reported performance outcomes, while acknowledging limitations in the current evaluation frameworks and the need for standardized benchmarks across different RL approaches.

## Key Results
- DPO demonstrates superior training efficiency and stability compared to traditional RLHF methods
- RLVR and verifier-guided RL significantly improve mathematical reasoning performance
- Persistent challenges include reward hacking, high computational costs, and lack of standardized evaluation metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Reinforcement learning techniques for LLMs work by transforming language model training from static supervised learning into a dynamic optimization process where models learn to maximize reward signals. The mechanism involves three key components: a policy (the language model itself) that generates responses, a reward function that evaluates these responses based on desired criteria, and an optimization algorithm that updates the model parameters to increase expected reward. This framework enables LLMs to refine their outputs beyond initial pretraining, addressing alignment by incorporating human preferences and improving reasoning through structured feedback on logical coherence and correctness.

## Foundational Learning
- **Policy Gradient Methods**: Essential for optimizing discrete text generation without explicit gradient computation through the environment
  - Why needed: Direct gradient computation is intractable for text generation due to discrete outputs
  - Quick check: Verify gradient estimator variance and convergence properties on small-scale tasks

- **Reward Modeling**: Creating differentiable approximations of human preference signals
  - Why needed: Enables efficient optimization of complex, human-defined objectives
  - Quick check: Compare reward model accuracy against ground truth human preferences

- **Proximal Policy Optimization**: Stabilizes policy updates through clipped probability ratios
  - Why needed: Prevents destructive policy updates that could degrade model performance
  - Quick check: Monitor KL divergence between old and new policies during training

- **Verifiable Rewards**: Using mathematical proof or logical verification for reward signals
  - Why needed: Provides objective feedback for tasks where human evaluation is impractical
- Quick check: Test verifier accuracy on known correct/incorrect solutions

- **Contrastive Preference Learning**: Learning from pairwise comparisons rather than absolute scores
  - Why needed: More sample-efficient way to capture human preferences
  - Quick check: Evaluate preference model calibration on out-of-distribution examples

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input Text -> Language Model Policy -> Generated Response -> Reward Function -> Value Estimate -> Policy Update -> New Policy Parameters

Critical path: Policy generation → Reward evaluation → Gradient estimation → Parameter update → New policy generation

Design tradeoffs: Traditional RLHF offers stable but computationally expensive training, while DPO provides efficiency at the cost of some alignment granularity. Verifier-guided approaches excel at reasoning tasks but require specialized reward structures. The choice between these methods depends on task requirements, available computational resources, and the nature of the desired model behavior.

Failure signatures: Reward hacking manifests as models exploiting loopholes in reward functions rather than improving genuine quality. Training instability appears as oscillating performance or catastrophic forgetting of previously learned capabilities. Poor convergence shows as plateaued reward scores without meaningful output improvements. Evaluation difficulties arise when reward signals don't correlate with actual task performance or human preferences.

Three first experiments:
1. Implement DPO on a small language model using pairwise preference data to verify training efficiency improvements
2. Test RLVR with a simple mathematical verifier on arithmetic reasoning tasks to measure correctness gains
3. Compare reward hacking susceptibility between PPO and DPO implementations using synthetic reward functions with known vulnerabilities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The survey identifies several open questions in reinforcement learning for LLMs: How to effectively combine multiple reward objectives without introducing instability? What are the fundamental limits of verifier-guided reasoning improvement? Can hybrid algorithms achieve both the stability of traditional RLHF and the efficiency of direct preference optimization? How to develop evaluation frameworks that accurately measure alignment quality across different RL methods? What are the long-term effects of reinforcement learning on model generalization and safety properties?

## Limitations
- Analysis primarily synthesizes existing literature rather than presenting original experimental data
- Claims about computational efficiency and stability improvements may not generalize across different model architectures
- Reward hacking conditions and susceptibility across methods are not deeply explored
- Current evaluation frameworks lack standardization for comparing alignment and reasoning improvements

## Confidence

High confidence:
- Foundational RL methods (RLHF, RLAIF) and their general applications are well-established in literature

Medium confidence:
- Comparative claims about DPO efficiency versus other methods, as these depend heavily on implementation details and evaluation metrics
- Performance improvements from RLVR and verifier-guided RL for mathematical reasoning, based on available studies

Low confidence:
- Long-term effectiveness of multi-objective alignment frameworks, as these are still largely theoretical

## Next Checks

1. Conduct head-to-head comparisons of DPO, RLVR, and verifier-guided RL on standardized mathematical reasoning benchmarks using identical model architectures and computational resources

2. Implement controlled experiments to measure reward hacking vulnerability across different RL methods using both synthetic and real-world reward functions

3. Develop and validate a comprehensive evaluation framework that can measure trade-offs between alignment quality, reasoning capability, and computational efficiency across multiple RL techniques simultaneously
