# Answering Students' Questions on Course Forums Using Multiple Chain-of-Thought Reasoning and Finetuning RAG-Enabled LLM

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.09831
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09831
- Reference count: 27
- Primary result: Proposed system achieves F1 score of 62.2% on HotpotQA dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel question-answering system for online course forums using a fine-tuned, retrieval-augmented large language model (LLM) enhanced with multiple chain-of-thought reasoning. The system addresses key challenges in large-scale online courses, including delayed responses, repetitive queries, and the burden on instructors, by automatically retrieving relevant content and providing step-by-step reasoning to support student learning. The proposed approach integrates a local knowledge base with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and leverages fine-tuning with LoRA to adapt the LLM to course-specific content. Multiple chain-of-thought reasoning improves the system's ability to avoid hallucinations and provide clearer, multi-step explanations. Experiments on the HotpotQA dataset demonstrate that the fine-tuned LLM with RAG significantly outperforms both the baseline and non-fine-tuned models, achieving an F1 score of 62.2%. The results highlight the effectiveness of combining RAG, fine-tuning, and multiple reasoning paths for improving question-answering performance in educational settings.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a question-answering system that combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with a fine-tuned LLM using LoRA adapters. The system retrieves relevant course content from a local knowledge base and employs multiple chain-of-thought reasoning to generate accurate, step-by-step answers to student questions. The fine-tuning process adapts the LLM to course-specific terminology and context, while the RAG component ensures answers are grounded in the course material. The multiple reasoning paths help avoid hallucinations and provide clearer explanations. The system was evaluated on the HotpotQA dataset, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline models.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned LLM with RAG achieves F1 score of 62.2% on HotpotQA dataset
- Proposed system outperforms both baseline and non-fine-tuned models
- Multiple chain-of-thought reasoning improves answer accuracy and reduces hallucinations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system works by combining three key techniques: retrieval-augmented generation ensures answers are grounded in relevant course content, fine-tuning with LoRA adapts the LLM to domain-specific language and concepts, and multiple chain-of-thought reasoning provides step-by-step explanations that improve accuracy and reduce hallucinations. The RAG component retrieves relevant information from a local knowledge base, which is then used by the fine-tuned LLM to generate answers. The multiple reasoning paths allow the system to explore different explanation strategies, increasing the likelihood of providing a clear and accurate response.

## Foundational Learning

1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
   - Why needed: To ground LLM responses in relevant course content and avoid hallucinations
   - Quick check: Verify retrieval accuracy and relevance of retrieved documents

2. LoRA Fine-tuning
   - Why needed: To adapt the LLM to course-specific terminology and context efficiently
   - Quick check: Compare performance with full fine-tuning to ensure LoRA is sufficient

3. Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
   - Why needed: To provide step-by-step explanations and improve answer accuracy
   - Quick check: Analyze reasoning paths for logical consistency and completeness

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Student Question -> RAG Retriever -> Fine-tuned LLM -> Multiple Chain-of-Thought Generator -> Answer

Critical path: The critical path involves retrieving relevant content, generating multiple reasoning paths, and selecting the best answer based on coherence and accuracy.

Design tradeoffs: The system trades off between retrieval accuracy and response speed, as well as between the number of reasoning paths and computational efficiency.

Failure signatures: Common failures include retrieval of irrelevant content, incorrect fine-tuning, and generation of inconsistent reasoning paths.

First experiments:
1. Evaluate retrieval accuracy on a held-out set of course content
2. Test fine-tuned LLM performance on course-specific questions
3. Analyze the quality and diversity of generated reasoning paths

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation scope, only tested on HotpotQA dataset
- Performance metrics still leave room for significant error rates (F1 score of 62.2%)
- No detailed analysis of failure cases or handling of ambiguous questions

## Confidence
- High confidence in the technical implementation of RAG and LoRA fine-tuning components
- Medium confidence in the claimed improvements over baselines, given the single dataset evaluation
- Low confidence in the system's robustness and effectiveness in real-world educational contexts without further validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct user studies with actual students and instructors to evaluate the system's performance on real course forum questions and assess user satisfaction
2. Test the system on multiple diverse educational datasets and benchmark it against other state-of-the-art QA systems in educational contexts
3. Perform ablation studies to isolate and quantify the individual contributions of RAG, fine-tuning, and multiple chain-of-thought reasoning to overall performance
