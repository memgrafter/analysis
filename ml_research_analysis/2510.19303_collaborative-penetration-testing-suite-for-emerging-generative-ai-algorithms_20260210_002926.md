core_contribution: This study presents a collaborative penetration testing suite designed
  to address vulnerabilities in generative AI systems against classical and emerging
  quantum cyber threats. The suite integrates dynamic and static application security
  testing (DAST/SAST) using OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, SonarQube, and Fortify; interactive
  application security testing (IAST) via Contrast Assess; blockchain-enhanced logging
  using Hyperledger Fabric; quantum-resistant cryptography based on lattice methods
  and RLWE; and AI-driven red team simulations to emulate adversarial and quantum-assisted
  attacks.

# Collaborative penetration testing suite for emerging generative AI algorithms

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.19303
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19303
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Framework identifies 300+ vulnerabilities, reduces high-severity issues by 70% in two weeks

## Executive Summary
This study presents a comprehensive collaborative penetration testing suite specifically designed to secure generative AI systems against both classical and emerging quantum cyber threats. The framework integrates multiple security testing methodologies including dynamic, static, and interactive application security testing, enhanced with blockchain-based logging and quantum-resistant cryptography. Through AI-driven red team simulations, the suite demonstrates significant improvements in vulnerability detection and resolution while maintaining data integrity under simulated quantum attack conditions.

## Method Summary
The framework combines established security testing tools (OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, SonarQube, Fortify) with interactive application security testing via Contrast Assess, creating a multi-layered approach to vulnerability detection. Blockchain technology (Hyperledger Fabric) provides immutable logging of security events, while quantum-resistant cryptography based on lattice methods and RLWE protects against future quantum computing threats. AI-driven red team simulations emulate both adversarial and quantum-assisted attacks to comprehensively test system resilience. The evaluation was conducted across controlled test environments measuring vulnerability detection rates, resolution efficiency, and cryptographic integrity under attack conditions.

## Key Results
- Identified over 300 vulnerabilities across test environments
- Achieved 70% reduction in high-severity vulnerabilities within two weeks
- Maintained 100% integrity for quantum-resistant protocols under simulated quantum attacks
- Demonstrated 90% resolution efficiency for blockchain-logged vulnerabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its layered security approach that combines multiple testing methodologies with emerging technologies. By integrating DAST, SAST, and IAST tools, it provides comprehensive coverage of different vulnerability types and attack surfaces. The blockchain-enhanced logging creates an immutable audit trail that improves vulnerability tracking and resolution accountability. Quantum-resistant cryptography ensures long-term data protection against future quantum computing capabilities, while AI-driven simulations provide adaptive testing that evolves with emerging threat patterns.

## Foundational Learning
- **OWASP ZAP**: Dynamic application security testing tool for web application vulnerabilities; needed for identifying runtime security flaws; quick check: verifies proper session management and authentication bypasses
- **Hyperledger Fabric**: Permissioned blockchain platform for secure logging; needed for creating tamper-proof security event records; quick check: validates transaction ordering and consensus mechanisms
- **RLWE (Ring Learning With Errors)**: Post-quantum cryptography foundation; needed for resisting quantum algorithm attacks; quick check: ensures proper key generation and encryption/decryption operations
- **Contrast Assess**: Interactive application security testing; needed for runtime vulnerability detection during application execution; quick check: monitors code behavior and data flow in real-time
- **Fortify**: Static application security testing; needed for identifying vulnerabilities in source code before deployment; quick check: scans for common coding flaws and security anti-patterns

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: DAST/SAST/IAST Tools -> Security Event Collection -> Blockchain Logging -> Quantum-Resistant Encryption -> AI Red Team Simulation -> Vulnerability Resolution
**Critical Path**: Security testing → Event logging → Cryptographic protection → Threat simulation → Resolution tracking
**Design Tradeoffs**: Comprehensive security coverage vs. system performance overhead; quantum resistance vs. computational efficiency; blockchain immutability vs. scalability
**Failure Signatures**: Increased false positives in vulnerability detection; blockchain network congestion affecting logging; quantum-resistant algorithms causing latency spikes
**First Experiments**: 1) Deploy DAST/SAST tools against sample generative AI application to establish baseline vulnerability count; 2) Implement blockchain logging for detected vulnerabilities and measure resolution tracking efficiency; 3) Test quantum-resistant encryption with simulated attack vectors to verify integrity maintenance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation conducted only in controlled test environments, not real-world production systems
- Vulnerability metrics lack detailed breakdowns by type and severity classification
- Quantum-resistant cryptography tested against simulations rather than actual quantum computing hardware

## Confidence
**High confidence**: Integration of multiple security testing tools and reported vulnerability reduction are well-supported by established security practices
**Medium confidence**: Blockchain logging effectiveness has measurable outcomes but lacks independent verification
**Low confidence**: Quantum-resistant cryptography performance claims based on theoretical simulations rather than empirical quantum computing tests

## Next Checks
1. Deploy framework in production generative AI environment with real-world traffic and adversarial testing
2. Conduct independent third-party security audits to verify vulnerability detection and resolution metrics
3. Test quantum-resistant protocols against actual quantum computing platforms and quantum algorithms
