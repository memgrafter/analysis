# A Framework for the Adoption and Integration of Generative AI in Midsize Organizations and Enterprises (FAIGMOE)

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.19997
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19997
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Conceptual framework synthesizing technology adoption theory, organizational change management, and innovation diffusion perspectives into four-phase approach for GenAI adoption

## Executive Summary
FAIGMOE addresses the critical gap in Generative AI adoption frameworks for midsize organizations and enterprises by providing a comprehensive four-phase approach: Strategic Assessment, Planning and Use Case Development, Implementation and Integration, and Operationalization and Optimization. The framework integrates technology adoption theory with organizational change management and innovation diffusion perspectives, specifically tailored to address the resource constraints of midsize firms and complexity constraints of enterprises. FAIGMOE incorporates GenAI-specific considerations including prompt engineering and hallucination management, offering scalable guidance and actionable implementation protocols with governance templates.

## Method Summary
FAIGMOE was developed as a conceptual framework synthesizing multiple theoretical perspectives on technology adoption, organizational change management, and innovation diffusion. The framework emerged from a comprehensive literature review spanning technology adoption theory, organizational change management frameworks, innovation diffusion models, and Generative AI-specific considerations. The four-phase structure was designed to address the unique challenges faced by midsize organizations and enterprises, with particular emphasis on resource optimization and scalability. The framework incorporates both general technology adoption principles and GenAI-specific elements such as prompt engineering techniques and hallucination management strategies.

## Key Results
- Provides first comprehensive conceptual framework explicitly addressing GenAI adoption across organizational scales
- Integrates four-phase approach: Strategic Assessment, Planning and Use Case Development, Implementation and Integration, and Operationalization and Optimization
- Incorporates GenAI-specific considerations including prompt engineering and hallucination management
- Offers scalable guidance tailored to resource-constrained midsize firms and complexity-constrained enterprises

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FAIGMOE works by systematically addressing the technology adoption lifecycle while incorporating GenAI-specific challenges and organizational constraints. The framework's strength lies in its integration of established technology adoption theories with organizational change management principles, creating a holistic approach that considers both technical and human factors. The four-phase structure provides clear progression pathways while allowing flexibility for organizational context. GenAI-specific elements like prompt engineering and hallucination management address the unique technical challenges of Generative AI systems, while the framework's scalability features enable adaptation across different organizational sizes and resource levels.

## Foundational Learning
- **Technology Adoption Theory**: Essential for understanding organizational readiness and resistance patterns. Quick check: Assess current organizational technology maturity level and identify key stakeholders' technology adoption behaviors.
- **Organizational Change Management**: Critical for successful implementation across different organizational structures. Quick check: Map change impact across departments and identify change champions within each unit.
- **Innovation Diffusion Models**: Necessary for understanding adoption rates and scaling strategies. Quick check: Analyze historical adoption patterns of previous technology initiatives within the organization.
- **GenAI-Specific Considerations**: Vital for addressing unique challenges like prompt engineering and hallucination management. Quick check: Evaluate current AI governance policies and identify gaps specific to Generative AI.
- **Resource Optimization Principles**: Key for adapting framework to resource-constrained environments. Quick check: Conduct resource audit to identify available technical and human capital.
- **Scalability Frameworks**: Important for ensuring framework applicability across different organizational sizes. Quick check: Test framework components at small scale before enterprise-wide implementation.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Strategic Assessment -> Planning and Use Case Development -> Implementation and Integration -> Operationalization and Optimization
- **Critical Path**: Strategic Assessment must complete before Planning; Planning must complete before Implementation; Implementation must complete before Operationalization
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Balance between comprehensive governance and implementation speed; trade-off between standardization and customization; resource allocation between phases
- **Failure Signatures**: Strategic misalignment leading to poor use case selection; inadequate change management causing adoption resistance; insufficient testing resulting in integration failures; lack of optimization leading to suboptimal performance
- **3 First Experiments**:
  1. Pilot implementation in single department with limited scope
  2. A/B testing of different prompt engineering approaches
  3. Small-scale hallucination detection and mitigation protocol testing

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalizability beyond midsize organizations to larger enterprises remains uncertain
- Applicability to highly regulated industries requires empirical validation
- Relative importance of GenAI-specific factors versus traditional AI adoption challenges is unclear

## Confidence
- Framework Core Structure (four-phase approach): Medium
- GenAI-Specific Components (prompt engineering, hallucination management): Low
- Scalability and Resource Optimization Claims: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Field testing of FAIGMOE across at least three different industry sectors with varying regulatory requirements
2. Longitudinal study tracking implementation success rates across all four phases in midsize organizations
3. Comparative analysis of FAIGMOE's effectiveness against existing technology adoption frameworks in similar organizational contexts
