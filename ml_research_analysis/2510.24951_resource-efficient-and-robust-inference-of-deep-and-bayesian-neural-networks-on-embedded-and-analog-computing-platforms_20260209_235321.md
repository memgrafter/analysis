# Resource-Efficient and Robust Inference of Deep and Bayesian Neural Networks on Embedded and Analog Computing Platforms

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.24951
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24951
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: This thesis advances resource-efficient and robust inference of both deterministic and Bayesian neural networks, focusing on embedded and analog hardware platforms. It bridges algorithmic design and physical realization to balance computational efficiency with reliability.

## Executive Summary
This thesis advances resource-efficient and robust inference of both deterministic and Bayesian neural networks, focusing on embedded and analog hardware platforms. It bridges algorithmic design and physical realization to balance computational efficiency with reliability. For deterministic networks, the Galen framework performs automatic, hardware-aware compression using sensitivity analysis and latency measurements to jointly optimize pruning and quantization. For analog accelerators, modeling and training strategies were developed to handle device-specific noise and imperfections, culminating in Variance-Aware Noisy Training (VANT) to improve robustness under nonstationary conditions. For Bayesian neural networks, efficient inference was enabled through the Probabilistic Forward Pass (PFP), a closed-form approximation of variational inference integrated into the TVM compiler stack for embedded ARM processors, achieving up to 4,200× speedups over sampling-based baselines. Ensemble methods such as Repulsive Last-Layer Ensembles were also explored, providing high uncertainty estimation quality at minimal cost. Finally, photonic hardware was investigated as a platform for probabilistic inference, leveraging chaotic light as a physical entropy source. Together, these contributions demonstrate that efficiency and reliability can be advanced jointly through algorithm-hardware co-design, establishing a foundation for trustworthy and energy-efficient machine learning systems.

## Method Summary
The thesis presents a comprehensive approach to efficient and robust neural network inference across deterministic and Bayesian models, targeting embedded and analog computing platforms. For deterministic networks, the Galen framework automates hardware-aware compression by integrating sensitivity analysis and latency measurements to jointly optimize pruning and quantization. For analog hardware, the work introduces modeling and training strategies that account for device-specific noise and imperfections, culminating in Variance-Aware Noisy Training (VANT) to enhance robustness under nonstationary noise conditions. For Bayesian inference, the Probabilistic Forward Pass (PFP) offers a closed-form approximation of variational inference, integrated into the TVM compiler for ARM processors, delivering up to 4,200× speedups over sampling-based methods. Additionally, ensemble-based uncertainty estimation (e.g., Repulsive Last-Layer Ensembles) and photonic hardware for probabilistic inference are explored. The research emphasizes algorithm-hardware co-design to jointly advance efficiency and reliability.

## Key Results
- Galen framework achieves automatic, hardware-aware compression of deterministic networks using sensitivity analysis and latency measurements.
- VANT improves robustness of analog hardware inference under nonstationary noise conditions.
- PFP enables up to 4,200× speedup for Bayesian neural network inference on embedded ARM processors.
- Ensemble methods (e.g., Repulsive Last-Layer Ensembles) provide high-quality uncertainty estimates at low computational cost.
- Photonic hardware leverages chaotic light for physical entropy in probabilistic inference.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The work succeeds by tightly coupling algorithmic innovations with hardware-specific constraints and characteristics. For deterministic networks, Galen's hardware-aware compression aligns model sparsity and quantization with actual latency profiles, ensuring real-world efficiency gains. VANT explicitly models and trains against analog hardware noise, making the resulting networks robust to the nonstationary and stochastic behaviors inherent in analog devices. PFP's closed-form approximation bypasses expensive sampling, enabling fast Bayesian inference on resource-constrained embedded platforms. Ensemble methods exploit the diversity and regularization benefits of model ensembles without incurring sampling overhead. Finally, photonic hardware exploits the physical properties of light for probabilistic computation, using inherent chaos as a source of entropy. This multi-pronged, hardware-aware approach enables simultaneous gains in efficiency and robustness.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Galen (pruning/quantization) -> VANT (analog robustness) -> PFP (Bayesian inference) -> TVM (compiler stack) -> ARM/Analog/Photonic (hardware targets)
**Critical Path**: Model compression and robustness enhancements feed into the PFP inference pipeline, which is compiled via TVM and deployed to target hardware.
**Design Tradeoffs**: Speed vs. accuracy in PFP; model size vs. robustness in VANT; computational cost vs. uncertainty quality in ensembles.
**Failure Signatures**: Over-aggressive compression degrades accuracy; insufficient noise modeling reduces analog robustness; PFP approximation may lose calibration under complex models.
**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Benchmark Galen's compression on a commercial edge device with real latency measurements.
2. Test VANT's robustness under controlled, nonstationary analog noise conditions.
3. Evaluate PFP's accuracy-speed tradeoff on a large-scale Bayesian model compared to full variational inference.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How generalizable is Galen's hardware-aware compression across diverse edge devices and real-world benchmarks?
- Can VANT maintain robustness under highly nonstationary noise conditions found in practical analog hardware?
- What is the precise trade-off between PFP's approximation accuracy and runtime efficiency for complex models?
- Do ensemble-based uncertainty estimation methods consistently match the calibration quality of sampling-based approaches?
- Is photonic hardware for probabilistic inference practically scalable and reproducible beyond early-stage research?

## Limitations
- Galen's effectiveness across diverse real-world edge devices remains to be fully validated.
- VANT's performance under highly nonstationary noise conditions is less certain due to limited real-world testing.
- PFP's approximation accuracy may vary with model complexity and dataset characteristics.
- Ensemble methods may not always match the uncertainty calibration of more expensive sampling-based approaches.
- Photonic hardware's practical scalability and reproducibility are still open questions.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate Galen's compression performance on a broader range of commercial edge devices and benchmarks.
