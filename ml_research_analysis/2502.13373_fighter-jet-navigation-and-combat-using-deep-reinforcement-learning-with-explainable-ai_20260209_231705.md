# Fighter Jet Navigation and Combat using Deep Reinforcement Learning with Explainable AI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.13373
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13373
- Reference count: 9
- This paper develops an AI-based fighter jet agent using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) within a Pygame simulation to handle multi-objective tasks such as navigation, target engagement, and enemy evasion

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning approach for fighter jet navigation and combat using a double deep Q-network (DDQN) algorithm within a Pygame simulation environment. The agent is designed to handle multiple objectives including navigation, target engagement, and enemy evasion through a carefully constructed reward function. The research emphasizes explainability by analyzing factual and counterfactual reward scenarios to understand the agent's decision-making process. Results demonstrate over 80% task completion rate across 1000 test episodes with consistent learning progression.

## Method Summary
The study employs a DDQN algorithm implemented in a Pygame-based simulation environment where the fighter jet agent learns to navigate, engage targets, and evade enemies. The state space is discretized to simplify decision-making, and actions are defined as discrete choices for movement and combat. A reward function is designed to balance multiple objectives including mission completion, resource efficiency, and intelligent decision-making. Hyperparameters are optimized through empirical trial and error rather than systematic methods. The explainability component analyzes reward patterns to provide insights into why certain actions were taken by the agent.

## Key Results
- Over 80% task completion rate across 1000 test episodes
- Consistent learning progression reflected in average reward and episode length metrics
- Explainability analysis reveals agent decision rationale through factual and counterfactual reward examination

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The DDQN algorithm effectively learns optimal policies through trial and error in the simulation environment. The discrete state and action spaces reduce computational complexity while maintaining sufficient granularity for meaningful decisions. The multi-objective reward function guides the agent toward behaviors that balance mission success with resource efficiency and tactical awareness. The explainability analysis provides transparency into the agent's decision-making process, validating that learned behaviors align with intended objectives.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Simulation Environment -> DDQN Agent -> Reward Function -> Action Selection -> State Update

**Critical Path:** State observation → Neural network Q-value estimation → Action selection → Environment response → Reward calculation → State update

**Design Tradeoffs:** Discrete vs continuous state spaces (simplicity vs fidelity), computational efficiency vs simulation realism, explainability vs model complexity

**Failure Signatures:** Reward stagnation indicates learning failure, high variance in episode length suggests instability, low task completion reveals insufficient policy learning

**First Experiments:**
1. Validate basic navigation without combat objectives
2. Test target engagement in controlled scenarios
3. Evaluate enemy evasion in simplified environments

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Simulation environment represents simplified abstraction lacking real-world complexity
- Discrete state and action spaces may not capture continuous flight dynamics
- Reward function design and hyperparameter optimization through trial and error may introduce biases

## Confidence
- High confidence in the DRL methodology implementation and simulation framework
- Medium confidence in the explainability analysis and reward function design
- Low confidence in real-world applicability due to simulation simplifications

## Next Checks
1. Validate the reward function sensitivity by systematically testing alternative reward structures and their impact on agent behavior
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing DDQN with other DRL algorithms (PPO, SAC) to assess algorithm choice robustness
3. Test transfer learning capabilities by retraining the agent in progressively more complex simulation environments with realistic physics models
