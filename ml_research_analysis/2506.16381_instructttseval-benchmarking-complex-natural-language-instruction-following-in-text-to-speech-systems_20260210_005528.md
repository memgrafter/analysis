# InstructTTSEval: Benchmarking Complex Natural-Language Instruction Following in Text-to-Speech Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.16381
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16381
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: A benchmark dataset and evaluation framework for instruction-following TTS systems covering acoustic parameters, style directives, and role-play scenarios

## Executive Summary
InstructTTSEval introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating instruction-following capabilities in text-to-speech systems, addressing the gap between existing TTS models' ability to generate natural speech and their capacity to interpret and execute complex natural language instructions. The benchmark comprises three tasks spanning low-level acoustic control to high-level expressive style inference, supported by a 6k-instruction dataset with reference audio. Automatic evaluation using Gemini as a judge reveals that closed-source models significantly outperform open-source alternatives, though all models fall short of human-level expressiveness in areas like emotional transitions and character-specific timbres.

## Method Summary
The authors constructed InstructTTSEval by first generating captions for 6,000 reference audio samples using Gemini, then creating natural language instructions from these captions using GPT-4o. The benchmark evaluates three distinct tasks: Acoustic-Parameter Specification (precise control over pitch, speed, and volume), Descriptive-Style Directive (interpreting style descriptions without explicit parameters), and Role-Play (character imitation). Models are evaluated using a three-phase process: automatic transcription comparison, human assessment of top candidates, and automatic scoring via Gemini's instruction-following capability. The dataset emphasizes diversity in scenarios, speakers, and acoustic parameters to test model generalization across different instruction types.

## Key Results
- Closed-source models (Gemini, GPT-4o-mini-TTS) significantly outperform open-source models across all three tasks
- All models struggle with reproducing natural vocal events, managing emotional transitions, and synthesizing character-specific timbres
- Performance gaps persist even for simple acoustic parameter instructions, indicating fundamental challenges in instruction interpretation
- The Acoustic-Parameter Specification task shows models have difficulty achieving precise control over speech characteristics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark's effectiveness stems from its multi-task design that progressively increases instruction complexity from explicit parameter control to implicit style inference and character imitation. By using reference audio as ground truth and LLM-based evaluation, the framework captures both objective acoustic differences and subjective quality aspects. The instruction generation process through caption-to-instruction transformation creates a scalable way to produce diverse, realistic instructions while maintaining alignment with achievable speech targets.

## Foundational Learning

**Text-to-Speech Fundamentals**
Why needed: Understanding TTS pipeline components and acoustic modeling is essential for grasping benchmark requirements
Quick check: Can identify vocoder role and parametric vs neural approaches

**Instruction Following in Language Models**
Why needed: Core to understanding how models interpret and execute natural language directives
Quick check: Can distinguish between explicit parameter instructions vs descriptive style directives

**Acoustic Parameter Space**
Why needed: Critical for understanding the specification task and evaluation metrics
Quick check: Can map pitch, speed, volume to perceptual speech qualities

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Instruction Generator -> TTS Model -> Audio Output -> Automatic Evaluation -> Human Assessment

Critical path: Instruction input → Text processing → Acoustic modeling → Waveform synthesis → Quality evaluation

Design tradeoffs: Automatic evaluation vs human judgment; synthetic instruction generation vs real user instructions; reference audio selection strategy

Failure signatures: Models fail on emotional transitions, vocal events reproduction, and character timbre synthesis; performance degrades on implicit style instructions

First experiments:
1. Test baseline TTS model on simple acoustic parameter instructions
2. Evaluate model performance on out-of-distribution instruction types
3. Compare automatic vs human evaluation scores for the same outputs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper doesn't explicitly call out open questions but raises implicit ones about the scalability of instruction-following TTS, the relationship between instruction complexity and model performance, and whether current evaluation methodologies adequately capture human perception of speech quality.

## Limitations

- Reliance on LLM-based automatic evaluation may not fully capture perceptual nuances compared to human evaluation
- Synthetic instruction dataset may introduce biases or unrealistic instruction patterns
- Performance gap between closed-source and open-source models raises questions about fundamental architectural differences vs training data effects

## Confidence

High: Systematic benchmark construction methodology, consistent performance observations across multiple evaluation dimensions
Medium: Relative performance rankings between model families, task difficulty assessments
Low: Absolute performance metrics, claims about human-level expressiveness without extensive human evaluation data

## Next Checks

1. Conduct extensive human perceptual studies to validate automatic evaluation scores, particularly for the Role-Play task where subjective judgment is critical
2. Test model generalization by evaluating performance on out-of-distribution instructions not seen during benchmark development
3. Investigate the impact of different reference audio selection strategies on the Acoustic-Parameter Specification task to ensure robust task design
