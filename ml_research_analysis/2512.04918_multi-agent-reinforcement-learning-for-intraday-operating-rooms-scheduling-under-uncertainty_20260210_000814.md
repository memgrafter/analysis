# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Intraday Operating Rooms Scheduling under Uncertainty
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.04918
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04918
- Reference count: 7
- Primary result: MARL-based policy outperforms six rule-based heuristics on intraday OR scheduling across seven metrics.

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the complex problem of intraday operating room scheduling under uncertainty, where elective surgeries must be dynamically rescheduled to accommodate urgent and emergency cases while managing delays, sequence-dependent setups, and overtime. The authors propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework where each OR is an autonomous agent trained via Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with centralized training and decentralized execution. A sequential assignment protocol constructs conflict-free joint schedules within each epoch, and a unified reward function captures throughput, timeliness, and staff workload through type-specific penalties and an overtime term.

Extensive simulation experiments on a six-OR, eight-surgery-type setting demonstrate that the learned policy consistently outperforms six rule-based heuristics across seven evaluation metrics and three data subsets (elective, urgent, emergency). The approach achieves better overall efficiency, reduced waiting times, and maintained throughput, while policy analytics reveal interpretable behaviors such as batching similar cases, prioritizing emergencies, and balancing load across ORs. Theoretical analysis provides a suboptimality bound for the sequential decomposition, though it relies on independence assumptions. Limitations include OR homogeneity and omission of explicit staffing constraints, but the method offers a practical, interpretable, and tunable data-driven complement to optimization for real-time OR scheduling.

## Method Summary
The method employs a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for intraday OR scheduling under uncertainty. Each OR is modeled as an autonomous agent trained via Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with centralized training and decentralized execution. A within-epoch sequential assignment protocol constructs conflict-free joint schedules, where agents select patients one at a time without conflicting with prior assignments. The reward function incorporates type-specific quadratic delay penalties and a terminal overtime penalty to balance throughput, timeliness, and staff workload. The approach handles elective, urgent, and emergency surgeries with sequence-dependent setup times, and uses historical data to calibrate demand distributions.

## Key Results
- MARL policy outperforms six rule-based heuristics across seven metrics (e.g., total completion time, waiting time, overtime) on three evaluation subsets (elective, urgent, emergency).
- The learned policy achieves better overall efficiency, reduced waiting times, and maintained throughput in realistic six-OR simulations with eight surgery types.
- Policy analytics reveal interpretable behaviors such as batching similar cases, prioritizing emergencies, and balancing load across ORs.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The MARL approach works by decomposing the complex, interdependent OR scheduling problem into decentralized decision-making with centralized training. Each OR agent learns to balance local objectives (its own schedule quality) with global coordination through the sequential assignment protocol and shared reward structure. PPO enables stable learning with bounded policy updates, while the quadratic delay penalties and overtime term in the reward function explicitly encode the trade-offs between throughput, timeliness, and staff workload. The sequential assignment within epochs ensures conflict-free schedules without requiring explicit joint action space exploration, making the problem tractable while still capturing essential dependencies between ORs.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)**: Needed to model independent ORs as agents that must coordinate without centralized control during execution. Quick check: each agent has its own policy and state, but shares a joint reward and training process.
- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: Required for stable policy learning with bounded updates, avoiding destructive large policy changes. Quick check: uses clipped probability ratios to limit policy deviation during training.
- **Sequential assignment protocol**: Needed to construct conflict-free joint schedules efficiently without exploring the full joint action space. Quick check: agents select patients one at a time, each respecting previous assignments to avoid conflicts.
- **Centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE)**: Required to enable global coordination learning while maintaining operational independence. Quick check: agents share information during training but act independently during scheduling.
- **Quadratic delay penalties**: Needed to capture the nonlinear impact of delays on patient outcomes and system performance. Quick check: penalty grows quadratically with delay time, reflecting increasing cost of longer waits.
- **Overtime penalty in terminal reward**: Required to explicitly account for staff workload and operational costs in the optimization objective. Quick check: large negative reward applied when cumulative overtime exceeds threshold at epoch end.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: PPO Trainer -> MARL Agents (ORs) -> Sequential Assignment Protocol -> Environment (OR System) -> Reward Calculator -> PPO Trainer
- **Critical path**: Environment generates state -> Agents select patients sequentially -> Schedule constructed -> Reward calculated -> PPO update -> New policy deployed
- **Design tradeoffs**: Sequential assignment trades optimality for computational tractability; homogeneous OR assumption simplifies learning but limits real-world applicability; omitted staffing constraints reduce model complexity but may affect feasibility.
- **Failure signatures**: Poor coordination leading to idle ORs; excessive overtime indicating misaligned reward weights; inability to handle urgent cases suggesting insufficient prioritization in policy.
- **3 first experiments**: 1) Compare learned policy vs. best heuristic on synthetic data with known optimal solutions. 2) Ablation study: remove sequential assignment to test necessity of conflict-free construction. 3) Policy transfer: evaluate learned policy on data from different hospital settings.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided.

## Limitations
- Assumes homogeneous ORs, limiting applicability to heterogeneous hospital settings with different OR capabilities.
- Omits explicit staffing constraints (nurse/anaesthetist schedules), which are critical in real OR operations.
- Suboptimality bound relies on independence assumptions that may not hold in dense OR schedules.

## Confidence
- Policy superiority claims: High
- Interpretability of learned behaviors: High
- Theoretical bound validity: Medium (due to simplifying assumptions)
- Real-world applicability: Medium (based on synthetic data evaluation)

## Next Checks
1. Field testing in a live OR environment to assess real-world performance and robustness.
2. Sensitivity analysis with heterogeneous OR capabilities and explicit staffing constraints to evaluate model limitations.
3. Comparison against state-of-the-art optimization solvers on identical problem instances to quantify the gap between learned and optimal policies.
