# Enhancing the Interpretability of Rule-based Explanations through Information Retrieval

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.05976
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05976
- Reference count: 33
- Proposes attribution-based approach using tf-idf metrics to cluster model attributes into semantically coherent factors for enhanced interpretability of rule-based AI explanations

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of interpreting rule-based AI models by introducing an attribution-based approach that clusters model attributes into semantically coherent factors using information retrieval techniques. The method employs tf-idf metrics to compute the relevance of these factors, creating more interpretable visualizations for predicting arm lymphedema risk after breast cancer radiotherapy. A user study comparing enhanced explanations with raw model predictions demonstrated statistically significant improvements in both interpretability and usefulness, with enhanced radar graphs and factor lists receiving higher ratings from both AI experts and non-AI experts.

## Method Summary
The approach clusters model attributes into semantically coherent factors and computes their relevance using tf-idf metrics from information retrieval. This attribution-based method transforms raw rule-based explanations into more interpretable visualizations, specifically radar graphs and factor lists, that highlight the most relevant contributing factors to model predictions.

## Key Results
- User study (n=24) showed statistically significant improvements in interpretability and usefulness of enhanced explanations
- Enhanced radar graphs and factor lists received significantly higher ratings than raw rule-based explanations
- Both AI experts and non-AI experts demonstrated improved understanding of model predictions using the enhanced approach

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The tf-idf approach works by identifying and emphasizing the most semantically meaningful factors in rule-based explanations, reducing cognitive load for users interpreting complex medical risk predictions.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Rule-based Model -> Attribution Engine -> tf-idf Clustering -> Semantic Factor Generation -> Visualization Engine -> Enhanced Explanations

**Critical Path**: The attribution engine identifies relevant attributes, tf-idf clustering groups them into semantic factors, and the visualization engine creates interpretable outputs (radar graphs and factor lists).

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach balances computational complexity of tf-idf calculations against interpretability gains, choosing semantic clustering over simpler frequency-based methods for better user comprehension.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor clustering quality leads to confusing factor groupings, while inappropriate tf-idf parameter tuning can overemphasize or underemphasize relevant factors.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test tf-idf parameter sensitivity on a small subset of rules
2. Validate clustering coherence with domain experts on sample factors
3. Compare visualization formats (radar vs list) with pilot users

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Validation limited to single breast cancer radiotherapy use case
- User study sample size (n=24) may not represent broader clinical practice
- Does not demonstrate translation to improved clinical decision-making or patient outcomes

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Core methodology effectiveness | Medium |
| User study findings | High |
| Generalizability across domains | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the study across multiple medical domains and different types of rule-based models to verify generalizability
2. Assess whether enhanced explanations lead to measurable improvements in clinical decision-making accuracy and patient outcomes
3. Compare the tf-idf approach with alternative information retrieval and clustering methods to establish relative effectiveness
