# Massively Multimodal Foundation Models: A Framework for Capturing Dependencies with Specialized Mixture-of-Experts

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2509.25678
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25678
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Achieves AUROC 85.40% and F1 84.97% on MIMIC-IV while providing interpretable, domain-aligned routing patterns

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of scaling multimodal learning to settings with dozens of heterogeneous input streams, where each stream constitutes a separate modality with distinct sampling rates, noise characteristics, and temporal dynamics. Existing Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures route tokens based on similarity alone, failing to account for rich temporal dependencies across modalities. The proposed MERGE framework explicitly quantifies temporal dependencies between modality pairs across multiple time lags using a multi-scale BATCH estimator that computes redundancy, uniqueness, and synergy (RUS) values. A dependency-aware router then dispatches tokens to specialized experts based on interaction type, enabling experts to learn generalizable dependency-processing skills.

## Method Summary
The MERGE framework introduces a dependency estimation module that computes RUS values between modality pairs using a multi-scale BATCH estimator, capturing redundancy, uniqueness, and synergy across temporal lags. This RUS matrix serves as input to a dependency-aware router that assigns tokens to specialized experts based on the type of modality interaction (redundant, unique, or synergistic). The framework scales efficiently to dozens of modalities while maintaining interpretability through routing patterns that align with domain knowledge. Experimental validation demonstrates substantial performance improvements across healthcare, activity recognition, and affective computing benchmarks, with particular success on the MIMIC-IV dataset.

## Key Results
- Achieves AUROC scores of 85.40% and F1 scores of 84.97% on MIMIC-IV
- Demonstrates substantial performance gains across healthcare, activity recognition, and affective computing benchmarks
- Provides interpretable routing patterns aligned with domain knowledge
- Scales efficiently to dozens of heterogeneous modalities while maintaining performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by explicitly modeling temporal dependencies between modalities rather than relying on similarity-based routing alone. By computing redundancy, uniqueness, and synergy values across multiple time lags, the approach captures the full spectrum of modality interactions. The dependency-aware router leverages this rich dependency structure to assign tokens to specialized experts who can learn to process specific interaction types, rather than forcing a one-size-fits-all expert architecture. This specialization enables the model to capture complex temporal relationships while maintaining interpretability through routing patterns that reflect domain knowledge.

## Foundational Learning
- **Temporal dependency estimation**: Needed to capture rich relationships between modalities across time lags; quick check: validate RUS values correlate with known modality interactions
- **Multi-scale analysis**: Required for handling diverse sampling rates and temporal dynamics; quick check: compare performance across different temporal window sizes
- **Information-theoretic metrics**: Redundancy, uniqueness, synergy provide interpretable interaction types; quick check: verify metric interpretation aligns with domain expertise
- **Mixture-of-Experts routing**: Enables specialization for different dependency types; quick check: analyze expert specialization patterns
- **RUS matrix construction**: Aggregates pairwise dependencies into a comprehensive interaction map; quick check: validate matrix sparsity and interpretability
- **Class imbalance handling**: Critical for reliable RUS estimation in skewed datasets; quick check: test performance under varying imbalance ratios

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Raw Modalities -> Multi-scale BATCH Estimator -> RUS Matrix -> Dependency-aware Router -> Specialized Experts -> Output

**Critical Path**: The multi-scale BATCH estimator to dependency-aware router pipeline is the core innovation, as it transforms raw modality streams into interpretable dependency structures that guide expert routing decisions.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach trades computational complexity in dependency estimation for improved model performance and interpretability. While the RUS computation adds overhead, it enables specialized expert training and provides domain-aligned insights that simpler routing mechanisms cannot achieve.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degrades when class imbalance severely affects RUS estimation quality, when modality streams are extremely sparse or have highly variable sampling rates, or when the information-theoretic assumptions underlying RUS metrics break down for certain modality pairs.

**First Experiments**:
1. Validate RUS estimation quality by comparing against expert-annotated modality relationships on a small, controlled dataset
2. Conduct ablation studies removing the dependency-aware routing component to quantify its contribution to performance gains
3. Test robustness by adding synthetic noise to RUS estimates and measuring performance degradation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dependency estimation via multi-scale BATCH relies on assumptions about signal stationarity and may produce noisy estimates when modality streams are extremely sparse or have highly variable sampling rates
- The RUS metric interpretation depends on underlying information-theoretic assumptions that may not hold for all modality pairs or domain contexts
- Performance degradation under severe class imbalance suggests sensitivity to imbalanced RUS estimation, limiting applicability in domains with skewed label distributions

## Confidence
- **High**: Empirical performance improvements over baselines (AUROC 85.40%, F1 84.97% on MIMIC-IV)
- **Medium**: Claims about interpretability of routing patterns and domain alignment
- **Medium**: Claims about robustness to noisy RUS estimates and efficiency gains
- **Low**: Claims about generalizability across all multimodal domains without extensive validation

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate MERGE on multimodal datasets with extreme class imbalance (e.g., 1:100 ratio) to quantify degradation patterns and identify thresholds for reliable RUS estimation
2. Conduct ablation studies varying the multi-scale parameter to determine optimal temporal window sizes across different modality types and sampling rates
3. Compare MERGE's dependency estimates and routing patterns against expert-annotated ground truth for modality relationships in at least two additional domains beyond healthcare
