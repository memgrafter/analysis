# Flick: Few Labels Text Classification using K-Aware Intermediate Learning in Multi-Task Low-Resource Languages

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.10292
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10292
- Reference count: 8
- Primary result: Flick achieves F1-scores up to 72.81% on Arabic datasets and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-label text classification for low-resource languages.

## Executive Summary
The paper addresses the challenge of few-label text classification in low-resource languages, particularly Arabic, where limited labeled data hinders deep learning model performance. The proposed Flick framework introduces a novel two-stage approach that first generates pseudo-labels via K-means clustering on unlabeled data, then refines these pseudo-labels by selecting high-quality clusters to train an intermediate classifier. This refined pseudo-label set is used to fine-tune a pre-trained language model with the limited real labels. Experiments across 14 datasets in Arabic, Urdu, Setswana, and English demonstrate Flick's effectiveness, with significant performance improvements over existing methods.

## Method Summary
Flick employs a two-stage approach to tackle few-label text classification in low-resource languages. First, it generates pseudo-labels using K-means clustering on unlabeled data, creating an initial labeled dataset. Second, it refines these pseudo-labels by selecting high-quality clusters to train an intermediate classifier. This intermediate model then helps identify and filter out noisy pseudo-labels, resulting in a more reliable labeled dataset. Finally, Flick fine-tunes a pre-trained language model using this refined pseudo-label set combined with the limited real labels. This approach leverages both unsupervised clustering and supervised fine-tuning to maximize the utility of scarce labeled data in low-resource language settings.

## Key Results
- Flick achieves F1-scores up to 72.81% on Arabic datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in few-label text classification.
- The framework demonstrates strong generalization across 14 datasets in Arabic, Urdu, Setswana, and English, showing its effectiveness in diverse low-resource language scenarios.
- Experimental results show significant improvements over existing methods, with Flick's two-stage approach effectively addressing the challenges of limited labeled data in low-resource languages.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Flick's effectiveness stems from its innovative two-stage approach to leveraging unlabeled data in low-resource settings. The first stage uses K-means clustering to generate initial pseudo-labels, which helps capture the underlying structure of the unlabeled data without requiring extensive labeled examples. The second stage then refines these pseudo-labels by training an intermediate classifier to identify high-quality clusters, effectively filtering out noise and improving label quality. This refined pseudo-label set, when combined with limited real labels, provides a more robust training signal for fine-tuning pre-trained language models. By intelligently augmenting scarce labeled data with high-quality pseudo-labels, Flick maximizes the utility of available resources and improves classification performance in low-resource language scenarios.

## Foundational Learning
- **K-means clustering**: An unsupervised learning algorithm used to partition unlabeled data into K clusters based on similarity. Why needed: To generate initial pseudo-labels from unlabeled data in the absence of sufficient labeled examples. Quick check: Ensure the number of clusters (K) is appropriately chosen based on dataset characteristics and domain knowledge.
- **Pseudo-label generation**: The process of assigning labels to unlabeled data based on clustering results or model predictions. Why needed: To create additional labeled data for training when real labels are scarce. Quick check: Evaluate the quality and consistency of pseudo-labels using metrics like cluster purity or agreement with domain experts.
- **Intermediate classifier**: A model trained on refined pseudo-labels to further improve label quality before fine-tuning the final model. Why needed: To filter out noisy pseudo-labels and select high-quality clusters for the final training stage. Quick check: Assess the intermediate classifier's performance on a small validation set to ensure it effectively captures meaningful patterns in the data.
- **Fine-tuning pre-trained language models**: Adapting a pre-trained model to a specific task using a smaller, task-specific dataset. Why needed: To leverage existing language knowledge while specializing the model for the target classification task. Quick check: Monitor performance on a validation set during fine-tuning to avoid overfitting on the limited labeled data.
- **Low-resource language adaptation**: Techniques for adapting NLP models to languages with limited available data. Why needed: To extend the benefits of Flick to diverse linguistic contexts beyond well-resourced languages. Quick check: Evaluate performance across languages with varying script systems and morphological complexities to assess linguistic generalization.
- **Cluster quality assessment**: Methods for evaluating the reliability and usefulness of clusters generated by unsupervised algorithms. Why needed: To ensure that pseudo-labels derived from clustering are of sufficient quality for training. Quick check: Use metrics like silhouette score or Davies-Bouldin index to assess cluster separation and compactness.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Pre-trained Language Model -> Fine-tuning Stage -> Final Classifier

Critical Path:
Unlabeled Data -> K-means Clustering -> Initial Pseudo-labels -> Intermediate Classifier -> Refined Pseudo-labels -> Fine-tuning -> Final Model

Design Tradeoffs:
- Clustering algorithm choice: K-means vs. other methods (e.g., DBSCAN, hierarchical clustering)
- Number of clusters (K): Balancing granularity and generalization
- Intermediate classifier architecture: Complexity vs. overfitting risk
- Pseudo-label quality threshold: Strict filtering vs. retaining more data

Failure Signatures:
- Poor clustering results leading to noisy pseudo-labels
- Overfitting on limited real labels during fine-tuning
- Insufficient pseudo-labels to effectively augment the training data
- Language-specific challenges (e.g., morphological complexity, script variations)

First Experiments:
1. Ablation study comparing Flick's two-stage approach to direct fine-tuning with pseudo-labels on pre-trained models.
2. Evaluation of Flick's performance across diverse low-resource languages with varying script systems and morphological complexities.
3. Sensitivity analysis of Flick to the number of pseudo-labels generated and adaptive strategies for pseudo-label quality assessment.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The framework's performance claims are primarily validated on Arabic datasets, with limited testing on other low-resource languages, raising questions about generalizability across diverse linguistic contexts.
- The reliance on K-means clustering for pseudo-label generation may introduce biases, particularly for languages with complex morphological structures or non-Latin scripts.
- The selection criteria for high-quality clusters and the impact of varying numbers of pseudo-labels on final performance are not thoroughly explored.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The core Flick methodology and its two-stage approach are clearly articulated and reproducible. The experimental setup, including dataset selection and evaluation metrics, is well-documented.
- **Medium Confidence**: The performance improvements over baselines are demonstrated but may be influenced by specific hyperparameter choices and the limited diversity of evaluation datasets.
- **Low Confidence**: The framework's effectiveness in truly resource-constrained scenarios (e.g., <100 labeled examples) and its robustness to noisy pseudo-labels are not comprehensively validated.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of the intermediate classifier stage versus direct fine-tuning with pseudo-labels on pre-trained models.
2. Evaluate Flick's performance on additional low-resource languages with varying script systems and morphological complexities to assess linguistic generalization.
3. Test the framework's sensitivity to the number of pseudo-labels generated and explore adaptive strategies for pseudo-label quality assessment.
