# PER-DPP Sampling Framework and Its Application in Path Planning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.07411
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07411
- Reference count: 10
- Key result: PER-DPP-Elastic DQN achieves 56.7% success rate vs 51.9% DQN on complex 2D maze

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the sample homogeneity problem in reinforcement learning experience replay by proposing a hybrid PER-DPP sampling framework. The approach combines prioritized experience replay (PER) with determinantal point processes (DPP) to balance learning efficiency with sample diversity. The framework is integrated with an Elastic DQN algorithm featuring adaptive step-size regulation through HDBSCAN clustering and multi-step returns. Experiments in 2D maze navigation demonstrate superior performance over standard DQN and Elastic DQN baselines.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework combines three key innovations: (1) PER-DPP sampling that first selects high-priority samples via TD-error ranking, then applies Fast Greedy DPP for diversity maximization using incremental Cholesky decomposition; (2) Elastic DQN with HDBSCAN clustering to adaptively regulate step sizes and incorporate multi-step returns; (3) a reward structure designed for path planning with goal (+500), collision (-500), stationary (-200), and distance-based (+100/-100) rewards. The method is evaluated in 16×16 grid mazes with three obstacle configurations, using state representations of {dx, dy, ob} and 8-directional actions.

## Key Results
- On complex Map 1, PER-DPP-Elastic DQN achieves 56.7% success rate vs 51.9% for DQN
- Optimal path lengths reduced to 23 vs 27 for DQN on Map 1
- Fewer path turns (7 vs 10) compared to Elastic DQN on Map 1
- Consistent improvements across all three maze configurations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework addresses the sample homogeneity problem where standard PER can oversample similar high-error transitions, leading to overfitting and poor generalization. By combining PER's efficiency in selecting important samples with DPP's diversity maximization, the method ensures both learning signal strength and state-space coverage. The Elastic DQN component further enhances exploration through adaptive step-size regulation and multi-step returns, preventing premature convergence to suboptimal policies.

## Foundational Learning
- **Determinantal Point Processes (DPP)**: Probabilistic models that favor diverse subsets through repulsion mechanisms; needed for balancing sample importance with diversity
- **Fast Greedy MAP DPP**: Incremental Cholesky-based approximation for efficient DPP sampling; needed to make DPP tractable for large buffers
- **HDBSCAN clustering**: Density-based clustering that identifies noise and clusters at multiple scales; needed for adaptive step-size regulation
- **Multi-step returns**: TD targets that incorporate rewards from multiple future steps; needed to improve credit assignment and reduce bias
- **Elastic DQN step regulation**: Dynamic adjustment of exploration step sizes based on cluster membership; needed to prevent premature convergence
- **TD-error prioritization**: Experience replay sampling proportional to temporal difference error; needed to focus learning on informative transitions

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Experience Replay Buffer -> PER Selection -> Fast Greedy DPP -> Elastic DQN Network -> HDBSCAN Memory Bank -> Step-size Regulation

**Critical path**: PER ranking (O(N log N)) → DPP subsampling (O(M²N)) → Elastic DQN training (O(batch_size × network_complexity))

**Design tradeoffs**: PER-DPP increases computational overhead for better sample quality vs standard PER's speed; Elastic DQN's adaptive steps add complexity but improve exploration vs fixed ε-greedy

**Failure signatures**: 
- Low success rates with high variance indicate insufficient diversity in sampled experiences
- Slow convergence suggests overly conservative step-size regulation
- High computational cost during sampling points to DPP optimization issues

**First experiments**:
1. Verify PER ranking correctly orders samples by TD-error with proper importance sampling weights
2. Test Fast Greedy DPP on small synthetic datasets to validate diversity maximization
3. Compare success rates with/without DPP step to isolate its contribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly stated in the paper.

## Limitations
- Limited to 2D discrete action spaces (8-directional movement) without validation in continuous control
- Static maze environments don't test adaptability to dynamic obstacle changes during training
- No ablation studies to isolate contributions of PER-DPP vs Elastic DQN components
- Computational overhead of DPP sampling not characterized across different buffer sizes

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Conceptual framework combining PER with DPP for diversity-aware sampling is mathematically sound
- **Medium confidence**: Integration of Elastic DQN components with PER-DPP sampling is feasible but requires careful implementation
- **Low confidence**: Specific performance improvements reported cannot be verified without exact hyperparameter configurations

## Next Checks
1. Implement parameter sensitivity analysis varying PER-to-DPP batch size ratio and DPP kernel width
2. Compare PER-DPP framework against pure PER and pure DPP baselines to isolate component contributions
3. Validate Fast Greedy DPP implementation by checking numerical stability and computational overhead across batch sizes
