# Conformal Prediction in The Loop: A Feedback-Based Uncertainty Model for Trajectory Optimization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.16376
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16376
- Authors: Han Wang; Chao Ning
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proposed Feedback-based Conformal Prediction (Fb-CP) framework improves trajectory optimization by using realized trajectories as feedback to dynamically adjust prediction regions, achieving up to 58.5% cost reduction while maintaining safety guarantees

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel Feedback-based Conformal Prediction (Fb-CP) framework that addresses the challenge of shrinking-horizon trajectory optimization under uncertainty. Unlike traditional conformal prediction methods that rely solely on historical data, Fb-CP leverages realized trajectories as feedback to dynamically adjust prediction regions online. The approach maintains statistical coverage guarantees while improving both performance and safety through adaptive risk allocation. The framework is particularly effective in dynamic environments where uncertainty patterns evolve over time, making it suitable for real-world robotic applications.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a Feedback-based Conformal Prediction (Fb-CP) framework that uses realized trajectories as feedback to adjust prediction regions dynamically. The key innovation is a novel posterior probability calculation method that leverages feedback information from past decisions, enabling online adjustment of prediction regions while maintaining coverage guarantees. The authors also introduce a decision-focused iterative risk allocation algorithm with theoretical convergence guarantees, extending the method to handle distribution shift scenarios. The framework combines conformal prediction theory with trajectory optimization, using realized trajectories to update uncertainty estimates and improve decision-making over time.

## Key Results
- Fb-CP with iterative risk allocation achieves up to 58.5% cost reduction compared to sequential CP while maintaining collision avoidance rates within specified risk tolerances
- Significant performance improvements demonstrated across multiple models (kinematic vehicle, quadrotor, bicycle) and real-world data (Stanford Drone Dataset)
- The framework provides provable safety guarantees through maintained coverage while enabling adaptive risk control for improved trajectory performance
- Extends to handle distribution shift, maintaining effectiveness in non-stationary environments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by creating a feedback loop where actual trajectory realizations inform future prediction regions. This closes the gap between theoretical uncertainty models and real-world behavior, allowing the system to adapt its risk assessment based on observed outcomes. The posterior probability calculation method effectively updates belief about uncertainty distributions using Bayesian principles, while the iterative risk allocation algorithm optimizes the trade-off between performance and safety dynamically.

## Foundational Learning
- **Conformal Prediction Theory**: Provides statistical guarantees for uncertainty quantification. Needed because traditional methods lack rigorous coverage guarantees. Quick check: Verify prediction regions maintain nominal coverage rates in experiments.
- **Shrinking-horizon Trajectory Optimization**: Enables online replanning with updated information. Needed because future uncertainty patterns evolve over time. Quick check: Confirm receding horizon approach maintains computational tractability.
- **Posterior Probability Calculation**: Updates uncertainty beliefs based on observed trajectories. Needed to incorporate feedback information effectively. Quick check: Validate posterior updates improve prediction accuracy over time.
- **Iterative Risk Allocation**: Optimizes the trade-off between performance and safety. Needed to balance competing objectives dynamically. Quick check: Verify convergence of risk allocation algorithm in experiments.
- **Distribution Shift Handling**: Maintains effectiveness in non-stationary environments. Needed for real-world deployment where uncertainty patterns change. Quick check: Test framework performance under varying environmental conditions.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Trajectory Generator -> Conformal Predictor -> Feedback Processor -> Risk Allocator -> Trajectory Generator

**Critical Path**: The trajectory generation process iteratively refines plans by incorporating feedback from previous executions. Conformal prediction provides uncertainty quantification, which feeds into risk allocation. The risk allocator determines how to distribute uncertainty across different trajectory segments, and this information returns to the trajectory generator to produce updated plans.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational complexity for improved adaptability and performance. While the iterative risk allocation algorithm provides better optimization than sequential approaches, it requires more computational resources. The feedback mechanism improves accuracy but depends on the quality and representativeness of realized trajectories.

**Failure Signatures**: The system may fail when feedback information becomes unrepresentative of future uncertainty patterns, particularly in highly non-stationary environments. Performance degradation can occur when the assumed uncertainty models significantly deviate from actual conditions, potentially compromising safety guarantees.

**First Experiments**: 
1. Test Fb-CP performance on kinematic vehicle model with varying uncertainty distributions
2. Evaluate collision avoidance rates on quadrotor model with obstacle-rich environments
3. Validate adaptive behavior on bicycle model with changing road conditions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Effectiveness depends on feedback information being representative of future uncertainty patterns
- Computational overhead of iterative risk allocation may limit real-time applicability in complex scenarios
- Safety guarantees rely on correctness of assumed uncertainty models, which may not hold under significant model misspecification

## Confidence
- High confidence: Coverage guarantees depend on correctness of assumed uncertainty models
- Medium confidence: Performance improvements may not generalize to complex real-world conditions
- Medium confidence: Feedback approach effectiveness in highly non-stationary environments uncertain
- Low confidence: Computational overhead claims require empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework in highly non-stationary environments with rapid distribution shifts to evaluate the robustness of the distribution shift handling mechanisms
2. Conduct extensive computational benchmarking to quantify the real-time feasibility of the iterative risk allocation algorithm across different trajectory optimization problems
3. Validate the safety guarantees under model misspecification scenarios where the assumed uncertainty distributions significantly differ from actual conditions
