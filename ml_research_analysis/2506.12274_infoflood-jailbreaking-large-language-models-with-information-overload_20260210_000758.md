# InfoFlood: Jailbreaking Large Language Models with Information Overload
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.12274
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12274
- Reference count: 26
- InfoFlood exploits linguistic complexity to jailbreak LLMs with up to 96% success rates

## Executive Summary
InfoFlood introduces a novel jailbreaking technique that exploits linguistic complexity to bypass LLM safety filters. By transforming harmful prompts into verbose, technically sophisticated queries through iterative refinement processes, InfoFlood achieves near-perfect success rates on standard jailbreak benchmarks without requiring adversarial prefixes or suffixes. The method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches by up to 3×, demonstrating a critical vulnerability in current LLM safety mechanisms against information overload-based attacks.

## Method Summary
InfoFlood employs a three-stage iterative refinement process: linguistic saturation to increase prompt complexity, rejection analysis to understand safety filter triggers, and saturation refinement to optimize the balance between information overload and malicious intent. The approach transforms simple harmful prompts into elaborate, technically dense queries that evade detection while maintaining their original malicious intent. Unlike traditional jailbreak methods that rely on adversarial prefixes or specific prompt patterns, InfoFlood focuses on overwhelming the model's safety mechanisms through sheer information density and linguistic sophistication.

## Key Results
- Achieved up to 96% success rates on standard jailbreak benchmarks
- Outperformed state-of-the-art methods by up to 3×
- Successfully evaded detection by OpenAI Moderation API, Perspective API, and SmoothLLM

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
InfoFlood exploits the fundamental tension between LLM safety mechanisms and their capacity to process complex information. Safety filters typically rely on pattern matching and semantic analysis to detect harmful content, but these mechanisms struggle when faced with prompts that combine legitimate technical language with malicious intent. The information overload strategy masks harmful objectives within dense, sophisticated text that appears benign to automated filters while retaining its ability to elicit harmful responses from the model. The iterative refinement process optimizes this masking effect by learning which linguistic patterns successfully evade detection while maintaining prompt effectiveness.

## Foundational Learning
**Information Overload**: Excessive data volume that overwhelms processing systems - needed to understand how InfoFlood masks malicious intent through complexity; quick check: verify that added information actually increases prompt length and density without changing core intent.

**Safety Filter Limitations**: Pattern-based detection systems struggle with complex linguistic structures - needed to explain why traditional filters fail against InfoFlood; quick check: test whether simpler, less sophisticated prompts get blocked while InfoFlood queries pass.

**Latent Space Embeddings**: Vector representations of text that capture semantic meaning - needed to understand how InfoFlood queries cluster closer to safe queries; quick check: verify clustering analysis across multiple embedding methods.

**Iterative Refinement**: Progressive optimization through repeated cycles - needed to explain how InfoFlood learns optimal attack patterns; quick check: measure improvement in success rates across refinement iterations.

**Linguistic Saturation**: Process of maximizing information density in text - needed to understand the core mechanism of intent masking; quick check: quantify information content before and after saturation.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: User Prompt -> Linguistic Saturation -> Rejection Analysis -> Saturation Refinement -> InfoFlood Query
**Critical Path**: The iterative refinement loop where each stage builds upon the previous one, with saturation refinement serving as the primary optimization mechanism that balances evasion and effectiveness.
**Design Tradeoffs**: Higher information density improves evasion but risks reducing prompt clarity and effectiveness; iterative refinement balances these competing objectives but increases computational overhead.
**Failure Signatures**: Success rates dropping below 50% indicates saturation refinement isn't optimizing effectively; detection by safety filters suggests insufficient linguistic complexity; model refusal indicates prompt structure issues.
**First Experiments**: 1) Baseline test: simple harmful prompts vs InfoFlood-transformed prompts; 2) Iterative analysis: measure success rate improvement across refinement cycles; 3) Defense testing: evaluate against multiple safety APIs and systems.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to specific model versions (GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini 2.0, LLaMA 3.1) without broader generalizability testing
- Lacks statistical significance testing and confidence intervals for reported success rates
- Does not evaluate adaptive defenses that could specifically target information overload patterns

## Confidence
- InfoFlood effectiveness claims: Medium confidence - supported by benchmark results but lacking statistical rigor and real-world validation
- Defense bypass claims: Medium confidence - demonstrates current system failures but does not assess adaptive countermeasures
- Latent space analysis conclusions: Low confidence - innovative approach but insufficiently validated across alternative embedding methods

## Next Checks
1. Conduct statistical significance testing across multiple independent runs to establish confidence intervals for reported success rates and determine whether the 96% performance is reproducible
2. Evaluate InfoFlood against adaptive defense systems that specifically target information overload patterns, including both static and dynamic detection methods
3. Test InfoFlood across a broader range of model architectures, versions, and deployment contexts to assess generalizability beyond the four specific models evaluated
