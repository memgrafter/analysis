core_contribution: This paper addresses the challenge of video relighting with temporal
  consistency, which is difficult due to the lack of paired video relighting datasets
  and the randomness inherent in diffusion models. The proposed RelightVid framework
  leverages a pre-trained image relighting diffusion model and extends it to video
  by incorporating temporal attention layers and training on a carefully curated dataset
  called LightAtlas.

# RelightVid: Temporal-Consistent Diffusion Model for Video Relighting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.16330
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16330
- Reference count: 13
- Primary result: Video relighting with temporal consistency using diffusion models trained on LightAtlas dataset

## Executive Summary
RelightVid addresses the challenge of video relighting with temporal consistency by extending a pre-trained image relighting diffusion model to video using temporal attention layers. The framework is trained on LightAtlas, a curated dataset combining real-world videos with augmentation and 3D-rendered data under extreme lighting conditions. It supports multiple relighting conditions including background videos, text prompts, and HDR environment maps. The method achieves state-of-the-art results in temporal consistency while preserving illumination priors from the image backbone, demonstrating superior performance in user studies for video smoothness, lighting rationality, and text alignment.

## Method Summary
RelightVid leverages a pre-trained image relighting diffusion model and extends it to video by incorporating temporal attention layers. The model is trained on LightAtlas, a carefully curated dataset containing 3,000 video clips (18,000 images) that includes both real-world videos with augmentation and 3D-rendered data under extreme lighting conditions. The framework supports three relighting conditions: background videos, text prompts, and HDR environment maps. By preserving the illumination priors of its image backbone while adding temporal consistency mechanisms, RelightVid achieves high-quality video relighting that maintains temporal coherence across frames.

## Key Results
- Achieves PSNR of 18.79, SSIM of 0.7832, and LPIPS of 0.1412, improving over baselines
- Demonstrates significant gains in temporal consistency with motion smoothness score of 1.458
- User studies show superior performance in video smoothness, lighting rationality, text alignment, and ID-preservation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
RelightVid works by combining the strengths of pre-trained image diffusion models with temporal attention mechanisms. The image backbone provides strong illumination priors learned from extensive training on image relighting tasks, while temporal attention layers ensure consistency across video frames. The LightAtlas dataset provides diverse training examples covering both realistic and extreme lighting conditions, enabling the model to generalize across different scenarios. The multi-condition support allows flexibility in specifying relighting targets through various modalities.

## Foundational Learning
- Diffusion models for image generation: Essential for understanding the base architecture that RelightVid extends to video. Quick check: Can generate high-quality single images with controllable lighting.
- Temporal attention mechanisms: Critical for maintaining consistency across video frames. Quick check: Should produce smooth transitions between consecutive frames without flickering.
- Dataset curation for video tasks: Important for understanding how LightAtlas was constructed to balance realism and diversity. Quick check: Dataset should cover both common and extreme lighting scenarios.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Pre-trained image diffusion model -> Temporal attention layers -> LightAtlas dataset -> Multiple relighting conditions (background, text, HDR)

Critical path: The core innovation involves integrating temporal attention layers into the pre-trained image diffusion architecture. The model processes video frames sequentially, with temporal attention modules computing cross-frame relationships to ensure consistency. During training, LightAtlas provides paired examples of original and relit video frames across diverse lighting conditions.

Design tradeoffs: The choice to leverage a pre-trained image model preserves strong illumination priors but may limit adaptability to video-specific features. The relatively small LightAtlas dataset (3,000 clips) balances curation quality with practical training constraints. Supporting multiple relighting conditions increases flexibility but requires careful conditioning mechanisms.

Failure signatures: Temporal inconsistencies may appear as flickering or abrupt lighting changes between frames. Poor generalization to extreme lighting conditions may result from limited representation in the training dataset. Mismatch between conditioning inputs and generated output may occur when text prompts or environment maps are ambiguous.

Three first experiments:
1. Test temporal consistency by generating a video with static lighting conditions and measuring frame-to-frame variation
2. Evaluate generalization by applying extreme lighting conditions not present in LightAtlas
3. Compare single-image vs. video relighting performance on identical content to quantify temporal coherence gains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- LightAtlas dataset size (3,000 video clips) may limit generalization to diverse real-world scenarios
- Reliance on 3D-rendered data for extreme lighting conditions raises questions about synthetic-to-real transfer
- Standard metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) may not fully capture perceptual quality of complex lighting scenarios
- User study sample sizes (14-10 participants) limit statistical significance of results

## Confidence

High confidence: Technical architecture soundness, quantitative improvements over baselines

Medium confidence: Temporal consistency claims, dataset curation effectiveness

Low confidence: Generalizability to extreme lighting, performance across diverse video content

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a larger-scale user study (minimum 50 participants) across diverse demographic groups to validate perceptual quality improvements, particularly for complex lighting scenarios.

2. Evaluate RelightVid's performance on a broader range of real-world video content, including challenging scenarios such as rapid motion, occlusions, and diverse lighting conditions not represented in LightAtlas.

3. Compare RelightVid's temporal consistency against state-of-the-art video generation models that are not specifically designed for relighting to establish its relative performance in the broader video generation landscape.
