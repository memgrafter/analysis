# Detecting Emotion Drift in Mental Health Text Using Pre-Trained Transformers

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.13363
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13363
- Authors: Shibani Sankpal
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: DistilBERT achieved 92.7% accuracy in emotion drift detection

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a novel approach to detecting emotion drift in mental health-related texts by analyzing changes in emotional state across sentences. The research employs pre-trained transformer models to classify emotions at the sentence level, construct emotion timelines, and calculate drift scores based on emotional transitions. A custom pipeline processes input text, segments it into sentences, and applies transformer-based classification to identify emotional patterns. The Streamlit application demonstrates real-time emotion drift analysis capabilities, showing that transformer models can effectively capture nuanced emotional changes beyond traditional sentiment analysis. This work offers potential applications for early detection of emotional distress in mental health monitoring contexts.

## Method Summary
The study implements a custom pipeline that segments input text into individual sentences, classifies each sentence's emotion using pre-trained transformer models, constructs emotion timelines showing emotional progression, and calculates drift scores based on detected emotional transitions. The approach focuses on detecting shifts in emotional states across consecutive sentences rather than just overall sentiment. The methodology includes a Streamlit-based application that demonstrates the emotion drift detection capabilities in real-time, allowing users to input text and visualize emotional transitions. The pipeline processes mental health-related texts to identify patterns that may indicate emotional distress or mood changes over the course of a conversation or written expression.

## Key Results
- DistilBERT achieved the highest accuracy at 92.7% for emotion drift detection
- DistilRoBERTa showed lower performance at 83.9% accuracy
- DeBERTa Base performed comparably to DistilBERT at 93.15% accuracy
- Transformer models demonstrated effectiveness in capturing nuanced emotional changes beyond traditional sentiment analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach leverages transformer models' attention mechanisms to capture contextual relationships between words within sentences, enabling accurate emotion classification at the sentence level. By analyzing consecutive sentences, the system can detect subtle emotional transitions that indicate drift. The attention heads identify key emotional indicators while the positional encoding maintains sentence order information crucial for tracking emotional progression. The emotion timeline construction method quantifies these transitions by mapping emotional states across the text sequence, making drift patterns visible and measurable.

## Foundational Learning
- **Sentence-level emotion classification**: Why needed - captures emotional content of individual utterances; Quick check - verify classification accuracy on held-out test set
- **Emotion timeline construction**: Why needed - visualizes emotional progression over text sequence; Quick check - ensure timeline reflects ground truth emotional transitions
- **Drift score calculation**: Why needed - quantifies emotional changes between consecutive sentences; Quick check - validate score increases correlate with actual emotional shifts
- **Transformer attention mechanisms**: Why needed - enables context-aware emotion detection; Quick check - analyze attention weights for emotional keywords
- **Text segmentation**: Why needed - breaks input into analyzable units for sentence-level analysis; Quick check - verify sentence boundaries align with natural language structure

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Text Input -> Text Segmentation -> Sentence Classification -> Emotion Timeline Construction -> Drift Score Calculation -> Visualization

Critical path: Text Input → Text Segmentation → Sentence Classification → Emotion Timeline Construction

Design tradeoffs: The approach prioritizes real-time analysis and interpretability through visualization over more complex modeling of emotional intensity or multi-turn conversation dynamics. Sentence-level classification provides granularity but may miss contextual emotional shifts spanning multiple sentences.

Failure signatures: 
- False negatives occur when subtle emotional transitions are missed due to model confidence thresholds
- False positives arise from misclassifying neutral sentences as emotional changes
- Boundary issues where emotional shifts occur mid-sentence rather than between sentences
- Context loss when sentences are analyzed independently without conversational context

First experiments:
1. Test model performance on a held-out validation set with known emotional transitions
2. Compare drift detection accuracy across different text lengths and emotional complexity levels
3. Evaluate false positive/negative rates by manually annotating sample outputs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on proprietary datasets without public access, limiting reproducibility
- Model comparisons lack statistical significance testing and cross-validation
- Methodology focuses on binary emotional transitions rather than quantifying gradual emotional changes
- Streamlit application remains a prototype without clinical validation or user testing

## Confidence
- High: Technical implementation of emotion drift detection pipeline
- Medium: Comparative model performance claims between transformer architectures
- Low: Clinical applicability and mental health monitoring utility claims

## Next Checks
1. Conduct k-fold cross-validation with statistical significance testing across all transformer models
2. Release the dataset or create a benchmark corpus for community evaluation and reproducibility
3. Conduct pilot study with mental health professionals to assess clinical utility and identify potential false positive/negative scenarios in therapeutic contexts
