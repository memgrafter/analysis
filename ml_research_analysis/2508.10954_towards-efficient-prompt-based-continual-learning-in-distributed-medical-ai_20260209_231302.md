# Towards Efficient Prompt-based Continual Learning in Distributed Medical AI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.10954
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10954
- Reference count: 39
- Key outcome: Improves classification accuracy by at least 10% and F1-score by 9 points over state-of-the-art approaches while lowering inference cost

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses continual learning in distributed medical AI systems, where models must be incrementally updated at each hospital using only local data while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. The authors propose a prompt-based continual learning (PCL) approach featuring a unified prompt pool with minimal expansion. By expanding and freezing a small subset of prompts, the method reduces computational overhead while maintaining performance. The approach includes a novel regularization term that balances retention of previous knowledge with adaptation to new data.

## Method Summary
The proposed prompt-based continual learning approach introduces a unified prompt pool that can be incrementally expanded with minimal computational overhead. The key innovation involves selectively expanding and freezing a small subset of prompts to reduce overall computational costs. A novel regularization term is introduced to balance the trade-off between retaining previously learned knowledge and adapting to new hospital-specific data. The method is designed for distributed settings where each hospital can update the model locally without sharing raw data.

## Key Results
- Improves final classification accuracy by at least 10% over state-of-the-art approaches
- Increases F1-score by 9 points compared to baseline methods
- Reduces inference cost while maintaining superior performance on diabetic retinopathy detection tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging prompt-based learning to enable efficient knowledge retention and adaptation in continual learning scenarios. By freezing most prompts and only expanding a minimal subset, the approach constrains parameter updates, which reduces computational overhead while preventing catastrophic forgetting. The regularization term explicitly balances the need to retain previously learned patterns with the requirement to adapt to new hospital-specific data distributions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Catastrophic forgetting**: When neural networks learn new tasks, they often overwrite previous knowledge; critical to understand for continual learning approaches
- **Prompt-based learning**: Using soft prompts to adapt pre-trained models without fine-tuning all parameters; needed for efficient parameter-efficient adaptation
- **Distributed learning**: Training across multiple sites without centralizing data; essential for medical AI where data privacy is paramount
- **Regularization in continual learning**: Techniques to preserve knowledge of previous tasks; needed to prevent forgetting while allowing adaptation
- **Non-IID data distributions**: Data heterogeneity across different hospitals; important for understanding real-world deployment challenges

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Input data -> Prompt encoder -> Prompt pool (unified, expandable) -> Regularization module -> Classification head
- **Critical path**: Data ingestion → Prompt encoding → Prompt selection/expansion → Regularization → Classification
- **Design tradeoffs**: Minimal prompt expansion vs. model capacity; computational efficiency vs. performance; local adaptation vs. knowledge retention
- **Failure signatures**: Performance degradation on previous tasks (forgetting), high computational overhead (inefficient expansion), poor adaptation to local data (underfitting)
- **3 first experiments**: 1) Ablation study on prompt expansion size vs. performance, 2) Comparison of different regularization strategies, 3) Analysis of computational overhead across different prompt pool sizes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to single medical task (diabetic retinopathy) across only three related datasets
- Claims of reduced computational overhead lack specific quantitative evidence and comparison metrics
- Insufficient technical detail on prompt pool expansion mechanism and regularization term design
- Does not address distributed learning challenges like communication efficiency, privacy preservation, or non-IID data robustness

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Experimental results showing improved accuracy and F1-score over state-of-the-art methods on tested diabetic retinopathy datasets
- Medium Confidence: Claim that method reduces computational overhead (asserted but not quantitatively validated)
- Medium Confidence: General approach of using prompt-based continual learning for distributed medical AI (technical details require clarification)

## Next Checks
1. Implement and evaluate the method on additional medical imaging tasks (e.g., chest X-rays, histopathology) to assess generalizability beyond diabetic retinopathy
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of prompt expansion strategy versus regularization term to overall performance
3. Measure and report explicit computational metrics (FLOPs, parameter count, inference latency) to substantiate claims of reduced computational overhead compared to baseline methods
