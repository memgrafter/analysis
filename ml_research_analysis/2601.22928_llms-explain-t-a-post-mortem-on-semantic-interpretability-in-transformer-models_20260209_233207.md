# LLMs Explain't: A Post-Mortem on Semantic Interpretability in Transformer Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.22928
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22928
- Reference count: 34
- This paper presents a critical post-mortem on two widely-used interpretability methods for Large Language Models (LLMs): attention-based analysis and embedding-based property inference.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a critical post-mortem on two widely-used interpretability methods for Large Language Models (LLMs): attention-based analysis and embedding-based property inference. The authors aimed to detect linguistic abstraction in LLMs using established techniques, but found both methods fundamentally flawed. Attention-based relational explanations failed because later-layer representations no longer correspond to individual tokens, making inferred "relations" artifacts rather than genuine model-internal structure. Embedding-based property inference produced high predictive scores not because embeddings encode semantic knowledge, but due to methodological artifacts and dataset structure - even random or corrupted features yielded strong results. The core lesson is that interpretability methods can produce convincing outputs without revealing actual understanding.

## Method Summary
The authors tested two interpretability pipelines: attention-based relational analysis and embedding-based property inference. They used feature-norm datasets (McRae, Buchanan, Binder) and extracted type-level embeddings from BERT layer 0, averaging subword tokens for multi-token concepts. Two mapping methods were employed: PLSR and single-hidden-layer FFNN with tanh activation, selecting latent dimensionality via elbow point on train-validation MSE. Control experiments included upper-bound (mapping norms to themselves), random/shuffled features, taxonomic corruption, and structured nonsense features. Attention maps were visualized using BertViz. The study focused on whether these methods could detect linguistic abstraction in transformer models.

## Key Results
- Attention-based explanations collapsed because later-layer representations no longer correspond to individual tokens, with residual-stream tracing showing token representations rapidly become mixtures through residual mixing.
- High predictive scores in embedding-based property inference were driven by dataset geometry and sparsity rather than semantic encoding, with shuffled feature matrices reaching nearly the same scores as original mappings.
- Both interpretability methods produced structured, linguistically plausible outputs that were methodologically unreliable - attention visualizations appeared structured even when token embeddings were shuffled, and property inference succeeded with random features.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Residual Stream Dissolution of Token Identity
The residual stream architecture causes hidden states to become linear combinations of all previous layers, with token representations rapidly becoming mixtures that "melt" individual token identity into global context by mid-depth.

### Mechanism 2: Sparsity-Driven Geometric Artifacts
Regression models exploit low-rank structure and sparsity inherent in feature norms, achieving high scores by learning the shape of the data rather than its semantic content - even random or corrupted features yield strong results.

### Mechanism 3: Perturbation-Invariant Visualization
Transformer architectures possess strong inductive biases that produce structured, "linguistic-looking" heatmaps that persist even under semantic perturbation, creating a "visualization fallacy" where observers attribute meaning to mathematically default behaviors.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Residual Stream Architecture**
  - **Why needed here:** To understand why the "Token Continuity" assumption fails, as additive residual connections cause information mixing and dilution of original token signals.
  - **Quick check question:** Does the output of a transformer layer replace the previous representation, or add to it? (Answer: Add to it, causing mixing).

- **Concept: Probing Classifiers (Probes)**
  - **Why needed here:** To grasp that probes test predictability rather than causal mechanism, making the "Prediction-as-Explanation" assumption central to the embedding failure.
  - **Quick check question:** If a linear probe can predict property Z from layer L, does the model use layer L to compute Z? (Answer: Not necessarily; predictability ≠ causality).

- **Concept: Feature Norms & Sparsity**
  - **Why needed here:** To comprehend why embedding experiments failed, as extremely sparse feature matrices allow regression models to achieve high scores by learning zero-heavy structure rather than specific semantic associations.
  - **Quick check question:** Why might a regression model score well on a dataset where 95% of values are "0"? (Answer: It can achieve 95% accuracy by simply predicting "0" for everything).

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Subject -> Transformer LLM (e.g., BERT) -> Interpretability Layer (Attention Extractors & Probing Regressors) -> Validation Module (Perturbation Engine & Upper-Bound Estimators)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Extract attention maps or train probing regressors on original data
  2. Apply Perturbations: Shuffle labels, randomize features, or inject noise into inputs
  3. Compare: Contrast performance between original and perturbed states (Sanity Check)
  4. Diagnose: If performance does not degrade, classify the result as a "Methodological Artifact"

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Visual Plausibility vs. Rigor: Highly structured attention maps are intuitive but empirically unreliable in deeper layers
  - Probe Complexity vs. Generalization: Complex probes may overfit to dataset geometry; linear probes may fail to capture nuance

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Invariant Metrics: F1@10 or Spearman's ρ remains high (>0.5) even when target features are shuffled or replaced with nonsense
  - Token Drift: Cosine similarity between Layer N output and input embedding drops below usable threshold for token-level attribution

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Label Shuffle Control: Retrain property inference probe on same embeddings with shuffled feature labels
  2. Attention Input Swap: Swap two tokens with distinct semantic roles and visualize attention to see if pattern follows token or position
  3. Upper Bound Estimation: Map feature norms to themselves using same regression technique to establish methodological ceiling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What interpretability methods can track information flow through transformers without assuming token identity persists across layers?
- Basis in paper: The authors show residual mixing and MLP transformations dissolve token-specific identity, yet no alternative to token-level analysis is proposed.
- Why unresolved: Current probing paradigms presuppose stable position–token correspondence, which the paper disproves but does not replace.
- What evidence would resolve it: A method that produces meaningful explanations while explicitly accounting for representational mixing in deeper layers.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can property-inference methods be modified to distinguish genuine semantic encoding from dataset geometry and sparsity artifacts?
- Basis in paper: The paper demonstrates that shuffled and corrupted features yield high predictive scores driven by structural properties rather than semantic content.
- Why unresolved: Standard metrics (F1@10, Spearman's ρ) cannot separate geometric similarity from semantic decoding.
- What evidence would resolve it: New evaluation protocols where performance drops reliably when semantic content is corrupted while structure is preserved.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What validation frameworks can ensure interpretability methods remain reliable when deployed in pervasive computing systems under resource constraints?
- Basis in paper: The authors warn that interpretability assumptions may silently fail in deployment, affecting debugging, compression, and trust.
- Why unresolved: Controlled-lab evaluations do not account for edge-device conditions or system integration.
- What evidence would resolve it: Failure-mode testing across diverse deployment scenarios showing when and why interpretability degrades.

## Limitations
- Analysis limited to specific transformer architectures (BERT-family) and feature-norm datasets, which may not generalize to all LLM interpretability contexts.
- Focus on type-level embeddings may miss fine-grained token-level patterns that could still provide valid insights.
- Assumes feature-norm datasets adequately represent semantic knowledge, though their construction methods may introduce biases.

## Confidence
- Attention mechanism critique: High - multiple ablation studies confirm token identity dissolution
- Embedding property inference critique: High - systematic controls show geometry/sparsity artifacts
- Generalizability to other architectures: Medium - results may vary with different transformer designs
- Implications for all LLM interpretability: Medium - methodology-specific rather than architecture-specific

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the study using decoder-only transformers (GPT-style) to test architecture dependency
2. Apply the same perturbation methodology to attention-based probing techniques that use different positional assumptions
3. Test whether incorporating contextual embeddings (rather than type-level) changes the artifact patterns observed
