# More Than Efficiency: Embedding Compression Improves Domain Adaptation in Dense Retrieval

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.13525
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13525
- Reference count: 28
- Applying PCA to query embeddings alone can effectively improve dense retrieval performance across diverse domains, with NDCG@10 gains in 75.4% of model-dataset pairs

## Executive Summary
This paper demonstrates that PCA-based embedding compression improves dense retrieval performance across diverse domains without requiring model fine-tuning or labeled data. The key insight is that low-rank embedding structure in retrieval tasks allows PCA to preserve domain-relevant semantic features while discarding non-discriminative components. By fitting PCA exclusively on target-domain queries, the method refocuses retrieval on domain-specific user information needs. The approach is especially effective for datasets with hierarchical or categorical query structures and outperforms more complex domain adaptation techniques while remaining robust even with limited unlabeled domain data.

## Method Summary
The method applies PCA compression to pre-trained dense retrieval embeddings for domain adaptation. Queries and documents are encoded using a fixed pre-trained retriever, then PCA is fitted on target-domain query embeddings to learn a projection matrix that retains the top principal components. Both queries and documents are projected into the reduced-dimensional space, and retrieval ranking is performed using cosine similarity in this compressed space. The approach uses query-only compression by default (retention ratio 0.9) rather than query+document compression, which introduces corpus variance that dilutes query-intent signals.

## Key Results
- PCA compression improves NDCG@10 in 75.4% of model-dataset pairs when applied to queries only
- Query-only compression (75.4% success rate) outperforms query+document compression (56.3% success rate)
- Gains are especially pronounced for datasets with hierarchical or categorical query structures
- The method matches or exceeds more complex domain adaptation techniques without requiring model training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Low-Rank Embedding Structure
Embedding spaces in retrieval tasks exhibit power-law eigenvalue decay, meaning most semantic variance concentrates in a small subset of dimensions. PCA identifies and retains high-variance principal components that capture domain-relevant structure while discarding low-variance dimensions that contribute minimally to discrimination within the target domain. The target domain's semantic structure can be represented in a lower-dimensional subspace than the original embedding dimension.

### Mechanism 2: Domain-Targeted Variance Filtering
Low-variance dimensions in query embeddings encode source-domain artifacts or noise rather than target-domain semantics. Fitting PCA exclusively on target-domain queries identifies variance directions specific to user information needs in that domain, removing dimensions that are irrelevant or distracting for domain-specific retrieval. Target-domain query variance correlates with retrieval-relevance signals.

### Mechanism 3: Query-Only Alignment Superiority
Fitting PCA on queries alone yields better domain adaptation than query+document compression. Document corpora contain broad topical variance that dilutes query-specific intent signals. Query-only PCA preserves subspace alignment with user information needs, while mixed compression introduces noise from documents. User intent variability (captured in queries) is more predictive of retrieval success than corpus topical variability.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction
  - Why needed here: Understanding how PCA extracts variance-maximizing directions clarifies why compression can improve rather than degrade retrieval by filtering noise
  - Quick check question: Given an embedding matrix with power-law eigenvalue decay, would you expect aggressive compression (keeping 10% of dimensions) to help or hurt performance? Why?

- Concept: Domain shift in dense retrieval
  - Why needed here: The paper addresses distribution mismatch between pretraining and target domains; understanding this motivates why adaptation is needed at all
  - Quick check question: A retriever trained on general web text is deployed on a biomedical corpus. Name two failure modes you might observe.

- Concept: Cosine similarity in embedding space
  - Why needed here: Retrieval ranking depends on query-document cosine similarity; PCA projection must preserve angular relationships in the reduced space
  - Quick check question: If PCA projection changes the relative magnitudes of embedding dimensions but preserves directional variance, will cosine similarity rankings change? Explain.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Pre-trained Encoder -> PCA Projection Module -> Similarity Scoring -> Ranking
- Critical path:
  1. Collect unlabeled target-domain queries (n queries sufficient for covariance estimation; paper uses datasets with 1,000+ queries typically)
  2. Encode queries using frozen pre-trained encoder
  3. Fit PCA on query embeddings -> extract top d' eigenvectors (retention ratio r = d'/d)
  4. Apply projection to both queries and documents
  5. Compute cosine similarity and rank
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Retention ratio: 0.9 (90%) is default; lower ratios (0.5-0.7) can help more on structured domains but risk information loss
  - Query-only vs. query+document: Query-only more robust; use query+document only if query count is very low
  - PCA fitting data: Requires unlabeled queries; cross-validation (Appendix B) shows learned components generalize to unseen queries
- Failure signatures:
  - Degradation on creative/ambiguous queries (e.g., FeedbackQA): PCA may overfit to dominant variance patterns
  - Instability with very few queries (<100): Covariance estimation unreliable
  - Large performance drops with query+document compression: Corpus variance diluting query-intent signals
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline sweep: Run retrieval on your target domain with uncompressed embeddings, then 90% query-only PCA compression. Report NDCG@10 delta.
  2. Retention ratio ablation: Test r in {0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0} on a validation split to find optimal compression level for your domain.
  3. Query count sensitivity: Fit PCA on varying query subset sizes (e.g., 50, 100, 500, all queries) to determine minimum data requirements for stable adaptation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can a principled, a priori method be developed to predict the optimal retention ratio for a specific domain without empirical trial-and-error? The authors state in the Limitations that "the optimal retention ratio proves model- and dataset-dependent," and explicitly "leave the criteria for choosing the optimal retention ratio to future works." While the paper demonstrates that performance often peaks at specific ratios, there is currently no theoretical framework or heuristic to select this ratio before running evaluations.

### Open Question 2
Do nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques capture domain-specific semantic nuances more effectively than the linear PCA approach used in this study? Section 8 explicitly highlights this gap, noting that "as a linear transformation, PCA may inadequately capture nonlinear semantic relationships... suggesting potential for exploring nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods." The paper establishes linear projection as a strong baseline, but it remains untested whether manifold learning or autoencoders could better disentangle complex semantic structures.

### Open Question 3
Does integrating PCA compression with synthetic data generation pipelines yield additive performance improvements over either method alone? The Conclusion proposes that "Future work could explore integrating PCA with synthetic data generation," specifically referencing Generative Pseudo Labeling (GPL). The paper compares PCA against GPL as separate baselines and finds PCA competitive, but it does not investigate if applying PCA to a model already adapted via synthetic fine-tuning provides compounding benefits.

## Limitations
- PCA compression is not universally beneficial, with degradation cases reported on creative/ambiguous queries
- The analysis of why query+document compression performs worse lacks detailed ablation studies on corpus variability effects
- Domain familiarity analysis relies on paraphrase similarity metrics whose reliability is not fully validated

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The empirical observation that PCA compression improves dense retrieval across diverse domains (75.4% success rate)
- **Medium Confidence:** The theoretical mechanism that low-rank embedding structure enables effective compression by filtering noise while preserving semantic variance
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim that query-only PCA outperforms query+document compression due to better capture of user information needs

## Next Checks

1. **Eigenvalue Decay Analysis:** Measure actual eigenvalue spectra across multiple datasets to confirm power-law decay patterns and identify thresholds where compression becomes harmful.
2. **Query Sample Size Sensitivity:** Systematically vary the number of unlabeled queries used for PCA fitting (e.g., 50, 100, 500, 1000) to establish minimum requirements for stable adaptation.
3. **Domain Structure Correlation:** Analyze the relationship between dataset query structure (hierarchical vs. flat) and PCA compression effectiveness to better predict when gains will be largest.
