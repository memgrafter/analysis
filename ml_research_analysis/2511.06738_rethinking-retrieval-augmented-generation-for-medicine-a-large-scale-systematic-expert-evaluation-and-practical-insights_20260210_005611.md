- Standard RAG degrades medical LLM outputs: factuality drops by up to 6%, completeness by up to 5%

## Executive Summary
This study presents the most comprehensive expert evaluation of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in medicine, involving 18 medical experts who contributed 80,502 annotations across 800 model outputs. The evaluation systematically assessed three RAG pipeline components: evidence retrieval (relevance of retrieved passages), evidence selection (accuracy of evidence usage), and response generation (factuality and completeness of outputs). Standard RAG often degraded performance: only 22% of top-16 passages were relevant, evidence selection precision and recall remained low (41-43% and 27-49%, respectively), and factuality and completeness dropped by up to 6% and 5% compared to non-RAG variants. The study demonstrated that simple strategies like evidence filtering and query reformulation substantially improved performance on medical benchmarks by up to 12% and 8.2%, respectively. These findings challenge the assumption that RAG reliably improves medical LLM outputs and highlight the importance of deliberate system design and stage-aware evaluation.

## Method Summary
The study systematically evaluated medical RAG pipelines using three components: evidence retrieval (assessing relevance of top-16 passages from a corpus including PubMed, StatPearls, Wikipedia, medical textbooks, and clinical guidelines), evidence selection (measuring precision and recall of cited passages), and response generation (evaluating factuality and completeness at statement level). The pipeline was tested on 200 queries (100 patient queries from K-QA, 100 USMLE-style from MedBullets) using GPT-4o and Llama-3.1-8B. Evidence filtering was implemented using a fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B classifier (trained on 3,200 query-passage pairs with 5-fold CV), and query reformulation used the LLM's rationale-style response as the reformulated query. Performance was evaluated against held-out benchmarks: MedQA, MedMCQA, MMLU, MMLU-Pro, and MedXpertQA (each ≤500 samples).

## Key Results
- Standard RAG degrades performance: factuality drops by up to 6%, completeness by up to 5%
- Only 22% of top-16 retrieved passages are relevant to medical queries
- Evidence selection remains weak with precision 41-43% and recall 27-49%
- Simple evidence filtering and query reformulation improve benchmark performance by up to 12% and 8.2%, respectively

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Evidence Filtering Reduces Noise Contamination
Removing irrelevant passages from retrieved results prevents models from incorporating misleading information that degrades response quality. A fine-tuned classifier (based on Llama-3.1-8B) evaluates each retrieved passage for relevance, filtering out noise before the LLM generates a response. This prevents the model from anchoring on misleading numerical references, incorrect clinical thresholds, or off-topic content. Core assumption: irrelevant passages actively harm performance rather than being merely neutral; models cannot reliably self-filter during generation.

### Mechanism 2: Query Reformulation Improves Retrieval Precision and Coverage
Using the model's initial reasoning response as a reformulated query surfaces more relevant evidence than the original patient or exam question. The LLM first produces a rationale-style response to the clinical query. This rationale, which articulates diagnostic reasoning and key clinical concepts, is then passed to the retriever instead of the raw question. This transforms verbose patient narratives into clinically salient terms and fills in missing context for underspecified queries. Core assumption: the model's internal reasoning contains better search terms than the original query; the retriever's vector space aligns more closely with clinical rationale than with patient language.

### Mechanism 3: Stage-Wise Evaluation Identifies Pipeline Bottlenecks
Decomposing RAG into retrieval, selection, and generation stages with expert annotation reveals where failures originate, enabling targeted fixes. Instead of evaluating only end-task accuracy, annotators assess: (1) passage relevance against must-have statements, (2) whether models cite relevant vs. irrelevant passages, and (3) statement-level factuality and completeness. This granularity shows that retrieval inadequacy and poor evidence selection—not generation—are the primary failure points. Core assumption: expert-annotated relevance and coverage metrics correlate with downstream clinical utility; failures are stage-local rather than emergent from stage interactions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Precision@k and Coverage@k in medical retrieval**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper uses these metrics to diagnose retrieval failure; standard accuracy metrics don't capture whether essential clinical information is retrievable.
  - **Quick check question:** If Precision@16 = 0.22 and Coverage@16 = 0.33, what proportion of queries have no relevant passage in top-16, and what proportion of essential statements are unretrievable?

- **Concept: Evidence attribution vs. citation generation**
  - **Why needed here:** The paper distinguishes between whether a passage *could* support a statement (retrieval relevance) and whether the model *actually* cites it (evidence selection). Conflating these hides failure modes.
  - **Quick check question:** A model cites 5 passages: 3 are relevant, 2 are irrelevant. The retriever returned 16 passages, 4 of which were relevant. Calculate precision and recall for evidence selection.

- **Concept: Must-have vs. nice-to-have statements in clinical responses**
  - **Why needed here:** Evaluation of completeness requires defining what's essential. The paper uses physician-annotated must-have statements as the ground truth for coverage.
  - **Quick check question:** For a query about drug contraindications in pregnancy, which would be must-have: the specific contraindicated drugs, or the mechanism of teratogenicity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Query -> (optional) Reformulation Module -> Retriever (MedCPT) -> Evidence Filter (Llama-3.1-8B) -> LLM (GPT-4o/Llama-3.1) -> Response with Citations
- **Critical path:** 1. Query enters → (optional) reformulation module generates rationale 2. Retriever returns top-k passages (k=16-32) 3. Filtering model scores each passage → removes low-relevance 4. Filtered passages + original query → LLM generates response with citations
- **Design tradeoffs:** Filtering threshold (higher reduces noise but may discard relevant passages), Reformulation vs. original query (improves precision but adds latency), Top-k value (higher increases coverage but also noise), Model scale (larger models are more robust to noise but more likely to over-incorporate irrelevant content)
- **Failure signatures:** Lexical ambiguity (query "poison ivy" retrieves DC Comics character), Numerical anchoring (retrieved passage mentions reference range in wrong context), Intent misalignment (retrieved content shifts frame), Self-generated citations (smaller models fabricate references)
- **First 3 experiments:** 1. Establish baseline degradation: Run standard RAG (no filtering, no reformulation) on held-out medical QA set; compare to non-RAG baseline 2. Ablate filtering threshold: Train filtering classifier; sweep threshold (0.3, 0.5, 0.7) and measure precision/recall tradeoff 3. Compare reformulation strategies: Test (a) original query, (b) rationale-based reformulation, (c) PICO-style reformulation on complex USMLE-style queries

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **How can an adaptive architecture be developed to selectively invoke RAG only when a model's internal knowledge is insufficient?**
  - The Discussion states, "In the longer term, an adaptive architecture that selectively invokes RAG only when the model's internal knowledge appears insufficient could offer a promising and efficient solution."
  - Why unresolved: The study demonstrates that standard RAG degrades performance for high-capability models on simpler tasks (due to noise) but helps on complex tasks, creating a need for a dynamic "switch" rather than a static application.

- **To what extent do evidence filtering and query reformulation strategies generalize across diverse medical subdomains and different LLM architectures?**
  - The authors note, "Further research should explore how these interventions interact with different retrievers, search databases, medical subdomains, and LLM architectures."
  - Why unresolved: While the study validated these interventions on general benchmarks using GPT-4o and Llama-3.1, it is unclear if these lightweight, model-agnostic modules remain effective in highly specialized medical contexts or for models with different reasoning behaviors.

- **How can models be improved to increase evidence selection recall without relying solely on external filtering?**
  - The results show that evidence selection remains a weak point with low recall (27-49%), yet the proposed solution focuses on external "evidence filtering" rather than improving the model's internal ability to identify and utilize relevant retrieved passages.
  - Why unresolved: The study reveals a failure mode where models frequently ignore relevant retrieved passages, suggesting that merely improving retrieval quality does not guarantee the model will "see" or use the evidence.

## Limitations

- The evidence filtering classifier's performance on out-of-distribution queries is not evaluated, creating potential robustness gaps for rare or highly specialized medical cases
- Query reformulation relies on the LLM's reasoning ability, which may introduce hallucinations that propagate through the retrieval stage
- The expert annotation process, while extensive, used a single labeler per query-passage pair, potentially introducing individual bias without inter-rater reliability measures

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** RAG pipeline degradation findings (factuality drops of 6%, completeness drops of 5%) are well-supported by the large-scale expert annotations across 800 outputs
- **Medium Confidence:** The effectiveness of filtering and reformulation strategies is demonstrated on benchmark datasets but may not generalize to all medical domains or query types
- **Medium Confidence:** The stage-wise evaluation framework provides valuable diagnostic insights, though the correlation between annotation metrics and actual clinical utility requires further validation

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-validation of expert annotations:** Have 10% of query-passage pairs re-annotated by a second medical expert to establish inter-rater reliability and assess annotation consistency
2. **Robustness testing of filtering classifier:** Evaluate the evidence filter on a held-out test set containing rare medical conditions and complex multi-system queries not present in the training data
3. **Clinical utility assessment:** Conduct a randomized controlled trial where clinicians use standard RAG vs. enhanced RAG (with filtering and reformulation) to answer actual patient care questions, measuring time-to-answer and diagnostic accuracy
