core_contribution: The AMBEDKAR framework addresses caste- and religion-based biases
  in Indian Large Language Models by introducing a Constitution-aware decoding layer
  that uses speculative decoding combined with counterfactual perturbations to reduce
  identity inference rates. It operates at inference time without retraining, leveraging
  a verifier trained on constitutional principles to re-rank token completions, thus
  ensuring identity-invariant outputs.

# AMBEDKAR-A Multi-level Bias Elimination through a Decoding Approach with Knowledge Augmentation for Robust Constitutional Alignment of Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.02133
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02133
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves up to 26.41% absolute reduction in identity inference rates for caste and religious biases

## Executive Summary
AMBEDKAR introduces a novel constitutional bias mitigation framework for Indian Large Language Models that operates at inference time without requiring model retraining. The approach leverages speculative decoding combined with counterfactual perturbations to generate identity-invariant outputs while maintaining fluency. By incorporating a verifier trained on constitutional principles, the framework re-ranks token completions to ensure alignment with Articles 14-17 of the Indian Constitution. The system achieves significant bias reduction with minimal latency overhead, providing a practical solution for addressing caste- and religion-based biases in AI systems deployed in Indian contexts.

## Method Summary
The AMBEDKAR framework operates as a constitutional-aware decoding layer that sits between the LLM and the output, using speculative decoding to propose multiple token sequences that are then evaluated by a verifier. The verifier, trained on constitutional principles and knowledge augmentation, assesses each candidate sequence for identity inference and bias. Counterfactual perturbations are applied to generate alternative completions that preserve semantic meaning while removing identity-specific markers. The framework then re-ranks the candidate sequences, selecting outputs that maintain fluency while minimizing identity-related bias. This approach achieves bias mitigation without the computational expense of full model retraining.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 26.41% absolute reduction in identity inference rates for religious and caste identities
- Maintains fluency with only 6.29% latency overhead compared to standard decoding
- Operates model-agnostically across Indian LLMs without requiring retraining

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its multi-level approach to bias elimination. By operating at the decoding layer rather than the training phase, it can dynamically assess and modify outputs based on real-time context. The speculative decoding generates multiple candidate sequences, while the verifier acts as a constitutional filter, evaluating each against principles encoded from Articles 14-17. The counterfactual perturbations create alternative paths that preserve meaning while removing identity markers, allowing the system to navigate between semantic preservation and bias elimination. This architecture enables continuous bias mitigation without the computational burden of retraining.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Constitutional AI Principles**
   - Why needed: Provides the ethical framework for bias evaluation and mitigation
   - Quick check: Can the verifier accurately map constitutional principles to linguistic patterns?

2. **Speculative Decoding**
   - Why needed: Enables efficient generation of multiple candidate sequences for evaluation
   - Quick check: Does the speculative decoding maintain generation speed while producing quality candidates?

3. **Counterfactual Perturbation**
   - Why needed: Allows creation of identity-neutral alternatives while preserving semantic meaning
   - Quick check: Are the perturbed sequences maintaining coherence and relevance?

4. **Verifier Architecture**
   - Why needed: Serves as the constitutional filter for evaluating and ranking candidate outputs
   - Quick check: Is the verifier achieving high accuracy in bias detection without over-filtering?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input Text -> Speculative Decoder -> Counterfactual Perturbation Generator -> Verifier -> Output Filter -> Final Output

**Critical Path:** The critical execution path flows from input through speculative decoding to the verifier, where constitutional principles are applied to filter and rank candidates. The counterfactual perturbation generator runs in parallel to speculative decoding, providing alternative sequences for evaluation.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework prioritizes bias mitigation over pure generation speed, accepting a 6.29% latency overhead for constitutional alignment. This tradeoff favors accuracy and ethical compliance over minimal latency, which is acceptable for most use cases where bias-free outputs are prioritized.

**Failure Signatures:** 
- Excessive filtering leading to generic or incomplete outputs
- Constitutional misinterpretation resulting in over-restriction of valid content
- Speculative decoding producing low-quality candidates that bypass the verifier
- Counterfactual perturbations creating semantically broken or incoherent alternatives

**First Experiments:**
1. Test framework performance on identity-neutral prompts to establish baseline latency overhead
2. Evaluate constitutional alignment accuracy using known biased and unbiased reference texts
3. Measure semantic preservation rates across different counterfactual perturbation intensities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Primary validation on Indian context biases limits generalizability to other cultural contexts
- Additional computational complexity from speculative decoding may affect deployment feasibility
- Reliance on constitutional principle encoding assumes effective capture of nuanced interpretations

## Confidence
- 26.41% bias reduction: High confidence
- 6.29% latency overhead: Medium confidence
- Model-agnostic claim: Medium confidence

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-cultural bias testing to evaluate framework performance on non-Indian bias types and contexts
2. Perform large-scale deployment testing to measure real-world latency impact and resource consumption
3. Test framework compatibility with diverse LLM architectures beyond the Indian models initially evaluated, including GPT-style and other transformer variants
