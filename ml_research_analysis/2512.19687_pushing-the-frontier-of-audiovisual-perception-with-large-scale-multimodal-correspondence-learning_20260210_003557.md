# Pushing the Frontier of Audiovisual Perception with Large-Scale Multimodal Correspondence Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.19687
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19687
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces PE-AV encoders achieving state-of-the-art multimodal correspondence learning across audio-video-text tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Perception Encoder Audiovisual (PE-AV), a family of audio-video-text encoders trained with large-scale contrastive learning. The authors develop a robust audiovisual data engine that synthesizes high-quality captions for over 100 million audio-video pairs, enabling large-scale supervision consistent across modalities. PE-AV supports diverse audio domains (speech, music, sound effects) and scales contrastive objectives to ten cross-modal pairs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks across sound, music, speech, and video tasks.

## Method Summary
The authors propose PE-AV, a family of audio-video-text encoders trained through large-scale contrastive learning. The key innovation is a robust audiovisual data engine that synthesizes high-quality captions for over 100 million audio-video pairs, providing consistent multimodal supervision. The approach scales contrastive objectives to ten cross-modal pairs and introduces PE-A-Frame for fine-grained audio-frame-to-text alignment. The framework supports diverse audio domains and achieves unified cross-modal embeddings across audio-video-text tasks.

## Key Results
- Improves AudioCaps text-to-audio retrieval from 35.4 to 45.8 R@1
- Increases VGGSound classification accuracy from 36.0 to 47.1
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance across sound, music, speech, and video benchmarks
- Demonstrates strong zero-shot performance and unified cross-modal embeddings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach leverages large-scale contrastive learning across ten cross-modal pairs to create unified audio-video-text embeddings. The data engine synthesizes captions at scale, providing consistent supervision across modalities. Fine-grained alignment through PE-A-Frame enables precise audio-frame-to-text correspondence, improving performance on sound event detection tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- **Contrastive learning**: Why needed - learns representations by pulling together positive pairs and pushing apart negative pairs. Quick check - verify embedding space has clear separation between different semantic categories.
- **Multimodal alignment**: Why needed - enables cross-modal retrieval and understanding across audio, video, and text. Quick check - test retrieval performance across different modality pairs.
- **Large-scale data synthesis**: Why needed - provides consistent supervision signals across millions of examples. Quick check - validate caption quality and diversity through human evaluation.
- **Fine-grained temporal alignment**: Why needed - enables precise correspondence between audio events and video frames. Quick check - measure alignment accuracy on temporal localization tasks.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Raw Data -> Data Engine -> Multimodal Encoder -> Contrastive Head -> Cross-modal Embeddings

**Critical Path**: The critical path involves the data engine generating captions, which are then used as training targets for the multimodal encoder through contrastive learning objectives across ten cross-modal pairs.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Scales to ten cross-modal pairs for comprehensive supervision versus computational cost. Uses synthesized captions versus relying on limited manual annotations. Employs unified embeddings versus separate modality-specific representations.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor cross-modal retrieval performance indicates misaligned embeddings. Inconsistent results across different audio domains suggest insufficient domain coverage. Weak performance on fine-grained tasks points to inadequate temporal alignment.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test cross-modal retrieval performance on AudioCaps benchmark
2. Evaluate VGGSound classification accuracy
3. Assess zero-shot performance on out-of-distribution audio domains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Training data composition and diversity remain unclear, raising concerns about generalization
- Caption synthesis pipeline effectiveness lacks validation for quality and potential hallucinations
- Scaling to ten cross-modal pairs may include redundant supervision without clear marginal benefits

## Confidence
- High confidence: Contrastive learning framework design, cross-modal retrieval performance metrics, zero-shot evaluation methodology
- Medium confidence: Caption synthesis pipeline effectiveness, generalization across audio domains, unified embedding space quality
- Low confidence: Real-world deployment considerations, computational efficiency claims, robustness to distribution shift

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies removing individual cross-modal pairs to quantify their marginal contribution to downstream performance.
2. Perform human evaluation of synthesized captions to assess quality, hallucinations, and potential biases in the data engine.
3. Test model performance on out-of-distribution video content (different domains, cultures, recording conditions) to validate generalization claims.
