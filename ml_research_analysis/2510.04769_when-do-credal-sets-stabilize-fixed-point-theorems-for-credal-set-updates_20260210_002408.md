# When Do Credal Sets Stabilize? Fixed-Point Theorems for Credal Set Updates

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.04769
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04769
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Fixed-point theorems establish when iterative credal set updates converge, with applications to Credal Bayesian Deep Learning

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes fixed-point theorems for update rules acting on credal sets, which are closed, convex sets of probability measures used in imprecise probabilistic machine learning. The authors analyze conditions under which iterative credal set updates converge to stable fixed points, generalizing classical fixed-point results (Kakutani, Edelstein, Boyd-Wong) to the credal set setting. The main theoretical contributions include proving existence of fixed points under Hausdorff continuity, uniqueness under strict distance-decreasing conditions, and convergence of iterative updates under generalized contraction conditions. An empirical illustration using finitely generated credal sets shows that parameter differences between extreme distributions converge to zero under repeated CBDL updates, confirming theoretical predictions.

## Method Summary
The empirical validation uses a synthetic data generation process where $\theta \sim N(0, 2.0)$ then $X \sim N(\theta, 1.0)$ with $N=50$ samples. The method iteratively updates 3 Gaussian priors with means $(2.0, 3.0, -2.0)$ and variances $(1.0, 2.0, 2.0)$ using a conjugate update rule with a fixed likelihood variance parameter (set to 2.0 in code). The key metric tracked is the averaged consecutive parameter difference $\frac{1}{3} \sum_{j=1}^3 \| \xi^{(j)}_t - \xi^{(j)}_{t-1} \|_2^2$, where $\xi$ represents the Gaussian parameters. The Python implementation uses `numpy` for calculations and `matplotlib` for plotting convergence behavior.

## Key Results
- Hausdorff-continuous update functions on credal sets over compact metric spaces have at least one fixed point (Theorem 1)
- Uniqueness of fixed points holds under strict distance-decreasing conditions (Corollary 2.1)
- Iterative credal set updates converge to unique fixed points under generalized Boyd-Wong contraction conditions (Theorem 3)
- Empirical illustration confirms CBDL updates converge geometrically to unique fixed points with parameter differences approaching zero

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Hausdorff Continuity Guarantees Fixed Point Existence
- Claim: Under compact metric spaces, Hausdorff-continuous update functions on credal sets admit at least one fixed point.
- Mechanism: The proof embeds credal sets into a compact convex subset of ℝ^N via support functions, then applies Schauder's fixed point theorem. The key insight is that Hausdorff continuity on the space of credal sets (nonempty weak*-closed convex probability sets) translates to continuity in this embedded space, guaranteeing a solution to f(P) = P.
- Core assumption: The underlying space X is compact metric, and the update function f maps credal sets to credal sets with Hausdorff continuity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Theorem 1 showing that Hausdorff-continuous update functions on credal sets have at least one fixed point when the underlying space is compact metric"
  - [Section 3.1, Theorem 1] "If f is continuous in the Hausdorff topology, then the set of fixed points of f is compact and nonempty."
  - [corpus] Weak corpus support—no direct corroboration of fixed-point theorems for credal sets; related work focuses on credal prediction and uncertainty quantification without addressing stability guarantees.
- Break condition: Discontinuity in the update function (hard thresholds, conditioning on near-zero likelihood events) or non-compact underlying space breaks fixed point existence (Example 1 shows this explicitly).

### Mechanism 2: Strict Distance-Decreasing Yields Unique Fixed Points
- Claim: When update functions strictly contract distances in the Hausdorff metric, the fixed point is unique.
- Mechanism: If d_H(f(P), f(Q)) < d_H(P,Q) for all P ≠ Q, the mapping is a strict contraction on a compact metric space. By Edelstein's theorem, such mappings have exactly one fixed point—multiple fixed points would contradict the strict contraction property.
- Core assumption: The credal set space (C, d_H) forms a compact metric space under Hausdorff distance induced by a weak*-compatible metric (e.g., Prokhorov metric).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Corollary 2.1 proving uniqueness of fixed points under strict distance-decreasing conditions"
  - [Section 3.2, Corollary 2.1] "If f satisfies d_H(f(P), f(Q)) < d_H(P,Q), ∀P,Q ∈ C, P ≠ Q, then f has a unique fixed point."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus corroboration for uniqueness results specific to credal sets.
- Break condition: Non-strict contraction (d_H(f(P), f(Q)) ≤ d_H(P,Q) with equality possible) permits multiple fixed points or limit cycles.

### Mechanism 3: Generalized Boyd-Wong Contraction Ensures Convergent Orbits
- Claim: Under ψ-contraction conditions (where ψ(t) < t and ψ is upper semicontinuous), iterative credal set updates converge to a unique fixed point at a rate governed by ψ.
- Mechanism: The control function ψ bounds how much f contracts distances at each scale. For CBDL with bounded likelihood ratios α_k ≤ ℓ_k(E|θ) ≤ β_k, the contraction coefficient is τ = max_k tanh(¼ log(β_k/α_k)) < 1, yielding geometric convergence d_n ≤ τ^n d_0.
- Core assumption: Priors lie in Δ_Θ^++ (densities bounded away from 0 and ∞); likelihoods satisfy boundedness condition (III') with uniform positive lower and finite upper bounds.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Theorem 3 establishing convergence of iterative updates under generalized contraction conditions"
  - [Section 3.3.1, Remark 1] "the orbit converges to P* at a geometric rate, i.e., d_H(P_n, P*) = O(τ^n)"
  - [Section 4, Figure 2] Empirical confirmation: "the difference quickly converges to 0, meaning the credal sets reach their fixed point"
  - [corpus] No corpus papers address convergence rates or stability conditions for credal set updates.
- Break condition: Unbounded likelihood ratios (β_k/α_k → ∞) cause τ → 1, eliminating contraction guarantees; atomic priors also break contraction (δ_θ1 and δ_θ2 remain distinct under Bayesian updates).

## Foundational Learning

- **Credal Sets**:
  - Why needed here: These are the fundamental objects being updated—closed, convex sets of probability measures representing imprecise beliefs. All theorems operate on the space C of such sets.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why credal sets must be both closed and convex, and what breaks if either property is lost?

- **Hausdorff Metric**:
  - Why needed here: This metric quantifies distance between credal sets, enabling the continuity and contraction arguments that underpin all fixed point results.
  - Quick check question: Given two credal sets P and Q, how would you compute d_H(P,Q), and what does a small Hausdorff distance tell you about their extreme distributions?

- **Weak* Topology on Probability Measures**:
  - Why needed here: The compactness and metrizability of Δ_X depend on this topology; it determines which convergence notions apply to sequences of probability measures within credal sets.
  - Quick check question: Why does weak* convergence (convergence of expectations for all bounded continuous functions) matter more than pointwise convergence for distributional updates?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input credal set P ∈ C -> Update function f: C → C -> Posterior credal set sequence (P_n) -> Hausdorff continuity/ contraction coefficient verification

- **Critical path**:
  1. Verify X is compact metric (or compactify)
  2. Confirm f outputs credal sets (nonempty, weak*-closed, convex)
  3. Check Hausdorff continuity analytically (polyhedral structure, optimization-based rules) or numerically (perturbation tests per Section 3.1)
  4. If uniqueness/convergence needed: verify contraction conditions (compute τ for CBDL via likelihood ratio bounds)

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - **Finitely vs. countably additive**: Countably additive case admits full theorems; finitely additive requires X finite (Theorem 12)—restricts applicability
  - **FGCS vs. infinite-dimensional**: Finitely generated credal sets enable efficient extreme-point tracking but limit expressiveness
  - **Pessimistic CBDL (PCBDL) vs. standard CBDL**: PCBDL handles varying evidence but requires strong condition (IV')—evidence minimizing infimum must be uniform across all parameter events

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Fixed points don't exist: Check for discontinuity at decision boundaries (Example 1's λ_2 = 1-δ jump)
  - Multiple fixed points or non-convergence: Verify strict contraction fails; likelihood ratios may be unbounded
  - Orbit diverges: Confirm P_n ≠ ∅ at all steps; check if diameters shrink (nested chain condition)

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Sanity check**: Replicate Figure 2 with Gaussian conjugate prior setup; verify parameter differences converge to zero within expected rounds based on τ estimate
  2. **Continuity stress test**: Perturb extreme distribution parameters by κ η and measure d_H(f(P_η), f(P_η+κη)); plot scaling behavior to diagnose Hausdorff continuity
  3. **Boundary case**: Construct likelihood with extreme ratio β/α → ∞ and observe convergence degradation; compare against theoretical τ → 1 prediction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can standard Bayesian posterior consistency and concentration results be formally framed as special cases of the fixed-point theorems for credal sets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Page 12 states, "it remains to be explicitly shown that (Bayesian) posterior consistency / concentration can be framed as special cases of our results."
- Why unresolved: While the paper generalizes fixed points to sets of measures, it has not yet connected these general convergence results back to the specific limiting behavior of precise Bayesian updating (convergence to a Dirac measure).
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal proof demonstrating that the conditions for posterior consistency imply the continuity or contraction conditions required by Theorem 1 or Theorem 3.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What structural conditions must be imposed on threshold-based update rules (such as model trimming) to guarantee the existence and attainability of fixed points?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Page 12 notes the plan to "study the structure needed to place on these kinds of threshold-based update rules... to have fixed points, and to be able to reach them."
- Why unresolved: Thresholding typically introduces discontinuities (as noted in Example 1), which violates the Hausdorff continuity assumptions of the current theorems.
- What evidence would resolve it: Identification of specific regularity constraints on discrete selection mechanisms that preserve sufficient continuity or allow for weaker fixed-point existence proofs.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can fixed-point theorems for credal sets be extended to lower probabilities, specifically within the Integral Imprecise Probability Metrics (IIPM) framework?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Page 12 mentions the plan to "inspect how our theorems can be put to use to study the existence of fixed point theorems for lower probabilities in the context of IIPM."
- Why unresolved: The current results apply to sets of probabilities, whereas lower probabilities are functionals on these sets; the topological properties required for fixed points may differ significantly in the functional space.
- What evidence would resolve it: A derivation of fixed-point results on the space of lower probabilities, showing that the IIPM topology supports the necessary continuity or contraction properties.

## Limitations
- Theoretical results require Hausdorff continuity and compact metric spaces, limiting applicability to non-compact or discontinuous update scenarios
- Empirical validation is limited to a single synthetic Gaussian example with only 50 data points
- No external validation exists in the corpus for fixed-point theorems applied to credal sets
- CBDL convergence relies on bounded likelihood ratios and strictly positive prior densities that may not hold in all practical settings

## Confidence
- Fixed point existence (Theorem 1): **Medium** - Proof follows classical Schauder approach but lacks external validation
- Uniqueness under strict contraction (Corollary 2.1): **Medium** - Relies on Edelstein's theorem with limited applicability evidence
- Convergence under ψ-contraction (Theorem 3): **Medium** - Theoretical derivation sound but empirical support limited to single synthetic example
- CBDL convergence behavior: **Low** - Only one numerical experiment shown with potential model mismatch in implementation

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the Gaussian CBDL convergence experiment with multiple random seeds and verify consistency of convergence behavior
2. Test Hausdorff continuity empirically across different credal set parameterizations using the perturbation approach described in Section 3.1
3. Construct a boundary case with unbounded likelihood ratios to empirically verify breakdown of convergence guarantees predicted by τ → 1
