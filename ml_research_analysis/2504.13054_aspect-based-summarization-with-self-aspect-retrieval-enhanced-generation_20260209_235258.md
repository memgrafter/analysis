# Aspect-Based Summarization with Self-Aspect Retrieval Enhanced Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.13054
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13054
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Embedding-driven retrieval enables LLMs to generate accurate aspect-based summaries while reducing hallucination and optimizing token usage.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenges of aspect-based summarization (ABS) with large language models (LLMs), particularly their limitations with long documents, token constraints, and tendency to hallucinate irrelevant content. The authors propose a novel framework called Self-Aspect Retrieval Enhanced Summary Generation (SARESG) that employs an embedding-driven retrieval mechanism to identify and extract text segments relevant to the specified aspect, recursively pruning the document until it fits within token limits. This approach optimizes token usage by removing unrelated content and ensures the model generates summaries strictly based on the given aspect, thereby reducing hallucination. The framework also supports the integration of in-context learning (ICL) techniques. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets (USB, OAsum, and Ma-news) demonstrate that SARESG consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving superior performance in metrics such as METEOR, ROUGE, and BERTScore. For instance, with the Llama3-70b model, SARESG achieved a METEOR score of 32.65 on the USB dataset and 30.41 on the Ma-news dataset. The results highlight SARESG's effectiveness in generating accurate, aspect-aligned summaries while addressing token limitations and improving the reliability of LLM-generated summaries.

## Method Summary
SARESG processes documents through a multi-stage pipeline: documents are split into 256-word chunks, each sentence is scored for aspect relevance using cosine similarity between sentence and aspect embeddings, and top-scoring sentences are selected per chunk up to a word threshold W. The selected sentences are reordered to original sequence and concatenated into a pruned document that fits within LLM token limits. This pruned input is then fed to an LLM (Llama3-70b or Llama3-8b) with optional in-context learning examples. The embedding model used is stella-en-1.5b, and experiments are conducted on USB, OAsum, and Ma-news datasets with METEOR, ROUGE, and BERTScore as evaluation metrics.

## Key Results
- SARESG achieved METEOR scores of 32.65 on USB and 30.41 on Ma-news datasets using Llama3-70b
- Chunk-based retrieval (256 words) outperformed sentence-level retrieval across all metrics
- With ICL, smaller 8B models achieved similar performance to 70B zero-shot models
- The framework reduced hallucination by constraining generation to retrieved relevant content

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Embedding-driven retrieval filters irrelevant content before generation, reducing hallucination risk by constraining model attention.
- Mechanism: An embedding model maps document chunks and the target aspect to a shared semantic space. Cosine similarity scores identify aspect-relevant sentences. Low-scoring segments are pruned before LLM ingestion.
- Core assumption: The embedding model captures semantic relevance between aspect descriptions and document content accurately enough to distinguish signal from noise.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we employ an embedding-driven retrieval mechanism to identify its relevant text segments. This approach extracts the pertinent content while avoiding unnecessary details"
  - [section III.A] "For each sentence si,j, we compute the similarity score Si,j with respect to A"
  - [corpus] Related work on retrieval-augmented systems supports semantic filtering as a pre-generation step, though direct evidence for hallucination reduction in ABS specifically is limited in neighbors.
- Break condition: If embedding quality degrades on domain-specific terminology or multi-sentence dependencies, retrieval may drop relevant context.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Chunk-based retrieval (256-word units) preserves local coherence better than sentence-level retrieval.
- Mechanism: Documents split into fixed 256-word chunks. Within each chunk, top-scoring sentences selected up to word threshold W. Selected sentences reordered to original sequence.
- Core assumption: 256 words provides sufficient context for embedding model to assess aspect relevance while remaining granular enough for selective pruning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section III.A] "each chunk di (except for the last one) contains exactly 256 words. This fixed chunk size ensures that each di contains enough contextual information"
  - [section V.B] "sentence-level retrieval yielded ROUGE-1 (R1), ROUGE-2 (R2), and ROUGE-L (RL) scores of 22.37, 6.53, and 15.06... performed slightly worse than the chunk-based retrieval method"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus comparison; chunk sizing remains a design choice with limited external validation.
- Break condition: Optimal chunk size likely varies with document structure and aspect granularity; 256 may over-fragment highly cohesive texts.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Token space conservation enables effective in-context learning (ICL) without truncating demonstration examples.
- Mechanism: Pruning reduces input length, freeing tokens for ICL examples and system prompts. This allows smaller models (8B parameters) to approach larger model (70B) zero-shot performance.
- Core assumption: ICL demonstration quality matters more than exhaustive document coverage for aspect alignment.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section I] "By preserving valuable token space, our method allows for the integration of ICL techniques"
  - [section V.D] "with ICL, smaller 8b model will achieve similar result with larger model like Llama3-70b with zero-shot"
  - [corpus] Corpus shows ICL instability noted in limitations; retrieval-enhanced ICL is underexplored in neighbors.
- Break condition: ICL sample selection is highly unstable; poor demonstration examples can degrade performance (observed on OAsum dataset with anomalous sample).

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Cosine similarity in embedding space**
  - Why needed here: Core scoring function for aspect-to-sentence relevance; determines which content survives pruning.
  - Quick check question: Given two embedding vectors [0.8, 0.6] and [0.6, 0.8], compute their cosine similarity. (Answer: 0.96)

- Concept: **In-context learning (ICL)**
  - Why needed here: SARESG's token savings enable ICL integration; understanding ICL's benefits and failure modes is essential for debugging.
  - Quick check question: What happens to ICL effectiveness if the demonstration example contains no aspect-relevant content? (Answer: Performance can degrade below zero-shot baseline)

- Concept: **Chunk granularity tradeoffs**
  - Why needed here: Paper empirically validates 256-word chunks; understanding why informs parameter tuning for new domains.
  - Quick check question: Why might sentence-level retrieval underperform compared to chunk-level for aspects like "a person's final years"? (Answer: Individual sentences may lack explicit aspect cues; context window needed)

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Document Chunker -> Embedding Model -> Similarity Scorer -> Pruning Engine -> Re-ranker -> LLM Generator

- Critical path:
  1. Chunk document → 2. Embed each sentence + aspect → 3. Score sentences → 4. Prune per-chunk to threshold → 5. Reassemble in order → 6. Add ICL examples if space permits → 7. Generate summary

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Chunk size vs. retrieval precision: Larger chunks preserve context but reduce selectivity
  - Pruning threshold vs. coverage: Aggressive pruning saves tokens but risks missing dispersed aspect mentions
  - ICL sample selection: Random sampling can backfire; domain-aligned samples improve consistency

- Failure signatures:
  - Generated summary discusses wrong aspect: Embedding model may conflate semantically similar but distinct aspects
  - Repetitive output (noted in 8B zero-shot): Model lacks guidance; ICL should help if tokens available
  - ROUGE drop in ICL mode: Check demonstration sample quality (e.g., single-word sentences, no aspect content)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Baseline validation**: Run zero-shot summarization on your domain data without pruning. Measure ROUGE/BERTScore and note token overflow rate.
  2. **Chunk size ablation**: Test chunk sizes [64, 128, 256, 512] on a held-out sample. Plot ROUGE-1/2/L against chunk size to validate or adjust the 256-word assumption for your data.
  3. **ICL sample sensitivity**: Select 3 ICL demonstration examples (high-quality, random, poor-quality). Compare SARESG_ICL performance across conditions to quantify ICL instability in your domain.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can pruning parameters be dynamically adjusted to maintain performance across varying document lengths?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the Limitations section that "the best pruning parameters will be varied as the length of articles varied."
- Why unresolved: The current framework likely relies on fixed heuristics (e.g., 256-word chunks) that may not be optimal for documents significantly shorter or longer than those in the current benchmarks.
- What evidence would resolve it: An adaptive algorithm that automatically tunes chunk sizes and retrieval thresholds based on input length, demonstrating stable performance across diverse document sizes.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What methodologies can effectively identify optimal demonstration samples to stabilize In-Context Learning (ICL) for this task?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note in the Conclusion that future work should "develop methods to identify optimal samples for diverse tasks" to address the observed instability where ICL performance fluctuated based on sample quality (e.g., the OAsum anomaly).
- Why unresolved: The study found ICL performance is highly sensitive to the random selection of guide samples, sometimes failing if the sample lacks relevant context.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic retrieval strategy for selecting ICL demonstrations that consistently improves metrics (ROUGE/BERTScore) over random selection on the OAsum dataset.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the SARESG framework maintain its retrieval accuracy and summarization performance when applied to full-scale, unfiltered datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Conclusion suggests "Further studies could examine larger-scale datasets," noting that current experiments were limited to subsets (e.g., first 2000 rows) or filtered samples due to resource constraints.
- Why unresolved: It is unclear if the "self-aspect retrieval" mechanism scales efficiently or if the chunk-based retrieval loses coherence when processing the complete, noisy versions of large datasets like OASum.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results on the full datasets without row limitations or length filtering, showing that the token-saving benefits persist without degradation in summary quality.

## Limitations

- Fixed 256-word chunk size and unspecified word threshold W limit adaptability to different document structures and aspect granularities
- ICL integration shows high sensitivity to demonstration sample quality, with performance degrading below zero-shot baseline when samples lack aspect relevance
- The re-ranking mechanism is mentioned but not described, leaving a gap in understanding the complete retrieval pipeline

## Confidence

- **High confidence** in the core claim that embedding-driven retrieval improves token efficiency and reduces hallucination risk by filtering irrelevant content before generation
- **Medium confidence** in the optimal chunk size (256 words) and the general effectiveness of the retrieval mechanism
- **Low confidence** in the robustness of ICL integration due to observed instability and lack of systematic analysis

## Next Checks

1. **Chunk size sensitivity test**: Systematically vary chunk sizes [64, 128, 256, 512] on a held-out sample and plot ROUGE-1/2/L against chunk size to validate or adjust the 256-word assumption for your domain

2. **ICL sample quality ablation**: Test SARESG_ICL performance using three demonstration examples per aspect (high-quality, random, poor-quality) to quantify ICL instability and establish best practices for sample selection

3. **Embedding model impact**: Replace stella-en-1.5b with a stronger embedding model (e.g., sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) and measure changes in retrieval precision and downstream summarization quality to assess the bottleneck of embedding quality
