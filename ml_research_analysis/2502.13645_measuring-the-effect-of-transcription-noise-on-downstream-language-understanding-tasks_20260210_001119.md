# Measuring the Effect of Transcription Noise on Downstream Language Understanding Tasks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.13645
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13645
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces ENDOW framework to measure transcription noise impact on SLU tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper presents ENDOW, a configurable framework for systematically measuring how transcription noise affects downstream language understanding tasks. The framework injects controlled noise into transcripts and evaluates the impact on task performance using various cleaning techniques. Through experiments on three SLU tasks (summarization, question-answering, and dialog-act classification) with seven noise levels and seven cleaning approaches, the study reveals that task models tolerate specific noise thresholds and that targeted cleaning of content words yields better results than general noise reduction. The framework provides a systematic approach to analyzing SLU pipelines and supports development of more robust speech processing systems.

## Method Summary
The ENDOW framework operates by first injecting controlled noise into clean transcripts at configurable levels and types (deletion, insertion, substitution), then applying various cleaning techniques targeting different word types (function words, content words, named entities), and finally evaluating the cleaned transcripts on downstream SLU tasks using large language models. The framework systematically varies noise parameters and cleaning strategies to measure their impact on task performance, using a cleaning-effectiveness score that quantifies trade-offs between noise reduction and task improvement. The experimental design covers seven noise levels, seven cleaning techniques, and four large language models across three SLU tasks.

## Key Results
- Task models demonstrate specific noise tolerance thresholds beyond which performance degrades significantly
- Cleaning of content words (nouns, named entities) is more effective than general noise reduction for preserving task performance
- The cleaning-effectiveness score successfully quantifies trade-offs between noise reduction and task improvement

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its systematic approach to isolating and measuring the impact of transcription errors on downstream tasks. By controlling noise injection parameters and applying targeted cleaning techniques, it reveals which types of errors most severely impact performance and which cleaning strategies best preserve task accuracy. The use of large language models as task processors allows for consistent evaluation across different noise conditions while the cleaning-effectiveness metric provides a quantitative measure of the trade-off between noise reduction and task preservation.

## Foundational Learning

**Speech Recognition Error Patterns**: Why needed: Understanding common ASR error types (substitutions, deletions, insertions) is crucial for designing effective cleaning strategies. Quick check: Can identify error patterns in sample noisy transcripts.

**Content vs Function Words**: Why needed: Different word types have varying importance for task performance. Quick check: Can classify words as content or function in sample sentences.

**Task-Specific Dependencies**: Why needed: SLU tasks rely on different linguistic features for success. Quick check: Can identify which linguistic features are critical for each tested task.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Clean Transcript -> Noise Injection -> Cleaning Technique -> Task Model -> Performance Metric

Critical path: Noise Injection -> Cleaning Technique -> Task Model Evaluation

Design tradeoffs: Synthetic vs real noise patterns, breadth of task coverage vs depth of analysis, cleaning technique specificity vs generalizability

Failure signatures: Performance degradation beyond tolerance thresholds, ineffective cleaning techniques that remove critical information, overfitting to specific noise patterns

First experiments:
1. Run baseline tests with no noise injection to establish performance ceilings
2. Test single noise type (substitution only) at increasing levels to identify degradation points
3. Apply content-word-only cleaning to noisy transcripts to validate targeted approach effectiveness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Synthetic noise injection may not capture complex error patterns in real ASR systems
- Limited to three SLU tasks, restricting generalizability to other applications
- English-only experiments raise questions about cross-linguistic validity

## Confidence

High confidence:
- Systematic framework design for controlled noise injection and cleaning evaluation
- Measurable impact of noise on task performance
- Effectiveness of targeted cleaning strategies for content words

Medium confidence:
- Identified noise tolerance thresholds for task models
- Comparative effectiveness of different cleaning techniques
- Cleaning-effectiveness score as trade-off metric

Low confidence:
- Framework's real-world applicability to production ASR systems
- Transferability of results to other languages and domains
- Generalizability of cleaning technique effectiveness

## Next Checks

1. Implement ENDOW with real ASR system outputs from multiple commercial and open-source speech recognition engines to compare synthetic versus real noise patterns and validate identified noise tolerance thresholds in practical settings.

2. Conduct cross-linguistic experiments using ENDOW framework with non-English datasets and multilingual task models to assess universality of cleaning techniques and noise tolerance findings across different language families.

3. Expand evaluation to additional SLU tasks including spoken language understanding in dialogue systems, intent recognition, and semantic parsing to determine if identified critical word types and cleaning strategies generalize beyond tested categories.
