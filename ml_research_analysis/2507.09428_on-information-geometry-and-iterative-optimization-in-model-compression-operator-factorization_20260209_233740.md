# On Information Geometry and Iterative Optimization in Model Compression: Operator Factorization

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2507.09428
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09428
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Iterative compression during training is crucial for high compression ratios with minimal performance degradation.

## Executive Summary
This paper explores operator factorization as a model compression technique, analyzing existing methods through the lens of information geometry. The authors demonstrate that many compression approaches implicitly approximate information divergences when projecting models onto lower-compute submanifolds. They prove convergence of iterative singular value thresholding for training neural networks under soft rank constraints and show that trainability—rather than projection quality—dominates compressed model performance. Experiments across CIFAR-10, ImageNet-1K, and GLUE benchmark tasks reveal that while information-based projections improve zero-shot accuracy, fine-tuned performance becomes nearly identical across methods.

## Method Summary
The method focuses on low-rank matrix factorization for model compression, specifically iterative rank reduction during fine-tuning. The core algorithm uses Iterative Euclidean Hard Thresholding (IEHT) or Iterative Fisher Hard Thresholding (IFHT), where weight matrices are decomposed via SVD and singular values are gradually reduced based on energy thresholds. At each iteration, the basis (U, V) is frozen while singular values (S) are trained, then the factorization is updated. The paper introduces energy-based cutoffs (keeping singular values contributing to top β% energy) rather than magnitude-based approaches, and demonstrates that iterative methods guide optimization toward desirable low-rank minima.

## Key Results
- Information-based projections (FWSVD) achieve 2-5× better zero-shot accuracy than Euclidean projections at aggressive compression ratios
- Iterative compression methods outperform one-shot compression for extreme compression ratios when sufficient training budget exists
- Per-layer rank selection based on energy-based cutoffs significantly outperforms global selection and magnitude-based methods
- Performance gap between different projection methods becomes negligible after fine-tuning, suggesting trainability dominates projection quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Information Geometry Preserves Zero-Shot Performance
Projecting via Fisher-weighted approximations (minimizing local KL divergence) preserves pretrained functionality better than Euclidean projection for immediate inference. The Fisher Information Matrix captures the local geometry of the loss landscape, and by minimizing KL(p_θ‖p_θ+Δθ) ≈ ½Δθ^T I(θ)Δθ rather than ‖θ−θ̃‖², projection preserves directions that matter for the output distribution rather than raw parameter distance.

### Mechanism 2: Iterative Compression Maintains Trainability via Gradual Rank Reduction
Gradual rank reduction during training outperforms single-shot compression for extreme compression ratios because it preserves the model's ability to adapt its representations. Iterative singular value thresholding acts as a proximal gradient method minimizing L(W) + λ·rank(W), where milder cutoffs allow the optimization trajectory to "flow" toward low-rank minima rather than being projected into regions with poor gradients.

### Mechanism 3: Per-Layer Rank Selection Respects Layer-Wise Dynamics
Local (per-layer) rank selection outperforms global selection because layers have different singular value distributions and stabilization rates. Earlier layers stabilize faster while later layers require more flexibility, and energy-based local cutoffs preserve more singular values in layers where they matter, avoiding premature bottlenecks.

## Foundational Learning

- **Fisher Information Matrix as Local Geometry**: Explains why Fisher-weighted methods work—FIM is the Riemannian metric induced by KL divergence on the statistical manifold.
  - Quick check: Why does I(θ) = E[∇log p(y|x)∇log p(y|x)^T] approximate the curvature of the loss landscape?

- **Proximal Gradient Methods with Non-Smooth Penalties**: The iterative thresholding algorithm is a proximal gradient method where the proximal operator of rank is SVD truncation.
  - Quick check: What is the closed-form solution to prox_{λ·rank}(W)?

- **Low-Rank Matrix Manifolds**: Compression is projection onto M_{<r}, the variety of rank-constrained matrices; understanding this geometry clarifies why iterative methods help.
  - Quick check: Why is M_{<r} not a smooth manifold at rank boundaries?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: SVD (Euclidean) -> FWSVD/TFWSVD (Fisher-weighted) -> OIALR (basis freeze) -> IEHT/IFHT (energy-based cutoff) -> TRP/FWTRP (nuclear norm regularization)
- **Critical path**: 1) Determine if zero-shot preservation is required → select FWSVD-family if yes 2) Determine training budget → use iterative (IEHT/IFHT) if extended training is feasible 3) Set rank cutoff strategy → prefer energy-based (β = 0.90–0.97) over magnitude-based 4) Configure schedule → increasing-depth schedules for vision transformers
- **Design tradeoffs**: Fisher weighting: Better zero-shot, but requires FIM computation (quartic complexity → layer-wise approximations); Iteration: Better extreme compression, but longer training and sensitive to schedule; Global vs local rank: Local better for heterogeneous layer dynamics, but requires per-layer tuning
- **Failure signatures**: Large initial rank cuts (>30% energy removal at once): Unrecoverable performance collapse; Aggressive magnitude-based cutoffs (OIALR default β=0.1): Creates training instability; Global rank selection on ViT: Early bottlenecks in critical layers; Short training with iterative methods: No advantage over one-shot methods
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Validate information projection benefit: Compare SVD vs FWSVD zero-shot accuracy at 3–4 fixed ranks on a pretrained model; expect 2–5× accuracy improvement at aggressive compression 2) Validate milder cutoffs: Compare OIALR (magnitude cutoff) vs IEHT (energy cutoff) on same compression target; expect IEHT to achieve higher accuracy at same parameter count 3) Validate schedule sensitivity: Ablate constant vs increasing-depth cutoff schedules on a vision transformer; expect increasing schedules to show 1–3% accuracy gains at extreme compression

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How robust are activation-aware compression methods to violations of the Gaussian assumption given the presence of outliers and clustered activations in deep networks?
- Can the theoretical convergence of iterative singular value thresholding be realized practically for Large Language Models (LLMs) given the computational cost of frequent SVDs?
- Does the negligible performance gap between Euclidean and Fisher projections during fine-tuning imply that the computational cost of estimating the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) is unnecessary for standard compression workflows?

## Limitations
- The paper uses diagonal approximations of the Fisher Information Matrix per layer, but the exact computation method for IFHT is ambiguous
- Results are demonstrated on ViT and BERT, and advantages may not transfer to architectures with different layer dynamics
- Iterative methods require additional SVD operations during training, but computational overhead is not quantified

## Confidence
- **High**: Iterative methods outperform one-shot for extreme compression ratios when sufficient training budget exists
- **Medium**: Information-based projections (FWSVD) provide meaningful zero-shot accuracy advantages
- **Low**: Per-layer rank selection consistently outperforms global selection across all architectures

## Next Checks
1. Validate Fisher Approximation: Reproduce IFHT results using both diagonal and full-layer Fisher Information to quantify the impact of approximation on performance claims
2. Cross-Architecture Generalization: Test iterative vs one-shot methods on a CNN architecture (e.g., ResNet) to determine if iterative advantages generalize beyond transformers
3. Compute Overhead Analysis: Measure and compare wall-clock training time and memory usage for SVD during iterative methods versus one-shot baselines
