# A Survey on Mechanistic Interpretability for Multi-Modal Foundation Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.17516
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17516
- Reference count: 40
- A survey that reviews mechanistic interpretability methods for multimodal foundation models, introducing a three-dimensional taxonomy and identifying key research gaps

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive overview of mechanistic interpretability methods for multimodal foundation models (MMFMs), covering contrastive/generative vision-language models and text-to-image diffusion models. The authors introduce a three-dimensional taxonomy that organizes current research by model family, interpretability techniques, and applications, providing a structured framework for understanding the field. The survey identifies that while many LLM interpretability methods can be adapted to MMFMs with moderate modifications, the multimodal nature of these models presents novel challenges, particularly in interpreting visual embeddings in human-understandable terms.

The authors highlight that while interpretability aids downstream tasks, critical applications such as hallucination mitigation and model editing remain significantly underdeveloped in multimodal models compared to their language model counterparts. Through systematic analysis of existing research, the survey identifies several important research gaps and provides directions for future work in multimodal mechanistic interpretability. The work serves as both a comprehensive reference for current methods and a roadmap for addressing the unique challenges posed by MMFMs.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a systematic review methodology to analyze mechanistic interpretability research for multimodal foundation models. The authors categorize existing work using a three-dimensional taxonomy covering model families (contrastive and generative vision-language models, text-to-image diffusion models), interpretability techniques (feature attribution, probing, mechanistic analysis, etc.), and applications (model editing, hallucination mitigation, bias detection, etc.). This structured approach allows for comprehensive coverage of the field while highlighting relationships between different research directions. The survey synthesizes findings from 40 references to identify patterns, challenges, and opportunities in multimodal interpretability research.

## Key Results
- LLM interpretability methods can be adapted to MMFMs with moderate modifications
- MMFMs present novel challenges like interpreting visual embeddings in human-understandable terms
- Hallucination mitigation and model editing applications remain underdeveloped in multimodal models compared to language models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey's systematic approach to categorizing interpretability methods creates a framework that reveals patterns and gaps in the field. By organizing research across model families, techniques, and applications, the authors can identify which interpretability approaches transfer between modalities and which require adaptation. The three-dimensional taxonomy provides a structured way to understand how different interpretability methods apply to multimodal contexts, revealing that while many techniques from language models can be adapted, the visual components of MMFMs introduce unique interpretability challenges. This organizational framework also helps identify underexplored areas like hallucination mitigation and model editing in multimodal contexts.

## Foundational Learning

**Mechanistic Interpretability**: The study of how neural networks implement their functions by examining their internal mechanisms. Why needed: Provides the foundation for understanding how models process information internally. Quick check: Can you explain how attention mechanisms contribute to model behavior?

**Multimodal Foundation Models**: AI models that process and generate multiple types of data (text, images, audio) using shared representations. Why needed: These are the target systems whose interpretability is being studied. Quick check: Can you name at least two types of multimodal models discussed in the survey?

**Visual Embeddings**: Internal representations of visual information in neural networks. Why needed: Understanding how visual information is encoded is crucial for interpreting MMFMs. Quick check: Can you describe how visual embeddings differ from text embeddings in multimodal models?

**Feature Attribution Methods**: Techniques that identify which input features most influence model predictions. Why needed: These are fundamental tools for interpretability that can be adapted across modalities. Quick check: Can you explain the difference between gradient-based and perturbation-based attribution methods?

**Probing Tasks**: Supervised tasks used to extract information from intermediate model representations. Why needed: These help understand what information is encoded at different layers. Quick check: Can you describe how probing tasks are used to interpret model representations?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: MMFM interpretability pipeline typically follows: Input Data -> Feature Extraction (visual/text encoders) -> Cross-modal Fusion -> Intermediate Representations -> Output Generation -> Interpretability Analysis (attribution/probing/mechanistic analysis) -> Insights/Applications

**Critical Path**: The most critical path for interpretability analysis is: Input Data -> Feature Extraction -> Cross-modal Fusion -> Intermediate Representations -> Interpretability Analysis. This path captures how information flows through the model and where interpretability methods can be applied.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Authors face tradeoffs between depth of analysis (focusing on specific components vs. holistic understanding) and generalizability (method applicability across different model architectures). The survey addresses this by providing both specific technique analyses and broader taxonomic organization.

**Failure Signatures**: Common failure modes in multimodal interpretability include: misinterpretation of visual features due to lack of human-understandable grounding, failure to capture cross-modal interactions, and techniques that work well for text but poorly transfer to visual modalities. The survey identifies these through analysis of existing research gaps.

**First Experiments**:
1. Apply gradient-based feature attribution to a vision-language model and compare results with text-only models
2. Design probing tasks to test what visual information is preserved at different layers of a multimodal encoder
3. Attempt to adapt a successful language model editing technique to a multimodal model and document the modifications required

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The survey identifies several open questions in multimodal mechanistic interpretability: How can we develop human-understandable representations of visual embeddings? What are the most effective approaches for detecting and mitigating hallucinations in multimodal models? How can we develop model editing techniques that work across modalities? The authors also highlight the need for more systematic evaluation of interpretability methods' impact on downstream tasks and the development of benchmark datasets specifically for multimodal interpretability research.

## Limitations
- The three-dimensional taxonomy, while useful, has not been independently validated for completeness
- The claim about moderate modifications needed for LLM-to-MMFM adaptation may not hold uniformly across all technique categories
- Coverage may be incomplete for emerging MMFM architectures and hybrid approaches
- Evaluation of interpretability's impact on downstream tasks relies on reported results that may vary in experimental rigor

## Confidence
- High confidence: The three-dimensional taxonomy provides a useful organizational structure for the field
- Medium confidence: LLM interpretability methods can be adapted to MMFMs with modifications
- Medium confidence: Novel challenges exist in interpreting visual embeddings
- Medium confidence: Hallucination mitigation and model editing are underdeveloped in MMFMs

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a systematic literature review to verify the completeness of the three-dimensional taxonomy and identify any missing categories or relationships
2. Perform a quantitative analysis of the adaptation effort required to transfer specific LLM interpretability techniques to MMFMs across multiple technique categories
3. Implement and benchmark hallucination detection methods on a standardized set of MMFM models to empirically assess the current state of this application area
