# Intention Knowledge Graph Construction for User Intention Relation Modeling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.11500
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11500
- Reference count: 40
- 351 million edges in resulting knowledge graph

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the IGC-RC framework for constructing relational intention knowledge graphs in e-commerce. The method uses large language models to automatically generate user intentions from session data, establish commonsense relationships between intentions, and abstract intentions into higher-level concepts. Applied to Amazon M2 dataset, the resulting Relational Intention Graph (RIG) demonstrates high quality and significantly improves session-based recommendation performance while providing substantial computational efficiency gains over direct LLM approaches.

## Method Summary
The IGC-RC framework constructs intention knowledge graphs through three stages: intention generation, conceptualization, and relation classification. It leverages LLMs to automatically generate user intentions from session data, establish temporal, causal, and conceptual relationships between intentions, and abstract these intentions into higher-level concepts. The framework processes the Amazon M2 dataset to create a comprehensive knowledge graph with 351 million edges, demonstrating both high quality (81.2% human acceptance rate) and computational efficiency (1,200× faster than direct LLM inference).

## Key Results
- 351 million edges in the constructed Relational Intention Graph (RIG)
- 81.2% human-annotated acceptance rate for knowledge graph quality
- Up to 14.3% improvement in Recall@50 for session-based recommendations compared to state-of-the-art methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The IGC-RC framework leverages large language models' ability to understand and generate complex user intentions from behavioral data. By establishing commonsense relationships between intentions and abstracting them into higher-level concepts, the framework creates a rich semantic representation that captures user behavior patterns more effectively than traditional methods. This enables more accurate session-based recommendations by providing contextual understanding of user goals and their relationships.

## Foundational Learning

**Intentions**: Abstract representations of user goals or purposes in e-commerce sessions. *Why needed*: Core unit for building the knowledge graph structure. *Quick check*: Can be automatically extracted from user behavior sequences.

**Relation Types**: Temporal, causal, and conceptual relationships between intentions. *Why needed*: Capture the complex interdependencies in user behavior. *Quick check*: Validated through human annotation at 81.2% acceptance rate.

**Conceptualization**: Abstraction of specific intentions into higher-level concepts. *Why needed*: Enables generalization across similar user goals. *Quick check*: Reduces graph complexity while preserving semantic relationships.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Session Data -> IGC-RC Pipeline -> Relational Intention Graph -> Recommendation Engine

**Critical Path**: Session Data → Intention Generation → Relation Classification → Graph Construction → Recommendation Enhancement

**Design Tradeoffs**: Accuracy vs. efficiency (LLM-based vs. direct inference), manual annotation vs. automatic generation, graph complexity vs. computational feasibility

**Failure Signatures**: Poor relation quality (low human acceptance rate), insufficient generalization (overfitting to specific sessions), computational bottlenecks (inefficient graph operations)

**First Experiments**:
1. Validate intention generation accuracy on sample sessions
2. Test relation classification performance with human annotators
3. Benchmark recommendation improvement on held-out test sets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

- Limited to single e-commerce dataset (Amazon M2), limiting generalizability
- Relies on proprietary LLM APIs with potential reproducibility and cost challenges
- Potential biases in LLM-generated relations not adequately addressed

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Empirical results showing 14.3% Recall@50 improvement well-supported by systematic experimentation.

**Medium Confidence**: Quality metrics (81.2% acceptance rate) and efficiency claims reasonable but need more rigorous validation.

**Low Confidence**: Applicability claims to other domains not substantiated with empirical evidence.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct cross-domain validation by applying IGC-RC framework to datasets from different e-commerce platforms and non-e-commerce domains.

2. Perform bias analysis on constructed knowledge graphs by examining relation distributions and testing for demographic or product category biases.

3. Implement cost-benefit analysis comparing total operational costs of knowledge graph approach against direct LLM inference across different scale scenarios.
