core_contribution: AuditVotes addresses the accuracy-robustness trade-off in certifiably
  robust Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by introducing a framework that combines augmentation
  and conditional smoothing with randomized smoothing. The augmentation component
  de-noises randomized graphs through graph rewiring techniques, while the conditional
  smoothing uses prediction confidence to filter low-quality votes, improving both

# AuditVotes: A Framework Towards More Deployable Certified Robustness for Graph Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.22998
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22998
- Reference count: 40
- Improves certified robustness in GNNs through augmentation and conditional smoothing

## Executive Summary
AuditVotes is a framework designed to address the accuracy-robustness trade-off in certified robust Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). It combines augmentation and conditional smoothing with randomized smoothing to improve both data quality and prediction consistency. The framework shows significant improvements in clean and certified accuracy on Cora-ML when defending against edge insertion attacks, while maintaining computational efficiency and broad applicability across different smoothing schemes and datasets.

## Method Summary
AuditVotes combines two key components: augmentation and conditional smoothing. The augmentation component de-noises randomized graphs through graph rewiring techniques that use node features to make edge predictions, facilitating inductive learning. The conditional smoothing component uses prediction confidence to filter low-quality votes, improving prediction consistency. The framework is designed to be compatible with any randomized smoothing scheme and can be applied to any graph data.

## Key Results
- Improves clean accuracy by 437.1% on Cora-ML when defending against edge insertion attacks
- Improves certified accuracy by 409.3% on Cora-ML when defending against edge insertion attacks
- Maintains high computational efficiency and broad applicability across different smoothing schemes and datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
AuditVotes addresses the fundamental tension between achieving high certified accuracy and maintaining clean accuracy in GNNs. The augmentation component improves data quality by de-noising randomized graphs through feature-based edge rewiring, while the conditional smoothing component improves prediction consistency by filtering low-confidence votes. Together, these components enhance the robustness of GNNs without significantly compromising their accuracy on clean data.

## Foundational Learning
- Randomized smoothing for GNNs: A certification technique that adds noise to graph structures to provide provable robustness guarantees. Why needed: Forms the foundation of certifiable robustness in GNNs. Quick check: Understand how Gaussian noise is applied to graph adjacency matrices.
- Graph Modification Attack (GMA): An attack framework that modifies graph structures through edge insertions/deletions. Why needed: The threat model against which AuditVotes is evaluated. Quick check: Review how GMA differs from other graph attack paradigms.
- Graph rewiring techniques: Methods for modifying graph structure while preserving certain properties. Why needed: Core mechanism for the augmentation component. Quick check: Understand feature-based edge prediction algorithms like Jaccard similarity.
- Inductive learning for GNNs: The ability to generalize to unseen graphs during training. Why needed: Ensures the augmentation component can handle new graphs. Quick check: Compare inductive vs. transductive learning paradigms in GNNs.
- Confidence-based filtering: Using prediction confidence scores to select high-quality predictions. Why needed: The mechanism for conditional smoothing. Quick check: Understand how confidence thresholds affect ensemble predictions.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Data augmentation -> Randomized smoothing -> Conditional smoothing -> Certification

Critical path: The augmentation module processes the original graph through feature-based edge rewiring, generating de-noised graph variants. These variants are then used in the randomized smoothing process, where multiple noisy versions are created and predictions are aggregated. The conditional smoothing component filters these predictions based on confidence scores, and the final certified radius is computed from the filtered votes.

Design tradeoffs: The framework balances computational efficiency with robustness by using lightweight, feature-based augmentation techniques rather than complex structural learning methods. This ensures compatibility with randomized smoothing's efficiency requirements while maintaining inductive capabilities. The conditional smoothing component adds minimal computational overhead while significantly improving prediction quality.

Failure signatures: Poor performance may occur when node features are uninformative or missing, as the augmentation component relies heavily on feature similarity. The framework may also struggle with graphs where structural information is more important than feature information for classification. Additionally, aggressive confidence thresholds in conditional smoothing could lead to insufficient votes for reliable certification.

3 first experiments:
1. Test the augmentation component in isolation on Cora-ML to measure improvements in clean accuracy without certification
2. Evaluate conditional smoothing with a simple voting mechanism to quantify the impact of confidence filtering
3. Compare the full AuditVotes pipeline against standard randomized smoothing on a small graph dataset to establish baseline improvements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
Can more advanced, learnable augmentation architectures (e.g., GNN-based structural learning or diffusion models) outperform the lightweight, feature-based augmenters (JacAug, FAEAug, SimAug) used in this study without violating the efficiency constraints required for randomized smoothing?

### Open Question 2
How does AuditVotes perform on graphs with uninformative, sparse, or completely missing node features, given that the proposed augmenters rely heavily on feature similarity for graph rewiring?

### Open Question 3
Can the conditional smoothing framework be effectively adapted for graph-level tasks (e.g., graph classification) or link prediction, where the prediction space and voting mechanisms differ significantly from node classification?

## Limitations
- The framework's performance heavily depends on the quality of node features, limiting its effectiveness on graphs with uninformative or missing features
- The reported improvements (437.1% clean accuracy, 409.3% certified accuracy) appear unusually high and may require additional validation across more datasets and attack scenarios
- The theoretical guarantees are currently limited to node classification under Graph Modification Attacks, with unclear applicability to other task types

## Confidence
- Framework effectiveness: Medium
- Performance improvements: Low
- Computational efficiency: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contributions of the augmentation and conditional smoothing components to the reported performance gains
2. Test the framework's robustness across a wider range of graph datasets and attack types beyond the Cora-ML edge insertion attack
3. Compare AuditVotes against other state-of-the-art certified robust GNN methods on standardized benchmarks to verify the claimed improvements are not due to experimental artifacts
