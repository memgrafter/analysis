# Poster: Enhancing GNN Robustness for Network Intrusion Detection via Agent-based Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.20806
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20806
- Reference count: 14
- Authors: Zhonghao Zhan; Huichi Zhou; Hamed Haddadi
- Primary result: LLM-based mitigation improves GNN robustness in NIDS against node injection attacks, with LLaMA 4 Maverick 17B achieving 0.859 accuracy and 0.834 F1-score in detecting injected nodes.

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the vulnerability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) to distribution drift and adversarial attacks, particularly node injection. The authors propose integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) as simulated cybersecurity expert agents to analyze network flow graph structures and identify suspicious or adversarially perturbed elements before GNN processing. Using a unified dataset from multiple sources and simulating realistic attacks, the experiments demonstrate that LLM-based mitigation significantly improves GNN resilience. For example, with 20% node injection (200 nodes injected into a base graph of 1000), leading LLMs correctly flagged a high percentage of malicious nodes, resulting in improved downstream GNN classification performance.

## Method Summary
The approach integrates LLMs as agent-based analyzers that inspect network flow graph structures to identify suspicious or adversarially perturbed elements before they reach the GNN processing stage. The system uses a unified dataset combining multiple sources and simulates realistic attacks like node injection. The LLM agents analyze graph structures and flag potential malicious nodes, which are then excluded or handled differently by the downstream GNN. This pre-processing step aims to improve the overall robustness of the NIDS by reducing the impact of adversarial perturbations on the GNN's performance.

## Key Results
- With 20% node injection (200 nodes injected into a base graph of 1000), leading LLMs correctly flagged a high percentage of malicious nodes
- Downstream GNN classification performance improved significantly compared to the attacked scenario without LLM mitigation
- LLaMA 4 Maverick 17B achieved accuracy of 0.859 and F1-score of 0.834 in detecting injected nodes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The LLM-based approach works by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of large language models to analyze graph structures and identify anomalous patterns that may indicate adversarial manipulation. By acting as simulated cybersecurity expert agents, the LLMs can detect subtle structural irregularities and suspicious node behaviors that might be challenging for traditional GNN architectures to handle directly. This pre-processing step effectively filters out or flags potentially malicious elements before they impact the GNN's learning process, thereby improving the overall robustness of the intrusion detection system.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Network flows -> Graph construction -> LLM analysis -> Node filtering -> GNN classification
Critical path: Real-time network monitoring feeds graph construction, which passes through LLM analysis for adversarial node detection before final GNN-based classification
Design tradeoffs: LLM integration adds computational overhead but provides superior anomaly detection compared to pure GNN approaches; tradeoff between detection accuracy and processing latency
Failure signatures: LLM misclassification of benign nodes as malicious (false positives) or missing actual adversarial nodes (false negatives); GNN performance degradation when LLM confidence is low
First experiments:
1. Baseline GNN performance on clean network flow data without LLM integration
2. GNN performance under various node injection attack rates without LLM mitigation
3. LLM node classification accuracy across different attack scales and LLM model sizes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- LLM robustness to diverse attack types and novel adversarial strategies is not fully explored
- Study focuses on node injection attacks at fixed 20% injection rate, leaving uncertainty about effectiveness under different attack scales
- Computational overhead introduced by LLM integration is not quantified, which is critical for practical deployment in high-throughput NIDS

## Confidence
High: GNN vulnerability to adversarial attacks in NIDS contexts; improvement in downstream GNN performance when LLM mitigation is applied in the tested setup
Medium: LLM effectiveness in detecting injected nodes at the tested attack scale; validity of the unified dataset and simulated attack methodology for representing realistic NIDS scenarios
Low: Scalability of the approach to different attack types, scales, and network conditions; quantification of computational overhead; robustness of LLM-based detection to prompt variations

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the LLM-based mitigation approach under varying attack scales (e.g., 5%, 10%, 30%, 40% node injection) and mixed attack strategies (e.g., node modification, edge perturbation) to assess robustness limits
2. Measure and report the computational overhead introduced by LLM integration, including inference time and resource usage, in comparison to baseline GNN-only NIDS performance
3. Conduct ablation studies on LLM prompt engineering to determine sensitivity of node detection performance to prompt variations and identify optimal prompting strategies
