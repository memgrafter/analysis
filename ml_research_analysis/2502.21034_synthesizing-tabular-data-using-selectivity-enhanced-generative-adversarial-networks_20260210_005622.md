# Synthesizing Tabular Data Using Selectivity Enhanced Generative Adversarial Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.21034
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21034
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: GAN-based approach for tabular data generation with query selectivity constraints

## Executive Summary
This thesis introduces a novel GAN-based method for generating tabular data that maintains query selectivity constraints, addressing a critical need in E-commerce stress testing. The approach integrates a pre-trained deep neural network into the GAN framework to ensure selectivity consistency between real and synthetic data. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art GANs and VAE models, achieving up to 20% enhancement in selectivity estimation accuracy and up to 6% improvement in machine learning utility. The method's flexibility and compatibility with various GAN architectures make it a practical solution for generating high-quality synthetic data that meets database constraints.

## Method Summary
The proposed approach addresses the challenge of generating tabular data with query selectivity constraints by incorporating a pre-trained deep neural network into the GAN framework. The discriminator is enhanced to evaluate both data quality and selectivity consistency, ensuring that synthetic data maintains similar query response characteristics to real data. The method involves training the GAN with both traditional adversarial loss and selectivity loss, which measures the difference in query selectivity between real and synthetic datasets. This dual-objective training process enables the generation of synthetic data that is both realistic and meets specific database query constraints, making it particularly valuable for E-commerce stress testing scenarios.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 20% improvement in selectivity estimation accuracy compared to state-of-the-art GANs and VAE models
- Demonstrates up to 6% improvement in machine learning utility for downstream tasks
- Shows compatibility with various GAN architectures, providing flexibility in implementation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by integrating a pre-trained deep neural network into the GAN framework to capture and preserve query selectivity patterns. This neural network learns to estimate the selectivity of various database queries on the real data. During GAN training, this selectivity estimator is used to compute a loss term that encourages the generator to produce synthetic data with similar query selectivity characteristics to the real data. By optimizing both the traditional GAN objective and this selectivity consistency objective, the model learns to generate data that not only looks realistic but also behaves similarly under database queries, addressing a critical gap in existing tabular data synthesis methods.

## Foundational Learning

**Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**
Why needed: GANs provide the fundamental framework for generating synthetic data that mimics real data distributions.
Quick check: Ensure understanding of the generator-discriminator dynamic and adversarial training process.

**Query Selectivity Estimation**
Why needed: Selectivity estimation is crucial for understanding database query performance and is the key constraint this method enforces.
Quick check: Verify knowledge of how selectivity is defined and estimated in database systems.

**Deep Neural Networks for Selectivity Prediction**
Why needed: A pre-trained neural network is used to estimate selectivity, requiring understanding of how DNNs can be applied to this task.
Quick check: Confirm understanding of how a neural network can be trained to predict query selectivity.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Data Distribution -> Generator -> Synthetic Data -> Discriminator + Selectivity Network -> Loss Function -> Generator Update

**Critical Path:**
The critical path involves the generator producing synthetic data, which is then evaluated by both the discriminator and the selectivity network. The combined feedback from these components forms the loss function that guides generator updates.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Complexity vs. Accuracy: Adding the selectivity network increases model complexity but significantly improves the quality of generated data for database queries.
- Training Time vs. Performance: The dual-objective training process may increase training time but results in better adherence to selectivity constraints.
- Flexibility vs. Specificity: The approach is flexible enough to work with various GAN architectures but is specifically designed for tabular data with query constraints.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Mode collapse in the generator, resulting in limited diversity in generated data
- Overfitting to selectivity constraints, leading to unrealistic data distributions
- Instability in training due to conflicting objectives between data quality and selectivity consistency

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Evaluate the selectivity estimation accuracy on real data using the pre-trained neural network.
2. Test the GAN's ability to generate realistic data without selectivity constraints as a baseline.
3. Measure the improvement in selectivity consistency when incorporating the selectivity loss into the GAN training.
