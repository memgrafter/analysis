# BiTAgent: A Task-Aware Modular Framework for Bidirectional Coupling between Multimodal Large Language Models and World Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.04513
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04513

- Primary result: Achieves 0.91 normalized score vs 0.87 (FOUNDER) and 0.82 (GenRL) across 10 DeepMind Control Suite tasks

## Executive Summary
BiTAgent introduces a task-aware modular framework that enables bidirectional coupling between multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and world models (WMs) for embodied agents. The framework addresses the challenge of integrating semantic reasoning from MLLMs with dynamic prediction capabilities of WMs through a novel task-aware modular fusion mechanism. This mechanism dynamically routes information between semantic and dynamics expert adapters under task guidance, allowing the model to adapt to different tasks without conflict. The framework establishes forward and backward paths for information flow, enabling semantically guided imagination and feedback-driven refinement of semantic representations.

## Method Summary
The framework operates through two primary pathways: a forward path where MLLM representations are injected into the WM's latent space for semantically guided imagination, and a backward path where WM-generated feedback refines the MLLM's semantic space via dense text-conditioned rewards. The core innovation is the task-aware modular fusion mechanism that dynamically selects and combines information from semantic and dynamics expert adapters based on task requirements. This allows the model to maintain specialized capabilities for different tasks while avoiding interference between them. The framework employs joint optimization to coordinate the learning of both MLLM and WM components, ensuring effective bidirectional coupling.

## Key Results
- Achieves overall normalized score of 0.91 across 10 DeepMind Control Suite tasks
- Outperforms FOUNDER (0.87) and GenRL (0.82) baselines
- Demonstrates strong cross-environment generalization with task-conditioned imagination trajectories closely approximating real observations
- Ablation studies show task-aware modular fusion and joint optimization provide largest performance gains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by establishing bidirectional information flow between semantic and dynamics representations. The forward path allows the MLLM's semantic understanding to guide the WM's imagination process, while the backward path enables the WM's dynamic predictions to refine the MLLM's semantic representations. The task-aware modular fusion mechanism acts as a dynamic router, selecting appropriate expert adapters based on task requirements and preventing interference between different task-specific capabilities. This creates a symbiotic relationship where semantic understanding enhances dynamic prediction and vice versa, while maintaining task-specific specialization.

## Foundational Learning

**Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)**: AI models that process and generate both text and visual information, enabling semantic understanding of visual scenes. Why needed: Provides the semantic reasoning foundation for understanding task contexts and visual inputs. Quick check: Verify the MLLM can accurately describe and reason about visual scenes in the control suite environments.

**World Models (WMs)**: Predictive models that learn the dynamics of an environment to generate imagined future states. Why needed: Enables the agent to predict and plan future actions based on current states. Quick check: Confirm the WM can accurately predict short-term future states given current observations.

**Bidirectional Coupling**: Establishing two-way information flow between semantic and dynamics representations. Why needed: Allows each component to benefit from and enhance the other's capabilities. Quick check: Test that improvements in one component (MLLM or WM) lead to measurable improvements in the other.

**Task-Aware Modular Fusion**: Dynamic routing mechanism that selects and combines expert adapters based on task requirements. Why needed: Prevents interference between different task-specific capabilities while maintaining specialization. Quick check: Verify that the fusion mechanism correctly selects different adapters for different tasks.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Raw Observations -> MLLM Encoder -> Task-Aware Fusion -> WM Latent Space -> Prediction Head -> Actions; WM Feedback -> Text-Conditioned Rewards -> MLLM Refinement

**Critical Path**: The forward path from observations through MLLM encoding, task-aware fusion, WM latent space injection, and prediction generation represents the primary decision-making pathway. The backward path provides reinforcement through dense rewards.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades increased model complexity and computational requirements for improved task-specific performance and generalization. The modular fusion mechanism adds routing overhead but enables better specialization across tasks.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Poor task performance when fusion mechanism incorrectly routes information
- Degradation in either semantic understanding or dynamic prediction when one component is significantly stronger than the other
- Overfitting to specific tasks when joint optimization is not properly balanced

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Baseline test: Evaluate individual MLLM and WM components separately on control suite tasks
2. Fusion mechanism test: Verify that different expert adapters are correctly selected for different tasks
3. Ablation study: Test performance with only forward path or only backward path enabled

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate BiTAgent on broader range of embodied AI benchmarks beyond DeepMind Control Suite, including real-world robotic manipulation tasks
2. Conduct comprehensive computational efficiency analysis measuring inference latency and resource requirements for task-aware modular fusion
3. Perform ablation studies isolating contribution of dense text-conditioned rewards in backward path to assess necessity and complexity trade-offs
