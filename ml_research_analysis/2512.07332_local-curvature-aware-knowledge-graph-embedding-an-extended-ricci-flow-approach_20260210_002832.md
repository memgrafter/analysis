# Local-Curvature-Aware Knowledge Graph Embedding: An Extended Ricci Flow Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.07332
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07332
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: RicciKGE dynamically adapts embedding geometry via extended Ricci flow, achieving +0.55 to +1.17 MRR improvements on WN18RR and +1.76% accuracy vs. GNRF on Roman-Empire through mutual adaptation of embeddings and local curvature.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces RicciKGE, a knowledge graph embedding framework that dynamically adapts embedding geometry via extended Ricci flow. Unlike prior methods with fixed manifolds, RicciKGE couples embedding updates with local curvature evolution, enabling mutual adaptation between entity representations and underlying geometry. The framework theoretically guarantees exponential curvature flattening and linear convergence of embedding distances. Empirically, RicciKGE consistently improves link prediction and node classification performance across multiple datasets.

## Method Summary
RicciKGE extends traditional knowledge graph embedding by integrating Ricci flow dynamics into the optimization process. The framework treats the embedding space as a Riemannian manifold whose geometry evolves during training. Entity embeddings and local curvature tensors are updated simultaneously through a coupled optimization process. The extended Ricci flow formulation ensures that the embedding geometry adapts to the heterogeneous structure of the knowledge graph while maintaining convergence guarantees. This dynamic approach contrasts with static embedding methods that assume fixed geometric properties.

## Key Results
- Achieved +0.55 to +1.17 MRR improvements on WN18RR across different embedding models
- Demonstrated +1.76% accuracy improvement versus GNRF on Roman-Empire node classification
- Showed consistent performance gains across multiple knowledge graph benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's success stems from its ability to adapt both the embedding space and its underlying geometry simultaneously. Traditional methods fix the embedding manifold geometry a priori, which may not capture the heterogeneous structure of real-world knowledge graphs. By allowing the geometry to evolve through Ricci flow, RicciKGE can better model complex relational patterns and varying local densities. The mutual adaptation ensures that embeddings are placed in a geometry that naturally reflects the graph's intrinsic structure.

## Foundational Learning
- Ricci Flow: A geometric evolution process that deforms Riemannian metrics to uniformize curvature distribution. Needed to dynamically adapt embedding geometry to graph structure. Quick check: Verify that curvature evolution follows exponential flattening toward target bounds.
- Riemannian Optimization: Optimization techniques on curved manifolds rather than flat Euclidean spaces. Required for maintaining geometric constraints during embedding updates. Quick check: Ensure gradient updates respect manifold constraints.
- Coupled Optimization: Simultaneous optimization of embeddings and curvature parameters. Essential for achieving mutual adaptation between geometry and representation. Quick check: Monitor convergence of both embedding distances and curvature metrics.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Knowledge Graph -> RicciKGE Framework -> Dynamic Embedding Space -> Optimized Embeddings
Critical path: Input KG structure → Compute initial curvature → Joint embedding-curvature optimization → Output adapted embeddings
Design tradeoffs: Computational overhead vs. adaptive geometry benefits; complexity of Ricci flow implementation vs. performance gains
Failure signatures: Non-convergence of curvature evolution; embedding collapse due to excessive curvature adaptation; performance degradation on simple graphs
First experiments:
1. Run RicciKGE on a small synthetic graph with known geometric properties to observe curvature adaptation behavior
2. Compare embedding convergence speed between RicciKGE and fixed-geometry baselines on medium-sized KGs
3. Conduct ablation study removing curvature updates to isolate their contribution to performance gains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly identify open questions beyond the computational overhead concerns mentioned in the limitations section.

## Limitations
- Computational overhead from dynamic curvature adaptation mechanism not fully quantified
- Convergence guarantees rely on assumptions about graph structure regularity that may not hold in noisy real-world KGs
- Limited validation on heterogeneous networks and temporal graphs where curvature dynamics might differ

## Confidence
- Performance improvements on standard benchmarks: Medium
- Theoretical convergence guarantees: High
- Scalability claims: Low

## Next Checks
1. Benchmark RicciKGE against fixed-manifold approaches on graphs with known geometric properties to isolate curvature adaptation impact
2. Conduct ablation studies measuring computational overhead of curvature updates versus embedding-only optimization
3. Test transferability by applying RicciKGE to heterogeneous graphs with varying node/edge types and compare adaptation behavior across graph subtypes
