# Few-Shot Demonstration-Driven Task Coordination and Trajectory Execution for Multi-Robot Systems

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.15686
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15686
- **Reference count**: 34
- **Primary result**: DDACE achieves perfect success rates in simulated multi-robot coordination tasks using few demonstrations

## Executive Summary
DDACE presents a novel framework for multi-robot coordination that separates temporal action sequence learning from spatial trajectory generation. The method employs Temporal Graph Networks to learn task-agnostic temporal sequences and Gaussian Processes for spatial trajectory modeling, enabling modularity and generalization across diverse coordination tasks. By using spectral clustering to extract key interdependencies from demonstration graphs, DDACE reduces data requirements compared to traditional learning from demonstration approaches.

The framework was validated across four simulated tasks involving heterogeneous teams, multi-sequence coordination, and complex trajectories, achieving perfect scores in overall success rate (OSR), sequence success rate (SSR), and goal condition recall (GCR) metrics. Fréchet distance values ranged from 0.02 to 0.04, indicating high-fidelity trajectory reproduction. Real-world deployment on physical robots successfully reproduced complex task behaviors, demonstrating DDACE's ability to generalize from few demonstrations to realistic multi-robot coordination scenarios.

## Method Summary
DDACE introduces a two-stage learning framework that decouples temporal action sequence learning from spatial trajectory generation. The temporal component uses Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs) to learn task-agnostic sequences from demonstration graphs, while the spatial component employs Gaussian Processes to model trajectories based on these learned sequences. Spectral clustering extracts key interdependencies from demonstration graphs, reducing data requirements by focusing on essential coordination patterns rather than memorizing complete sequences.

The framework's modularity allows it to adapt to various coordination tasks by learning temporal patterns independently of specific spatial trajectories. This separation enables generalization across different robot teams and task types while maintaining high-fidelity reproduction of demonstrated behaviors. The approach addresses the challenge of learning complex multi-robot coordination from limited demonstrations by identifying and leveraging fundamental task structures.

## Key Results
- Achieved perfect scores (OSR, SSR, GCR = 1.0) across all four tested tasks in simulation
- Fréchet distance values between 0.02 and 0.04 demonstrate high-fidelity trajectory reproduction
- Successfully deployed on physical robots, reproducing complex task behaviors from few demonstrations
- Spectral clustering reduced data requirements by extracting key interdependencies from demonstration graphs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its principled separation of temporal and spatial learning, allowing each component to specialize in its respective domain. Temporal Graph Networks excel at capturing temporal dependencies in coordination patterns, while Gaussian Processes provide smooth, probabilistic trajectory modeling. Spectral clustering identifies the most informative coordination patterns from demonstrations, enabling the system to generalize from limited data rather than memorizing specific instances.

## Foundational Learning
- **Temporal Graph Networks**: Needed to capture temporal dependencies in multi-robot coordination sequences; quick check: verify TGN can learn from demonstration graphs with varying lengths and structures
- **Gaussian Processes for trajectory modeling**: Required for smooth, probabilistic spatial path generation; quick check: ensure GP can handle different trajectory complexities and uncertainties
- **Spectral clustering**: Essential for identifying key interdependencies in demonstration graphs; quick check: validate clustering identifies meaningful coordination patterns
- **Learning from Demonstration (LfD)**: Core paradigm for acquiring multi-robot coordination skills; quick check: confirm framework can reproduce demonstrated behaviors accurately
- **Task-agnostic temporal learning**: Enables generalization across different coordination scenarios; quick check: test with novel task types not seen during training

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Demonstration Graphs -> TGN (Temporal Learning) -> Sequence Generator -> GP (Spatial Learning) -> Trajectory Executor

**Critical Path**: Demonstration collection → Graph construction → Spectral clustering → TGN training → Sequence generation → GP trajectory planning → Execution

**Design Tradeoffs**: The separation of temporal and spatial learning enables modularity but requires careful synchronization between components; spectral clustering reduces data needs but may miss subtle coordination patterns

**Failure Signatures**: Poor temporal learning manifests as incorrect action sequencing; spatial learning failures result in suboptimal or collision-prone trajectories; clustering errors lead to missing or incorrect coordination patterns

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Validate TGN's ability to learn temporal sequences from demonstration graphs across different task types
2. Test GP's trajectory generation accuracy and smoothness with varying sequence inputs
3. Evaluate spectral clustering's effectiveness in identifying key interdependencies from complex demonstration graphs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation with truly minimal demonstrations (fewer than four) despite "few-shot" framing
- Real-world results lack quantitative metrics comparable to simulation evaluation
- Focus on homogeneous or simple heterogeneous teams raises scalability concerns for larger, more diverse robot collectives

## Confidence
- **High**: Simulation results showing perfect success rates across all four task types
- **High**: Fréchet distance values (0.02-0.04) indicating high-fidelity trajectory reproduction
- **Medium**: Real-world deployment claims without quantitative validation comparable to simulation
- **Medium**: Scalability to more complex, unstructured environments remains unproven

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate DDACE's performance with fewer than four demonstrations across all four task types to verify true few-shot capability
2. Test the framework with heterogeneous robot teams of varying capabilities and communication constraints in both simulation and real-world settings
3. Conduct systematic ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each component (TGN, GP, spectral clustering) to overall performance and identify potential bottlenecks
