# Beyond Benchmarks: A Novel Framework for Domain-Specific LLM Evaluation and Knowledge Mapping
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.07658
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07658
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces a deterministic pipeline converting raw domain corpora into completion-type benchmarks without LLM or human curation, enabling evaluation on latest domain data while avoiding contamination.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel framework for domain-specific large language model evaluation that addresses benchmark contamination issues and enables direct assessment of models on current domain data. The method generates completion-type benchmarks deterministically from raw domain corpora using TF and TF-IDF for keyword extraction, creating prompt-target pairs that evaluate domain knowledge in base models. The approach shows strong correlation with expert-generated benchmarks and outperforms traditional perplexity metrics for measuring domain knowledge. Experiments across multiple models and domains reveal that domain adaptation occurs rapidly in smaller models (within 500 steps) and follows a pattern of steep initial improvement followed by gradual saturation, enabling efficient early stopping.

## Method Summary
The framework uses a deterministic pipeline that converts raw domain corpora into completion-type benchmarks without requiring large language models or human curation. The process involves generating domain-specific keywords and related word lists using TF and TF-IDF techniques, then constructing prompt-target pairs to directly assess domain knowledge in base models. This approach specifically targets benchmark contamination issues while enabling evaluation on the latest domain data. The method creates a controlled environment for evaluating domain-specific knowledge acquisition and adaptation patterns across different model architectures and sizes.

## Key Results
- The benchmark strongly correlates with expert-generated benchmarks and outperforms traditional perplexity metrics for measuring domain knowledge
- Domain adaptation occurs rapidly in smaller models within 500 steps, following steep initial improvement then gradual saturation
- Layer-wise analysis reveals initial-to-mid layers handle attribute extraction while later layers focus on next-token prediction, with amplified forgetting in deeper layers during adaptation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The deterministic pipeline creates a controlled environment for evaluating domain-specific knowledge by generating prompts directly from domain corpora using statistical keyword extraction. This approach eliminates contamination from pretrained model knowledge while ensuring prompts reflect actual domain vocabulary and structure. The completion-type format forces models to demonstrate understanding of domain-specific relationships and terminology rather than relying on memorized patterns. The TF/TF-IDF based keyword generation captures domain-relevant terms that represent the core vocabulary and concepts of the field being evaluated.

## Foundational Learning
- TF/TF-IDF keyword extraction - needed for domain-specific term identification; quick check: keyword relevance scores and domain coverage
- Prompt-target pair construction - needed for completion-based evaluation; quick check: prompt-target alignment and domain specificity
- Layer-wise activation analysis - needed for mechanistic understanding; quick check: activation patterns across layers for domain-specific tasks
- Catastrophic forgetting quantification - needed for adaptation assessment; quick check: knowledge retention vs new knowledge acquisition
- Perplexity vs knowledge correlation - needed for evaluation metric validation; quick check: correlation coefficients across multiple domains

## Architecture Onboarding
Component Map: Raw Corpus -> TF/TF-IDF Processing -> Keyword Extraction -> Prompt-Target Pair Generation -> Benchmark Creation -> Model Evaluation -> Layer-wise Analysis -> Knowledge Mapping
Critical Path: Corpus Processing -> Benchmark Generation -> Model Evaluation -> Mechanistic Analysis
Design Tradeoffs: Computational efficiency vs prompt quality, deterministic vs LLM-assisted generation, completion tasks vs other evaluation formats
Failure Signatures: Keyword irrelevance, prompt-target misalignment, poor correlation with expert benchmarks, inconsistent layer-wise patterns
First Experiments:
1. Validate keyword relevance by comparing extracted terms against domain expert vocabulary lists
2. Test benchmark correlation with human-curated domain-specific evaluation sets
3. Verify layer-wise activation patterns match expected attribute extraction and prediction division

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- TF/TF-IDF keyword generation may produce contextually shallow prompts compared to expert-crafted benchmarks
- Layer-wise mechanistic findings based on limited model families and domains may not generalize
- Rapid adaptation claims within 500 steps may not hold for larger models or complex domains
- Focus on completion tasks may not capture other critical aspects of domain-specific performance

## Confidence
High: Deterministic pipeline reduces contamination risk, enables evaluation on current data, strong correlation with expert benchmarks
Medium: Domain adaptation speed claims, benchmark quality compared to expert curation, generalization of layer-wise patterns
Low: Generalizability of mechanistic layer-wise findings across diverse architectures, performance on complex reasoning tasks

## Next Checks
1. Systematic evaluation of TF/TF-IDF benchmark generation pipeline across 10+ diverse technical domains to quantify correlation with multiple expert benchmarks
2. Replication of layer-wise mechanistic analysis on additional model families including decoder-only, encoder-decoder, and MoE architectures
3. Controlled experiments comparing deterministic pipeline against LLM-assisted prompt generation and human expert benchmarks across multiple evaluation metrics
