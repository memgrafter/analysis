# Lifted Forward Planning in Relational Factored Markov Decision Processes with Concurrent Actions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.22147
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22147
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Foreplan achieves polynomial complexity for rfMDPs with concurrent actions by exploiting indistinguishability among objects

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Foreplan, a lifted forward planner that efficiently solves relational factored Markov Decision Processes (rfMDPs) with concurrent actions. The core innovation lies in exploiting the indistinguishability among objects through first-order representations and counting abstractions, reducing exponential state and action spaces to polynomial complexity. The method uses a relational cost graph to identify dependencies between variables and employs extended Counting Random Variables (CRVs) to count object assignments, enabling significant computational savings.

## Method Summary
Foreplan leverages first-order representations to exploit object indistinguishability in rfMDPs. The approach constructs a relational cost graph to identify variable dependencies and uses extended Counting Random Variables (CRVs) to count object assignments efficiently. By representing states and actions at an abstract level rather than enumerating all ground instances, Foreplan achieves polynomial complexity where traditional methods face exponential blowup. The method includes both exact and approximate variants, with the latter providing further runtime reductions while maintaining high accuracy.

## Key Results
- Achieves speedup of at least four orders of magnitude compared to existing approaches
- Solves problems with up to 191 objects where competitors fail after 15 objects
- Approximate variant maintains over 97% accuracy while reducing runtime to polynomial in all parameters

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Foreplan works by exploiting the structural properties of rfMDPs where many objects are indistinguishable. Instead of explicitly representing each ground state and action, it uses first-order representations that capture the essential relationships between variables. The relational cost graph identifies which variables affect each other, allowing the algorithm to focus computation only where dependencies exist. Extended CRVs provide a compact way to count object assignments without enumerating them individually, dramatically reducing the search space.

## Foundational Learning
**Relational Factored MDPs**: Why needed - provide a compact representation for problems with relational structure; Quick check - can represent fluents and actions in terms of objects and their relationships
**Counting Random Variables**: Why needed - enable efficient counting of object assignments without enumeration; Quick check - maintain polynomial complexity for counting operations
**First-Order Representations**: Why needed - allow abstraction over object types to exploit indistinguishability; Quick check - reduce ground state space by grouping equivalent objects

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: CRVs -> Relational Cost Graph -> State Space Abstraction -> Action Selection
**Critical Path**: The algorithm first constructs the relational cost graph, then uses CRVs to count object assignments, applies first-order state abstraction, and finally performs action selection based on the compressed representation
**Design Tradeoffs**: Exact vs approximate variants - the approximate version sacrifices some accuracy for significant runtime improvements, trading solution quality for scalability
**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance when objects are highly heterogeneous (indistinguishability assumption breaks down), or when action concurrency creates complex interaction patterns that don't decompose well
**First Experiments**: 1) Run on a small rfMDP with known ground truth to verify correctness; 2) Test scalability by increasing object count while monitoring runtime; 3) Compare exact vs approximate variants on benchmark problems

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance relies heavily on object indistinguishability assumptions that may not hold in all domains
- Evaluation focuses on artificial benchmarks rather than real-world applications with noisy data
- Scalability may degrade for problems with heterogeneous objects or complex relational structures

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Polynomial complexity analysis and fundamental algorithmic framework for exploiting indistinguishability
- **Medium Confidence**: The claimed four orders of magnitude speedup and the methodology for baseline comparisons
- **Medium Confidence**: The approximate variant's accuracy claims and the sensitivity of approximation quality to problem characteristics

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate Foreplan on problems with heterogeneous objects where counting abstractions are less effective to assess the method's limits
2. Conduct runtime analysis on problems with varying action concurrency levels to understand the polynomial complexity bounds empirically
3. Test the approximate variant's performance across diverse rfMDP problem distributions to establish reliability guarantees
