# Falsification-Driven Reinforcement Learning for Maritime Motion Planning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.06970
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06970
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: CMA-ES-based falsification approach improves COLREGs compliance by 3-16% in two-vessel maritime scenarios

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of training reinforcement learning (RL) agents to comply with maritime traffic rules (COLREGs) for autonomous vessels. The key difficulty is that complex maritime scenarios are hard to design, and real-world data is insufficient for effective training. The proposed solution is a falsification-driven RL approach that generates adversarial training scenarios using covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) to optimize scenario inputs, targeting violations of STL-specified maritime traffic rules by the current RL policy. By integrating these counterexamples into the training process, the RL agent learns to handle more challenging and relevant scenarios.

## Method Summary
The proposed approach integrates signal temporal logic (STL) specifications of COLREGs with reinforcement learning and falsification techniques. The system uses CMA-ES to search for initial conditions and scenario parameters that cause the current RL policy to violate COLREGs rules. These adversarial scenarios are then used to augment the training data, forcing the RL agent to learn robust behaviors that comply with traffic rules even in challenging situations. The method is evaluated on open-sea navigation with two vessels, demonstrating improved rule compliance compared to baseline methods across different encounter types including crossing, head-on, and overtaking scenarios.

## Key Results
- Falsification-driven RL achieves 3-16% higher rule compliance across different encounter types compared to baseline methods
- The approach exhibits reduced standard deviation across random seeds, indicating more reliable learning of give-way maneuvers
- Falsification-trained agent shows more consistent COLREGs compliance in crossing, head-on, and overtaking scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by systematically generating challenging scenarios that expose weaknesses in the current RL policy's understanding of COLREGs. By using CMA-ES to optimize scenario parameters toward rule violations, the method creates a curriculum of increasingly difficult scenarios that push the agent to learn robust compliance strategies. This adversarial training process ensures the RL agent encounters and learns from edge cases that would be difficult to design manually or capture in real-world data.

## Foundational Learning
- Signal Temporal Logic (STL): Formal specification language for describing temporal properties and constraints - needed for precise COLREGs rule formulation, quick check: verify STL formulas capture all required maritime rules
- Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES): Evolutionary algorithm for continuous optimization - needed for efficient search of adversarial scenarios, quick check: confirm convergence properties on benchmark functions
- Reinforcement Learning Policy Training: Iterative optimization of agent behavior through reward maximization - needed for learning compliant navigation strategies, quick check: validate reward shaping aligns with COLREGs objectives
- Maritime Traffic Rules (COLREGs): International regulations for preventing collisions at sea - needed as the compliance target, quick check: ensure full coverage of relevant COLREGs articles

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:**
Initial Conditions -> CMA-ES Optimization -> Adversarial Scenario Generation -> RL Training Environment -> RL Policy Update -> Rule Violation Detection (STL)

**Critical Path:**
Scenario Generation (CMA-ES) -> RL Training -> Rule Compliance Evaluation (STL)

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Computational cost of CMA-ES vs. quality of generated scenarios
- Frequency of falsification integration vs. training stability
- Complexity of STL specifications vs. training tractability

**Failure Signatures:**
- CMA-ES converging to trivial scenarios
- RL policy overfitting to specific adversarial patterns
- STL specifications not capturing complete COLREGs requirements

**First Experiments:**
1. Validate CMA-ES optimization on synthetic COLREGs violation scenarios
2. Test STL-based rule violation detection on known compliant/non-compliant trajectories
3. Benchmark baseline RL training without falsification for comparison

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to simple two-vessel scenarios, not capturing multi-vessel complexity
- Reliance on specific STL formulations may limit generalizability to different regulatory frameworks
- Computational overhead of CMA-ES could pose practical implementation challenges
- Does not address performance under real-world uncertainties like sensor noise

## Confidence
- High confidence in CMA-ES optimization framework implementation
- Medium confidence in generalization to complex maritime scenarios
- Medium confidence in scalability for real-world deployment

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the approach in multi-vessel scenarios with 3+ interacting ships to assess scalability and rule compliance in complex traffic situations
2. Test policy robustness under realistic perturbations including sensor noise, communication delays, and imperfect state estimation
3. Benchmark computational efficiency and real-time performance requirements against baseline methods to assess practical deployment feasibility
