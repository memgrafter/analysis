- A convergence theory for PnP-PGD with mismatched priors that removes restrictive assumptions and introduces equivariant PnP to improve robustness

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes the first convergence theory for plug-and-play proximal gradient descent (PnP-PGD) when the denoiser is trained on a mismatched prior distribution. The analysis removes restrictive assumptions from prior work, allowing nonconvex data fidelity terms, nonconvex regularizers, and expansive denoisers. The main result shows that PnP-PGD converges to a stationary point under a mismatch error bound condition, with explicit rates dependent on the mismatch magnitude. The paper also introduces equivariant PnP (EPnP), proving it reduces error variance and tightens convergence bounds compared to standard PnP-PGD when the bias is anisotropic. This provides a principled geometric intervention to improve robustness against structural prior mismatch without retraining the denoiser.

## Method Summary
The authors analyze PnP-PGD with a denoiser trained on a prior distribution different from the true prior generating the data. They establish convergence by introducing a mismatch error bound condition that quantifies the distance between the true prior and the denoiser's training distribution. The analysis relaxes previous assumptions by allowing nonconvex data fidelity terms, nonconvex regularizers, and expansive denoisers. Additionally, they propose equivariant PnP (EPnP) that accounts for the geometric structure of the forward operator, proving it reduces error variance and provides tighter convergence bounds when the bias introduced by prior mismatch is anisotropic.

## Key Results
- PnP-PGD converges to a stationary point under a mismatch error bound condition with rates dependent on mismatch magnitude
- Convergence rates explicitly depend on the mismatch error bound constant, providing a principled way to quantify the impact of prior mismatch
- EPnP reduces error variance and tightens convergence bounds compared to standard PnP-PGD when bias is anisotropic
- The analysis removes restrictive assumptions from prior work, allowing nonconvex regularizers and expansive denoisers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The convergence is established through a novel mismatch error bound condition that characterizes the distance between the true prior and the denoiser's training distribution. This condition allows the analysis to account for the bias introduced by prior mismatch while maintaining convergence guarantees. The equivariant PnP formulation improves robustness by incorporating geometric knowledge of the forward operator, which reduces the variance of the error term when the bias is anisotropic. The mathematical framework leverages tools from nonconvex optimization theory while extending them to the plug-and-play setting with mismatched priors.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Plug-and-Play Proximal Gradient Descent (PnP-PGD)**: An iterative algorithm where a learned denoiser replaces the proximal operator in standard proximal gradient descent. Why needed: This is the algorithmic framework being analyzed. Quick check: Verify understanding of the basic PnP-PGD iteration: x_{k+1} = D(x_k - s∇f(x_k)) where D is the denoiser.

2. **Mismatch Error Bound Condition (MEBC)**: A condition that quantifies the distance between the true prior distribution and the denoiser's training distribution. Why needed: This is the key assumption enabling convergence analysis under prior mismatch. Quick check: Understand that MEBC requires the distance between true and learned prior to be bounded by a constant times the difference in their expectations.

3. **Nonconvex Optimization**: The framework allows both the data fidelity term and regularizer to be nonconvex functions. Why needed: Real-world imaging problems often involve nonconvex objectives. Quick check: Recognize that convergence is established to stationary points rather than global optima.

4. **Expansive Denoisers**: The analysis allows denoisers that can expand the range of their inputs, not just contract them. Why needed: Many modern denoisers are not guaranteed to be contractive. Quick check: Understand that the analysis requires only bounded iterates and restricted expansion, not full contractivity.

5. **Equivariant Operators**: Operators that commute with the forward operator's singular value decomposition. Why needed: EPnP uses this property to reduce error variance. Quick check: Verify that the forward operator's SVD is known and that the denoiser can be modified to be equivariant.

6. **Stationary Point Convergence**: The analysis establishes convergence to points where the gradient is zero, rather than requiring convergence to a global minimum. Why needed: This is the appropriate notion of convergence for nonconvex problems. Quick check: Understand that the final iterate satisfies a stationarity condition up to some error bound.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Forward Operator → Data Fidelity → Denoiser (mismatched prior) → PnP-PGD Iteration → Stationary Point

**Critical Path:**
The critical path for convergence is: Forward Operator → Data Fidelity → Gradient Computation → PnP-PGD Update → Denoiser Application. The bottleneck is the MEBC constant, which determines the convergence rate.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Relaxing contractivity assumptions allows more flexible denoisers but requires bounded iterates
- Allowing nonconvex objectives increases applicability but only guarantees stationary point convergence
- EPnP improves robustness when bias is anisotropic but requires knowledge of forward operator geometry

**Failure Signatures:**
- Slow convergence indicates large MEBC constant (significant prior mismatch)
- Oscillation suggests the denoiser is too expansive or iterates are becoming unbounded
- Poor final solution quality indicates the denoiser's bias is not well-handled by the geometric correction

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Verify convergence of standard PnP-PGD on a simple nonconvex problem with mismatched prior
2. Test EPnP on a problem where the forward operator's SVD is known and prior mismatch is structured
3. Empirically estimate the MEBC constant on synthetic problems with controllable mismatch

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations

- The mismatch error bound condition requires quantifying the distance between true and learned prior distributions, which is difficult to estimate in practice
- EPnP requires knowledge of the forward operator's singular value decomposition, limiting applicability in some settings
- The analysis assumes bounded iterates and restricted denoiser expansion, though these are shown to be mild relaxations

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Mathematical derivation and proof techniques
**Medium Confidence:** Practical relevance of convergence rates (depends on MEBC constant estimation)
**Low Confidence:** Universal applicability of EPnP across diverse practical scenarios

## Next Checks

1. Empirical validation of the MEBC constant estimation using synthetic mismatched priors with controllable mismatch magnitude
2. Comparison of EPnP vs standard PnP-PGD on real imaging tasks where the forward operator is well-characterized (e.g., deblurring with known PSF)
3. Extension of analysis to time-varying forward operators to assess robustness of EPnP when geometric assumptions are relaxed
