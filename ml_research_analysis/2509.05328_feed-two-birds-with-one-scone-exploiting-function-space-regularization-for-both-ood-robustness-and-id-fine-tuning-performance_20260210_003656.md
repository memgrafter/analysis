# Feed Two Birds with One Scone: Exploiting Function-Space Regularization for Both OOD Robustness and ID Fine-Tuning Performance

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.05328
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05328
- Authors: Xiang Yuan; Jun Shu; Deyu meng; Zongben Xu
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proposes function-space regularization to achieve both strong in-distribution performance and out-of-distribution robustness during fine-tuning of foundation models like CLIP

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of robust fine-tuning for foundation models like CLIP, which aims to maintain strong in-distribution (ID) performance while improving out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness. The proposed method employs function-space regularization to simultaneously optimize both objectives. While experimental results on benchmark datasets support the claims, several key limitations and uncertainties warrant consideration, including moderate confidence due to evaluation primarily on image-text models and unclear generalization to other architectures or distribution shift types.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a function-space regularization approach that simultaneously optimizes in-distribution (ID) performance and out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness during fine-tuning of foundation models. The method introduces a regularization term in the function space that encourages the model to maintain consistent predictions across similar inputs while being robust to distribution shifts. This is achieved by penalizing the difference between the model's predictions on original and perturbed inputs, effectively creating a smoother decision boundary that generalizes better to OOD data.

## Key Results
- Function-space regularization successfully maintains strong ID performance while improving OOD robustness
- The method shows effectiveness on image-text models like CLIP across benchmark datasets
- Claims of achieving both objectives simultaneously are supported by experimental results

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The function-space regularization works by constraining the model's output function to be smooth and consistent across similar inputs. By penalizing large changes in predictions for small perturbations, the model learns to create decision boundaries that are both accurate on in-distribution data and robust to distribution shifts. This dual objective is achieved through a carefully designed regularization term that balances the trade-off between fitting the training data and maintaining generalization to unseen distributions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Function-space regularization**: A technique that constrains the model's output function rather than its parameters, enabling better generalization. Why needed: Traditional parameter-space regularization may not effectively capture the desired functional properties. Quick check: Verify that the regularization term is properly defined in the output space.
- **Out-of-distribution robustness**: The ability of a model to maintain performance on data that differs from the training distribution. Why needed: Foundation models must perform well in real-world scenarios where data distribution can vary significantly. Quick check: Test the method on diverse distribution shift types.
- **In-distribution fine-tuning**: The process of adapting a pre-trained model to a specific task while maintaining performance on the original distribution. Why needed: Fine-tuning must not degrade the model's original capabilities. Quick check: Ensure ID performance metrics are not compromised.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Pre-trained foundation model (e.g., CLIP) -> Fine-tuning module with function-space regularization -> Regularization term computation -> Loss function aggregation
- **Critical path**: Input data → Foundation model → Fine-tuning module → Regularization term computation → Combined loss → Parameter updates
- **Design tradeoffs**: The method introduces computational overhead through the regularization term but claims this is manageable. The trade-off between regularization strength and model performance must be carefully balanced.
- **Failure signatures**: Over-regularization may lead to underfitting and degraded ID performance. Insufficient regularization may fail to improve OOD robustness. Sensitivity to hyperparameter choices can affect stability.
- **First experiments**:
  1. Validate the regularization term's effect on a simple regression task
  2. Test the method on a small image classification dataset before scaling to larger models
  3. Compare performance against standard fine-tuning baselines on a controlled distribution shift

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily focuses on image-text models, limiting generalization to other foundation model architectures or modalities
- Computational overhead introduced by the function-space regularization approach is not thoroughly explored for larger models
- Performance under diverse types of distribution shifts (e.g., semantic, covariate, or concept drift) remains unclear

## Confidence
- Claims about achieving both strong ID performance and improved OOD robustness: Medium
- Generalizability to other foundation model architectures: Low
- Scalability to larger models: Low

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Modal Generalization**: Evaluate the method's effectiveness on non-image-text foundation models (e.g., language models or multimodal models) to assess its broader applicability.
2. **Distribution Shift Robustness**: Test the method's performance under diverse types of distribution shifts, including semantic and concept drift, to validate its robustness claims comprehensively.
3. **Scalability Analysis**: Conduct experiments on larger foundation models (e.g., GPT-3 or beyond) to quantify the computational overhead and assess the method's scalability in real-world applications.
