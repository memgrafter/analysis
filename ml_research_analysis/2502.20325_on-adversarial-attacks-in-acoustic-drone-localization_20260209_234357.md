# On Adversarial Attacks In Acoustic Drone Localization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.20325
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20325
- Authors: Tamir Shor; Chaim Baskin; Alex Bronstein
- Reference count: 30
- Key result: Universal adversarial perturbations increase RMS localization error from ~5% to ~37%, mitigated to ~6% via phase modulation defense

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates adversarial attacks on acoustic drone localization systems for the first time. The authors demonstrate that universal adversarial perturbations, optimized via projected gradient descent and constrained for feasibility, can severely degrade localization accuracy from 4.87% to 37.4% RMS error. They introduce a novel defense called Phase Modulation Perturbation Delineation that exploits the periodic nature of drone propulsion noise to recover clean signals, reducing RMS error back to 6.02%. The study evaluates both targeted and untargeted attacks across multiple acoustic environments, showing consistent results while also exploring the impact of optimizing attack source location.

## Method Summary
The paper addresses acoustic drone localization using self-sound from drone propulsion. The attack employs universal adversarial perturbations optimized via projected gradient descent (PGD) in a sine-wave basis, constrained to remain feasible within drone propulsion frequency ranges. The defense, Phase Modulation Perturbation Delineation, recovers clean signals by subtracting perturbed waveforms after applying phase modulations. The study uses Neural Acoustic Fields (NAFs) from Luo et al. 2022 to generate room impulse responses for training a 3-layer transformer-encoder localization model with 1024 hidden dimensions. Experiments are conducted across Matterport3D and Replica dataset scenes with both fixed and optimized source locations for attacks.

## Key Results
- Clean localization achieves 4.87% RMS error, while adversarial attacks increase this to 37.4%
- The proposed defense reduces attacked RMS error to 6.02%, nearly matching clean performance
- Source location optimization provides only marginal improvements in attack effectiveness for standard environments
- Results are consistent across multiple acoustic environments (apartment, office, room scenes)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The attack works by optimizing universal perturbations that can be added to drone propulsion signals to mislead localization models. The PGD optimization in a sine-wave basis with frequency constraints ensures perturbations remain physically plausible for drone systems. The defense exploits the periodic nature of drone propulsion noise by applying phase modulations and subtracting perturbed waveforms, effectively canceling out the adversarial component while preserving the underlying acoustic signal structure.

## Foundational Learning
- **Universal adversarial perturbations**: Optimized perturbations that work across multiple inputs; needed to create robust attacks that generalize across different drone positions/orientations; quick check: verify perturbation effectiveness across diverse test samples
- **Projected gradient descent (PGD)**: Iterative optimization method with projection onto constraint sets; needed to ensure perturbations remain physically feasible within drone frequency ranges; quick check: confirm constraint satisfaction after each optimization iteration
- **Room Impulse Response (RIR) generation**: Synthetic acoustic environment modeling using Neural Acoustic Fields; needed to create realistic training data without requiring physical recordings; quick check: verify RIR dimensions match microphone array configuration
- **Phase modulation recovery**: Signal processing technique exploiting periodicity; needed to separate adversarial components from legitimate drone propulsion noise; quick check: confirm perturbation period divides drone cycle appropriately
- **Transformer-encoder architecture**: Self-attention based model for acoustic feature extraction; needed to learn spatial-temporal patterns in drone sound propagation; quick check: validate attention weights capture meaningful acoustic features

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: NAF RIR Generator -> Transformer-Encoder Localization Model -> Universal PGD Attack -> Phase Modulation Defense

**Critical path**: The attack-defend cycle follows: drone sound generation → RIR convolution → localization prediction → adversarial perturbation optimization → signal recovery via phase modulation → localization on recovered signal

**Design tradeoffs**: Fixed vs. optimized source location balances attack effectiveness against computational cost (43GB GPU memory requirement). Sine-wave basis for perturbations trades representational flexibility for physical plausibility within drone propulsion frequencies.

**Failure signatures**: Attack failure occurs when perturbations violate frequency constraints or when localization model becomes invariant to adversarial patterns. Defense failure manifests as incomplete perturbation recovery, particularly at t=0 where scalar uncertainty remains unresolved.

**3 first experiments**: 1) Generate RIRs using pre-trained NAF models for target scenes, 2) Train transformer-encoder localization model with phase modulation optimization, 3) Implement universal PGD attack with sine-wave basis and frequency constraints

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- **Question**: Does optimizing the adversarial attack source location provide significant performance improvements over a fixed source location in highly non-convex room geometries?
- **Question**: Can the proposed attack and defense frameworks be effectively extended from 2D localization to 6-Degrees-of-Freedom (6-DoF) regression problems?
- **Question**: Can the scalar uncertainty in the recovered perturbation waveform at moment $t=0$ be resolved by imposing correlation among several perturbation waveforms at different locations?

## Limitations
- Exact transformer-encoder architecture details are not specified beyond layer count and hidden dimension
- Pre-trained NAF model weights and RIR query interface are not directly accessible
- Defense mechanism assumptions about perturbation periodicity matching drone cycles are not fully validated beyond synthetic settings
- Source location optimization requires substantial GPU memory (>43GB), limiting practical reproduction

## Confidence
- **High**: Feasibility of adversarial attack on acoustic localization, basic defense principle
- **Medium**: Quantitative results, joint source-location optimization methodology
- **Low**: Exact model architecture details, RIR generation pipeline fidelity, defense robustness in diverse acoustic environments

## Next Checks
1. Verify RIR generation output from pre-trained NAF models matches expected microphone array configurations before training localization model
2. Implement and test learned linear subsampling operator to ensure temporal dimension reduction (12000→1200) is correctly applied
3. Validate perturbation periodicity assumption by analyzing δ uncertainty bounds and ensuring defense frequency constraints are met for synthetic drone propulsion noise
