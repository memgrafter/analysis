# TimeHF: Billion-Scale Time Series Models Guided by Human Feedback

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.15942
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15942
- Reference count: 20
- 6B parameter time series model with human feedback achieves 33.21% accuracy improvement in supply chain deployment

## Executive Summary
TimeHF introduces a novel pipeline for creating large-scale time series models with 6 billion parameters that incorporate human feedback to address key challenges in time series forecasting. The framework combines patch convolutional embedding to capture long-range temporal dependencies with a time-series policy optimization (TPO) mechanism that leverages human feedback. Deployed at JD.com for automated replenishment across 20,000+ products, TimeHF demonstrates significant improvements in prediction accuracy compared to existing methods while maintaining strong zero-shot and fine-tuned performance across various datasets.

## Method Summary
TimeHF addresses the limitations of traditional time series forecasting methods by introducing a human-in-the-loop approach to training large transformer-based models. The framework uses patch convolutional embedding to effectively process long time series sequences, followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with time-series policy optimization (TPO). The TPO mechanism incorporates human feedback through preference data to guide model training, outperforming standard RLHF approaches like PPO and RLOO. The complete pipeline consists of pre-training on large time series datasets, SFT for initial refinement, and TPO for final optimization using human feedback.

## Key Results
- Achieves 33.21% improvement in prediction accuracy over existing methods in JD.com supply chain deployment
- PCLTM+SFT+TPO configuration shows superior performance across various time series datasets
- TPO framework outperforms PPO and RLOO in both predictive performance and training efficiency
- Successfully scales to 6 billion parameters while maintaining effective zero-shot and fine-tuned capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of TimeHF stems from its ability to combine the scalability of large transformer models with the nuanced guidance of human expertise. The patch convolutional embedding allows the model to effectively capture long-range dependencies in time series data that traditional methods miss. The human feedback mechanism through TPO provides a way to incorporate domain expertise and preference signals that are difficult to capture through purely automated approaches. By using SFT as an intermediate step before TPO, the model benefits from both supervised learning stability and reinforcement learning's ability to optimize for specific objectives defined by human preferences.

## Foundational Learning
- **Time series forecasting fundamentals**: Understanding of temporal dependencies, seasonality, and trend components is essential for designing effective time series models.
- **Transformer architecture**: Knowledge of self-attention mechanisms and positional encoding needed to understand how large models process sequential data.
- **Reinforcement learning with human feedback**: Understanding RLHF concepts like reward modeling, preference learning, and policy optimization critical for grasping TPO.
- **Large-scale model training**: Familiarity with distributed training, optimization techniques, and parameter scaling necessary for handling 6B parameter models.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Data -> Patch Convolutional Embedding -> Transformer Layers -> SFT -> TPO -> Predictions

Critical path: Raw time series data flows through patch convolutional embedding to capture long-range patterns, then through transformer layers for representation learning, followed by SFT for initial refinement, and finally TPO for human feedback-guided optimization.

Design tradeoffs: Large parameter count (6B) enables capturing complex patterns but requires significant computational resources; human feedback improves quality but introduces dependency on expert availability; patch convolutional embedding balances local and global pattern capture.

Failure signatures: Poor generalization may occur if human feedback is biased or limited in scope; computational bottlenecks during training with large models; overfitting to specific domains without diverse training data.

First experiments:
1. Test patch convolutional embedding on synthetic time series with known long-range dependencies
2. Validate TPO framework on a small dataset with controlled human feedback
3. Benchmark zero-shot performance against established time series models on standard datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Limited comparative analysis against broader state-of-the-art time series forecasting methods
- Lack of transparency in evaluation metrics and experimental setup for performance comparisons
- Need for more detailed implementation specifics regarding scalability and deployment
- Sample size and specific conditions of TPO superiority comparisons not clearly specified

## Confidence

High Confidence:
- Architectural components (patch convolutional embedding, TPO framework) are technically sound and clearly described

Medium Confidence:
- Performance improvements (33.21% accuracy gain) based on internal evaluations without independent verification
- Scalability claims for 6B parameters and 20,000+ products plausible but lack detailed implementation specifics
- Superiority of TPO over PPO and RLOO demonstrated but comparison conditions unclear

## Next Checks

1. Conduct head-to-head comparisons of TimeHF against established time series forecasting benchmarks (Prophet, ARIMA, LSTM-based models) on standardized datasets like M4 Competition data with publicly available code and results.

2. Perform ablation studies to isolate the contribution of individual components (patch convolutional embedding, SFT, TPO) to overall performance gains, measuring the incremental improvement of each element.

3. Test the generalization capabilities of TimeHF across different domains beyond supply chain applications, including financial time series, weather forecasting, and sensor data, to validate cross-domain applicability.
