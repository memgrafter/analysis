# AI Agent-Driven Framework for Automated Product Knowledge Graph Construction in E-Commerce

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2511.11017
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11017
- **Reference count:** 21
- **Primary result:** Achieved over 97% property coverage with minimal redundancy in product knowledge graph construction using LLM agents

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an innovative AI agent-driven framework that automates the construction of product knowledge graphs in e-commerce by eliminating manual schema design and extraction rules. The framework leverages three specialized LLM-powered agents to iteratively create, refine, and populate product ontologies from unstructured descriptions. Tested on a real-world dataset of 291 air conditioner descriptions, the system demonstrates strong performance with 97% property coverage and minimal redundancy, generating a fine-grained ontology with 42 classes and 69 properties, and producing 7,459 RDF triples from 282 products. The results highlight the potential of LLM agents for scalable, accurate structured knowledge extraction in retail environments.

## Method Summary
The framework employs three specialized LLM agents working in an iterative cycle: the Schema Agent creates and refines the product ontology, the Knowledge Agent extracts and structures product information from descriptions, and the Quality Agent evaluates and ensures data quality. The system processes unstructured product descriptions through these agents to automatically generate a comprehensive knowledge graph without requiring manual schema design or predefined extraction rules. The agents collaborate to build the ontology structure, extract relevant properties and values, and validate the resulting triples for accuracy and completeness.

## Key Results
- Achieved over 97% property coverage across the air conditioner product category
- Generated 7,459 RDF triples from 282 products with minimal redundancy
- Produced a fine-grained ontology with 42 classes and 69 properties

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from leveraging LLMs' natural language understanding capabilities to handle unstructured product descriptions, while the multi-agent architecture allows for specialized, iterative refinement of both ontology structure and extracted data. The separation of concerns between schema creation, knowledge extraction, and quality assurance enables focused optimization for each task, while the iterative process allows continuous improvement of the knowledge graph construction.

## Foundational Learning

**Product Knowledge Graphs** - Structured representations of product information enabling semantic search and recommendation; needed to provide context for why structured data matters in e-commerce.

**LLM Agent Architecture** - Multi-agent systems where specialized agents handle different aspects of a task; needed to understand how the framework decomposes complex knowledge extraction into manageable components.

**RDF Triples** - Subject-predicate-object statements used to represent knowledge in semantic web formats; needed to grasp the output format and data representation method.

**Ontology Engineering** - The process of creating structured vocabularies and relationships between concepts; needed to understand how the framework builds product schemas automatically.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Raw product descriptions -> Schema Agent -> Knowledge Agent -> Quality Agent -> RDF Triples -> Knowledge Graph

**Critical Path:** Product descriptions enter the system, are processed by the Schema Agent to establish ontology, then the Knowledge Agent extracts structured data, and finally the Quality Agent validates and refines the output before generating RDF triples.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework trades computational efficiency and API costs for eliminating manual schema design and extraction rules, relying on LLM capabilities rather than traditional rule-based approaches.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor ontology structure from Schema Agent leads to incomplete property coverage; Knowledge Agent extraction errors result in missing or incorrect values; Quality Agent failures allow redundant or low-quality triples into the final graph.

**First Experiments:**
1. Test the framework on a small sample of product descriptions from a single category to validate basic functionality
2. Evaluate agent coordination by running each agent independently and comparing results to the integrated system
3. Measure coverage and redundancy metrics on a controlled dataset with known ground truth

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to a single product category (air conditioners) with 291 descriptions, restricting generalizability
- High coverage metrics don't account for potential semantic errors or misclassification rates
- Framework's dependence on LLM APIs raises concerns about reproducibility, cost sustainability, and vendor lock-in

## Confidence

**Framework Effectiveness:** High - Strong performance metrics within tested domain with clear coverage and redundancy results

**Generalizability:** Medium - Methodology appears sound but needs validation across multiple product categories and larger datasets

**LLM Agent Approach:** Medium - Three-agent architecture shows promise but specific design choices and their relative contributions need further exploration

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework across multiple diverse product categories (electronics, apparel, home goods) to assess domain transferability and identify category-specific limitations

2. Conduct error analysis comparing LLM-generated triples against human-annotated gold standards to quantify semantic accuracy beyond coverage metrics

3. Measure computational efficiency and API costs at scale, including latency benchmarks and resource requirements for processing millions of product descriptions
