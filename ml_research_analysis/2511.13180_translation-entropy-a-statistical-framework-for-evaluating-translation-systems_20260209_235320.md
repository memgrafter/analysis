# Translation Entropy: A Statistical Framework for Evaluating Translation Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.13180
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13180
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces translation entropy (TE) metric that reveals identical translations can be produced by sentences differing by only one selected token, enabling objective ranking of machine translation systems.

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a statistical framework for quantifying translation entropy (TE), a novel metric for objectively evaluating machine translation systems. The key finding is that identical translations can be produced by sentences differing by only one selected token. By analyzing the probabilities of such token replacements across an ensemble of sentences, the study derives an estimate of TE for a given translator. Results show that TE is enhanced along decoder blocks and reveals asymmetries in mutual translation entropy between language pairs (e.g., English-French vs. English-Hebrew). Extending the method to two-token replacements demonstrates a multiplicative effect on translation degeneracy. The framework enables quantitative ranking of translators (MarianMT, T5-Base, NLLB-200), with MarianMT showing superior efficiency despite fewer parameters. TE correlates with translation quality but captures different aspects than traditional metrics like BLEU and COMET. The findings establish TE as a measurable property and objective benchmark for artificial translators, though computational constraints and the unknown minimal entropy of languages limit its interpretation.

## Method Summary
The framework quantifies translation entropy by measuring how many source token substitutions preserve the translation output. For each pivot token in source sentences, the method generates translations after replacing the pivot with all vocabulary tokens, then computes entropy from the probability distribution of degenerate subgroups (identical translations). The process involves sampling 100 pivot tokens appearing 500-1,500 times in Opus100 training data, extracting 30 sentences per pivot, generating pivot translations, and systematically replacing the pivot token with all vocabulary tokens to count identical outputs. Entropy is calculated using the 24 smallest subgroup sizes, with thresholds applied to filter significant degeneracies. The method is applied to compare MarianMT, T5-Base, and NLLB-200 translators across English-French and English-Hebrew language pairs, with additional analysis of decoder block contributions.

## Key Results
- Translation entropy decreases from MarianMT (S=0.018 bits) to T5-Base (S=0.025 bits) to NLLB-200 (S=0.031 bits), revealing MarianMT's superior efficiency despite fewer parameters
- Entropy increases monotonically along decoder blocks, with first block contributing most significantly to degeneracy
- Two-token replacements show multiplicative degeneracy effects compared to single-token replacements
- Mutual translation entropy reveals asymmetries between language pairs (English→French < French→English; English→Hebrew < Hebrew→English)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The translation entropy framework works by exploiting the degeneracy in translation outputs - the phenomenon where multiple distinct source sentences map to identical translations. This degeneracy arises from the complex, non-injective mapping learned by neural translators between source and target languages. By systematically varying individual tokens in source sentences and measuring the probability of obtaining identical translations, the framework captures the degree of this degeneracy as an entropy measure. Lower entropy indicates more efficient, less redundant translation processes where small changes in input more consistently produce distinct outputs.

## Foundational Learning
- **Translation degeneracy**: The property where distinct source sentences map to identical translations. Why needed: This is the fundamental phenomenon that TE measures to evaluate translator efficiency. Quick check: Verify that replacing a pivot token can produce identical translations for multiple vocabulary substitutions.
- **Entropy calculation from degeneracy subgroups**: Using the 24 smallest subgroup sizes to estimate the probability distribution of degenerate translations. Why needed: Provides a robust statistical measure of translation redundancy. Quick check: Confirm that subgroup size counts follow expected probability distributions.
- **Vocabulary-based pivot substitution**: Systematically replacing a single token with all vocabulary tokens to probe translation behavior. Why needed: Enables comprehensive mapping of how input variations affect outputs. Quick check: Ensure all vocabulary tokens are tested and subgroup sizes are correctly recorded.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Source sentences -> Pivot token selection -> Vocabulary substitution -> Translation generation -> Degeneracy counting -> Entropy calculation -> Translator ranking
Critical path: The core measurement process where pivot tokens are systematically replaced and translations are generated to measure degeneracy. This path determines the computational bottleneck, as each pivot-token pair requires ~30K translation generations.
Design tradeoffs: The framework trades computational efficiency for comprehensive measurement - analyzing all vocabulary substitutions provides thorough coverage but requires significant resources. The choice of 24 smallest subgroups balances statistical robustness with practical feasibility.
Failure signatures: High subgroup sizes (>10K) indicate the translator may be ignoring pivot tokens, suggesting the pivot token is semantically redundant or the model has learned to omit it. Low degeneracy across all tokens suggests the translator is highly sensitive to input variations.
First experiments: 1) Verify basic functionality by testing a single pivot token across all vocabulary substitutions and confirming degeneracy detection. 2) Compare TE values for a simple translator vs. a more complex one to validate the ranking capability. 3) Test the threshold sensitivity by varying β_c values and observing stability of TE estimates.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The framework's computational cost limits analysis to single and two-token replacements, potentially missing higher-order degeneracy patterns
- Exact string matching may underestimate semantic degeneracy by counting lexically different but functionally equivalent translations separately
- The unknown "true" or minimal entropy of natural languages complicates interpretation of TE values
- Correlation with translation quality (r ≈ 0.6) suggests TE captures different aspects than traditional metrics, but the relationship is not fully characterized

## Confidence
High confidence: The core methodology for calculating translation entropy (token substitution, degeneracy counting, entropy computation) is clearly specified and reproducible. The ranking of translators by TE (MarianMT < T5-Base < NLLB-200) is consistent across multiple validation checks.

Medium confidence: The interpretation of TE as an objective quality metric is supported by correlation with BLEU/COMET but requires further validation. The decoder block analysis showing entropy increase is reproducible but the functional significance remains unclear.

Low confidence: Claims about minimal language entropy and the relationship between TE and "true" translation quality are speculative given current knowledge limitations.

## Next Checks
1. **Parameter sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary the number of subgroup sizes used (S_24 vs S_12 vs S_36) and threshold β_c to assess robustness of TE rankings across different settings.

2. **Semantic vs lexical degeneracy**: Implement fuzzy matching or embedding-based similarity to measure semantic equivalence of translations, comparing results with exact string matching to quantify the impact of lexical variation on TE estimates.

3. **Scaling behavior validation**: Test whether the multiplicative effect observed for two-token replacements holds for three-token replacements within computational constraints, and verify if this relationship scales consistently across different translator architectures.
