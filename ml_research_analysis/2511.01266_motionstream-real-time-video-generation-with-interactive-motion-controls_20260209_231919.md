- Primary result: First streaming motion-controlled video generation system at up to 29 FPS on single GPU

## Executive Summary
MotionStream introduces the first real-time streaming video generation system with interactive motion controls, achieving up to 29 FPS on a single GPU. The system addresses fundamental limitations of existing motion-conditioned video models by introducing a causal autoregressive architecture with attention sinks and KV cache rolling. Through self forcing-style distribution matching distillation, MotionStream distills a bidirectional teacher with joint text-motion guidance into a causal student, enabling stable infinite-length generation while maintaining state-of-the-art motion-following accuracy and visual quality.

## Method Summary
MotionStream combines a bidirectional teacher model (augmented with lightweight track heads and joint text-motion guidance) distilled into a causal student through Self Forcing-style Distribution Matching Distillation. The key innovations are attention sinks with rolling KV cache that preserve initial frame tokens as anchors during autoregressive generation, and extrapolation-aware training that simulates inference-time dynamics. The system uses chunk-wise generation with causal attention, enabling real-time interactive video creation for applications like motion transfer, camera control, and drag-based editing.

## Key Results
- Achieves real-time video generation at up to 29 FPS on single GPU
- State-of-the-art motion-following accuracy and visual quality
- Two orders of magnitude faster than prior methods
- Enables interactive applications like motion transfer and camera control

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Attention Sinks with Rolling KV Cache
The model maintains initial frame tokens permanently in KV cache while using a sliding attention window over recent chunks. This prevents quality drift during infinite-length streaming by anchoring generation to the initial image. The approach adapts attention sinking from StreamingLLM to video models, where initial tokens serve as "sink" tokens that stabilize long-context generation.

### Mechanism 2: Self Forcing-Style Distribution Matching Distillation with Joint Guidance Baking
The expensive multi-step bidirectional teacher with joint text-motion guidance is distilled into a few-step causal student. During distillation, the teacher's joint guidance computation is compressed into the student's weights through DMD objective, enabling real-time inference while preserving motion fidelity. The student learns to replicate the teacher's distribution with single NFE using self-rollout during training.

### Mechanism 3: Extrapolation-Aware Training via Cache Simulation
Training incorporates self-rollout with attention sinks and KV cache rolling to simulate inference-time extrapolations. This bridges the train-test distribution gap by ensuring the training distribution exactly matches the inference distribution, preventing quality degradation during long-horizon generation.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Attention Sinks (StreamingLLM paradigm)**
  - Why needed here: Essential for understanding how initial tokens stabilize streaming generation and debugging drift issues
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a model might attend more strongly to initial tokens than recent context, and how this affects long-horizon generation stability?

- Concept: **Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD)**
  - Why needed here: Core training objective requires understanding score functions and generator-critic adversarial dynamics
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the "fake score estimator" and why is it updated 5x more frequently than the generator?

- Concept: **Causal vs Bidirectional Attention in Diffusion**
  - Why needed here: Fundamental architectural shift determines available information at each generation step
  - Quick check question: Why can't a bidirectional video diffusion model be used for real-time streaming, even with small number of denoising steps?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Image + Text Prompt + Motion Tracks (50×50 grid) → Track Head → Diffusion Transformer (Wan DiT) → Causal VAE Decoder → Video frames

- Critical path:
  1. Track encoding: Sinusoidal PE + 4× temporal compression + 1×1×1 Conv3D (must complete within ~25ms)
  2. Autoregressive chunk generation: 3 denoising steps with causal attention over sink + window tokens
  3. VAE decoding: Tiny VAE reduces decoding from 1.67s to 0.12s for 81 frames

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Chunk size 3 balances quality against latency
  - Minimal sink/window (s1w1) surprisingly outperforms larger configurations
  - Joint guidance weights (wt=3.0, wm=1.5) balance trajectory accuracy and visual quality
  - Tiny VAE provides 1.75-2.3× speedup with marginal quality trade-off

- Failure signatures:
  - Drift over time without attention sink
  - Rigid 2D translation with pure motion guidance
  - Artifacts on rapid/impossible trajectories
  - Scene change failure due to fixed attention sink

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Attention sink ablation: Compare c3s0w1 vs c3s1w1 for quality over time
  2. Chunk size latency-quality tradeoff: Profile throughput for {1, 3, 5, 7} with fixed s1w1
  3. Guidance weight sensitivity: Sweep wt and wm on Sora subset to reproduce EPE vs LPIPS tradeoff curves

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can dynamic attention sinking strategies be designed to handle complete scene transitions while maintaining temporal stability? The current static anchoring prevents adaptation to new environments, requiring adaptive anchor refreshing for world modeling applications.

### Open Question 2
Can a distinct representation be developed to disambiguate between occluded tracks and unspecified tracks during interactive streaming? The current representation cannot distinguish between occluded and unspecified tracks, leading to potential artifacts.

### Open Question 3
Does the causal distillation pipeline maintain efficiency and structure preservation when scaled to significantly larger backbone models? The smaller Wan 2.1 often outperforms larger Wan 2.2 in preserving source structures, suggesting scaling challenges.

## Limitations
- Scene transition limitation: Fixed attention sink prevents adaptation to new environments
- Physical plausibility boundary: Artifacts on extremely rapid or physically implausible trajectories
- Computational constraints: Significant VRAM requirements for KV cache management

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Real-time performance claims (29 FPS), causal architecture design, and attention sink mechanism
- **Medium Confidence**: Motion fidelity improvements and effectiveness of joint text-motion guidance
- **Low Confidence**: Long-term generation stability beyond training horizon and generalization to highly dynamic scenarios

## Next Checks
1. **Attention Sink Robustness Test**: Generate videos with varying sink sizes (0, 1, 2, 3 chunks) and measure quality degradation over time to validate sink-1 configuration
2. **Extreme Motion Evaluation**: Create test cases with physically implausible trajectories and evaluate visual quality and motion accuracy to quantify model boundaries
3. **Scene Transition Capability**: Design experiments where motion tracks indicate complete scene changes mid-generation to test fixed attention sink limitations
