# Unlocking Speech Instruction Data Potential with Query Rewriting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.08603
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08603
- Reference count: 25
- Primary result: Query rewriting framework improves speech instruction dataset usability from 72% to 93%

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of constructing high-quality speech instruction datasets for training end-to-end Large Speech Language Models (LSLMs). The authors propose a query rewriting framework that leverages multiple LLMs for knowledge fusion, combined with multi-agent annotation and data quality validation. The approach focuses on rewriting text instructions to better match text-to-speech (TTS) model distributions while ensuring high semantic fidelity through multiple validation stages.

## Method Summary
The proposed method employs a multi-stage framework where multiple LLMs collaborate to rewrite text instructions, ensuring they are better suited for TTS model generation. The rewritten instructions undergo validation using multiple ASR and embedding models to assess semantic similarity and quality. The framework incorporates multi-agent annotation strategies to handle complex rewriting tasks that require context-aware understanding and knowledge integration. This systematic approach addresses the gap between natural language instructions and TTS-compatible content.

## Key Results
- Data usability increased from 72% to 93% through the proposed query rewriting framework
- Semantic similarity between synthesized speech and original text improved by 5%
- Framework shows particular advantages in handling complex rewriting tasks requiring context-aware understanding

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework succeeds by addressing the fundamental mismatch between natural language instructions and TTS model capabilities. Multiple LLMs provide diverse perspectives for instruction rewriting, while multi-agent validation ensures quality through redundancy. The knowledge fusion approach captures nuances that single models might miss, and the multi-stage validation pipeline catches errors early in the process.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Speech Instruction Dataset Construction** - Why needed: Traditional methods produce low-quality data unsuitable for LSLMs. Quick check: Compare TTS output quality with and without instruction rewriting.
2. **Multi-LLM Knowledge Fusion** - Why needed: Single models lack the diversity needed for complex instruction understanding. Quick check: Measure diversity metrics across LLM outputs.
3. **Semantic Similarity Metrics** - Why needed: Quality assessment requires quantitative measures beyond human evaluation. Quick check: Validate metric correlation with human judgment scores.
4. **Text-to-Speech Model Distributions** - Why needed: Instructions must match TTS capabilities for successful synthesis. Quick check: Analyze TTS success rates across different instruction types.
5. **Multi-Agent Annotation Systems** - Why needed: Complex tasks require collaborative validation approaches. Quick check: Compare error rates between single and multi-agent annotation.
6. **Data Quality Validation Pipelines** - Why needed: Ensures consistency and reliability in large-scale dataset construction. Quick check: Measure validation pipeline precision and recall.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Instruction Collection -> Multi-LLM Rewriting -> TTS Generation -> ASR Validation -> Embedding Analysis -> Quality Assessment

Critical path: The rewriting stage is critical as poor instructions will propagate errors through the entire pipeline, making subsequent validation stages ineffective.

Design tradeoffs: Multiple LLM usage increases computational overhead but improves quality; multi-agent validation adds complexity but catches errors single systems miss.

Failure signatures: Low semantic similarity scores indicate rewriting issues; high TTS generation failure rates suggest instruction format problems; inconsistent ASR outputs reveal quality control failures.

First experiments: 1) Test single LLM vs. multi-LLM rewriting performance on simple instructions, 2) Validate semantic similarity improvements on benchmark datasets, 3) Measure TTS success rates with rewritten vs. original instructions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions, but the limited evaluation on synthetic benchmarks rather than real-world deployment scenarios suggests this as an implicit area for further investigation.

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily relies on synthetic benchmarks rather than real-world deployment scenarios
- Semantic similarity improvements of 5% represent modest gains that may have limited practical impact
- Computational overhead from multiple LLM, ASR, and embedding model evaluations could pose scalability challenges

## Confidence
- Data usability improvement (72% to 93%): High confidence
- Semantic similarity enhancement: Medium confidence
- Multi-LLM knowledge fusion effectiveness: Medium confidence
- Multi-agent annotation benefits: Low confidence

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a large-scale user study with human annotators to evaluate whether the improved semantic similarity translates to better instruction comprehension and execution in real applications
2. Test the framework's performance on domain-specific speech datasets (e.g., medical, legal, technical) to assess generalization beyond general-purpose instructions
3. Measure the end-to-end training performance of LSLMs using the rewritten datasets to determine if data quality improvements lead to measurable gains in downstream task performance, particularly for complex reasoning and generation tasks
