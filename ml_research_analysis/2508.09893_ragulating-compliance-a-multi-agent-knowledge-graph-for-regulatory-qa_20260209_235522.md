# RAGulating Compliance: A Multi-Agent Knowledge Graph for Regulatory QA

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.09893
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09893
- Reference count: 4
- One-line primary result: Triplet-level retrieval improves factual correctness to 4.73/5 and section overlap accuracy to 28.88% at high similarity thresholds in regulatory compliance QA.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of regulatory compliance question answering, where large language models often struggle with precision and verifiability. The authors propose a multi-agent framework that combines a knowledge graph of regulatory triplets with retrieval-augmented generation. By extracting subject-predicate-object facts from regulatory documents and embedding them alongside textual evidence, the system achieves significantly higher factual accuracy and navigational efficiency than conventional RAG methods.

## Method Summary
The approach builds an ontology-free knowledge graph by extracting SPO triplets from regulatory documents, embedding them (concatenating SPO elements) and storing in a unified vector database with provenance metadata. A multi-agent pipeline ingests documents, extracts and normalizes triplets, and retrieves them using k-NN search for QA. The system uses both structured triplets and associated source text sections to ground LLM-generated answers, improving factual correctness and enabling traceability.

## Key Results
- Factual correctness score of 4.73 on a 5-point scale
- Section overlap accuracy of 28.88% at stricter similarity thresholds (θ=0.75)
- Improved navigation metrics: faster shortest path (1.3300) and higher interconnectedness (1.6080 average degree)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Triplet-level semantic retrieval may improve alignment between queries and factual regulatory content compared to text-only retrieval. Subject-predicate-object (SPO) triplets capture the "who-did-what-to-whom" core of regulatory statements. Embedding these triplets directly creates denser semantic representations that match query intent more precisely than longer text passages, reducing noise in retrieval. Core assumption: The embedding function preserves factual relationships such that similarity meaningfully correlates with answer relevance. Evidence: Abstract emphasizes "triplet-level retrieval for question answering, ensuring high semantic alignment between user queries and the factual 'who-did-what-to-whom' core captured by the graph." Break condition: If triplet extraction produces noisy or incomplete extractions, retrieval quality degrades.

### Mechanism 2
Linking triplets to source text sections enables traceability and may reduce hallucinations by grounding LLM outputs. Each triplet stores provenance metadata pointing to originating text sections. At generation time, the LLM receives both structured triplets and evidential text, providing both precision (from triplets) and context (from source text). Core assumption: LLMs generate more accurate answers when prompted with both structured facts and supporting context than with either alone. Evidence: Abstract states "ensuring factual correctness with embedded triplets, enabling traceability through a unified vector database." Break condition: If provenance links are broken or text sections are partitioned incorrectly, the LLM receives misleading or incomplete context.

### Mechanism 3
Ontology-free KG construction enables faster adaptation to evolving regulatory documents, at the cost of potential vocabulary fragmentation. Rather than enforcing a predefined schema, the system extracts triplets bottom-up and applies post-hoc normalization. This allows rapid ingestion of heterogeneous regulatory formats without upfront ontology engineering. Core assumption: Regulatory documents share enough implicit structure that extracted triplets will converge on meaningful entities without explicit schema constraints. Evidence: Section 3 describes "schema-light approach defers rigid schemas in favor of flexible bottom-up extraction...making it especially valuable in regulatory settings where rules evolve rapidly." Break condition: If regulatory domains diverge significantly in terminology without effective normalization, entity resolution fails and retrieval fragments.

## Foundational Learning

- **Subject-Predicate-Object (SPO) Triplets**
  - Why needed here: The entire architecture depends on decomposing regulatory text into atomic relational facts. Understanding what makes a good triplet (complete, unambiguous, properly scoped) is prerequisite to evaluating extraction quality.
  - Quick check question: Given the sentence "The FDA requires submission within 15 days," what are the subject, predicate, and object?

- **Vector Similarity Search (k-NN retrieval)**
  - Why needed here: Triplet and query embeddings are compared via cosine similarity. Understanding embedding space geometry is necessary to debug retrieval failures.
  - Quick check question: Why might two semantically similar regulatory statements have low cosine similarity if embedded separately?

- **Ontology-free vs. Schema-first Knowledge Engineering**
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly rejects predefined ontologies. Understanding the tradeoff (flexibility vs. consistency) is essential for deciding when this approach fits a new domain.
  - Quick check question: What entity resolution problems might arise if two sections use "Agency" and "FDA" interchangeably without normalization?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Document Ingestion Agent -> Extraction Agent -> Normalization/Cleaning Agent -> Triplet Store/Indexing Agent -> Retrieval Agent -> Story-Building Agent -> Generation Agent

- **Critical path**: Ingestion → Extraction → Normalization → Embedding/Storage. If extraction quality is poor, all downstream retrieval and generation degrade. Start validation here.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Ontology-free = faster onboarding but requires robust normalization; monitor vocabulary fragmentation
  - Unified vector DB for triplets + text = simpler retrieval but larger index; consider sharding for scale
  - Transformer-based embeddings (BERT-family) capture semantics but may miss domain jargon; fine-tuning on eCFR data addresses this

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Low section overlap scores at high thresholds → triplet extraction missing key relationships or embedding model misaligned
  - High average shortest path in navigation metrics → triplet graph too sparse; extraction may be filtering valid relationships
  - Inconsistent entity references across triplets → normalization agent not catching synonyms

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Triplet extraction validation**: Sample 50 sections, manually verify extracted SPO triplets against ground truth. Measure precision/recall of extraction pipeline Φ.
  2. **Retrieval ablation**: Compare triplet-only vs. text-only vs. hybrid retrieval on a held-out query set. Measure section overlap O(R, G) at threshold θ=0.75.
  3. **Normalization stress test**: Inject synonym variants (e.g., "FDA", "Agency", "Food and Drug Administration") into test corpus. Measure whether normalization agent produces unified entity references.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can the current framework support multi-step logical reasoning and evidence chaining for complex regulatory queries? Basis: Section 8.2 states, "more complex regulatory questions demand deeper logical reasoning or chaining of evidence," and suggests integration with advanced reasoning LLMs as a future step. Why unresolved: The current evaluation focuses on factual correctness and section overlap for direct retrieval, rather than multi-hop inference or synthesis across distinct regulatory clauses. What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation results on a multi-hop regulatory QA dataset, measuring the system's ability to synthesize answers from non-adjacent graph nodes.

### Open Question 2
What is the most efficient mechanism for performing incremental updates to the Knowledge Graph when regulatory documents change? Basis: Section 8.2 notes the aim to "develop incremental update mechanisms that re-ingest altered documents and regenerate only those triples affected by the changes." Why unresolved: The current system describes a pipeline for construction and maintenance, but does not detail or evaluate a differential update strategy for dynamic corpora. What evidence would resolve it: A comparison of resource latency and graph consistency between full corpus re-ingestion and a targeted differential update pipeline.

### Open Question 3
To what extent does the ontology-free approach induce vocabulary fragmentation, and can current normalization agents effectively mitigate it? Basis: Section 8.1 identifies "vocabulary fragmentation" as a specific challenge of the ontology-free approach, noting that extraction quality depends on agents resolving synonyms. Why unresolved: While the results show high accuracy, the paper does not quantify the noise introduced by the lack of schema or the error rate of the normalization agent in resolving ambiguous entities. What evidence would resolve it: An ablation study measuring entity redundancy and retrieval failures specifically attributed to schema-less extraction before and after the cleaning stage.

## Limitations
- Exact embedding model architecture, training regimen, and hyperparameters are unspecified, which is critical for reproducing retrieval performance
- LLM configurations for extraction, normalization, and generation are not provided, potentially altering results significantly
- Multi-agent orchestration implementation details are conceptual rather than technical, making faithful reproduction challenging

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core hypothesis that triplet-level semantic retrieval improves factual alignment in regulatory QA is well-supported by the evaluation results showing improved accuracy (4.73/5) and navigation metrics.

- **Medium confidence**: The ontology-free approach's benefits for rapid adaptation to evolving regulations are conceptually sound, but the tradeoff with vocabulary fragmentation is only partially addressed.

- **Low confidence**: The exact quantitative impact of using both structured triplets and textual evidence versus either alone is not isolated in ablation studies.

## Next Checks
1. **Extraction pipeline validation**: Sample 100 sections from the test corpus, manually verify extracted SPO triplets against ground truth, and measure precision, recall, and F1 score of the extraction pipeline Φ.

2. **Ablation study of retrieval modalities**: Compare retrieval and answer quality for three conditions: triplet-only retrieval, text-only retrieval, and hybrid (triplet + text) retrieval on the same query set. Measure section overlap O(R, G) at θ=0.75 and answer accuracy.

3. **Normalization robustness test**: Create a synthetic test corpus with controlled synonym variants (e.g., "FDA", "Food and Drug Administration", "Agency") and measure whether the normalization agent successfully unifies these into single entities. Track vocabulary fragmentation metrics.
