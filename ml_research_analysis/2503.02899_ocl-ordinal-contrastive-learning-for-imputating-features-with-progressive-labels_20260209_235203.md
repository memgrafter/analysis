# OCL: Ordinal Contrastive Learning for Imputating Features with Progressive Labels

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.02899
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02899
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: Ordinal Contrastive Learning improves AD classification accuracy from 67.3% to 82.9%

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Ordinal Contrastive Learning (OCL) for imputing missing neuroimaging features in Alzheimer's disease research. The authors address the challenge of incomplete multi-modal imaging data by proposing a framework that maps data into a modality-agnostic embedding space aligned with disease progression. Their method uses domain adversarial training to remove modality-specific information, maximizes coherence between modalities from the same subject, and introduces OCL to align samples based on disease severity. Experiments on the ADNI dataset show their approach improves statistical sensitivity in group comparisons, detecting more significant regions of interest. The method also enhances downstream classification performance, achieving 82.9% accuracy compared to 67.3% without imputation, outperforming multiple baseline methods including MICE, MissForest, and GAIN.

## Method Summary
The proposed Ordinal Contrastive Learning framework addresses missing neuroimaging data through a three-component approach. First, domain adversarial training is applied to remove modality-specific information and create modality-agnostic embeddings. Second, coherence maximization ensures that multiple modalities from the same subject are mapped to similar locations in the embedding space. Third, the ordinal contrastive learning component aligns samples based on disease severity levels, leveraging the ordinal nature of Alzheimer's progression. The framework is trained to predict missing features while simultaneously optimizing these three objectives, creating embeddings that are both informative for disease progression and robust to modality differences.

## Key Results
- Classification accuracy improved from 67.3% to 82.9% using OCL-based imputation
- Statistical sensitivity increased, detecting more significant regions of interest in group comparisons
- Outperformed multiple baseline imputation methods including MICE, MissForest, and GAIN
- Demonstrated effectiveness specifically for multi-modal neuroimaging data in Alzheimer's disease research

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the ordinal nature of Alzheimer's disease progression to guide the imputation process. By aligning samples based on disease severity in a modality-agnostic embedding space, the framework can infer missing values from the patterns observed in other modalities for subjects at similar disease stages. The domain adversarial component ensures that the imputation doesn't rely on modality-specific artifacts, while coherence maximization leverages the redundant information across modalities from the same subject. This combination allows the model to make more informed predictions about missing values by considering both the disease progression trajectory and the complementary information across imaging modalities.

## Foundational Learning

**Ordinal Regression**
- Why needed: Alzheimer's disease has a natural progression from mild to severe stages
- Quick check: Can the model correctly order samples by disease severity without regression

**Domain Adversarial Training**
- Why needed: Remove modality-specific biases to create modality-agnostic embeddings
- Quick check: Do embeddings from different modalities cluster together for the same subject

**Contrastive Learning**
- Why needed: Learn representations by comparing similar and dissimilar samples
- Quick check: Are embeddings closer for samples with similar disease severity

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Raw Data -> Feature Extractor -> Embedding Space -> Imputation Layer -> Output

Critical Path: Feature extraction → Domain adversarial training → Coherence maximization → Ordinal contrastive learning → Imputation prediction

Design Tradeoffs: Modality-agnostic embeddings vs. preserving modality-specific diagnostic information

Failure Signatures: Imputations that violate known disease progression patterns or show modality-specific biases

First Experiments:
1. Ablation study: Remove ordinal contrastive learning to measure its specific contribution
2. Modality coherence test: Verify that embeddings from different modalities for the same subject are similar
3. Domain adversarial effectiveness: Test whether embeddings are truly modality-agnostic

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Validation limited to single ADNI dataset, raising generalizability concerns
- Comparison with baseline methods uses a limited set of alternatives
- Effectiveness of domain adversarial training in achieving true modality-agnostic embeddings not independently verified

## Confidence

High Confidence:
- Core methodology and experimental results on ADNI dataset are sound
- Improvements in statistical sensitivity and classification accuracy are clearly demonstrated

Medium Confidence:
- Generalizability to other datasets and disease contexts supported by theoretical framework but lacks empirical validation across multiple cohorts

Low Confidence:
- Absolute performance numbers impressive but need independent replication due to potential influence of preprocessing and feature selection procedures

## Next Checks

1. Replicate experiments on independent Alzheimer's disease cohorts (e.g., AIBL, OASIS) to assess generalizability across different data collection protocols and patient populations

2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of the Ordinal Contrastive Learning component versus domain adversarial training and coherence maximization objectives

3. Test imputation quality under various missingness mechanisms (MCAR, MAR, MNAR) and missingness rates to evaluate real-world applicability beyond controlled experimental conditions
