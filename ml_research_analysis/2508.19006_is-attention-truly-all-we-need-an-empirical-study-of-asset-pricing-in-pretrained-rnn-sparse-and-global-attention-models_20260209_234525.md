# Is attention truly all we need? An empirical study of asset pricing in pretrained RNN sparse and global attention models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.19006
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19006
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: RNN attention models achieve annualized Sortino ratios of 2.0 (global self-attention) and 1.80 (sliding window sparse attention) during COVID-19 period for 420 large-cap US stocks

## Executive Summary
This study investigates the effectiveness of attention mechanisms in pretrained RNN models for empirical asset pricing using 420 large-cap US stocks. The research addresses limitations of traditional ML models by incorporating various attention mechanisms (additive, Luong's three, global self-attention, sliding window sparse attention) while enforcing causal masks to prevent future data leakage. The study evaluates model performance across three distinct market periods (pre-COVID-19, COVID-19, post-COVID-19) to test stability under extreme market conditions.

The results demonstrate that RNN global self-attention and RNN sliding window sparse attention models perform strongly in deriving absolute returns and hedging downside risks, particularly during the COVID-19 market turmoil. The sliding window sparse attention model shows more stable performance across different market capitalizations compared to the global self-attention model. An MLP autoencoder is used for pretraining and dimensionality reduction of input features.

## Method Summary
The study implements mainstream attention mechanisms in pretrained RNN models for asset pricing, including additive, Luong's three variants, global self-attention, and sliding window sparse attention. All models incorporate causal masks to prevent future information leakage. An MLP autoencoder is used to pretrain the model and reduce input dimensionality. The evaluation framework tests performance across three distinct periods (pre-COVID-19, COVID-19, post-COVID-19) using 420 large-cap US stocks to assess model stability under extreme market conditions. Models are evaluated on their ability to derive absolute returns and hedge downside risks.

## Key Results
- RNN global self-attention model achieves annualized Sortino ratio of 2.0 during COVID-19 period
- RNN sliding window sparse attention model achieves annualized Sortino ratio of 1.80 during COVID-19 period
- Sliding window sparse attention model demonstrates more stable performance across market capitalizations compared to global self-attention model

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of RNN attention models in asset pricing stems from their ability to capture complex temporal dependencies in financial time series while maintaining computational efficiency. The attention mechanisms allow the models to focus on relevant historical information when making predictions, while the causal masking ensures no future information leakage. The pretraining phase with MLP autoencoder helps reduce dimensionality and extract meaningful features from raw financial data, improving model generalization. The sliding window sparse attention provides computational advantages while maintaining predictive accuracy across different market conditions.

## Foundational Learning

**Attention Mechanisms**: Why needed - to focus on relevant historical information for predictions. Quick check - verify that attention weights sum to 1 and align with expected importance.

**Causal Masking**: Why needed - prevents future information leakage in time series forecasting. Quick check - confirm that attention weights only use past and present information.

**MLP Autoencoder**: Why needed - reduces dimensionality and extracts meaningful features from raw financial data. Quick check - validate reconstruction error and feature relevance.

**Sortino Ratio**: Why needed - measures risk-adjusted returns focusing on downside risk. Quick check - ensure target return threshold is appropriate for the asset class.

**RNN Pretraining**: Why needed - establishes initial weights for better convergence and generalization. Quick check - verify pretraining loss decreases and features capture market patterns.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Input Features -> MLP Autoencoder -> RNN Attention Layer -> Output Layer

Critical Path: The pretraining phase through MLP autoencoder is essential as it establishes the feature space for the RNN attention mechanisms. The causal masking in attention layers is critical to prevent information leakage.

Design Tradeoffs: Global self-attention provides comprehensive context but is computationally expensive. Sliding window sparse attention offers computational efficiency at the cost of some contextual information. The choice depends on the balance between performance needs and computational resources.

Failure Signatures: Poor performance in extreme market conditions suggests inadequate attention mechanism adaptation. Consistent underperformance across all periods indicates issues with pretraining or feature extraction. Model instability across different market caps suggests overfitting to specific market segments.

First Experiments:
1. Test attention weight distributions to verify proper focus on relevant historical information
2. Validate causal masking by checking attention weights only use past/present data
3. Compare performance across different window sizes for sparse attention to find optimal balance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations

The study's results are based on a relatively narrow sample of 420 large-cap US stocks, which may limit generalizability to other market segments. The three-period evaluation framework provides temporal robustness testing but may not fully capture longer-term model stability across diverse market conditions. The use of pretrained models on specific stocks could lead to overfitting to the large-cap segment.

## Confidence

High confidence in experimental methodology and implementation of attention mechanisms, including proper causal masking and dimensional reduction through MLP autoencoders.
Medium confidence in comparative performance results due to limited scope of stocks and specific market conditions tested.
Low confidence in model's ability to generalize to different asset classes, market caps, or international markets based on current study design.

## Next Checks

1. Expand testing to include small and mid-cap stocks to validate model's stability across different market capitalizations, particularly focusing on the claimed advantage of the sliding window sparse attention model.

2. Implement cross-validation across multiple time periods beyond the COVID-19 framework to assess long-term model stability and performance consistency.

3. Test the model on different asset classes (bonds, commodities) and international markets to evaluate the generalizability of attention mechanisms beyond US large-cap stocks.
