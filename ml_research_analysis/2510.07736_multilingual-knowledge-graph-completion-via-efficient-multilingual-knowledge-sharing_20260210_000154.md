# Multilingual Knowledge Graph Completion via Efficient Multilingual Knowledge Sharing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.07736
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07736
- Reference count: 35
- Primary result: 5.47% improvement in Hits@1 on 5-language knowledge graph completion

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a multilingual knowledge graph completion (MKGC) framework that leverages large language models' multilingual capabilities. The method uses Knowledge-level Grouped Mixture of Experts (KL-GMoE) to efficiently model shared knowledge across languages and Iterative Entity Reranking (IER) to improve entity ranking. Experiments on a 5-language dataset show significant improvements over state-of-the-art MKGC methods: 5.47%, 3.27%, and 1.01% gains in Hits@1, Hits@3, and Hits@10 metrics respectively. The framework demonstrates robustness to language imbalance and strong performance on unseen languages.

## Method Summary
The framework uses Llama-2-7B as a base model with KL-GMoE applied to FFN layers, combining frozen parameters with LoRA-based experts. It generates candidate entities using KGE models (TransE/RotatE), constructs prompts with query context and candidates, and employs IER with 10 iterations to iteratively refine entity rankings. The KL-GMoE architecture routes entire queries to specific expert pairs rather than splitting them at the token level, while IER reformulates training from single-shot generation to iterative selection from candidate lists.

## Key Results
- Achieves 5.47% improvement in Hits@1 metric
- Shows 3.27% improvement in Hits@3 metric
- Demonstrates 1.01% improvement in Hits@10 metric
- Exhibits strong zero-shot performance on unseen languages
- Maintains robustness to language imbalance in training data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Knowledge-level Grouped MoE
The KL-GMoE architecture replaces standard FFN layers with knowledge-level routing that processes complete queries atomically rather than splitting them across token-level experts. This mitigates "knowledge fragmentation" by allowing distinct expert pairs to capture cross-lingual nuances while preserving the integrity of each query's context.

### Mechanism 2: Iterative Entity Reranking
IER reformulates the training objective from single-shot generation to iterative selection from candidate lists. Instead of generating the correct entity immediately, the model learns to select the best entity from a list, remove it, and repeat for multiple rounds, forcing the model to refine rankings of all candidates rather than just identifying the top one.

### Mechanism 3: Cross-lingual Parameter Sharing
Shared LoRA-based parameters within MoE groups enable zero-shot generalization to unseen languages by transferring relational logic independent of specific language tokens. The framework leverages the base LLM's pre-existing multilingual alignment to map distinct languages to shared expert parameters.

## Foundational Learning

- **Mixture of Experts (MoE) & Sparse Routing**: Understanding how tokens are routed to specific expert weights is crucial for diagnosing knowledge fragmentation vs. overload. Quick check: How does KL-GMoE's routing differ from standard token-level routing?

- **Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE)**: The framework relies on KGE models to generate candidate lists before LLM processing. Quick check: Why use TransE/RotatE for candidates instead of direct LLM generation?

- **Cross-Lingual Alignment in LLMs**: Understanding how multilingual LLMs share knowledge internally is essential for interpreting zero-shot performance on unseen languages. Quick check: What property allows English-trained experts to assist with Italian queries?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: KGE Candidate Generator -> Input Constructor -> KL-GMoE LLM (Router + Experts) -> IER Loop
- **Critical path**: Knowledge-level Expert Route (Eq. 5-8) determines which LoRA expert activates; incorrect implementation leads to knowledge fragmentation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Candidate quality vs. bias, iterations vs. latency, number of experts vs. parameter efficiency
- **Failure signatures**: Knowledge fragmentation (degrading mixed-language performance), language collapse (hallucination), top-1 bias (parroting KGE ranking)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Routing visualization to verify relation-based clustering, 2) IER ablation with N_t=1 vs N_t=10, 3) Unseen language test (EN/FR → IT)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question 1**: Can a stable fine-tuning instruction set be constructed to perform MKGC without relying on traditional KGE models for candidate retrieval?
- **Question 2**: How can the framework be extended to integrate non-textual information for multimodal knowledge graph completion?
- **Question 3**: How can entity selection operate over the entire knowledge graph rather than a restricted candidate set given LLM token length limitations?

## Limitations

- Framework critically depends on KGE candidate quality, creating a "garbage in, garbage out" scenario
- Zero-shot transfer is limited by base LLM's pre-training distribution, particularly for low-resource languages
- IER introduces significant computational overhead with 10 separate forward passes per prediction

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: 5.47%, 3.27%, and 1.01% improvements on 5-language dataset are well-supported by experimental results
- **Medium Confidence**: Zero-shot generalization claims are supported but may not generalize to truly low-resource languages
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about knowledge fragmentation mitigation lack direct head-to-head ablation studies

## Next Checks

1. **KGE Candidate Quality Analysis**: Systematically analyze how often correct entities appear in top-30 candidates across language pairs to quantify pipeline bottlenecks

2. **Cross-Lingual Transfer Stress Test**: Evaluate on truly low-resource languages (Swahili, Basque) to reveal limits of cross-lingual transfer mechanism

3. **Dynamic Iteration Scheduling**: Implement adaptive IER that stops when ranking stabilizes to quantify marginal returns and reduce computational overhead
