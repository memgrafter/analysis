# If You Want Coherence, Orchestrate a Team of Rivals: Multi-Agent Models of Organizational Intelligence

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2601.14351
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14351
- Reference count: 17
- 92.1% success rate in production financial analysis sessions, reducing error rates from 75% to 7.9%

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an AI Office architecture that applies organizational principles to multi-agent LLM systems to improve reliability. The system implements role-based specialization, hierarchical veto authority, and pre-declared acceptance criteria across specialized agents including planners, executors, critics, and experts. Organized into teams with distinct roles and coordinated through a remote code executor, the architecture achieves significant reliability gains in production financial analysis while trading computational overhead for enhanced dependability.

## Method Summary
The AI Office architecture introduces organizational principles to multi-agent LLM systems by creating specialized agents with distinct roles: planners, executors, critics, and experts. These agents are organized into teams with clear hierarchies and coordinated through a remote code executor that maintains separation between reasoning and data transformation. The system implements hierarchical veto authority and pre-declared acceptance criteria to ensure coherent outputs. The architecture was evaluated on 522 production financial analysis sessions, demonstrating substantial improvements in reliability through cascaded critique layers.

## Key Results
- 92.1% success rate in production financial analysis sessions
- Error rate reduction from 75% to 7.9% through cascaded critique layers
- 38.6% computational overhead as trade-off for reliability gains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The architecture leverages organizational intelligence principles by distributing cognitive load across specialized agents with
