# Supporting Construction Worker Well-Being with a Multi-Agent Conversational AI System

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.07997
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07997
- Reference count: 0
- Multi-agent AI system significantly improves usability, psychological well-being, and trust for construction workers

## Executive Summary
This study develops a conversational multi-agent AI system using large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to address mental health and safety challenges in the construction industry. The system features specialized agents (OSH Specialist, HR Advisor, and Worker Peer) that provide tailored support for safety, workplace policies, and emotional well-being. A user study with 12 participants compared the system against a single-agent baseline across three industry-specific scenarios. Results show the multi-agent system significantly outperformed the baseline with 18% higher usability scores (Mean = 84.58 vs 71.88), 40% higher self-determination scores, and 60% improvements in both social presence and trust.

## Method Summary
The study employed a user study methodology with 12 participants comparing a multi-agent conversational AI system against a single-agent baseline. Participants engaged with three industry-specific scenarios: stress management and mental health support, workplace conflict resolution, and safety hazard reporting. The system architecture utilized specialized agents for Occupational Safety and Health (OSH), Human Resources (HR), and worker peer support, with an orchestrator coordinating responses. The study measured usability through the System Usability Scale (SUS), self-determination theory constructs, social presence, and trust metrics. All participants completed pre- and post-experiment questionnaires, with session recordings and transcripts analyzed to evaluate user engagement and response quality.

## Key Results
- Multi-agent system achieved 18% higher usability scores (Mean = 84.58 vs 71.88) compared to single-agent baseline
- Self-determination scores improved by 40% in the multi-agent system
- Social presence and trust metrics improved by 60% in the multi-agent system

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The multi-agent system demonstrates effectiveness through specialized domain expertise, contextual adaptation, and collaborative response generation. Each agent maintains focused expertise in their domain (safety, HR, peer support) while the orchestrator ensures coherent, comprehensive responses. The system leverages RAG to ground responses in current industry standards and organizational policies, providing practical, actionable guidance rather than generic advice.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Specialized Agent Architecture**: Why needed - Construction industry requires domain-specific knowledge across safety, HR, and peer support. Quick check - Verify each agent maintains focused expertise without overlap or gaps.
2. **Orchestration Layer**: Why needed - Coordinates between specialized agents to provide coherent, comprehensive responses. Quick check - Ensure orchestrator properly sequences and integrates responses from multiple agents.
3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Why needed - Grounds responses in current industry standards and organizational policies. Quick check - Validate RAG system accurately retrieves and integrates relevant documentation.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: User Input -> Orchestrator -> [OSH Agent, HR Agent, Peer Agent] -> RAG System -> Response Synthesis -> User Output

**Critical Path**: User Query → Orchestrator → Agent Selection → RAG Retrieval → Response Generation → Synthesis → Output

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Multi-agent specialization vs. system complexity
- RAG integration vs. response latency
- Privacy preservation vs. personalized support

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Agent overlap causing contradictory advice
- RAG retrieval failures leading to outdated information
- Orchestrator coordination failures resulting in fragmented responses

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test individual agent performance on domain-specific queries
2. Validate RAG system accuracy with construction safety documentation
3. Evaluate orchestrator's ability to handle multi-domain queries

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Small sample size (n=12) limits generalizability to broader construction workforce
- Single-session evaluation cannot establish long-term effectiveness or sustained behavior change
- Controlled scenario-based approach may not fully capture real-world complexity

## Confidence
- Usability improvements (18% higher scores): Medium confidence
- Psychological benefits (40% higher self-determination scores): Medium confidence
- Social presence and trust improvements (60%): Low confidence due to small sample size

## Next Checks
1. Conduct longitudinal field study with actual construction workers over several months to assess sustained impact on mental health outcomes and safety behaviors
2. Perform rigorous testing of system's accuracy and reliability with construction-specific safety regulations and policies across different jurisdictions
3. Evaluate system performance under various stress conditions and emergency scenarios to ensure safety-critical reliability
