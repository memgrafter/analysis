# Sloth: scaling laws for LLM skills to predict multi-benchmark performance across families
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.06540
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06540
- Reference count: 40
- Predicts LLM performance across benchmarks using low-dimensional latent skills

## Executive Summary
Sloth introduces a novel approach to predicting large language model performance across multiple benchmarks and model families by modeling performance as driven by low-dimensional latent skills. The method leverages correlations between benchmarks to improve prediction accuracy while requiring fewer parameters than traditional scaling laws. It was evaluated on 12 prominent LLM benchmarks using data from 30+ model families, showing competitive or superior performance compared to existing scaling laws.

## Method Summary
Sloth models benchmark performance as driven by low-dimensional latent skills (e.g., reasoning, knowledge, instruction following) that scale with computational resources like model size and training tokens. The approach learns these latent skills from correlations across multiple benchmarks, enabling improved prediction accuracy with fewer parameters than traditional scaling laws. The method can predict test-time scaling behavior through repeated sampling and provides interpretable insights into how different skills scale with compute resources.

## Key Results
- Achieves competitive or superior prediction accuracy compared to existing scaling laws
- Shows particular strength in predicting performance for larger models and complex downstream tasks
- Enables interpretable insights into how different skills scale with compute resources

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Sloth works by capturing the shared underlying skills that drive performance across multiple benchmarks, rather than modeling each benchmark independently. By learning low-dimensional latent representations of these skills, the method can generalize better across benchmarks and model families. The correlations between benchmarks provide additional information that helps constrain predictions, leading to more accurate scaling behavior estimates with fewer parameters than traditional approaches that model each benchmark separately.

## Foundational Learning
- **Latent skill representation**: Models performance as driven by underlying skills rather than direct benchmark relationships
  - Why needed: Captures shared capabilities across benchmarks
  - Quick check: Verify dimensionality reduction preserves performance correlations
- **Multi-benchmark correlation learning**: Uses relationships between benchmarks to improve predictions
  - Why needed: Additional constraints improve generalization
  - Quick check: Compare performance with and without cross-benchmark information
- **Scaling law parameterization**: Models how skills scale with computational resources
  - Why needed: Enables extrapolation to larger models
  - Quick check: Validate extrapolation accuracy on known larger models
- **Low-dimensional modeling**: Reduces parameter count while maintaining accuracy
  - Why needed: Prevents overfitting with limited data
  - Quick check: Monitor parameter efficiency vs prediction accuracy
- **Test-time scaling prediction**: Estimates performance under repeated sampling
  - Why needed: Captures non-parametric scaling behaviors
  - Quick check: Compare predictions with actual test-time scaling results
- **Cross-family generalization**: Transfers knowledge across different model architectures
  - Why needed: Enables predictions for new model families
  - Quick check: Validate performance on held-out model families

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map:** Data preprocessing -> Latent skill learning -> Scaling law fitting -> Cross-benchmark correlation modeling -> Performance prediction

**Critical path:** The core innovation lies in the latent skill learning component, which transforms raw benchmark performance data into a low-dimensional representation that captures shared capabilities across benchmarks. This component must be trained first before scaling laws can be fit to individual skills.

**Design tradeoffs:** The method trades computational complexity during training (for learning correlations) against improved generalization and reduced parameters. The choice of latent skill dimensionality involves balancing expressiveness against overfitting risk.

**Failure signatures:** Poor performance on truly novel tasks that don't correlate with existing benchmarks, failure to generalize to significantly different model architectures, and breakdown of correlation assumptions as models approach new capability thresholds.

**First experiments:**
1. Train on 2-3 benchmark suites with known scaling relationships to validate basic functionality
2. Compare prediction accuracy with and without cross-benchmark correlations on held-out data
3. Test generalization to a new model family not seen during training

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalization to future model families and novel architectures remains uncertain
- Reliance on stable benchmark correlations may break down at new capability thresholds
- Limited validation on truly novel downstream tasks outside evaluated benchmarks
- Uncertainty about performance on non-transformer architectures

## Confidence
- High: Competitive performance against existing scaling laws on evaluated benchmarks
- Medium: Ability to predict test-time scaling through repeated sampling
- Medium: Interpretability benefits of low-dimensional skill representation

## Next Checks
1. Test Sloth's predictive accuracy on completely new benchmark suites not used during training
2. Evaluate performance prediction across significantly different architectural families
3. Conduct ablation studies removing benchmark correlations to quantify their contribution
