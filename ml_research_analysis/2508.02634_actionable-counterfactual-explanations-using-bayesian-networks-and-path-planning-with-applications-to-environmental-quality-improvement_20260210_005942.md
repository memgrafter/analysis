# Actionable Counterfactual Explanations Using Bayesian Networks and Path Planning with Applications to Environmental Quality Improvement

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.02634
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02634
- Reference count: 40
- Method generates actionable counterfactual explanations using Bayesian networks and path planning without leveraging training data

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach for generating actionable counterfactual explanations that addresses key limitations of existing methods. Unlike traditional approaches that directly use training data, this method learns a density estimator to create a search landscape for path planning algorithms, ensuring privacy by masking endogenous data. The method is tested on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including the Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Quality Index (EQI) dataset, demonstrating superior performance in finding actionable and simpler counterfactuals compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.

The approach leverages Bayesian networks to enhance interpretability, making it particularly valuable in high-stakes scenarios where understanding variable interactions is crucial. The method is applied to policy-making for improving quality of life in U.S. counties, capturing complex variable interactions and ensuring equity in decisions. The study reveals the importance of variables related to the housing crisis and their potential negative impact on communities, highlighting the method's practical utility in addressing real-world challenges.

## Method Summary
The proposed method combines Bayesian networks with path planning to generate actionable counterfactual explanations. First, a Bayesian network is learned as a density estimator to model the data distribution without directly using training data, thereby preserving privacy. This network creates a probabilistic landscape that guides the search for counterfactuals. Then, path planning algorithms are employed to navigate this landscape, finding paths from the original instance to counterfactuals that satisfy the desired outcome while minimizing changes. The Bayesian network structure provides interpretability by revealing variable dependencies and interactions, which is crucial for actionable recommendations in domains like environmental quality improvement and policy-making.

## Key Results
- The method finds more actionable and simpler counterfactuals compared to state-of-the-art algorithms
- Bayesian networks enhance interpretability by revealing variable interactions and dependencies
- The approach ensures privacy by masking endogenous data through density estimation
- Application to EQI dataset reveals housing crisis variables as critical factors affecting community quality of life

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by decoupling the data modeling from the counterfactual generation process. Instead of directly using training data (which may contain sensitive information), it learns a Bayesian network as a generative model. This network captures the joint probability distribution of variables, allowing the creation of a search space that respects the underlying data structure. Path planning algorithms can then efficiently explore this space to find counterfactuals that are both feasible (according to the learned distribution) and actionable (minimizing changes while achieving the desired outcome). The Bayesian network's interpretability helps stakeholders understand the causal relationships between variables, making the explanations more trustworthy and useful for decision-making.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Bayesian Networks**
   - Why needed: To model complex variable dependencies and serve as a density estimator
   - Quick check: Verify the learned network structure matches domain knowledge and passes statistical independence tests

2. **Path Planning Algorithms**
   - Why needed: To efficiently navigate the search space created by the Bayesian network
   - Quick check: Confirm the algorithm finds valid paths from original instances to counterfactuals within reasonable computational time

3. **Counterfactual Explanations**
   - Why needed: To provide actionable recommendations for changing outcomes
   - Quick check: Validate that generated counterfactuals are both feasible and minimal in terms of required changes

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Bayesian Network (Density Estimator) -> Path Planning Algorithm -> Counterfactual Generator

**Critical Path:**
Data → Bayesian Network Learning → Search Space Creation → Path Planning → Counterfactual Generation → Validation

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Privacy vs. accuracy: Density estimation provides privacy but may introduce approximation errors
- Interpretability vs. complexity: Bayesian networks are interpretable but may oversimplify complex relationships
- Computational efficiency vs. solution quality: More sophisticated path planning yields better counterfactuals but requires more computation

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor counterfactual quality: Indicates issues with Bayesian network learning or path planning parameters
- Privacy breaches: Suggests insufficient data masking in the density estimation process
- Interpretability issues: Points to overly complex or incorrect Bayesian network structures

**First Experiments:**
1. Test Bayesian network learning on synthetic data with known structure to verify accuracy
2. Validate path planning algorithm on simple landscapes to ensure correct navigation
3. Compare counterfactual quality on benchmark datasets against established methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- Scalability concerns for high-dimensional datasets beyond the tested EQI data
- Lack of quantitative validation for privacy preservation claims
- Limited empirical evidence for interpretability benefits compared to alternative methods
- Speculative nature of real-world policy application and equity impact claims

## Confidence

**High confidence:**
- Novel methodology combining Bayesian networks and path planning for counterfactual generation

**Medium confidence:**
- Privacy benefits and interpretability claims
- Comparative performance against state-of-the-art algorithms

**Low confidence:**
- Real-world policy application and equity impact claims

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive testing on diverse high-dimensional real-world datasets to evaluate scalability and generalizability
2. Implement quantitative metrics to validate the privacy preservation claims, including data reconstruction attacks and membership inference tests
3. Design user studies to empirically assess the interpretability benefits of Bayesian network-based explanations compared to alternative methods
