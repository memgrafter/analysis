# VidLBEval: Benchmarking and Mitigating Language Bias in Video-Involved LVLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.16602
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16602
- Reference count: 9
- This paper addresses language bias in video-involved Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) where models prioritize language over video content.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses language bias in video-involved Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where models prioritize language over video content, leading to incorrect responses. The authors introduce VidLBEval, a benchmark dataset designed to assess language bias through two tasks: Ambiguous Video Contrast (AVC) and Interrogative Question Probing (IQP). To mitigate this issue, they propose Multi-branch Contrastive Decoding (MCD), which introduces two expert branches—one focusing on video content and another retaining the original model process—to counteract the language bias potentially generated by the text-only branch. Experiments show that MCD effectively reduces language bias across multiple LVLMs, including VideoLLaVA, VideoLLaMA2, and VideoGPT+, while maintaining general-purpose capabilities without additional retraining or architectural changes.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces a benchmark dataset (VidLBEval) to assess language bias in video-involved LVLMs and proposes a mitigation method (MCD) that uses contrastive decoding with two expert branches. The benchmark includes tasks designed to evaluate how LVLMs handle ambiguous video content versus language cues. MCD introduces a multi-branch decoding approach where one branch focuses on video content while another retains the original model's processing, helping to counteract language bias. The method is evaluated across multiple LVLMs without requiring additional training or architectural modifications.

## Key Results
- MCD effectively reduces language bias across VideoLLaVA, VideoLLaMA2, and VideoGPT+ LVLMs
- Method achieves consistent improvements in Biased Visual Consistency (BVC), Text Consistency Rate (TCR), and Robust Accuracy (RA) metrics
- MCD maintains general-purpose capabilities while reducing bias without requiring additional retraining or architectural changes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The MCD method works by introducing a multi-branch decoding approach that counteracts the tendency of LVLMs to prioritize language over visual content. By creating two expert branches—one focused on video content and another retaining the original model process—the method provides a contrastive mechanism that helps the model balance visual and textual information. This approach addresses the fundamental issue where language-only branches in LVLMs can generate biased responses by giving too much weight to textual cues over visual evidence.

## Foundational Learning
- **Language Bias in Multimodal Models**: The tendency of models to favor textual information over visual content when both are present; needed to understand the core problem being addressed
- **Contrastive Decoding**: A decoding strategy that uses multiple branches to generate different outputs and select the most appropriate response; needed to understand how MCD works
- **LVLM Architecture**: Large Vision-Language Models combine visual and language processing; needed to understand the context and limitations of the approach
- **Benchmark Construction**: Creating controlled test scenarios to evaluate specific model behaviors; needed to understand how VidLBEval measures language bias
- **Expert Branch Integration**: Adding specialized processing paths to existing models; needed to understand how MCD modifies model behavior
- **Bias Metrics**: Quantitative measures (BVC, TCR, RA) used to evaluate bias reduction; needed to understand how success is measured

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
VidLBEval benchmark -> MCD mitigation method -> LVLM evaluation (VideoLLaVA, VideoLLaMA2, VideoGPT+)

**Critical Path**
1. Input video and question processed by LVLM
2. Multi-branch contrastive decoding applied via MCD
3. Video-focused and text-focused branches generate outputs
4. Contrastive selection balances visual and language information
5. Output response minimizes language bias

**Design Tradeoffs**
- MCD trades computational overhead for reduced bias versus standard decoding
- Benchmark uses controlled scenarios that may not fully capture real-world complexity
- Method requires no retraining but adds processing complexity through multiple branches

**Failure Signatures**
- If MCD fails: Language bias persists despite multi-branch approach, indicating branch specialization is insufficient
- If benchmark fails: Inconsistent bias measurements across similar test cases, suggesting task design issues
- If implementation fails: Computational overhead becomes prohibitive for real-time applications

**First Experiments to Run**
1. Baseline LVLM performance on VidLBEval tasks without MCD to establish bias levels
2. MCD implementation with single LVLM to verify branch functionality
3. Comparative evaluation across all three LVLMs to assess generalization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Study focuses on three specific LVLMs (VideoLLaVA, VideoLLaMA2, VideoGPT+), limiting generalizability to broader LVLM landscape
- Evaluation metrics may not capture all dimensions of language bias in real-world applications
- MCD method may introduce computational overhead or latency concerns not addressed in the paper

## Confidence

**Major Uncertainties and Limitations**
The paper identifies language bias in video-involved LVLMs as a largely under-explored problem, with existing benchmarks failing to adequately address this issue. While the proposed VidLBEval benchmark and MCD mitigation method show promising results, several uncertainties remain. The study primarily focuses on three specific LVLMs (VideoLLaVA, VideoLLaMA2, and VideoGPT+), which limits the generalizability of findings to the broader landscape of video-involved LVLMs. Additionally, the evaluation metrics (BVC, TCR, and RA) may not capture all dimensions of language bias, particularly in real-world applications where multimodal reasoning complexity exceeds controlled benchmark scenarios. The MCD method, while effective, relies on a contrastive decoding approach that may introduce computational overhead or latency concerns not addressed in the paper. Furthermore, the benchmark's construction process and the specific design choices for AVC and IQP tasks are not fully detailed, making independent replication challenging.

**Confidence Labels for Major Claim Clusters**

- **VidLBEval Benchmark Effectiveness (High)**: The paper demonstrates that VidLBEval successfully identifies language bias in multiple LVLMs through controlled experiments, with consistent improvements in bias metrics. The benchmark design appears methodologically sound, though the limited scope to three models slightly reduces confidence.

- **MCD Method Efficacy (High)**: Experimental results show MCD consistently improves BVC, TCR, and RA across all tested LVLMs without requiring retraining. The method's ability to maintain general-purpose capabilities while reducing bias is well-supported by quantitative evidence.

- **Language Bias Generalization (Medium)**: While the paper convincingly shows language bias exists across tested LVLMs, the claim that this is a "largely under-explored" problem lacks comprehensive literature review. The assertion that MCD generalizes to all video-involved LVLMs remains to be validated across a broader model spectrum.

## Next Checks

1. Test MCD on additional LVLMs beyond the three evaluated, including models with different architectural designs and training approaches, to assess true generalization capability across the LVLM landscape.

2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contribution of each expert branch in MCD to determine whether the video-focused branch or the retention of original model processes drives the observed improvements.

3. Implement real-time latency measurements for MCD decoding compared to standard decoding to quantify computational overhead and evaluate practical deployment feasibility in time-sensitive applications.
