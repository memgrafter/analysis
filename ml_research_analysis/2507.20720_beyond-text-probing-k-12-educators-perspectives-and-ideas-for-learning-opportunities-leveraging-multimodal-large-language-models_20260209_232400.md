# Beyond Text: Probing K-12 Educators' Perspectives and Ideas for Learning Opportunities Leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.20720
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20720
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: K-12 educators envisioned using MLLMs to create multimedia-rich content and support personalization, with generated code effectively mimicking multimodal visual outputs

## Executive Summary
This study explored K-12 educators' perspectives on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for learning through workshops with 12 teachers. Participants brainstormed applications, prototyped with Claude 3.5, and reflected on their experiences. Educators saw potential for MLLMs to create multimedia-rich content, support personalization, and facilitate research. The hands-on prototyping revealed that text-based generated code could effectively mimic multimodal visual outputs like animations and games, making rich learning experiences more attainable today. Teachers appreciated MLLMs for expanding design possibilities beyond simple answers and enabling students to build upon generated content.

## Method Summary
The study employed a workshop-based approach with 12 K-12 educators who participated in structured sessions to explore MLLM applications for education. Participants first brainstormed potential uses for MLLMs in their teaching contexts, then engaged in hands-on prototyping using Claude 3.5 to generate code that approximated multimodal outputs. The workshops concluded with reflection sessions where educators discussed their experiences, challenges, and ideas for implementation. The methodology focused on qualitative exploration of educator perspectives rather than quantitative measurement of student outcomes.

## Key Results
- Educators envisioned MLLMs creating multimedia-rich content, supporting personalization, and facilitating research
- Generated code effectively mimicked multimodal visual outputs like animations and games
- Teachers valued MLLMs for expanding design possibilities beyond simple answers, enabling students to build upon generated content

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MLLMs enable educators to generate multimedia-rich educational content through text-based code generation that can produce visual and interactive elements. The mechanism works by translating natural language prompts into executable code that creates animations, games, and other visual outputs, effectively bridging the gap between textual interaction and multimodal experiences. This approach makes sophisticated educational tools accessible to teachers without requiring extensive programming knowledge.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multimodal AI concepts**: Understanding how AI can process and generate multiple types of media (text, images, audio, video) is essential for grasping MLLM capabilities and limitations
- **Code generation fundamentals**: Knowledge of how AI systems convert natural language into executable code helps educators evaluate and adapt generated outputs
- **Educational technology integration**: Understanding how to embed AI tools into existing pedagogical frameworks ensures meaningful rather than superficial technology adoption
- **Digital literacy and evaluation**: Teachers need skills to assess the quality and appropriateness of AI-generated content for their specific educational contexts

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: User Input -> MLLM Processing -> Code Generation -> Execution Environment -> Visual Output
- **Critical path**: Natural language prompt → AI model interpretation → code generation → runtime execution → multimodal display
- **Design tradeoffs**: Text-based code generation offers broad compatibility but may lack the immediacy of native multimodal interfaces; simplicity vs. feature richness
- **Failure signatures**: Incorrect code syntax, missing dependencies, platform incompatibility, or security restrictions preventing execution
- **First experiments**: 1) Generate simple animations from text descriptions, 2) Create interactive quizzes through code generation, 3) Produce educational games from lesson content

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Small sample size (12 educators) limits generalizability across diverse educational contexts
- Recruitment through professional networks may introduce selection bias toward tech-comfortable educators
- Focus on a single MLLM (Claude 3.5) may not reflect broader model capabilities or limitations

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Educators' general enthusiasm for MLLMs' potential to enhance learning experiences and create multimedia content
- **Medium confidence**: Specific claims about generated code effectively mimicking multimodal outputs
- **Medium confidence**: Identified challenges around teacher training and literacy adaptation

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the study with a larger, more diverse sample of K-12 educators across different subject areas, grade levels, and geographic regions to test generalizability.

2. Conduct longitudinal studies tracking how teachers actually integrate MLLMs into their practice over a full academic year, including student outcomes and sustained pedagogical changes.

3. Test the same workshop protocol with actual multimodal outputs (not code approximations) to verify whether educators' positive reactions to generated code translate to authentic multimodal experiences.
