# Who Moved My Distribution? Conformal Prediction for Interactive Multi-Agent Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2511.11567
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11567
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Iterative conformal prediction framework improves multi-agent motion planning success rates up to 9.6% over baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of safe motion planning in multi-agent systems where uncertainty-aware agents interact with reactive non-ego agents, causing endogenous distribution shifts. The authors introduce an iterative conformal prediction framework that adapts uncertainty-aware controllers to these shifts by continuously recalibrating prediction regions using collected trajectory data. The method integrates with model predictive control and provides theoretical convergence guarantees under specific conditions. Experiments in 2- and 3-agent simulation scenarios demonstrate improved success rates while maintaining safety, with the iterative approach preventing overly conservative behavior seen in non-iterative methods.

## Method Summary
The framework employs an iterative conformal prediction approach for safe motion planning in multi-agent systems. It begins with an initial uncertainty-aware controller that uses exogenous uncertainty bounds, then collects trajectory data under deployment to estimate the endogenous shift caused by reactive agents. The conformal prediction regions are iteratively updated based on this data, with convergence guaranteed when the exogenous uncertainty set is sufficiently large. The method integrates with model predictive control, using the calibrated prediction regions to ensure safety during planning. The iterative process stops when the conformal prediction regions stabilize, preventing divergence while maintaining performance.

## Key Results
- Iterative conformal prediction improves success rates by up to 9.6% compared to baselines
- Framework maintains safety guarantees while preventing overly conservative behavior
- 3-agent case shows particularly notable improvements when all agents employ conformal prediction
- Theoretical analysis establishes convergence conditions for the iterative process

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by recognizing that multi-agent interactions create endogenous distribution shifts that invalidate initial uncertainty models. By iteratively collecting trajectory data and recalibrating prediction regions, the controller adapts to the true interaction dynamics. The conformal prediction framework provides rigorous safety guarantees by ensuring that prediction regions cover the true system behavior with specified confidence. The integration with model predictive control allows for real-time planning while maintaining these safety bounds. The stopping criteria prevent the iterative process from becoming overly conservative while ensuring convergence.

## Foundational Learning
- **Conformal prediction**: Provides distribution-free uncertainty quantification with rigorous coverage guarantees. Needed to ensure safety without requiring precise distributional assumptions. Quick check: Verify prediction regions achieve target coverage on held-out data.
- **Endogenous vs exogenous uncertainty**: Distinguishes between inherent system noise and uncertainty introduced by agent interactions. Critical for understanding distribution shifts. Quick check: Compare uncertainty magnitudes under different interaction scenarios.
- **Model Predictive Control**: Enables receding horizon planning with safety constraints. Essential for real-time implementation. Quick check: Verify constraint satisfaction at each planning step.
- **Iterative calibration**: Allows online adaptation to changing system dynamics. Key for handling distribution shifts. Quick check: Monitor prediction region size changes across iterations.
- **Safety guarantees**: Ensures collision-free operation despite uncertainties. Fundamental requirement for multi-agent systems. Quick check: Verify minimum distance constraints are maintained throughout operation.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: 
MPC Planner -> Uncertainty Estimator -> Conformal Calibrator -> Safety Checker -> Trajectory Collector -> MPC Planner (iterative loop)

**Critical Path**: The safety-critical path involves MPC generating trajectories, safety checker validating them against calibrated prediction regions, and trajectory collector gathering data for the next iteration. The conformal calibrator processes collected data to update prediction regions.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The iterative approach trades computational overhead for improved performance and safety. Larger exogenous uncertainty sets guarantee convergence but may lead to conservative initial behavior. The stopping criteria balance between sufficient adaptation and computational efficiency.

**Failure Signatures**: Divergence occurs if exogenous uncertainty is too small or prediction regions grow unbounded. Poor performance results from insufficient data collection or inaccurate uncertainty modeling. Safety violations indicate calibration errors or model mismatches.

**First Experiments**: 
1. Single-agent navigation with known exogenous uncertainty to validate basic MPC integration
2. Two-agent interaction with synthetic endogenous shifts to test calibration accuracy
3. Three-agent scenario with varying prediction region sizes to study convergence behavior

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Theoretical convergence requires specific exogenous uncertainty set size conditions that may not hold in all practical scenarios
- Experimental validation limited to 2- and 3-agent simulations; scalability to larger systems unverified
- Computational overhead of iterative process and real-time feasibility for complex scenarios not thoroughly characterized

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Core iterative conformal prediction framework is well-defined with sound theoretical convergence conditions
- **Medium confidence**: Experimental results show convincing improvements in tested scenarios but generalizability is uncertain
- **Medium confidence**: Safety guarantees are theoretically sound but practical effectiveness depends on accurate uncertainty modeling

## Next Checks
1. Test framework with 5+ agents to evaluate scalability and identify computational bottlenecks in iterative process
2. Validate approach with non-linear agent dynamics and heterogeneous agent types beyond simple linear models
3. Implement method on physical multi-robot system to verify theoretical safety guarantees translate to real-world performance under sensor noise and unmodeled dynamics
