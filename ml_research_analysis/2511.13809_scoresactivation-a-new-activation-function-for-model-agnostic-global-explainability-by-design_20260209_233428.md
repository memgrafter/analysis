# ScoresActivation: A New Activation Function for Model Agnostic Global Explainability by Design

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.13809
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13809
- **Reference count**: 14
- **Primary result**: Novel activation function that integrates feature importance estimation during training, achieving 29.33% accuracy improvement on noisy datasets while being 150x faster than SHAP for feature scoring

## Executive Summary
ScoresActivation introduces a novel activation function that directly embeds feature importance estimation into the model training process. Unlike post-hoc explanation methods that are disconnected from learning, this approach learns feature importance scores during training through a differentiable scoring mechanism. The method uses a softmax-based weighting of input features within the forward pass, creating models that are inherently interpretable. Experimental results show that ScoresActivation produces globally faithful feature rankings that align with SHAP values and ground truth, while maintaining high predictive performance and offering significant speed advantages over traditional explanation methods.

## Method Summary
ScoresActivation integrates feature importance estimation directly into the neural network architecture by replacing standard activation functions with a novel mechanism that computes feature importance scores during the forward pass. The method uses a softmax-based weighting system that assigns importance scores to input features, which are then used to modulate the activation of subsequent layers. This creates a differentiable pathway for learning feature importance alongside the primary prediction task. The approach is model-agnostic, meaning it can be applied to various neural network architectures without requiring architectural changes. During training, the model simultaneously optimizes for both prediction accuracy and meaningful feature importance scores, resulting in inherently interpretable models that provide global explanations without additional post-processing.

## Key Results
- Achieved 29.33% accuracy improvement on datasets with irrelevant features, demonstrating robustness to noise
- Feature scoring is 150 times faster than classical SHAP, requiring only 2 seconds during training compared to SHAP's 300 seconds
- Feature rankings from ScoresActivation align closely with SHAP values and ground truth across synthetic and real datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by embedding a differentiable scoring mechanism within the model's forward pass, allowing feature importance to be learned simultaneously with the primary prediction task. By using softmax-based weighting of input features, the model can dynamically adjust the importance of each feature during training based on its contribution to the final prediction. This integration ensures that the feature importance scores are directly tied to the learned representations and decision boundaries, rather than being computed as an afterthought. The differentiable nature of the scoring mechanism means that gradients can flow through the importance weights during backpropagation, allowing the model to refine both its predictions and its explanations in a unified optimization process.

## Foundational Learning
- **Softmax function**: Used for normalizing feature importance scores into probability distributions; needed to ensure scores sum to one and can be interpreted as relative importance weights
- **Global explainability**: Focus on understanding overall model behavior rather than individual predictions; quick check: can the model identify which features are generally most important across the entire dataset?
- **Differentiable programming**: The scoring mechanism must be differentiable to allow gradient-based learning; quick check: do gradients flow correctly through the importance weights during backpropagation?
- **Model-agnostic design**: Architecture-independent approach that can be applied to various neural network types; quick check: does the method work consistently across different model architectures?
- **Feature importance alignment**: Scores should correlate with established methods like SHAP; quick check: do the learned importance scores match SHAP values on benchmark datasets?
- **Computational efficiency**: Method must be significantly faster than post-hoc explanation techniques; quick check: is the scoring process truly 150x faster than SHAP across different hardware configurations?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Input features -> Softmax-based scoring layer -> Weighted activation function -> Hidden layers -> Output layer
- **Critical path**: Feature importance computation (softmax weighting) -> Activation function application -> Prediction layer
- **Design tradeoffs**: Integrates explainability directly into training (faster, more aligned explanations) vs. traditional post-hoc methods (more flexible, model-independent)
- **Failure signatures**: If softmax weights become uniform, the model fails to learn meaningful feature importance; if training diverges, importance scores may become noisy or meaningless
- **3 first experiments**:
  1. Compare feature importance rankings on synthetic dataset with known ground truth
  2. Measure inference time and feature scoring speed versus SHAP baseline
  3. Test accuracy degradation when irrelevant features are added to real-world datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions for future research.

## Limitations
- Performance gains (29.33% accuracy improvement) may be dataset-specific and not generalize to all domains
- Method lacks comparative analysis against other inherently interpretable models like decision trees or linear models
- Claims about global explainability need validation on complex, high-dimensional data types like images or text

## Confidence
- **High**: The core contribution of integrating feature importance into the activation function is novel and technically sound
- **Medium**: The performance improvements on noisy datasets, as this may be dataset-specific
- **Low**: The global explainability claims, as the method's performance on complex, high-dimensional data remains untested

## Next Checks
1. Test the method on image and text datasets to evaluate cross-domain generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of the activation function from other model components
3. Compare performance against established inherently interpretable models on standard benchmark datasets
