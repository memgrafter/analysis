# On the Difficulty of Token-Level Modeling of Dysfluency and Fluency Shaping Artifacts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2512.02027
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02027
- Reference count: 28
- The study addresses the challenge of recognizing dysfluencies and fluency-shaping artifacts in stuttered speech using automatic speech recognition systems.

## Executive Summary
This study tackles the challenge of recognizing dysfluencies and fluency-shaping artifacts in stuttered speech through automatic speech recognition. The authors propose a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach using LoRA adapters to predict special tokens representing dysfluencies and modified speech in transcriptions. Experiments conducted on both English and German stuttered speech datasets demonstrate significant improvements in word error rates and token placement accuracy, particularly when incorporating language-adaptive pretraining. However, a persistent tokenization bias against German limits overall performance gains, highlighting critical barriers in multilingual models.

## Method Summary
The authors propose parameter-efficient fine-tuning with LoRA adapters to predict special tokens representing dysfluencies and modified speech within transcriptions. This approach aims to address the challenge of recognizing dysfluencies and fluency-shaping artifacts in stuttered speech. The method involves training a speech recognition system to identify and transcribe dysfluencies while maintaining overall ASR performance. The approach is tested on English and German stuttered speech datasets, with particular attention to word error rates and token placement accuracy.

## Key Results
- Significant improvements in word error rates and token placement accuracy for English stuttered speech
- Language-adaptive pretraining enhances performance when incorporated
- Persistent tokenization bias against German limits overall performance gains in multilingual settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by using LoRA adapters for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, allowing the model to adapt to dysfluency patterns without full model retraining. The special tokens serve as explicit markers for dysfluencies and fluency-shaping artifacts, enabling the system to recognize and transcribe these phenomena accurately. Language-adaptive pretraining further enhances the model's ability to handle language-specific characteristics of dysfluent speech.

## Foundational Learning
- **LoRA adapters**: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning method; needed to adapt ASR models to dysfluency patterns without full retraining; quick check: compare performance with and without LoRA
- **Token-level modeling**: Approach of predicting special tokens for dysfluencies; needed to explicitly mark dysfluency occurrences; quick check: evaluate token placement accuracy
- **Multilingual ASR**: Speech recognition across multiple languages; needed to assess cross-linguistic applicability; quick check: compare performance across languages
- **Dysfluency recognition**: Identifying speech disruptions; needed as core task for stuttered speech processing; quick check: measure WER improvements
- **Tokenization bias**: Systematic errors in token generation; needed to understand performance limitations; quick check: analyze error patterns by language
- **Language-adaptive pretraining**: Task-specific pretraining for target language; needed to improve language-specific performance; quick check: compare with standard pretraining

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: XLS-R model -> LoRA adapter fine-tuning -> Special token prediction -> Evaluation on stuttered speech datasets

**Critical Path**: ASR input → XLS-R encoding → LoRA adaptation → Token prediction → Evaluation metrics (WER, token accuracy)

**Design Tradeoffs**: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning vs. full model retraining; explicit token marking vs. implicit dysfluency modeling; multilingual capability vs. language-specific optimization

**Failure Signatures**: Persistent tokenization bias against German; modest absolute performance gains; limited improvement on German dataset

**First Experiments**: 1) Compare LoRA fine-tuning with full model retraining on English dataset; 2) Test alternative tokenization strategies to address German bias; 3) Evaluate performance on additional languages beyond English and German

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper acknowledges but cannot explain the root cause of the persistent tokenization bias against German, leaving uncertainty about whether this bias would persist across other language pairs or different multilingual architectures.

## Limitations
- Persistent tokenization bias against German appears to be a fundamental architectural constraint
- Limited experimental scope to two languages (English and German) and one model architecture (XLS-R)
- Modest absolute performance gains, particularly for German (2.4% relative WER improvement)

## Confidence
- High confidence in LoRA fine-tuning effectiveness for English dysfluency recognition
- Medium confidence in language-adaptive pretraining benefits
- Medium confidence in multilingual extension due to German tokenization bias
- Low confidence in scalability to other languages/architectures

## Next Checks
1. Test the proposed approach on additional languages and ASR architectures to assess generalizability beyond English and German/XLS-R
2. Investigate alternative tokenization strategies or subword vocabularies to address the persistent bias against German and other languages
3. Evaluate the trade-off between dysfluency recognition accuracy and general ASR performance on fluent speech
