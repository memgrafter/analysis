# Dynamic Routing Between Experts: A Data-Efficient Approach to Continual Learning in Vision-Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2511.01831
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01831
- **Reference count**: 19
- **Primary result**: Addresses catastrophic forgetting in vision-language models using dynamic routing with LoRA modules, maintaining foundational capabilities while improving specialized task performance

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a dynamic routing approach to address catastrophic forgetting in vision-language models during sequential fine-tuning. The method employs lightweight LoRA modules for task-specific adaptation while learning routing vectors that dynamically select the appropriate module during inference. By preserving foundational capabilities while enabling efficient task specialization, the approach matches or exceeds multi-task learning performance without requiring simultaneous access to all task data.

The research evaluates the approach on InternVL-2 models (2B and 8B parameters), demonstrating computational efficiency and scalability with model size. The routing mechanism enables cross-modal transfer between language and vision capabilities, making it particularly valuable for real-world deployment scenarios where models must continually learn new tasks while maintaining existing performance.

## Method Summary
The approach combines task-specific LoRA modules with a dynamic routing mechanism that learns routing vectors to select the appropriate module during inference. When a new task arrives, a lightweight LoRA module is trained while the routing mechanism learns to direct inputs to the most relevant module. This enables task specialization without overwriting foundational knowledge. The method maintains computational efficiency by only requiring new task data and lightweight modules, while the routing mechanism facilitates cross-modal transfer between language and vision capabilities.

## Key Results
- Maintains performance on benchmark tasks while improving accuracy on specialized tasks
- Matches or exceeds multi-task learning performance without requiring all task data simultaneously
- Demonstrates computational efficiency and scalability with model size (tested on 2B and 8B parameter models)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by decoupling task-specific adaptation from foundational knowledge preservation. LoRA modules provide lightweight task specialization while routing vectors dynamically direct inputs to appropriate modules based on task requirements. This prevents catastrophic forgetting by maintaining separate pathways for different tasks rather than overwriting shared parameters. The routing mechanism learns task-specific patterns that enable efficient cross-modal transfer, allowing the model to leverage existing capabilities when learning new tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- **Catastrophic forgetting**: Why needed - Understanding why neural networks lose previous knowledge during sequential training is crucial for designing effective continual learning solutions. Quick check - Verify that performance on previously learned tasks degrades without appropriate mitigation strategies.
- **Parameter-efficient fine-tuning**: Why needed - LoRA modules provide task-specific adaptation without the computational cost of full fine-tuning. Quick check - Compare parameter counts between full fine-tuning and LoRA-based approaches.
- **Routing mechanisms**: Why needed - Dynamic selection of appropriate modules enables efficient task switching without manual intervention. Quick check - Evaluate routing accuracy across diverse task distributions.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input -> Routing Vector Generator -> LoRA Module Selector -> Task-Specific LoRA Module -> Base Model -> Output

**Critical Path**: Input data flows through the routing vector generator, which selects the appropriate LoRA module based on learned patterns. The selected module applies task-specific transformations to the base model's output, enabling specialized performance while preserving foundational capabilities.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach trades some inference latency (due to routing decisions) for significantly reduced training costs and improved task-specific performance. The modular design enables easy addition of new tasks but requires careful routing mechanism training to prevent suboptimal module selection.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor routing vector training may lead to incorrect module selection, causing performance degradation on both new and existing tasks. Insufficient LoRA module capacity can result in inadequate task specialization, while overly complex routing mechanisms may overfit to specific task distributions.

**First Experiments**:
1. Sequential training on two diverse tasks to verify catastrophic forgetting prevention
2. Routing mechanism accuracy evaluation across task distributions
3. Computational efficiency comparison between full fine-tuning and LoRA-based approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation focused on InternVL-2 models (2B and 8B parameters), limiting generalizability to other vision-language architectures
- Long-term stability of foundational capabilities during extended sequential training remains unverified
- Performance in highly specialized or imbalanced domains has not been thoroughly investigated

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The core methodology of dynamic routing with LoRA modules is technically sound and well-documented. The computational efficiency claims are supported by reasonable architectural analysis.

**Medium confidence**: The reported performance improvements on specialized tasks are convincing but limited to specific benchmarks. The cross-modal transfer capabilities are demonstrated but not extensively validated across diverse domains.

**Low confidence**: Long-term stability of foundational capabilities during extended sequential training and performance in highly specialized or imbalanced scenarios remain unverified.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct extended sequential training experiments (10+ tasks) to assess long-term stability of foundational capabilities and routing mechanism effectiveness.

2. Evaluate performance on diverse vision-language benchmarks with varying class distributions and domain specificity to test robustness.

3. Implement comprehensive computational benchmarking across different hardware configurations to validate efficiency claims under realistic deployment conditions.
