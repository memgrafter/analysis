# Disrupt Your Research Using Generative AI Powered ScienceSage

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.18479
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18479
- Reference count: 26
- ScienceSage is a web application that leverages generative AI to help researchers build, store, update, and query knowledge bases for scientific research

## Executive Summary
ScienceSage is a web application that leverages generative AI to help researchers build, store, update, and query knowledge bases for scientific research. It addresses challenges in retrieving relevant, up-to-date information from multimodal data (text, images, audio, video) and generating structured research reports. The application integrates three core functions—generating research reports, chatting with documents, and chatting with any multimodal data—using a common set of knowledge bases. These knowledge bases are indexed using vector, knowledge graph, and custom (combined) indices to enable efficient information retrieval and querying.

## Method Summary
ScienceSage integrates three core functions—generating research reports, chatting with documents, and chatting with any multimodal data—using a common set of knowledge bases. These knowledge bases are indexed using vector, knowledge graph, and custom (combined) indices to enable efficient information retrieval and querying. The application uses LLMs like ChatGPT4 and Mixtral 8X7B, with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for enhanced accuracy.

## Key Results
- ScienceSage enables efficient information retrieval and querying through vector, knowledge graph, and custom (combined) indices
- The custom indexing method consistently outperformed vector and knowledge graph approaches in correctness, relevance, and faithfulness across queries of varying difficulty
- Internal deployment demonstrated accelerated research projects through quick iteration and information retrieval

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ScienceSage leverages generative AI and RAG to enhance information retrieval accuracy by combining multiple indexing strategies (vector, knowledge graph, custom). This multimodal approach addresses the limitations of single-index systems by providing complementary retrieval methods that improve query performance across different data types and query complexities.

## Foundational Learning
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Why needed - Combines information retrieval with generative models to improve accuracy and reduce hallucinations. Quick check - Verify retrieved context matches query intent before generation.
- Vector Indexing: Why needed - Enables semantic similarity search in high-dimensional space. Quick check - Test nearest neighbor retrieval accuracy for semantic queries.
- Knowledge Graph Indexing: Why needed - Captures relationships and structured knowledge between entities. Quick check - Verify graph traversal returns expected connected entities.
- Custom (Combined) Indexing: Why needed - Integrates multiple indexing approaches for comprehensive retrieval. Quick check - Compare retrieval performance against individual indexing methods.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
User Interface -> LLM Integration -> Indexing Layer (Vector/Graph/Custom) -> Knowledge Base Storage -> Document Processing Pipeline

**Critical Path:**
User query → Document processing → Indexing retrieval → LLM generation → Response delivery

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Vector indexing provides semantic search but may miss explicit relationships
- Knowledge graphs capture relationships but require structured data preparation
- Custom indexing combines benefits but increases complexity and storage requirements

**Failure Signatures:**
- Hallucinations in generated content indicate poor context retrieval
- Slow response times suggest indexing or retrieval bottlenecks
- Missing relevant information indicates inadequate indexing coverage

**First Experiments:**
1. Test RAG performance with single vs. combined indexing approaches on sample queries
2. Measure hallucination rates across different indexing methods using controlled test cases
3. Evaluate query response times across indexing methods with varying dataset sizes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation based on limited internal testing without publicly available benchmark datasets
- Claims about custom indexing superiority lack independent verification
- Internal deployment raises questions about scalability across different research domains

## Confidence
- High confidence in technical description of system architecture and AI model integration
- Medium confidence in evaluation results due to lack of independent verification
- Low confidence in disruption claims based on internal observations without broader user studies

## Next Checks
1. Conduct independent evaluation using standardized benchmark datasets across multiple scientific domains
2. Perform user studies with external researchers from different fields to assess practical utility
3. Test system scalability and performance in cloud environments with larger, more diverse datasets
