# Causal Time Series Modeling of Supraglacial Lake Evolution in Greenland under Distribution Shift

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2510.15265
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15265
- Reference count: 34
- Primary result: RIC-TSC achieves up to 12.59% higher accuracy than correlation-based baselines for supraglacial lake evolution classification under out-of-distribution evaluation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces RIC-TSC, a causally-informed time series classification framework for modeling supraglacial lake evolution in Greenland. The method integrates Joint PCMCI+ causal discovery with MiniROCKET sequence modeling and RidgeClassifier to identify temporally stable and physically grounded predictors of lake dynamics. Using multi-modal satellite and reanalysis data across six drainage basins and two melt seasons (2018-2019), the approach demonstrates improved generalization and interpretability compared to correlation-based baselines, particularly under out-of-distribution evaluation. The work advances Earth observation by embedding causal inference into scalable time series modeling for dynamic cryospheric processes.

## Method Summary
RIC-TSC employs a three-stage pipeline: (1) Joint PCMCI+ causal discovery identifies lagged causal parents of HV backscatter anomaly using global and per-basin samples (60 lakes globally, 20 per basin); (2) MiniROCKET transforms the causal features into fixed-length representations; (3) RidgeClassifier performs multi-class classification (refreeze, buried, slow drainage, rapid drainage). The framework uses 365-day multivariate time series from Sentinel-1 SAR (HV backscatter anomaly), Sentinel-2/Landsat-8 optical (water fraction, solar zenith), and CARRA-West reanalysis (temperature, radiation, pressure, sea surface temperature). Evaluation employs three protocols: global pooled (80/20 split), region-specific in-distribution, and leave-one-region-out out-of-distribution.

## Key Results
- RIC-TSC achieves up to 12.59% higher accuracy than correlation-based baselines under out-of-distribution evaluation
- Causal features demonstrate superior generalization across six Greenland drainage basins compared to full-variable baselines
- Class-wise performance shows consistent improvement, particularly for rare evolution pathways like buried lakes
- Global causal graphs (60 lakes) provide more stable parent sets than region-specific graphs (20 lakes each)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages causal discovery to identify temporally stable predictors that capture the underlying physical mechanisms of lake evolution rather than spurious correlations. By using lagged causal parents as features, the model reduces dimensionality while maintaining predictive power and improving generalization under distribution shift. The MiniROCKET transform efficiently handles the time series nature of the data without requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning, while RidgeClassifier provides regularization that complements the causal feature selection.

## Foundational Learning
- **Joint PCMCI+ causal discovery**: Estimates lagged causal relationships from time series data using conditional independence testing; needed because traditional correlation fails to capture temporal dependencies and causal structure in Earth observation data
- **MiniROCKET transform**: Extracts discriminative features from time series using convolutional kernels; needed because raw time series are high-dimensional and non-stationary
- **RidgeClassifier**: Linear classifier with L2 regularization; needed because causal features may still be correlated and require shrinkage to prevent overfitting
- **Out-of-distribution evaluation**: Tests model performance on unseen regions to assess generalization; needed because Earth observation models must transfer across spatial domains
- **Multi-modal data fusion**: Combines SAR, optical, and reanalysis data; needed because lake evolution depends on multiple interacting physical processes
- **Lag-aware modeling**: Incorporates temporal delays in causal relationships; needed because cryospheric processes unfold over days to weeks

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Raw data -> Preprocessing (rolling median, interpolation) -> J-PCMCI+ causal discovery -> MiniROCKET transform -> RidgeClassifier -> Multi-class prediction

**Critical Path**
J-PCMCI+ causal discovery -> MiniROCKET transform -> RidgeClassifier (cross-validated regularization)

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Causal discovery with limited samples (20 lakes/region) vs. computational efficiency and physical interpretability
- MiniROCKET lightweight feature extraction vs. potential information loss compared to deeper sequence models
- RidgeClassifier simplicity vs. capacity to capture complex temporal patterns

**Failure Signatures**
- Empty or unstable causal graphs from J-PCMCI+ indicate insufficient samples or inappropriate lag structure
- Poor OOD performance suggests data leakage or insufficient regularization
- Class imbalance in predictions indicates need for weighted loss or resampling

**3 First Experiments**
1. Verify causal graph stability by running J-PCMCI+ on multiple random subsets of lakes
2. Test classification performance using different lag windows (τmax = 7, 14, 21 days)
3. Compare RidgeClassifier performance with and without MiniROCKET feature transformation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Would stratifying causal discovery by lake outcome class reveal distinct causal mechanisms specific to each evolution pathway (refreeze, buried, slow drainage, rapid drainage)?
- Can spatiotemporal graph neural networks that explicitly model inter-lake dependencies improve classification accuracy beyond the current per-lake approach?
- Would deeper sequence models (e.g., LSTMs, Transformers) outperform MiniROCKET–RidgeClassifier when sufficient labeled data are available?
- How robust is the causal discovery to increased sample sizes and longer lag windows beyond the current 7-day maximum?

## Limitations
- Causal discovery with only 20 lakes per region may produce unstable parent sets due to limited statistical power
- Implementation details for J-PCMCI+ (independence tests, conditioning sets) remain underspecified, complicating exact replication
- Cross-validation strategy for RidgeClassifier hyperparameter tuning is not detailed, limiting assessment of model robustness
- The framework treats lakes as independent observational units, ignoring potential spatial interactions and cascading drainage events

## Confidence
- High confidence in methodological framework and core contributions
- Medium confidence in causal discovery stability given limited regional samples
- Medium confidence in OOD generalization claims pending hyperparameter validation

## Next Checks
1. Replicate causal discovery on subsampled data to assess stability of parent sets across different random seeds and sample sizes
2. Conduct ablation studies removing individual predictor variables to verify their causal relevance and contribution to classification accuracy
3. Test model performance on an independent validation dataset from a previously unseen Greenland region or melt season to further validate OOD generalization claims
