# LACA: Improving Cross-lingual Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis with LLM Data Augmentation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.09515
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09515
- Reference count: 22
- Key result: LLM-based data augmentation improves cross-lingual ABSA by up to 2.62% F1-score over translation-based methods

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LACA, a novel LLM-based data augmentation framework for cross-lingual aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). The approach addresses the limitations of translation-based methods by generating pseudo-labelled target language data using LLMs prompted with model predictions. The framework demonstrates significant performance improvements across six languages and five backbone models, with fine-tuned LLMs outperforming smaller multilingual models. LACA achieves state-of-the-art results in cross-lingual ABSA while being adaptable to both sequence labeling and generative ABSA models.

## Method Summary
LACA operates through a three-step process: First, it fine-tunes an ABSA model on source language data. Second, it generates pseudo-labelled target language sentences using an LLM, which is prompted with the predictions from the fine-tuned model. Third, it retrains the ABSA model on this augmented data, combining the original source data with the LLM-generated pseudo-labels. This approach leverages the generative capabilities of LLMs to create high-quality target language data without requiring direct translation, addressing issues like word ambiguity and context loss inherent in translation-based methods.

## Key Results
- LACA achieves up to 2.62% average F1-score improvement over state-of-the-art translation-based methods
- Framework demonstrates 6% improvement over zero-shot baselines across six languages
- Fine-tuned LLMs consistently outperform smaller multilingual models (XLM-T, XLM-R) in cross-lingual ABSA tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging LLMs' generative capabilities to create contextually appropriate target language data that preserves the nuanced sentiment information required for ABSA. By prompting the LLM with model predictions rather than direct translations, LACA avoids the information loss and ambiguity issues common in translation-based approaches. The iterative refinement process allows the model to learn from both source language data and high-quality pseudo-labels, effectively bridging the cross-lingual gap while maintaining aspect-specific sentiment information.

## Foundational Learning

**Cross-lingual ABSA**: Aspect-based sentiment analysis that works across multiple languages without requiring labeled data in all target languages. Needed because sentiment analysis requirements vary across domains and languages, making direct translation ineffective.

**Data Augmentation**: Technique of artificially expanding training datasets to improve model generalization. Quick check: Does the augmented data maintain the original distribution characteristics while adding diversity?

**Zero-shot Cross-lingual Transfer**: Training on one language and directly applying to another without any target language examples. Quick check: How much performance drops when moving from zero-shot to few-shot scenarios?

**Pseudo-labeling**: Using model predictions as training labels for unlabeled data. Quick check: What's the quality threshold where pseudo-labels become detrimental rather than helpful?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Source Language Data -> Fine-tuned ABSA Model -> LLM Prompt Generator -> Pseudo-labelled Target Data -> Retrained ABSA Model

**Critical Path**: The most time-consuming component is LLM inference for pseudo-label generation, which scales with the number of target sentences needed. Memory usage peaks during the retraining phase when combining source and augmented data.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational cost (LLM inference) for improved cross-lingual performance. Alternative designs could use smaller language models or rule-based generation, but these would likely sacrifice quality for speed.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation occurs when LLM-generated pseudo-labels have high error rates, when source language data is insufficient for proper fine-tuning, or when language pairs have significantly different linguistic structures.

**First Experiments**:
1. Baseline: Fine-tune ABSA model on source language only, test on target language (zero-shot)
2. Translation baseline: Translate target data to source language, fine-tune, translate predictions back
3. LACA with different LLM prompting strategies to identify optimal configuration

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None identified in the source material.

## Limitations

- Relies on LLM-generated pseudo-labels without quantifying label quality or error propagation
- Experiments limited to high-resource languages where LLMs perform well, leaving low-resource effectiveness unverified
- Lacks ablation studies on different LLM prompting strategies and computational cost analysis

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Experimental methodology sound with proper baselines and multiple models tested
- **Medium Confidence**: Core claim of LLM augmentation outperforming translation is well-supported but improvement extent may vary
- **Medium Confidence**: Fine-tuned LLM superiority demonstrated but limited to specific models tested

## Next Checks

1. Conduct error analysis on LLM-generated pseudo-labels to quantify label noise and its impact on final model performance
2. Test framework on genuinely low-resource languages with minimal training data to assess scalability
3. Perform ablation studies varying LLM prompting strategies to identify optimal configurations for different language pairs
