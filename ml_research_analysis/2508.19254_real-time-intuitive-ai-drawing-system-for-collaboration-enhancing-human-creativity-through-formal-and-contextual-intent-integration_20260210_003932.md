# Real-Time Intuitive AI Drawing System for Collaboration: Enhancing Human Creativity through Formal and Contextual Intent Integration

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2508.19254
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19254
- Reference count: 4
- Primary result: Real-time collaborative AI drawing system with median end-to-end latency near two seconds

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a real-time collaborative AI drawing system that interprets and integrates both formal intent (structural and compositional attributes of sketches) and contextual intent (semantic and thematic meaning) to enable synchronous co-creation. The method combines contour-preserving structural control via Concave Hull-based masking and ControlNet with style- and content-aware image synthesis guided by vision-language models. Implemented with a touchscreen interface and distributed inference architecture, the system supports multi-user collaboration on shared canvases with median end-to-end latency near two seconds. The platform lowers barriers to artistic participation and fosters collective creativity, as demonstrated in public installations like Graffiti-X. The approach redefines human-AI interaction as co-creation, addressing authorship tensions by structuring AI as a responsive collaborator rather than a post-processing tool.

## Method Summary
The system processes user strokes through a dual-path intent extraction pipeline: structural features (line trajectories, proportions, spatial arrangement) are captured via Canny edge detection and Concave Hull masking, while semantic content is extracted through a vision-language model. These signals are jointly conditioned in a multi-stage diffusion pipeline—ControlNet enforces structural alignment while VLM-derived prompts guide thematic content. TouchDesigner clients stream strokes via WebSockets to distributed GPU workers that process jobs in parallel, with spatial partitioning enabling concurrent updates. The generation uses a two-stage KSampler with denoising rate of 0.3, followed by LoRA style adaptation and seam-aware compositing back to the shared canvas.

## Key Results
- Achieves median end-to-end latency near two seconds for real-time collaboration
- Preserves user structural intent through Concave Hull-based masking and ControlNet conditioning
- Enables multi-user co-creation on shared canvases with spatial partitioning
- Demonstrates reduced barriers to artistic participation in public installations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Simultaneously processing formal and contextual intent enables co-creative output that preserves user agency while adding semantic coherence.
- Mechanism: The system splits user input into two parallel paths: (1) structural extraction via Canny edge detection and Concave Hull masking captures line trajectories, proportions, and spatial arrangement; (2) a CLIP-based vision-language model extracts semantic descriptors and emotional tone. These dual signals are jointly conditioned in a multi-stage diffusion pipeline—ControlNet enforces structural alignment while VLM-derived prompts guide thematic content.
- Core assumption: Users' creative intent is composed of both geometric/spatial decisions (formal) and semantic/thematic goals (contextual), and neither alone suffices for meaningful co-creation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "our approach simultaneously analyzes ground-level intuitive geometric features such as line trajectories, proportions, and spatial arrangement, and high-level semantic cues extracted via vision–language models"
  - [section 3.1] "Formal Intent—structural and compositional properties of the sketch—is preserved through Concave Hull-based masking and ControlNet-driven structural conditioning, while Contextual Intent—semantic, thematic, and affective cues—is extracted via a vision–language model (VLM)"
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence; corpus neighbor "InterChat" addresses multimodal intent interpretation in visual analytics but not dual-path sketch processing.
- Break condition: If formal and contextual signals conflict (e.g., semantic prompt implies composition changes that violate structural constraints), output quality degrades; the denoising rate (0.3) becomes a critical failure point.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Concave Hull-based masking preserves stroke-level fidelity and enables seamless compositing without spillover artifacts.
- Mechanism: Unlike convex or rectangular masks, the Concave Hull algorithm generates a tight boundary conforming to the actual drawn silhouette. This precise mask: (a) isolates the sketch region for inpainting, (b) preserves contour thickness perception, and (c) allows pixel-level stitching with surrounding canvas regions. The tight boundary prevents diffusion models from generating content outside user-defined regions.
- Core assumption: Tight spatial constraints on generation are necessary for users to perceive their strokes as "theirs" in the final output—critical for co-creative agency.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1] "The sketch region is isolated using a Concave Hull algorithm, which tightly conforms to the user's drawn silhouette, preserving contour thickness and overall shape. This precise masking prevents unintended spillover during generation"
  - [section 1] "By accurately defining the mask boundary, the system enables seamless pixel-level stitching with surrounding regions"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for Concave Hull in generative masking; this appears novel to the paper.
- Break condition: If strokes are highly sparse or disconnected, Concave Hull may produce fragmented masks; blob merging logic (section 3.2) must compensate.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Distributed inference with spatial partitioning enables multi-user, real-time collaboration at ~2-second latency.
- Mechanism: TouchDesigner clients stream stroke data via WebSockets to a central queue server. Multiple GPU workers process jobs in parallel, each handling the full intent-extraction-to-generation pipeline. The shared canvas is spatially tiled, allowing concurrent updates in separate regions without contention. Priority scheduling for interactive tasks maintains median end-to-end latency near two seconds.
- Core assumption: Latency under ~2 seconds is perceived as "real-time" for collaborative drawing; beyond this, the co-creative experience degrades.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the system achieves low-latency, two-stage transformation while supporting multi-user collaboration on shared canvases"
  - [section 3.2] "Telemetry (queue depth, GPU utilization, per-stage latency) is continuously monitored, and priority scheduling is applied to interactive tasks to maintain median end-to-end latency near two seconds"
  - [corpus] Corpus neighbor "Reframer-HRC" demonstrates multi-user co-creative drawing feasibility but with robotic arm integration, not distributed GPU inference.
- Break condition: If users draw in the same spatial tile simultaneously, contention increases; the system relies on spatial separation for concurrency guarantees.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **ControlNet conditioning for structure-preserving diffusion**
  - Why needed here: The system uses ControlNet to enforce alignment between generated output and original stroke structure—understanding how auxiliary conditioning networks modify diffusion sampling is essential for debugging output fidelity.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how ControlNet differs from standard text-conditioning in a diffusion model, and what happens if the conditioning signal is noisy?

- Concept: **Vision-Language Models for semantic extraction from sketches**
  - Why needed here: The system relies on CLIP-based VLM to infer semantic descriptors from rough sketches—understanding the limitations of VLMs on abstract or ambiguous drawings is critical for prompt quality.
  - Quick check question: What types of visual content does CLIP struggle to semantically classify, and how might that affect prompt generation for abstract sketches?

- Concept: **Concave Hull algorithms and alpha shapes**
  - Why needed here: The masking approach uses Concave Hull to tightly bound user strokes—this differs from convex hulls and requires tuning of concavity parameters.
  - Quick check question: How does the choice of concavity threshold affect mask tightness for sparse vs. dense stroke distributions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - TouchDesigner Client -> WebSocket Queue Server -> GPU Workers (parallel) -> Shared Canvas
  - GPU Workers: VLM intent extraction -> VAE encoding -> ControlNet-conditioned diffusion (two-stage KSampler) -> LoRA style adaptation -> Post-processing

- Critical path:
  1. User stroke -> TouchDesigner capture -> WebSocket stream
  2. Queue server assigns to GPU worker
  3. Concave Hull masking + Canny edge extraction
  4. VLM semantic analysis -> prompt generation
  5. VAE encoding -> ControlNet-conditioned two-stage diffusion (denoising=0.3)
  6. LoRA style module application
  7. Seam-aware compositing -> return to TouchDesigner

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Denoising rate (0.3) balances structure preservation vs. detail introduction; higher values risk losing formal intent.
  - Spatial tiling enables concurrency but creates edge cases for cross-tile strokes.
  - Two-stage generation adds latency but improves output quality vs. single-pass.

- Failure signatures:
  - Spillover beyond mask: Check Concave Hull parameters and pixel blending thresholds.
  - Semantic drift (output doesn't match sketch meaning): VLM may misclassify ambiguous strokes; inspect generated prompts.
  - Latency spikes >3s: Check queue depth, GPU utilization; may need worker scaling or tile rebalancing.
  - Cross-user stroke interference: Blob merging logic may be merging unintended strokes; check spatial proximity thresholds.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablate the Concave Hull mask (replace with rectangular bounding box) and measure user perception of stroke preservation in generated output—expect reduced agency ratings.
  2. Vary denoising rate (0.1, 0.3, 0.5) and quantify structure preservation vs. detail quality using edge-aligned metrics (e.g., HFEN) and human preference.
  3. Load test with 4+ concurrent users drawing in adjacent tiles; measure latency distribution and identify contention thresholds where median exceeds 2.5s.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Expanding contextual intent beyond the sketch**: The authors propose extending intent analysis to incorporate social, spatial, and temporal context of the creation process, but current implementation only analyzes the immediate sketch and background.
- **Adaptive models for evolving co-creative relationships**: The paper aims to develop models that learn from repeated interactions to personalize the creative experience, but current system uses static pre-trained components without memory of past sessions.
- **Quantifying creative agency and authorship**: The claimed mitigation of "creative double bind" and increased user agency lacks rigorous comparative studies against text-prompt systems, remaining anecdotal from deployment demonstrations.

## Limitations
- Model specificity gap: Paper specifies architectural components but omits exact model versions, LoRA weights, and diffusion sampling parameters needed for exact reproduction.
- Latency measurement ambiguity: "Median end-to-end latency near two seconds" lacks definition of what constitutes "end-to-end" and how variance is distributed across pipeline stages.
- Multi-user contention handling: Spatial tiling approach assumes minimal cross-tile interaction, but system behavior under heavy concurrent drawing in overlapping regions is not characterized.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The dual-path intent extraction mechanism (formal + contextual) and its integration via ControlNet and VLM is technically sound and well-specified.
- **Medium confidence**: The distributed inference architecture can achieve sub-3-second latency under moderate load, based on the described spatial partitioning and priority scheduling.
- **Low confidence**: The preservation of user agency and perception of co-creation in real-world collaborative settings, as demonstrated in public installations like Graffiti-X, due to lack of detailed user study methodology and metrics.

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation of Concave Hull masking**: Replace with rectangular bounding box and measure user perception of stroke preservation and agency in generated output using a within-subjects design (n=20 participants, 3-point Likert scale for "my strokes are preserved").
2. **Denoising rate sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary denoising strength (0.1, 0.3, 0.5) and quantify structure preservation (HFEN edge alignment) vs. detail quality (LPIPS) across 50 diverse sketch prompts.
3. **Multi-user contention stress test**: Simulate 4+ concurrent users drawing in adjacent spatial tiles; measure latency distribution and identify the tile density threshold where median latency exceeds 2.5 seconds.
