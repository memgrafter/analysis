# Agentic RAG with Knowledge Graphs for Complex Multi-Hop Reasoning in Real-World Applications

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.16507
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16507
- Reference count: 18
- Primary result: Agentic RAG system integrating LLM-based agent with multi-tool architecture for complex multi-hop reasoning in knowledge-intensive domains

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the limitations of conventional RAG systems in handling complex, multi-hop reasoning tasks, especially in knowledge-intensive domains. INRAExplorer is introduced as an agentic RAG system that integrates an LLM-based agent with a multi-tool architecture, enabling dynamic engagement with a comprehensive knowledge graph derived from INRAE publications. The system supports iterative, targeted queries, exhaustive data retrieval, and structured answers by combining knowledge graph querying with hybrid publication search. This approach enables the system to overcome the single-pass, limited-context nature of classical RAG. The system is designed as an open, adaptable solution for advanced knowledge exploration and reasoning in specialized fields.

## Method Summary
The method introduces INRAExplorer, an agentic RAG system that leverages a knowledge graph extracted from INRAE publications and an LLM-based agent capable of orchestrating multiple specialized tools. The architecture combines knowledge graph querying with hybrid publication search to support iterative, multi-hop reasoning over complex queries. The agent dynamically selects tools and formulates targeted sub-queries, enabling structured, comprehensive answers that address information needs beyond the reach of single-pass retrieval methods. The approach is positioned as a flexible framework adaptable to various knowledge-intensive domains.

## Key Results
- Introduces agentic RAG system for complex multi-hop reasoning in specialized domains
- Integrates knowledge graph with LLM-based agent and multi-tool architecture
- Supports iterative, targeted queries and exhaustive data retrieval
- Overcomes single-pass limitations of classical RAG systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism centers on combining a knowledge graph with an LLM-based agent that dynamically selects and orchestrates multiple specialized tools. This architecture allows the system to break down complex queries into manageable sub-queries, leveraging the structured knowledge graph for precision and the agent's reasoning for contextual adaptation. By supporting iterative refinement and targeted retrieval, the system can navigate information gaps and deliver comprehensive, structured answers that classical RAG systems cannot achieve.

## Foundational Learning
- Knowledge graphs in RAG: Enable structured, semantically rich retrieval; needed for precision in multi-hop reasoning; quick check: assess graph coverage and link quality.
- Agent-based tool orchestration: Allows dynamic, context-aware query decomposition; needed for handling complex, multi-step reasoning; quick check: test agent decision accuracy.
- Hybrid search integration: Combines KG querying with vector/document retrieval; needed for exhaustive information coverage; quick check: measure retrieval completeness.
- Iterative query refinement: Supports progressive information gathering; needed to bridge gaps in single-pass systems; quick check: track query iteration depth and success rate.

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: User Query -> LLM Agent -> Tool Selector -> (KG Query Tool / Hybrid Search Tool / Answer Synthesis Tool) -> Response
- Critical path: Query reception → Agent decomposition → Tool selection → Retrieval → Synthesis → Response delivery
- Design tradeoffs: Precision vs. recall (KG vs. vector search), agent autonomy vs. control, system complexity vs. usability
- Failure signatures: Incomplete tool selection, knowledge graph sparsity, agent reasoning errors, retrieval timeouts
- First experiments: 1) Test agent's tool selection accuracy on sample queries, 2) Measure retrieval completeness with and without KG, 3) Evaluate end-to-end response quality on multi-hop reasoning benchmarks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Lack of empirical evaluation metrics or comparative benchmarks
- Dependence on INRAE-specific publications raises domain adaptability concerns
- Insufficient detail on practical challenges such as scalability, maintenance, and error handling

## Confidence
- System architecture feasibility: Medium confidence
- Multi-hop reasoning capability: Low confidence
- Domain adaptability: Low confidence
- Performance improvements over classical RAG: Low confidence

## Next Checks
1. Conduct controlled experiments comparing INRAExplorer's accuracy and efficiency against standard RAG systems on multi-hop reasoning tasks using standardized datasets
2. Implement a pilot deployment in a non-INRAE domain to assess the system's adaptability and identify domain-specific integration challenges
3. Perform comprehensive error analysis and user satisfaction studies to evaluate the system's practical utility and identify failure modes in real-world usage scenarios
