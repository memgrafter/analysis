# $φ^{\infty}$: Clause Purification, Embedding Realignment, and the Total Suppression of the Em Dash in Autoregressive Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2506.18129
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18129
- Reference count: 4
- Key outcome: Clause purification operator φ∞ and embedding realignment suppress em dash-driven semantic drift in autoregressive models.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to mitigate semantic drift in autoregressive language models caused by the em dash token. The authors propose a clause purification operator (φ∞) that recursively removes em dashes from text, combined with an embedding realignment technique that suppresses the token's influence in model parameters. This dual method preserves topic coherence and halts recursive semantic decay without requiring retraining. The work presents a general framework for addressing token-level vulnerabilities in foundation models, linking symbolic identity to fixed-point convergence.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce a clause purification operator φ∞ that recursively removes em dashes from text, preventing clause boundary hallucination. Simultaneously, they apply an embedding realignment technique that suppresses the em dash's influence in the model's parameter space. This dual approach operates without retraining, modifying both input text and internal embeddings to preserve topic coherence and generation consistency. The method is framed as a self-referential semantic invariant, ensuring fixed-point convergence during text generation.

## Key Results
- Clause purification operator φ∞ successfully removes em dashes, halting recursive semantic decay.
- Embedding realignment suppresses em dash influence, improving generation consistency and topic maintenance.
- The dual approach preserves coherence without retraining, demonstrating a general method for mitigating token-level vulnerabilities.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The em dash token entangles embeddings and shifts latent representations, causing semantic drift and clause boundary hallucination. By recursively removing em dashes (clause purification) and suppressing their influence in embeddings (embedding realignment), the model avoids recursive semantic decay. This preserves the integrity of topic coherence during generation. The approach leverages the symbolic identity of text and fixed-point convergence to create a self-referential semantic invariant.

## Foundational Learning
- **Clause Purification Operator (φ∞)**: Recursively removes em dashes from text to prevent semantic drift. Why needed: Em dashes cause clause boundary hallucination. Quick check: Verify removal does not alter intended meaning.
- **Embedding Realignment**: Suppresses em dash influence in model parameters. Why needed: Prevents embedding entanglement and latent representation shifts. Quick check: Measure embedding stability pre- and post-realignment.
- **Autoregressive Language Models**: Generate text sequentially, conditioning on previous tokens. Why needed: Understanding model behavior is key to addressing vulnerabilities. Quick check: Analyze generation sequences for coherence.
- **Semantic Drift**: Gradual loss of topic coherence during generation. Why needed: Core problem addressed by the proposed method. Quick check: Track topic consistency across generated sequences.
- **Fixed-Point Convergence**: Ensures stable, repeatable generation outcomes. Why needed: Underpins the self-referential semantic invariant. Quick check: Test for convergence across multiple generations.
- **Token-Level Vulnerabilities**: Specific tokens that destabilize model behavior. Why needed: Generalizes the solution beyond em dashes. Quick check: Identify other problematic tokens.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Text -> Clause Purification (φ∞) -> Embedding Realignment -> Stable Generation
- **Critical Path**: Clause purification removes problematic tokens; embedding realignment stabilizes latent space; together they ensure coherent generation.
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Clause purification may alter stylistic nuance; embedding realignment requires careful parameter tuning to avoid over-suppression.
- **Failure Signatures**: Residual semantic drift if purification is incomplete; over-suppression leading to bland or repetitive output.
- **First Experiments**:
  1. Apply φ∞ to a diverse text corpus and measure semantic drift reduction.
  2. Implement embedding realignment and test generation consistency across topics.
  3. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of each component.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- Scalability of clause purification operator φ∞ across diverse text domains.
- Stability of embedding realignment for models with varying architectures.
- Generalization of results beyond em dashes to other token-level vulnerabilities.
- Formal proof of symbolic identity and fixed-point convergence claims.

## Limitations
- Scalability of clause purification across diverse text domains is uncertain.
- Stability of embedding realignment for different model architectures not fully validated.
- Claims about general token-level vulnerability mitigation lack formal proof.
- Symbolic identity and fixed-point convergence are supported empirically, not mathematically.

## Confidence
- **High**: Empirical observation that em dashes cause semantic drift and generation inconsistencies.
- **Medium**: Effectiveness of clause purification and embedding realignment within tested model and corpus.
- **Low**: Broader claims about general token-level vulnerability mitigation and formal properties of φ∞ as a semantic invariant.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies removing φ∞ on out-of-domain corpora to test robustness and identify failure modes.
2. Implement formal proofs or rigorous empirical tests to validate symbolic identity and fixed-point convergence claims.
3. Benchmark embedding realignment against established model patching and fine-tuning techniques to quantify relative performance and stability.
