# An Interpretable Neural Control Network with Adaptable Online Learning for Sample Efficient Robot Locomotion Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.10698
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10698
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: SME-AGOL requires 40% fewer samples and achieves 150% higher final reward/locomotion performance compared to state-of-the-art methods

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of sample inefficiency and lack of interpretability in robot locomotion learning using reinforcement learning. The authors propose SME-AGOL, a framework combining an interpretable neural control network called Sequential Motion Executor (SME) with an Adaptable Gradient-weighting Online Learning (AGOL) algorithm. SME generates sequentially propagating hidden states and constructs triangular bases with minimal non-neighbor interference, while AGOL prioritizes updating parameters with high relevance scores. The framework achieves locomotion learning from scratch in just 10 minutes on a physical hexapod robot, requiring 40% fewer samples and achieving 150% higher final reward compared to state-of-the-art methods.

## Method Summary
The SME-AGOL framework addresses sample inefficiency in robot locomotion learning through two key innovations. First, the Sequential Motion Executor (SME) is a three-layer neural network designed for interpretability, generating sequentially propagating hidden states that construct triangular bases with minimal non-neighbor interference. Second, the Adaptable Gradient-weighting Online Learning (AGOL) algorithm prioritizes parameter updates based on relevance scores, allowing the learning process to focus on highly relevant parameters. This combination enables more efficient learning by reducing unnecessary parameter updates while maintaining interpretability through the sequential structure of SME.

## Key Results
- Requires 40% fewer samples compared to state-of-the-art methods
- Achieves 150% higher final reward/locomotion performance on simulated hexapod robot
- Achieves locomotion learning from scratch in just 10 minutes on physical hexapod robot

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The SME-AGOL framework works by combining structured neural architecture with intelligent parameter update prioritization. The Sequential Motion Executor's sequential propagation creates interpretable intermediate states that correspond to meaningful motion primitives, while the triangular basis construction ensures minimal interference between non-neighboring components. The AGOL algorithm's relevance scoring mechanism identifies which parameters contribute most to performance improvements, allowing focused updates that accelerate learning. This dual approach of structural interpretability and adaptive learning prioritization addresses both the sample efficiency and black-box nature problems simultaneously.
