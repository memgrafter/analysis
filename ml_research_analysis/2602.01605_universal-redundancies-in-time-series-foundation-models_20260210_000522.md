# Universal Redundancies in Time Series Foundation Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2602.01605
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01605
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Middle layers of TSFM architectures show high redundancy, enabling effective component pruning while maintaining performance

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates component redundancy in transformer-based time series foundation models (TSFMs) and develops an intrinsic head-pruning strategy based on kernel-based theoretical analysis. The authors demonstrate that middle layers of leading TSFMs exhibit significant redundancy, allowing for substantial ablation of attention heads and MLPs without major performance degradation. Through extensive experiments on GIFT-Eval and chaotic ODE benchmarks, they show that removing 28% of heads and 2 MLPs results in only a 6% performance loss, while identifying specific attention heads responsible for common failure modes like context parroting and seasonality bias.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a kernel-based theoretical framework to analyze TSFM architectures, focusing on the stable rank of query-key projection matrices as a measure of head importance. They introduce an intrinsic pruning strategy that leverages this framework to identify and remove redundant components systematically. The method involves computing the stable rank for each attention head across all layers, then removing heads with the lowest stable rank values. Experiments are conducted on three TSFM architectures (PatchTST, TimesFM, and Pyraformer) with model sizes ranging from 1.8M to 12.9M parameters, using the GIFT-Eval benchmark suite and chaotic ODE time series datasets.

## Key Results
- Removing 28% of attention heads and 2 MLPs results in only 6% performance degradation
- Middle layers show higher redundancy than other layers across all tested TSFM architectures
- Sharp attention heads are critical for forecasting performance, while diffuse heads can be pruned
- Specific heads identified as responsible for context parroting and seasonality bias failures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study's findings are rooted in the intrinsic redundancy of transformer attention mechanisms in time series contexts. The kernel-based framework reveals that many attention heads learn similar functions, particularly in middle layers where temporal dependencies are less critical. The stable rank of query-key projection matrices serves as an effective proxy for head importance, capturing the effective dimensionality of learned representations. This intrinsic property allows for systematic identification of redundant components without requiring task-specific fine-tuning or retraining.

## Foundational Learning

**Stable Rank**: Measures effective dimensionality of linear operators; needed to quantify head importance beyond simple parameter counts; quick check: compute for random matrices to verify expected behavior

**Attention Head Types**: Sharp vs diffuse heads; needed to understand different roles in temporal modeling; quick check: visualize attention weight distributions

**Kernel Methods**: Theoretical framework for analyzing transformer components; needed to provide principled pruning criteria; quick check: verify kernel alignment with empirical performance

**Time Series Forecasting**: Sequential prediction tasks with temporal dependencies; needed to contextualize TSFM evaluation; quick check: compare naive vs learned baselines

**Component Redundancy**: Statistical overlap in learned representations; needed to justify pruning without retraining; quick check: measure correlation between head outputs

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input -> Positional Encoding -> Multi-Head Attention -> Feed-Forward Network -> Output Prediction; Feed-Forward Network -> Layer Norm -> Residual Connection -> Next Layer

**Critical Path**: Query-Key-Value computation -> Attention weight calculation -> Value aggregation -> Feed-forward transformation -> Output projection

**Design Tradeoffs**: Model size vs performance, computational efficiency vs accuracy, interpretability vs black-box complexity

**Failure Signatures**: Context parroting (repeating past patterns), seasonality bias (overfitting to periodic patterns), sharp head degradation (loss of forecasting ability)

**First Experiments**: 1) Compute stable rank distribution across all heads; 2) Perform layer-wise ablation studies; 3) Identify sharp vs diffuse head characteristics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations

- Findings based on relatively small TSFM architectures (1.8M-12.9M parameters), limiting generalizability to larger models
- Limited evaluation across diverse real-world time series domains and data distributions
- Correlation-based identification of sharp vs diffuse heads lacks causal evidence for their roles
- Potential negative impacts on model robustness and out-of-distribution generalization not explored

## Confidence

**Major Claim Confidence:**
- **High confidence**: Empirical observation of middle layer redundancy across multiple TSFM architectures
- **Medium confidence**: Effectiveness of stable rank-based intrinsic pruning strategy
- **Medium confidence**: Identification of specific heads responsible for failure modes
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability to larger TSFM architectures and diverse applications

## Next Checks

1. Test stable rank-based pruning strategy on larger TSFM architectures (100M+ parameters) to assess scalability
2. Evaluate pruned models across diverse real-world time series datasets with varying statistical properties
3. Conduct ablation studies to determine minimum components required for maintaining performance across different forecasting horizons
