# Leveraging AI Agents for Autonomous Networks: A Reference Architecture and Empirical Studies

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2509.08312
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08312
- Reference count: 17
- Primary result: Sub-10ms real-time RAN link adaptation with 4% throughput gain and 85% BLER reduction

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a reference architecture for Level 4 autonomous networks based on AI agents, bridging theoretical frameworks with practical implementation. The architecture employs coordinated proactive and reactive runtimes driven by hybrid knowledge representation. A key empirical case study of a Radio Access Network (RAN) Link Adaptation Agent demonstrates the architecture's effectiveness, achieving sub-10 ms real-time control in 5G NR sub-6 GHz environments. The agent delivers 4% higher downlink throughput than Outer Loop Link Adaptation algorithms for enhanced mobile broadband and reduces Block Error Rate by 85% for ultra-reliable services through dynamic Modulation and Coding Scheme optimization.

## Method Summary
The architecture centers on a dual-runtime system coordinating reactive safety rules with proactive learning-based optimization. For RAN link adaptation, a Dueling QR-DQN selects Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) indices 0-27 based on 61-dimensional state vectors including SINR, CQI, BLER, throughput, and LSTM-predicted channel trends. A 2-layer Bi-LSTM predicts next-5-TTI BLER from 100-TTI history windows, while RAG-guided action masking retrieves similar historical scenarios to constrain safe exploration. The system operates within 10ms latency budgets using edge deployment, with structured 3GPP rules in Neo4j and unstructured embeddings in FAISS forming unified long-term memory.

## Key Results
- Sub-10 ms real-time control achieved in 5G NR sub-6 GHz environments
- 4% higher downlink throughput than Outer Loop Link Adaptation for eMBB
- 85% BLER reduction for URLLC services through dynamic MCS optimization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Dual-Runtime Coordination (Proactive + Reactive)
- Claim: Coordinating proactive deliberation with reactive reflex enables L4 autonomy without sacrificing real-time safety
- Mechanism: The Workflow Coordinator Runtime sequences two subsystems—reactive executes hard-coded safety rules bypassing neural networks (<2ms), while proactive performs predictive optimization via LSTM→RAG→DQN pipelines (1.2–2.8ms). Both share a unified Long-Term Memory but operate on different timescales
- Core assumption: Safety-critical responses can be adequately captured by rule-based systems while learning-based approaches handle optimization
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "deploying coordinated proactive-reactive runtimes driven by hybrid knowledge representation"; [section III.A] "Runtime systems act as meta-coordination layers that dynamically sequence modules via state-machine logic"

### Mechanism 2: LSTM-Based Predictive Lookahead
- Claim: Short-term trend prediction enables proactive MCS adjustment before channel degradation causes packet loss
- Mechanism: A 2-layer Bi-LSTM (128 hidden units) ingests 100 TTI windows and predicts BLER for next 5 TTIs. This look-ahead allows the DQN to select conservative MCS proactively rather than reactively adjusting after NACK feedback
- Core assumption: Historical channel patterns generalize to near-future states within 5-TTI horizon
- Evidence anchors: [section IV.B] "This look-ahead capability allows the agent to preemptively adjust MCS before channel degradation causes packet loss"; [section IV.C, Table I] Ablation shows removing LSTM drops performance below OLLA baseline

### Mechanism 3: RAG-Guided Action Masking
- Claim: Retrieving similar historical scenarios constrains DQN exploration to safe MCS ranges, accelerating convergence
- Mechanism: A lightweight MLP encoder embeds current channel state; FAISS retrieves top-5 nearest-neighbor historical scenarios. RAG-recommended MCS+2 defines the maximum allowable action, preventing unsafe exploration while preserving optimization flexibility
- Core assumption: Embedding similarity correlates with action appropriateness across channel conditions
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "hybrid knowledge representation"; [section IV.B] "RAG-guided masking restricts valid actions to a maximum of the RAG-recommended MCS+2"

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Dueling QR-DQN (Distributional RL)**
  - Why needed here: Standard DQN estimates scalar Q-values; QR-DQN models value distributions, critical for balancing throughput vs. BLER trade-offs under uncertainty
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why distributional value estimates help when reward signals are sparse and delayed (e.g., BLER measured over many TTIs)?

- **Concept: Bi-directional LSTM for Time-Series Forecasting**
  - Why needed here: The agent must predict future channel degradation from historical telemetry; Bi-LSTM captures both past and future context within the input window
  - Quick check question: Given a sequence of 100 SINR measurements, how would a Bi-LSTM's output differ from a forward-only LSTM for 5-step-ahead prediction?

- **Concept: RAG with Hybrid Knowledge (Graph + Vector)**
  - Why needed here: Structured 3GPP constraints (Neo4j) must combine with unstructured operational embeddings (FAISS) for both protocol compliance and adaptive retrieval
  - Quick check question: How would you handle a query where graph-based constraints conflict with vector-retrieved historical actions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Sensors → Kalman filter → LSTM predictor → RAG retriever → DQN selector → Rule engine → Action executor

- **Critical path:**
  1. Sensor ingest (SINR, CQI, ACK-NACK) → Kalman filter
  2. LSTM predicts next-5-TTI BLER trend
  3. RAG retrieves top-5 similar scenarios, masks DQN action space
  4. DQN selects MCS index (constrained to MCS ≤ RAG_recommendation+2)
  5. Rule engine validates safety (e.g., mandatory MCS reduction if BLER>0.1%)
  6. Action command to BBU

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Edge (Near-RT RIC) vs. Cloud (Non-RT RIC): Short Proactive Flow must complete <10ms on BBU; Full Proactive Flow (LLM) runs asynchronously in cloud
  - LSTM complexity vs. latency: 2-layer Bi-LSTM with 128 units fits 1.2–2.8ms budget; deeper models risk timeout
  - RAG precision vs. coverage: Top-5 neighbors balance guidance quality with retrieval latency

- **Failure signatures:**
  - LSTM prediction drift: BLER spikes despite stable SINR → check prediction vs. actual BLER divergence
  - RAG retrieval mismatch: Sudden throughput drop → verify embedding quality; nearest neighbors may be from dissimilar channel conditions
  - Rule engine conflict: MCS oscillation → safety rules may fight DQN policy; review constraint thresholds
  - Intent translation error: Unexpected behavior after user directive → LLM may misinterpret natural language; validate reward weight JSON output

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce ablation baseline: Deploy agent without LSTM, measure throughput vs. OLLA to validate that performance drops below baseline
  2. Latency budget validation: Instrument each module (Kalman, LSTM, RAG, DQN, rule engine) to verify sub-10ms end-to-end under peak load
  3. RAG retrieval quality audit: For 100 random channel states, manually inspect top-5 retrieved neighbors—verify embedding similarity correlates with MCS appropriateness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can timing-constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and ontology-guided LLM reasoning be integrated into the decision-making loop without violating the sub-10 ms latency budget?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion explicitly lists "timing-constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), ontology-guided LLM reasoning" as targets for future extensions
- Why unresolved: The current implementation relies on a Dueling QR-DQN and rule engine to meet strict timing, whereas MCTS and LLMs typically introduce significant computational overhead
- What evidence would resolve it: Latency benchmarks showing inference times remain under 10ms when these advanced reasoning modules are active

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the proposed Knowledge-Driven Negotiation Mechanism effectively scale the architecture from a single RAN agent to a collaborative "Society of Agents"?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper outlines a future direction toward a "Society of Agents" where shared telecom ontologies facilitate cross-domain negotiation
- Why unresolved: The empirical validation is limited to a single Link Adaptation Agent; multi-agent coordination and semantic alignment remain untested
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies demonstrating successful intent decomposition and conflict resolution between distinct RAN and Core Network agents

### Open Question 3
- Question: How robust is the agent's performance in high-mobility or millimeter-wave (mmWave) environments compared to the stable sub-6 GHz lab conditions tested?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The problem modeling section highlights high-mobility and mmWave as critical challenges for traditional OLLA, but the experimental validation is restricted to a controlled lab with stable channel conditions
- Why unresolved: The controlled environment (±1 dB RSRP variation) does not replicate the severe Doppler shifts or blocking issues inherent in the highlighted challenging scenarios
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative throughput and BLER results from field trials conducted in high-speed mobility or mmWave bands

## Limitations
- The LSTM-based predictive model's generalization performance beyond the 5-TTI horizon remains unclear for rapidly changing channel dynamics
- RAG-guided action masking effectiveness depends heavily on embedding quality and retrieval relevance, with limited validation across diverse conditions
- Scalability to other frequency bands (mmWave) or deployment scenarios (macro vs. small cells) is not established beyond the controlled 5G NR sub-6 GHz environment

## Confidence
- **High**: Dual-runtime coordination mechanism and its role in achieving real-time safety and optimization is well-supported by ablation study and timing measurements
- **Medium**: LSTM-based predictive lookahead's contribution to performance gains is validated through ablation, but specific architectural choices lack detailed justification
- **Medium**: RAG-guided action masking's impact on convergence speed and performance is demonstrated, but embedding methodology and retrieval quality metrics are underspecified

## Next Checks
1. Extended Channel Dynamics Testing: Evaluate agent performance across broader channel conditions including rapid fading, interference scenarios, and multi-path propagation to stress-test LSTM prediction accuracy and RAG retrieval relevance
2. Real-World Deployment Validation: Deploy architecture in operational 5G networks with heterogeneous deployment scenarios (urban, rural, indoor) to validate scalability and robustness beyond controlled simulation
3. Safety Boundary Stress Testing: Systematically probe rule-based reactive layer's coverage by introducing novel failure modes and corner cases to verify safety-critical responses without neural network intervention
