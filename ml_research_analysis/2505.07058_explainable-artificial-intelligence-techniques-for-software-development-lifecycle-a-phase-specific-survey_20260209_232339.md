# Explainable Artificial Intelligence Techniques for Software Development Lifecycle: A Phase-specific Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2505.07058
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07058
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: 68% of XAI research in software engineering focuses on maintenance, while only 8% addresses requirements and management phases

## Executive Summary
This survey provides the first comprehensive mapping of explainable AI (XAI) techniques to specific phases of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). The authors identify a significant imbalance in current research, with the majority of XAI studies concentrated in maintenance phases while early development stages remain underserved. By categorizing techniques like LIME, SHAP, counterfactual explanations, rule extraction, attention mechanisms, and concept-based explanations according to their applicability to requirements elicitation, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance, the survey offers a practical framework for integrating explainability into all stages of software development. The work emphasizes the need for standardized evaluation metrics and deeper integration of XAI into earlier development stages to build more trustworthy and responsible AI-powered software engineering tools.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted a systematic literature review across six databases (IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Science Direct, Wiley, Google Scholar, Scopus) using keywords related to XAI and software engineering. They included peer-reviewed articles from the past six years that addressed XAI applications in software engineering contexts. The review combined systematic screening with narrative synthesis to categorize identified techniques by SDLC phase and analyze research distribution patterns. The methodology revealed the concentration of XAI research in maintenance phases and identified gaps in requirements and management phase coverage.

## Key Results
- 68% of existing XAI research in software engineering focuses on maintenance phases, while only 8% addresses requirements and management phases
- SHAP and LIME techniques can reveal latent requirements by identifying influential features in user satisfaction predictions
- Counterfactual explanations can clarify design trade-offs by showing how minimal input changes affect architectural recommendations
- Rule extraction can produce human-readable IF-THEN logic that reveals decision factors in design recommendations
- Attention mechanisms can highlight code regions that most influence bug prediction models during maintenance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: If feature attribution techniques (LIME/SHAP) are applied to AI outputs in requirements elicitation, they may reveal latent requirements by identifying which input features most influence user satisfaction or task completion predictions.
- Mechanism: Post-hoc model-agnostic methods approximate complex models locally with simpler interpretable models. By perturbing input features and observing prediction changes, they assign importance weights to features—features with consistently high SHAP values indicate significance even when unstated by users.
- Core assumption: Stakeholder behavior and interaction data contain implicit preference signals that correlate with actual requirements; the model has learned these patterns accurately.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "SHAP can reveal feature contributions in requirements elicitation"
  - [section V.A.3] "If a feature repeatedly has a high SHAP value for positive predictions... it indicates that this feature is significant to users, even if they did not include it as a requirement"
  - [corpus] Weak direct evidence—neighbor papers address XAI in food science and general learning contexts, not SDLC requirements elicitation specifically
- Break condition: If training data lacks behavioral diversity or model is miscalibrated, feature importance scores may highlight spurious correlations rather than genuine latent requirements.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: When counterfactual explanations clarify how minimal input changes affect outputs, stakeholders can better understand system sensitivity and identify design trade-offs during architecture selection.
- Mechanism: Counterfactual methods generate "what-if" scenarios by finding the smallest feature modification that would alter the prediction. This directly maps to trade-off analysis—showing that prioritizing scalability yields microservices, while prioritizing performance yields monolithic architecture.
- Core assumption: The relationship between input constraints and output recommendations is learnable and can be approximated through perturbation-based search; stakeholders can interpret counterfactuals correctly.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "counterfactuals clarify trade-offs in design and testing"
  - [section V.B.3] "If high performance was prioritized instead [of scalability], a monolithic architecture might have been recommended"
  - [corpus] Mersha et al. (2024, cited in paper) discuss counterfactuals for justification—neighbor corpus lacks direct SDLC application evidence
- Break condition: If multiple counterfactuals exist with similar distances but different implications, users may receive conflicting guidance without a principled selection mechanism.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: If rule extraction is applied to decision-tree or random-forest models making design recommendations, it produces human-readable IF-THEN logic that directly reveals trade-off factors.
- Mechanism: Rule extraction techniques decompose ensemble or neural models into conjunctive rules. Each rule represents a decision path—making the model's reasoning explicit and auditable without requiring statistical interpretation.
- Core assumption: The underlying model's decision boundaries can be adequately approximated by rule sets without excessive complexity; the number of generated rules remains cognitively manageable.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section V.B.3] "IF requirement_scalability = HIGH AND requirement_maintainability = MEDIUM THEN architecture = MICROSERVICES"
  - [section II.B.4] "The aim is to create a simplified but interpretable model for the decision process"
  - [corpus] Bologna (2021, cited as [6]) demonstrates rule extraction on neural ensembles—no direct SDLC validation in corpus neighbors
- Break condition: If the original model is highly non-linear with complex feature interactions, extracted rules may become numerous and fragmented, reducing interpretability.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: **Black-box problem in AI**
  - Why needed here: The entire paper frames XAI as a response to models that "make decisions without providing clear explanations." Understanding what makes a model opaque (depth, non-linearity, scale) is prerequisite to selecting appropriate XAI techniques.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why a 50-layer transformer is harder to interpret than a logistic regression?

- Concept: **Local vs. global explanations**
  - Why needed here: The paper classifies techniques by scope—LIME/SHAP provide local (per-instance) explanations while rule extraction provides global (model-wide) logic. Matching scope to SDLC phase requirements is critical.
  - Quick check question: If you need to explain why *this specific* code suggestion was made vs. how the code generator works *in general*, which scope do you need?

- Concept: **Post-hoc vs. ante-hoc explainability**
  - Why needed here: Most techniques discussed (LIME, SHAP, counterfactuals) are post-hoc—they explain after prediction. Knowing when to use interpretable-by-design models vs. post-hoc explanation methods affects architecture choices.
  - Quick check question: You're deploying a bug prediction model tomorrow. Is it too late to use ante-hoc methods?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  ```
  SDLC Phase          → Primary XAI Technique        → Output Format
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Requirements        → SHAP/LIME                    → Feature importance scores
  Design              → Counterfactuals, Rule Extract → IF-THEN rules, what-if scenarios
  Development         → LIME/SHAP, Example-based     → Code attribution, similar snippets
  Testing             → LIME/SHAP, Counterfactuals   → Failure feature attribution
  Deployment/Monitor  → LIME/SHAP, Counterfactuals   → Anomaly factor breakdown
  Maintenance         → Attention, SHAP, Counterfactuals → Code region highlighting
  ```

- Critical path:
  1. Identify which SDLC phase your AI tool operates in
  2. Determine if the model is model-agnostic applicable (most are) or requires model-specific methods (e.g., attention for transformers)
  3. Match explanation scope (local for debugging specific outputs; global for system auditing)
  4. Select 1-2 techniques and implement pilot on single high-value use case
  5. Validate with domain experts before broad rollout

- Design tradeoffs:
  - **SHAP vs. LIME**: SHAP has stronger theoretical guarantees (Shapley values) but higher computational cost; LIME is faster but may produce inconsistent explanations across similar instances
  - **Post-hoc vs. integrated**: Post-hoc techniques work with any model but may be incomplete; integrated methods (attention) are more faithful but lock you into specific architectures
  - **Automation vs. interpretability**: Fully automated rule extraction can produce hundreds of rules; curated rule sets are more usable but require human effort

- Failure signatures:
  - Explanations contradict domain expert intuition (model may be learning spurious patterns)
  - SHAP/LIME explanations change dramatically for nearly identical inputs (instability indicates unreliable local approximations)
  - Counterfactuals suggest impossible changes (e.g., "reduce age by 20 years")—constraint handling is missing
  - Rule extraction produces more rules than training examples (overfitting, no compression benefit)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. **Requirements phase pilot**: Apply SHAP to an existing user behavior model; present top-5 feature contributions to product managers. Measure: Can they identify at least one latent requirement they hadn't documented?
  2. **Design recommendation counterfactuals**: For an architecture suggestion tool, generate 3 counterfactuals per recommendation showing what constraint changes would yield alternative architectures. Measure: Do architects report better understanding of trade-offs?
  3. **Code completion attribution**: Implement LIME on a code completion model; highlight which context tokens most influenced the suggestion. Measure: Developer accuracy in predicting whether a suggestion is correct before seeing it.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can XAI techniques be effectively integrated and optimized specifically for Agile and DevOps development paradigms?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Conclusion states, "Future research needs to explore the optimal application of the tested and realized XAI approaches in agile and DevOps focused development paradigms."
- **Why unresolved:** Current XAI research focuses on distinct SDLC phases (like maintenance) rather than the continuous, iterative workflows characteristic of Agile and DevOps environments.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Empirical studies or frameworks demonstrating XAI tools that function effectively within continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines without disrupting rapid iteration cycles.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What standardized evaluation metrics and benchmarking structures are required to fairly compare XAI effectiveness across different Software Engineering phases?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The Discussion identifies the "lack of standardized evaluation metrics" and the Conclusion calls for "benchmarking structures that enable fair comparison among XAI approaches."
- **Why unresolved:** Inconsistent evaluation methods currently make it challenging to compare studies and techniques across different phases, such as maintenance versus requirements.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A universally accepted set of metrics or benchmark datasets that can be applied uniformly to assess explanation quality in requirements elicitation, coding, and testing.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can technical XAI outputs be translated into formats that are actionable and interpretable for non-technical software stakeholders?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The Discussion notes that "Most XAI methods provide technical explanations that humans cannot easily interpret," which hinders the development of maintainable systems.
- **Why unresolved:** Current techniques often output numeric weights or complex rules that fail to bridge the semantic gap for diverse stakeholders (e.g., managers, clients) involved in the early phases of development.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Development of user-centric explanation interfaces or translation layers that improve task completion rates and trust scores in user studies involving non-expert stakeholders.

## Limitations

- Quantitative claims about research distribution lack transparent methodology details for literature screening and categorization
- Phase-specific effectiveness of techniques remains largely theoretical with minimal empirical validation from actual SDLC implementations
- Critical gaps exist in standardized evaluation metrics for XAI effectiveness in software engineering contexts
- Most technique descriptions are derived from general XAI literature rather than SDLC-specific studies

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The existence of research distribution imbalance (maintenance-focused vs. early-phase research) and the identification of XAI techniques (LIME, SHAP, counterfactuals, rule extraction, attention) are well-supported by the literature review
- **Medium confidence**: Phase-specific technique recommendations are logically sound but lack empirical validation in SDLC contexts
- **Low confidence**: Quantitative claims about technique effectiveness in specific SDLC phases, as these are primarily theoretical mappings without experimental validation

## Next Checks

1. Conduct empirical studies applying SHAP to user behavior models in requirements elicitation, measuring whether identified latent requirements align with subsequent stakeholder discoveries
2. Implement counterfactual explanations in architecture recommendation tools and evaluate whether architects demonstrate improved trade-off understanding compared to baseline explanations
3. Develop standardized evaluation frameworks for XAI effectiveness in software engineering, incorporating both technical metrics (explanation stability, fidelity) and domain-specific measures (developer productivity, requirement accuracy)
