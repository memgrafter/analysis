# In-Context and Few-Shots Learning for Forecasting Time Series Data based on Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2512.07705
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07705
- **Reference count**: 37
- **Primary result**: TimesFM foundation model achieved best performance (RMSE 0.3023, MAE 0.2127) on SWaT dataset in 266 seconds

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates Large Language Models (LLMs) and foundation models for time series forecasting using in-context learning approaches. The research compares OpenAI o4-mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite, TimesFM, TCN, and LSTM models on the SWaT dataset. Results demonstrate that pretrained time series foundation models significantly outperform conventional deep learning approaches, with TimesFM achieving superior accuracy metrics while requiring minimal adaptation. The findings suggest foundation models offer advantages in both accuracy and efficiency for time series forecasting tasks.

## Method Summary
The study employs in-context learning and few-shot learning methodologies to evaluate multiple models on the SWaT dataset. The experimental setup includes OpenAI o4-mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite, TimesFM foundation model, TCN, and LSTM architectures. Performance evaluation uses RMSE and MAE metrics, with TimesFM demonstrating superior results. The methodology specifically compares foundation models against traditional deep learning approaches to assess their effectiveness for time series forecasting tasks. Assumption: The SWaT dataset represents typical time series forecasting scenarios.

## Key Results
- TimesFM foundation model achieved best performance with RMSE of 0.3023 and MAE of 0.2127 in 266 seconds
- OpenAI o4-mini performed well in zero-shot learning with RMSE of 0.3310 and MAE of 0.2098
- Traditional deep learning models (LSTM, TCN) and Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite showed significantly lower accuracy compared to foundation models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Foundation models like TimesFM achieve superior performance through their pretraining on diverse time series datasets, enabling them to capture underlying temporal patterns and relationships without requiring extensive task-specific training. The in-context learning approach allows these models to adapt to new forecasting tasks by leveraging their general understanding of time series dynamics. TimesFM's architecture, specifically designed for time series data, provides better feature extraction and pattern recognition capabilities compared to general-purpose LLMs or traditional deep learning models.

## Foundational Learning
TimesFM's foundation model leverages pretraining on large-scale time series datasets to develop general temporal understanding. This pretraining enables the model to recognize common patterns, seasonality, and temporal dependencies across different domains. The foundation learning allows TimesFM to perform well on the SWaT dataset with minimal fine-tuning, demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer learning from diverse time series contexts. Assumption: Pretraining data encompasses representative time series patterns relevant to the SWaT domain.

## Architecture Onboarding
The TimesFM foundation model architecture incorporates specialized components for time series processing, including temporal attention mechanisms and sequence-aware embeddings. These architectural choices enable efficient handling of sequential dependencies and temporal relationships in the data. The model's design facilitates in-context learning by maintaining temporal coherence across input sequences while allowing flexible adaptation to new forecasting tasks. The architecture supports efficient inference with reasonable computational requirements compared to traditional deep learning approaches.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper identifies several key open questions including the scalability of foundation models across diverse time series domains, the optimal balance between model size and forecasting accuracy, and the generalization capabilities beyond the SWaT dataset. Additional questions remain about the computational efficiency trade-offs in real-world deployment scenarios and the potential for foundation models to handle multi-variate time series forecasting tasks. The paper also raises questions about the robustness of foundation models to data distribution shifts and their ability to incorporate domain-specific constraints.

## Limitations
- Study uses single dataset (SWaT), limiting generalizability to other time series domains
- Performance metrics don't capture computational resource trade-offs across deployment scenarios
- Absence of ablation studies prevents isolation of components driving foundation model performance advantages
- Limited exploration of multi-variate time series forecasting capabilities
- Lack of analysis regarding model robustness to data distribution shifts

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: TimesFM achieving superior accuracy metrics (RMSE 0.3023, MAE 0.2127) on tested dataset
- **Medium confidence**: General claims about foundation models' advantages in minimal adaptation and superior accuracy across diverse tasks
- **Low confidence**: Extrapolation of results to time series domains beyond industrial control systems

## Next Checks
1. Test same model comparison across multiple diverse time series datasets spanning different domains (financial, environmental, medical)
2. Conduct computational resource profiling including memory usage, training/inference time scaling, and energy consumption
3. Implement ablation experiments varying context window sizes, prompt structures, and few-shot examples to determine optimal configuration parameters
