# Input Resolution Downsizing as a Compression Technique for Vision Deep Learning Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2504.03749
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03749
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Input resolution scaling achieves up to 28% reduction in FLOPs for ViTs while maintaining competitive accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper explores input resolution downsizing as a model compression technique for vision deep learning systems. The authors propose methods to scale input resolution at different stages in both convolutional neural networks (ResNets) and vision transformers (ViTs), enabling significant reductions in computational cost and memory usage. By modifying training procedures and model architectures, they demonstrate that carefully chosen input resolution reductions can maintain competitive performance while substantially decreasing resource requirements.

## Method Summary
The authors develop two complementary approaches for resolution scaling in different architectures. For ResNets, they modify random crop sizes during training and apply resolution scaling after the first convolution layer. For ViTs, they adjust the number of tokens and explore the relationship between patch size and sequence length. The methods enable progressive reduction of input resolution while maintaining model accuracy through architectural adaptations that compensate for the loss of spatial information.

## Key Results
- Input resolution scaling achieves competitive performance with up to 28% reduction in FLOPs for ViTs
- For semantic segmentation tasks, resolution scaling achieves up to 24% reduction in both memory and FLOPs
- The technique outperforms traditional model scaling approaches on ImageNet and Cityscapes datasets
- Resolution scaling is complementary to quantization, further enhancing compression capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of input resolution scaling stems from the observation that deep learning models often have significant redundancy in their ability to process high-resolution inputs. By carefully reducing input resolution while adapting the model architecture accordingly, computational efficiency can be dramatically improved without proportional loss in accuracy. The key insight is that the relationship between input resolution and model capacity can be optimized rather than simply scaling both together.

## Foundational Learning

**Convolutional Neural Networks** - Why needed: Understanding standard vision architectures is crucial for implementing resolution scaling modifications. Quick check: Can you explain the role of convolution layers and pooling operations in feature extraction?

**Vision Transformers** - Why needed: ViTs process images as sequences of patches, making them particularly amenable to resolution scaling. Quick check: How does changing patch size affect the sequence length and computational requirements?

**FLOPs Calculation** - Why needed: Measuring computational cost requires understanding floating point operations. Quick check: Can you calculate FLOPs for a basic convolution layer given input/output dimensions and kernel size?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Image -> Preprocessing -> Backbone (ResNet/ViT) -> Classification/Segmentation Head

**Critical Path**: Input resolution directly affects early feature extraction stages, which cascade through the entire model. Resolution scaling must be implemented at the correct architectural points to maintain feature hierarchy.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Higher compression ratios provide greater computational savings but may degrade accuracy. The optimal balance depends on the specific task requirements and acceptable performance thresholds.

**Failure Signatures**: Excessive resolution reduction can lead to loss of fine-grained details crucial for certain tasks. Models may fail on small object detection or precise boundary delineation when compressed too aggressively.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test baseline ResNet/ViT performance on ImageNet with standard input resolution
2. Implement progressive resolution scaling in the first convolution layer only
3. Compare accuracy-FLOP trade-offs across different compression ratios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions for future research. The focus is primarily on demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed resolution scaling technique rather than identifying limitations or future directions.

## Limitations

- Experimental validation is limited to ResNet and ViT architectures on ImageNet and Cityscapes datasets
- Potential accuracy degradation at extreme compression levels is not extensively explored
- The complementary effects with quantization are mentioned but not thoroughly quantified across different compression ratios

## Confidence

**Major Claims Confidence:**
- Input resolution scaling effectiveness: High confidence based on strong experimental results across multiple architectures
- Memory and FLOP reductions: High confidence with measured improvements of up to 28% for ViTs
- Complementary relationship with quantization: Medium confidence due to limited experimental exploration
- Generalizability across vision tasks: Low confidence given narrow experimental scope

## Next Checks

1. Test resolution scaling on diverse vision tasks beyond classification (detection, segmentation, 3D vision) to assess generalizability
2. Evaluate performance degradation patterns at different compression levels to establish practical limits
3. Conduct extensive ablation studies on different compression combinations (resolution scaling + quantization + other techniques) to optimize the overall compression pipeline
