## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CS-SHAP, an innovative approach that extends SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to the cyclic-spectral domain for improved interpretability in intelligent fault diagnosis (IFD). The method addresses a critical limitation in existing interpretability approaches that focus on single frequency perspectives by deriving a cyclic-spectral transform that preprocesses vibration signals, enabling attribution analysis that simultaneously reveals both carrier and modulation frequencies. This dual-frequency representation provides clearer, more accurate explanations that align better with fault mechanisms, particularly for distinguishing closely spaced fault components and maintaining robustness under high noise conditions.

The proposed CS-SHAP demonstrates exceptional performance across three validation datasets: simulation, CWRU bearing, and a private helical gearbox dataset. The method achieves a test accuracy of 99.98% on the simulation dataset and perfect 100% accuracy on both the CWRU and private gearbox datasets. These results establish CS-SHAP as a promising benchmark for post-hoc interpretability in intelligent fault diagnosis, offering significant advantages over traditional methods that operate solely in the time or frequency domains.

## Method Summary
CS-SHAP extends the SHAP framework by incorporating cyclic-spectral transforms into the preprocessing pipeline for vibration signals. The core innovation involves transforming time-domain vibration signals into the cyclic-spectral domain before applying SHAP attribution analysis. This transformation captures both carrier frequencies (fundamental rotation frequencies) and modulation frequencies (fault-related sidebands) simultaneously, providing a richer representation of the fault characteristics. The cyclic-spectral transform is particularly effective at revealing periodicities and modulations that are often obscured in traditional spectral analysis, making it especially suitable for diagnosing faults in rotating machinery where both types of frequencies carry diagnostic information.

## Key Results
- Achieves 99.98% test accuracy on simulation dataset with synthetic fault signatures
- Perfect 100% accuracy on both CWRU bearing dataset and private helical gearbox dataset
- Demonstrates superior performance in distinguishing close fault components compared to single-frequency methods
- Maintains robustness under high noise conditions where traditional methods struggle

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CS-SHAP works by leveraging the cyclic-spectral transform's ability to simultaneously capture carrier and modulation frequencies, which are both critical for fault diagnosis in rotating machinery. Traditional SHAP applied to time or frequency domain signals can only attribute importance to either the fundamental frequencies or the modulation components, but not both in an integrated manner. The cyclic-spectral representation naturally encodes the relationship between these frequencies, allowing CS-SHAP to attribute importance to the complete fault signature. This dual-perspective approach aligns with the physical mechanisms of fault generation in rotating machinery, where faults create modulations around carrier frequencies that are diagnostic of specific fault types and severities.

## Foundational Learning
**Cyclic Spectral Analysis** - A signal processing technique that reveals periodicities in the frequency domain by computing correlations at different spectral frequencies. *Why needed:* Rotating machinery faults manifest as modulations around fundamental frequencies, requiring analysis beyond standard Fourier transforms. *Quick check:* Verify that the cyclic spectrum shows peaks at fault-related cyclic frequencies in known fault cases.

**SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** - A game-theoretic approach to explain individual predictions of any machine learning model by computing feature attribution values based on Shapley values. *Why needed:* Provides mathematically grounded attribution scores that fairly distribute prediction credit among input features. *Quick check:* Confirm that SHAP values sum to the difference between model prediction and baseline.

**Vibration Signal Processing for Fault Diagnosis** - The domain-specific application of signal processing techniques to extract fault signatures from mechanical vibration data. *Why needed:* Fault characteristics in rotating machinery appear as specific patterns in vibration signals that must be properly extracted and interpreted. *Quick check:* Validate that extracted features correlate with known fault types and severities.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Raw Vibration Signals -> Cyclic-Spectral Transform -> SHAP Attribution Analysis -> Interpretable Fault Explanation

**Critical Path:** The cyclic-spectral transform is the critical component that enables the method's effectiveness. It must accurately compute the cyclic spectrum while preserving the relationship between carrier and modulation frequencies. The quality of this transform directly determines the quality of the subsequent SHAP attribution analysis and the interpretability of the final results.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The method trades computational complexity for interpretability gains. Computing cyclic spectra is more computationally intensive than standard spectral analysis, but provides richer diagnostic information. The choice of transform parameters (cyclic frequency resolution, spectral resolution) involves balancing computational cost against the ability to resolve closely spaced fault components.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor cyclic-spectral transform quality will manifest as blurred or shifted peaks in the cyclic spectrum, leading to incorrect attribution of importance to features. High noise levels can obscure weak modulation components, causing SHAP to under-attribute importance to subtle fault signatures. Non-stationary operating conditions can cause time-varying spectral content that the stationary cyclic-spectral transform cannot properly capture.

**First Experiments:** 1) Apply CS-SHAP to a simple simulation with known fault signatures to verify correct attribution of importance to fault-related cyclic frequencies. 2) Compare CS-SHAP attributions with traditional SHAP on the same vibration signals to demonstrate the added value of cyclic-spectral representation. 3) Test CS-SHAP's robustness by gradually increasing noise levels and observing the degradation in attribution quality and diagnostic accuracy.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Assumes stationary processes, may struggle with time-varying fault signatures common in real-world rotating machinery
- Substantial computational cost for computing cyclic spectra limits scalability to large datasets
- Inherits SHAP's known limitations regarding consistency and sensitivity to sampling strategies
- Focuses exclusively on vibration signals, excluding potentially valuable information from other sensor modalities

## Confidence

**High confidence:** The core methodology for extending SHAP to cyclic-spectral domain is technically sound with well-established mathematical foundations. The theoretical justification for improved interpretability through dual-frequency representation is robust.

**Medium confidence:** The exceptionally high benchmark results (99.98% and 100% accuracy) warrant scrutiny as they may reflect dataset-specific characteristics or potential overfitting. Generalization to diverse fault types and operating conditions requires further validation.

**Low confidence:** The claim positioning CS-SHAP as a "potential benchmark" for post-hoc interpretability is premature given the limited comparative analysis with existing state-of-the-art interpretability methods in the intelligent fault diagnosis literature.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct comprehensive ablation studies comparing CS-SHAP with traditional SHAP and other spectral-based attribution methods across diverse fault scenarios, noise levels, and operating conditions to quantify the claimed interpretability improvements.

2. Evaluate the method's robustness to time-varying fault signatures and non-stationary operating conditions using datasets with realistic operational variations, including transient events and varying load conditions.

3. Perform computational efficiency analysis by measuring inference times and memory requirements for large-scale industrial datasets, and investigate optimization strategies such as parallel processing or approximation techniques for cyclic-spectral computation.
