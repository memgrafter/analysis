# RURA-Net: A general disease diagnosis method based on Zero-Shot Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2503.00052
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00052
- Reference count: 21
- One-line primary result: RURA-Net achieves 0.8395 accuracy on zero-shot ophthalmic disease diagnosis

## Executive Summary
RURA-Net presents a Zero-Shot Learning framework for disease diagnosis that addresses the high annotation costs in medical imaging. The method leverages clinically-similar diseases with abundant labeled data to diagnose target diseases with no labeled samples. Evaluated on ophthalmic datasets, the framework combines similarity analysis, lesion segmentation, and clustering to achieve strong diagnostic performance without requiring direct training data for the target disease.

## Method Summary
The RURA-Net framework uses a three-stage approach: (1) A Siamese neural network with VGG19 backbone identifies clinically-similar diseases to serve as knowledge transfer sources, (2) A U-Net with ResNet50 encoder segments disease-specific lesions from the proxy disease images, and (3) ResNet18 features from segmented images are clustered using Agglomerative Clustering to produce zero-shot diagnoses. The framework was validated on ophthalmic diseases, particularly targeting Mild Diabetic Retinopathy as the unseen class.

## Key Results
- Achieved 0.8395 accuracy, 0.8094 precision, 0.8463 recall, 0.8274 F1 Score, and 0.9226 AUC on ophthalmic disease diagnosis
- Outperformed Few-Shot and One-Shot Learning baselines in comparative evaluation
- Ablation study showed segmentation step is critical, with accuracy dropping from 0.84 to 0.31 when removed
- Agglomerative Clustering outperformed KMeans (F1: 0.83 vs 0.80) and GMM (F1: 0.016) clustering methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Knowledge Transfer via Disease Similarity Mapping
A Siamese neural network identifies clinically-related "proxy" diseases with abundant labeled data, enabling knowledge transfer to target diseases with no labeled samples. VGG19 extracts deep features, which are compared using L1 norm distance and processed through fully connected layers with sigmoid activation to produce similarity scores. Contrastive loss optimizes the network to minimize distance between similar disease pairs and maximize distance between dissimilar pairs.

### Mechanism 2: Diagnostic Feature Isolation Through Lesion Segmentation
U-Net-based segmentation isolates pathologically-relevant regions, removing confounding background variation that would otherwise impair clustering. ResNet50 encoder transforms 512×512×3 images into 16×16×2048 feature maps. Focal loss addresses class imbalance between lesion pixels and background. Output is binary segmentation mask for specific lesion types.

### Mechanism 3: Unsupervised Disease State Separation via Agglomerative Clustering
ResNet-extracted features from segmented images cluster naturally by disease state without requiring explicit labels, enabling zero-shot classification. ResNet18 backbone (classification head removed) outputs high-dimensional feature vectors. Agglomerative clustering uses Euclidean distance to perform bottom-up hierarchical clustering with no gradient updates at this stage.

## Foundational Learning

- **Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL)**: Why needed: Core paradigm enabling diagnosis of diseases never seen during training by transferring knowledge from related, annotated diseases. Quick check: Can you explain why ZSL differs from Few-Shot Learning in terms of what data is available at training time?

- **Siamese Networks and Contrastive Loss**: Why needed: Enables learning a similarity metric between disease images without requiring classification labels for the target disease. Quick check: Given two input images, what does a Siamese network output and how does contrastive loss shape that output?

- **Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering**: Why needed: Final classification stage operates without labels; understanding bottom-up clustering is essential for debugging failure modes. Quick check: How does agglomerative clustering determine which clusters to merge at each iteration?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input Image → Siamese Network → Disease Similarity Score → Select Proxy Disease → U-Net Segmentation → Lesion Masks → ResNet18 Feature Extractor → Feature Vectors → Agglomerative Clustering → Cluster Assignments → Diagnosis

- Critical path: Segmentation quality → Feature vector separability → Clustering accuracy. Ablation shows removing segmentation drops accuracy from 0.84 to 0.31.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - VGG19 vs. other backbones for Siamese: VGG19 achieved 0.8853 accuracy; EfficientNet and DenseNet showed overfitting
  - AGG vs. KMeans clustering: AGG more balanced (F1=0.83) vs. KMeans (F1=0.80); GMM failed completely (F1=0.016)
  - ResNet18 vs. deeper ResNets for clustering: ResNet18 performed best; ResNet152 showed high recall (0.91) but lower accuracy (0.81)

- Failure signatures:
  - Accuracy near 0.50 with high variance: Check if Siamese network identified appropriate proxy disease
  - Accuracy ~0.30 with extremely low recall: Segmentation likely failing; verify lesion masks are non-empty
  - High recall but low precision (>0.90 recall, <0.70 precision): Clustering threshold too permissive
  - GMM-style failure (near-zero recall): Distribution assumption violated; use AGG or PAM instead

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate Siamese similarity on held-out disease pairs not used in training; target accuracy >0.85 before proceeding
  2. Test segmentation mIoU on each lesion type independently; if any mIoU <0.50, augment training data or adjust focal loss weighting
  3. Run clustering with 2-3 algorithms (AGG, PAM, KMedoids) on validation set; select based on balanced F1 rather than single metric

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
The paper identifies the need to develop ZSL models for multiple imaging modalities, as the current framework is limited to single-modality data and cannot integrate and process multi-modal medical imaging data.

### Open Question 2
Poor interpretability is listed as a distinct limitation, noting that improving interpretability is essential for advancing the field and enabling clinicians to understand the rationale behind the "approximate diagnosis."

### Open Question 3
The paper questions whether the framework is effective for diseases where pathological features are diffuse or textural rather than spatially localized lesions, given the heavy dependency on U-Net's ability to segment "key lesions."

## Limitations
- Missing hyperparameter specifications for Siamese network, U-Net segmentation, and Agglomerative Clustering make faithful reproduction difficult
- Dependency on finding clinically-similar proxy diseases introduces potential failure mode not fully explored
- Methodology for constructing disease similarity pairs and mapping cluster assignments to diagnostic labels remains unclear

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Architectural components and evaluation metrics are clearly specified; ablation study results are compelling
**Medium Confidence**: Performance claims rest on similarity transfer, which requires validation across multiple target diseases
**Low Confidence**: Specific combination of components is presented as novel, but core concepts are individually established

## Next Checks

1. Apply RURA-Net to diagnose a second ophthalmic disease and evaluate whether the Siamese similarity mechanism identifies clinically-appropriate proxy diseases
2. Systematically vary the similarity score threshold for selecting proxy diseases and measure the impact on final diagnostic accuracy
3. For misclassified cases, conduct detailed analysis to determine whether errors stem from poor similarity identification, segmentation failure, or clustering ambiguity
