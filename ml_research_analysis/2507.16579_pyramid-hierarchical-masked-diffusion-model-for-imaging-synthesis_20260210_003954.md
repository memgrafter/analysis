core_contribution: The paper presents a Pyramid Hierarchical Masked Diffusion Model
  (PHMDiff) for medical image synthesis, addressing the challenge of generating high-quality
  images across and within medical imaging modalities. The method introduces a multi-scale
  hierarchical approach that decomposes images into a pyramid structure, applying
  randomly generated masks at each level to guide reconstruction and balance detail
  preservation with overall structural integrity.
