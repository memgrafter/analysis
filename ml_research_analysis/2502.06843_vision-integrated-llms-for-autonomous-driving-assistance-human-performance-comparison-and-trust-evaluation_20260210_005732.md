# Vision-Integrated LLMs for Autonomous Driving Assistance : Human Performance Comparison and Trust Evaluation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2502.06843
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06843
- Reference count: 0
- Developed vision-integrated LLM-based AD assistance system combining YOLOv4 and Vision Transformer with GPT-4

## Executive Summary
This study developed a vision-integrated LLM-based autonomous driving assistance system that combines YOLOv4 and Vision Transformer for visual feature extraction with GPT-4 for decision-making. The system was evaluated through experiments with 45 experienced drivers, demonstrating high semantic similarity scores in situation description tasks (METEOR 0.76, BERT 0.73) while showing moderate alignment in generating appropriate responses. The system significantly increased user trust levels after interaction (p < .001, Cohen's d = 0.75), indicating its potential to support human decision-making in autonomous driving technologies. The research addresses critical challenges in ADAS development by focusing on both technical performance and human-machine trust dynamics.

## Method Summary
The study developed a vision-integrated LLM system that combined YOLOv4 and Vision Transformer for visual feature extraction with GPT-4 for decision-making. The experimental design involved 45 experienced drivers who interacted with the system in controlled driving scenarios. Performance was evaluated using semantic similarity metrics (METEOR and BERT scores) for situation descriptions and appropriate response generation. Trust levels were measured before and after system interaction using validated scales. The methodology emphasized both technical accuracy through automated metrics and human factors through subjective trust assessment, providing a comprehensive evaluation framework for ADAS technologies.

## Key Results
- System achieved high semantic similarity scores in situation description tasks (METEOR 0.76, BERT 0.73), closely matching human performance
- Moderate alignment observed in generating appropriate responses, indicating challenges with nuanced decision-making
- Significant increase in user trust levels after interaction (p < .001, Cohen's d = 0.75)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system's effectiveness stems from its integration of complementary visual processing techniques with advanced language reasoning. YOLOv4 provides real-time object detection capabilities, while Vision Transformer captures contextual relationships between visual elements. This combined visual understanding is then processed by GPT-4, which leverages its extensive reasoning capabilities to generate appropriate driving responses. The architecture bridges the gap between raw sensor data and high-level decision-making by creating a semantic layer that translates visual inputs into actionable driving instructions. The system's success in situation description tasks demonstrates its ability to accurately perceive and articulate driving environments, though the moderate performance in response generation suggests that translating perception into action remains challenging.

## Foundational Learning

**Object Detection (YOLOv4)** - Why needed: Provides real-time identification of vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles in driving scenarios. Quick check: Verify detection accuracy exceeds 80% on standard driving datasets like KITTI or Waymo.

**Vision Transformer** - Why needed: Captures contextual relationships between detected objects to understand scene composition. Quick check: Validate attention mechanisms correctly identify relevant spatial relationships in complex multi-object scenes.

**Large Language Models (GPT-4)** - Why needed: Translates visual understanding into natural language descriptions and driving instructions. Quick check: Ensure generated responses maintain coherence and relevance across diverse driving scenarios.

**Semantic Similarity Metrics (METEOR, BERT)** - Why needed: Quantifies alignment between system outputs and human responses for objective evaluation. Quick check: Compare metric scores against human-annotated gold standards to establish validity.

**Trust Assessment Scales** - Why needed: Measures user acceptance and willingness to rely on ADAS technologies. Quick check: Validate scales through factor analysis and test-retest reliability in pilot studies.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: YOLOv4 -> Vision Transformer -> GPT-4 -> User Interface

Critical path: Sensor Input → YOLOv4 Detection → Vision Transformer Encoding → GPT-4 Reasoning → Response Generation → Display/Output

Design tradeoffs: The system prioritizes semantic accuracy over computational efficiency, accepting higher processing requirements for better decision quality. Real-time performance may be limited by the sequential processing pipeline, particularly during complex scenarios requiring multiple reasoning steps.

Failure signatures: Detection failures from YOLOv4 propagate downstream, causing GPT-4 to generate responses based on incomplete scene understanding. Vision Transformer context errors lead to misattribution of object relationships. GPT-4 hallucinations may produce plausible-sounding but incorrect driving instructions when faced with ambiguous scenarios.

First experiments:
1. Test individual component performance on benchmark datasets (YOLOv4 on KITTI, GPT-4 on driving instruction datasets)
2. Evaluate end-to-end system performance on simple driving scenarios with known ground truth
3. Conduct pilot user studies with 5-10 participants to identify usability issues before full deployment

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations
- Limited generalizability beyond the specific experimental setup and cultural context of 45 experienced drivers
- Moderate alignment in generating appropriate responses suggests challenges with nuanced decision-making in complex real-world scenarios
- Trust evaluation conducted immediately after interaction without longitudinal assessment of sustained trust or potential over-reliance

## Confidence

**Human Performance Comparison - High**: The methodology appears robust for controlled experimental conditions in situation description tasks.

**Human Performance Comparison - Medium**: Moderate alignment in response generation indicates potential struggles with nuanced decision-making.

**Trust Evaluation - Medium**: Statistical significance is strong, but short-term assessment and potential Hawthorne effect may influence results.

**System Performance Claims - Medium**: Real-world deployment would face additional challenges not captured in this study.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a longitudinal study tracking trust levels and system reliance over 3-6 months of real-world usage across diverse geographic and cultural contexts

2. Implement the system in a high-fidelity driving simulator with edge cases (adverse weather, sensor failures, unexpected pedestrian behavior) to evaluate robustness beyond controlled scenarios

3. Perform a comparative analysis with multiple ADAS systems and baseline human performance across different driver experience levels (novice to expert) to establish relative effectiveness and identify skill transfer issues
