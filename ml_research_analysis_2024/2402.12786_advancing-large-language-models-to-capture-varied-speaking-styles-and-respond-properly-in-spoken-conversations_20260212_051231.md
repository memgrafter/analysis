core_contribution: This paper addresses the problem of enabling LLMs to generate contextually
  appropriate responses in spoken dialogue by incorporating speaking styles, which
  contain paralinguistic and prosodic information. The authors propose a two-stage
  training method called Spoken-LLM that combines a large language model (Llama 2-Chat)
  with a speech emotion representation model (emotion2vec) to model both linguistic

# Advancing Large Language Models to Capture Varied Speaking Styles and Respond Properly in Spoken Conversations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.12786
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12786
- Reference count: 11
- Authors: Guan-Ting Lin; Cheng-Han Chiang; Hung-yi Lee
- Primary result: Proposed Spoken-LLM achieves 49.6 F1 score on response emotion and 62.1 F1 score on response speaking speed, outperforming text-only baselines in spoken dialogue generation with appropriate speaking styles

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of enabling large language models to generate contextually appropriate responses in spoken dialogue by incorporating speaking styles, which contain paralinguistic and prosodic information. The authors propose Spoken-LLM, a two-stage training method that combines a large language model (Llama 2-Chat) with a speech emotion representation model (emotion2vec) to model both linguistic content and speaking styles. To train and evaluate this approach, they collect a novel speech-to-speech dataset called StyleTalk, where the same dialogue context and input sentence are spoken in different styles, resulting in different responses. The method demonstrates significant improvements over text-only baselines and prior speech LLMs methods in capturing speaking styles.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a two-stage training approach called Spoken-LLM that combines a large language model with speech emotion representation. In the first stage, they continue pre-train Llama 2-Chat using emotion2vec embeddings that capture speaking style information from speech input. In the second stage, they perform supervised fine-tuning using the StyleTalk dataset, which contains dialogue contexts and responses spoken in different styles (neutral, happy, angry). The model learns to generate response speech that matches the input speaking style while maintaining contextual appropriateness. The training pipeline integrates both the linguistic content and paralinguistic features extracted from the speech signal.

## Key Results
- Spoken-LLM achieves 49.6 F1 score on response emotion classification, outperforming text-only LLM baselines
- The model reaches 62.1 F1 score on response speaking speed classification, demonstrating improved prosodic modeling
- Human evaluation shows Spoken-LLM generates more reasonable and proper response speech compared to text-only LLM baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The two-stage training approach effectively bridges the gap between text-based language understanding and speech-based speaking style modeling. By first pre-training with emotion2vec embeddings, the model learns to associate paralinguistic features with linguistic content. The supervised fine-tuning on StyleTalk then allows the model to learn how different speaking styles should influence response generation in conversational contexts. This combination enables the model to generate responses that not only make semantic sense but also match the appropriate emotional tone and speaking rate of the input speech.

## Foundational Learning

**Speech Emotion Recognition**: Why needed - To extract paralinguistic features that represent speaking styles from raw audio input. Quick check - Verify that emotion2vec accurately captures emotional valence, arousal, and speaking speed from speech signals.

**Multi-modal Learning**: Why needed - To integrate information from both text (dialogue context) and speech (speaking style) modalities. Quick check - Ensure the model can properly align textual semantics with acoustic features during training.

**Prosody Modeling**: Why needed - To capture variations in speaking rate, pitch, and rhythm that convey meaning beyond words. Quick check - Validate that the model learns to reproduce appropriate prosodic patterns in generated responses.

**Dialogue Context Understanding**: Why needed - To generate responses that are contextually appropriate within the conversation flow. Quick check - Confirm the model maintains coherence when switching between different speaking styles within the same dialogue.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Speech input -> Emotion2Vec (speaking style extraction) -> Spoken-LLM (two-stage training) -> Response speech generation

**Critical Path**: Speech signal → Emotion2vec embedding extraction → LLM input embedding → Response generation → Speech synthesis

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach trades computational complexity (emotion2vec inference) for improved speaking style modeling accuracy. The two-stage training requires more data and training time but enables better integration of paralinguistic features.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Inconsistent speaking styles across dialogue turns
- Mismatch between input emotion and generated response emotion
- Generation of responses that ignore speaking style information
- Degradation in linguistic quality when incorporating style features

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate model performance on StyleTalk test set with varying input speaking styles
2. Compare emotion classification accuracy between text-only and speech-based response generation
3. Test model generalization to speakers not seen during training

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations

**Dataset Size and Diversity**: The StyleTalk dataset contains only 300 dialogues with three speaking styles each, which is relatively small for training and evaluating speaking style modeling. Additionally, all audio is provided by a single speaker, limiting generalizability.

**Evaluation Methodology**: The methodology for generating response speech from text-only LLMs relies on prompting rather than true speech-based generation, making comparisons less direct. The emotion2vec model used for style embedding may introduce additional error sources.

**Generalization Concerns**: The model's performance on speakers with different characteristics, accents, or speaking patterns not represented in the training data remains unclear. The approach may not generalize well to more nuanced or mixed speaking styles.

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The technical implementation of the two-stage training pipeline (continued pre-training with emotion2vec embeddings followed by supervised fine-tuning) is well-documented and follows established LLM training methodologies.

**Medium confidence**: The reported F1 scores for emotion (49.6) and speaking speed (62.1) classification appear competitive, but the evaluation metrics and their calculation methods require more detailed clarification to fully assess their validity.

**Low confidence**: The human evaluation methodology lacks sufficient detail regarding rater selection, inter-rater reliability, and specific evaluation criteria, making it difficult to assess the reliability of claims about response quality and appropriateness.

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset Diversity Validation**: Re-evaluate the StyleTalk dataset with multiple speakers across different demographic groups to assess whether the speaking style modeling generalizes beyond the single-speaker corpus.

2. **Controlled Baseline Comparison**: Implement a controlled experiment comparing Spoken-LLM against a text-only baseline that uses explicit style instructions in prompts, rather than relying on speech input, to isolate the contribution of the speech modality.

3. **Ablation Study on Emotion2Vec Integration**: Conduct an ablation study testing the model's performance with different emotion embedding models or without emotion embeddings entirely to quantify their specific contribution to the improved speaking style modeling.
