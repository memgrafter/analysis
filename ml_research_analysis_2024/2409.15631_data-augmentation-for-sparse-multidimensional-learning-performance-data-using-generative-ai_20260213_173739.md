# Data Augmentation for Sparse Multidimensional Learning Performance Data Using Generative AI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.15631
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15631
- Reference count: 40
- This study introduces a systematic framework that integrates tensor factorization for data imputation and generative AI models for data augmentation to address the critical issue of data sparsity in intelligent tutoring systems.

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the critical challenge of data sparsity in intelligent tutoring systems by introducing a comprehensive framework that combines tensor factorization for data imputation with generative AI models for data augmentation. Learning performance data from systems like AutoTutor is typically 80-90% missing due to adaptive item selection, which severely limits the ability to predict learner performance and explore learning hypotheses. The framework constructs a three-dimensional tensor representing learners, questions, and attempts, uses tensor factorization to impute missing values, and employs generative models (Vanilla GAN and GPT-4o) to create additional data tailored to individual learner performance patterns. Tested on an adult literacy dataset, the approach significantly outperforms traditional knowledge tracing methods and provides stable, reliable data augmentation that enhances educational data mining and learning analytics.

## Method Summary
The framework addresses data sparsity through a four-stage process: (1) constructing a 3D tensor from raw learning logs representing learners, questions, and attempts; (2) applying tensor factorization to impute missing performance values by capturing latent relationships among the three dimensions; (3) clustering learners based on power-law function parameters fitted to their performance patterns to identify distinct learning behaviors; and (4) using generative AI models (Vanilla GAN and GPT-4o) to augment data for each learner cluster. The approach was validated on AutoTutor ARC lessons for adult literacy, comparing tensor factorization against baseline knowledge tracing methods (BKT, PFA, SPARFA-Lite) and evaluating data augmentation quality through distribution analysis.

## Key Results
- Tensor factorization significantly outperformed baseline knowledge tracing techniques (BKT, PFA, SPARFA-Lite) in predicting learning performance with higher fidelity in data imputation.
- Vanilla GAN-based augmentation exhibited greater stability and lower statistical bias across varying sample sizes compared to GPT-4o.
- The framework enhances data richness and reliability, enabling comprehensive evaluation and optimization of instructional designs prior to deployment.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Tensor factorization outperforms baseline KT models in imputing missing performance values.
- Mechanism: Decomposes the sparse learner-question-attempt tensor into lower-dimensional latent matrices capturing learner features and knowledge components, enabling reconstruction of missing entries through reconstruction from factorized components.
- Core assumption: Learner performance data exhibits underlying low-rank structure that can be captured through factorization, and missing values are recoverable through relationships among observed entries.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "tensor factorization significantly outperformed baseline knowledge tracing techniques (BKT, PFA, SPARFA-Lite) in predicting learning performance, demonstrating higher fidelity in data imputation"
  - [section: Tensor-based Imputation] "This method leverages multidimensional relationships to enhance predictions and knowledge representation by integrating three dimensions: learners, items (e.g., questions or learning materials), and temporal factors (e.g., time or attempts)"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus; claim is specific to this paper's methodology
- Break condition: When the underlying data structure is not low-rank, or when sparsity patterns are non-random and violate the reconstruction assumptions.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Generative AI models can effectively augment sparse learning performance data by generating samples that match the distribution of observed performance patterns.
- Mechanism: GANs learn to generate synthetic learner-question-attempt triplets that preserve the statistical properties of the original data, while GPT models use reasoning capabilities to simulate new data points based on learned patterns and contextual understanding.
- Core assumption: The generative models can learn the underlying distribution of learning performance data and generate samples that are statistically indistinguishable from real data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Vanilla GAN-based augmentation exhibited greater stability and lower statistical bias across varying sample sizes, while GPT-4o showed higher variability but occasionally captured closer fidelity to the original data distribution"
  - [section: Data Augmentation based on Generative Models] "The generator is designed to produce simulated data samples from initialized random noise, typically sourced from a Gaussian distribution. Its output is crafted to be compatible with the input from the individualized learning performance pattern as synthetic sample data"
  - [corpus] Limited evidence in corpus; neighboring papers focus on imputation but not specifically on GAN/GPT-based augmentation for learning performance data
- Break condition: When the generative model fails to capture the true data distribution, or when generated samples introduce systematic biases that affect downstream modeling.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Clustering learners by performance patterns enables targeted data augmentation that preserves individual learning trajectories.
- Mechanism: Learners are grouped based on power-law function parameters fitted to their performance across attempts, creating clusters with similar learning characteristics that guide generative model training.
- Core assumption: Learners with similar performance patterns across attempts can be meaningfully clustered, and these clusters represent distinct learning behaviors that should be preserved in augmented data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "data augmentation using Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models, including Generative Adversarial Network, specifically Vanilla Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), and Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPT, specifically GPT-4o), generate data tailored to individual clusters of learning performance"
  - [section: Identification of Learning Performance Patterns by Clustering] "We then utilized K-means++ algorithm to cluster the distribution of these parameters (a and b) among learners, which assists in identifying distinct individual learning performance patterns"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus; clustering approach is specific to this paper's methodology
- Break condition: When the clustering algorithm fails to identify meaningful patterns, or when generated data from one cluster inappropriately influences another cluster's characteristics.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Tensor factorization and decomposition
  - Why needed here: The core methodology relies on decomposing a 3D tensor to impute missing values and capture latent relationships between learners, questions, and attempts.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how tensor factorization differs from traditional matrix factorization in handling multi-dimensional educational data?

- Concept: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
  - Why needed here: GANs are used as one of the primary generative models for data augmentation, learning to generate realistic synthetic learning performance data.
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of a GAN and how do they work together to generate realistic synthetic data?

- Concept: Power-law learning curves and clustering
  - Why needed here: Power-law functions model the relationship between learner performance and attempts, and clustering based on these parameters enables targeted data augmentation.
  - Quick check question: How does a power-law function capture the relationship between practice attempts and learning performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw learning logs → 3D tensor construction → Tensor factorization → Clustering → Generative augmentation → Augmented dataset ready for downstream use

- Critical path: The framework processes learning performance data through tensor construction, imputation, clustering, and generative augmentation to produce enhanced datasets for educational analysis.

- Design tradeoffs: The framework balances between imputation accuracy (favoring tensor factorization) and augmentation diversity (favoring generative models). Tensor factorization provides high-fidelity imputation but may not capture all nuances, while generative models can introduce variability but risk introducing bias.

- Failure signatures: Poor imputation accuracy manifests as high RMSE/MAE values in validation; ineffective augmentation shows high EMD divergence from original data; model instability appears as high variance in generated parameters across sample sizes.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement tensor factorization on a small subset of the AutoTutor dataset and validate imputation accuracy against held-out data.
  2. Test clustering algorithm on the imputed tensor to verify that meaningful learner groups are identified based on power-law parameters.
  3. Run both Vanilla GAN and GPT-4o augmentation on a single cluster and measure EMD divergence to assess generation quality.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Limitations

- The framework assumes that learner performance data exhibits underlying low-rank structure that can be captured through tensor factorization, which may not hold for all educational datasets.
- The clustering approach based on power-law parameters assumes predictable learning trajectories, which may not be universally applicable across different learning domains or populations.

## Next Checks

1. Test the framework on datasets with different sparsity patterns and item selection strategies to assess generalizability beyond the AutoTutor ARC dataset.

2. Conduct ablation studies comparing the complete framework against versions with individual components disabled to quantify the contribution of each mechanism.

3. Perform external validation by applying the augmented data to downstream tasks such as learner modeling or instructional design optimization to verify practical utility.
