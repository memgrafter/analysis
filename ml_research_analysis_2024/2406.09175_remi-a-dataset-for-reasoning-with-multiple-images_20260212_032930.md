# ReMI: A Dataset for Reasoning with Multiple Images

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.09175
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09175
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces ReMI benchmark to evaluate LLMs' ability to reason with multiple images

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ReMI, a new benchmark designed to evaluate large language models' (LLMs) ability to reason with multiple images. The dataset covers diverse domains like math, physics, logic, and spatial reasoning, with tasks requiring integration of information across text and multiple images. The authors benchmark several state-of-the-art LLMs on ReMI, finding a substantial gap between model performance and human-level proficiency. Their analysis reveals strengths and weaknesses of different models, highlighting the challenges in multi-image reasoning and areas for future improvement. The dataset and benchmark are made publicly available to foster further research in this area.

## Method Summary
The authors created ReMI by curating a diverse set of multi-image reasoning tasks across domains including mathematics, physics, logic, and spatial reasoning. Each task requires integrating information from multiple images along with textual descriptions. The dataset was designed to systematically evaluate different aspects of multi-image reasoning capabilities. The authors then benchmarked several state-of-the-art LLMs with vision capabilities on this dataset, comparing their performance against human-level proficiency to establish baseline metrics and identify areas for improvement.

## Key Results
- ReMI benchmark reveals substantial performance gap between LLMs and human-level proficiency in multi-image reasoning
- Different models show varying strengths and weaknesses across reasoning domains
- The dataset covers diverse domains requiring integration of text and multiple images
- Public release of dataset and benchmark to enable further research

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark's effectiveness stems from its focus on tasks that require genuine integration of multiple visual inputs with textual information, rather than simple single-image classification or captioning. By covering diverse domains and requiring complex reasoning chains across multiple images, ReMI creates a challenging evaluation environment that exposes limitations in current multi-modal LLMs.

## Foundational Learning
- Multi-image reasoning: Understanding how to combine information from multiple visual sources
  - Why needed: Single-image models cannot handle tasks requiring cross-image relationships
  - Quick check: Can the model identify relationships between objects appearing in different images?
- Visual-text integration: Combining visual information with textual descriptions
  - Why needed: Most real-world reasoning tasks involve both visual and textual elements
  - Quick check: Does the model correctly use both image and text information to answer questions?
- Spatial reasoning: Understanding spatial relationships and transformations
  - Why needed: Many multi-image tasks involve understanding how objects relate in space
  - Quick check: Can the model correctly interpret spatial arrangements across multiple images?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
LLM with vision capabilities -> Text Encoder -> Image Encoder -> Fusion Layer -> Reasoning Module

**Critical Path:**
Image inputs → Visual feature extraction → Text processing → Information fusion → Multi-step reasoning → Answer generation

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Vision encoder complexity vs. inference speed
- Fusion method granularity (early vs. late fusion)
- Reasoning depth vs. computational cost

**Failure Signatures:**
- Correct identification of individual image elements but failure to integrate across images
- Over-reliance on textual information while ignoring visual cues
- Correct reasoning on single images but breakdown when multiple images are involved

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Evaluate model performance on single-image vs. multi-image variants of the same tasks
2. Test models with occluded or incomplete images to assess robustness
3. Compare performance across different domain types (math vs. physics vs. logic)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Potential domain specificity may not represent all real-world multi-image reasoning scenarios
- Benchmark focuses on LLMs, potentially overlooking specialized visual processing approaches
- Performance gap metrics lack specific quantitative details in abstract

## Confidence

**High confidence:** Dataset's multi-domain coverage and public availability are well-established

**Medium confidence:** Claims about substantial performance gap between models and humans

**Medium confidence:** Characterization of model strengths and weaknesses across reasoning types

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies comparing ReMI performance against other multi-image reasoning benchmarks to validate its relative difficulty and discriminative power

2. Perform inter-rater reliability tests on the dataset annotations to ensure consistency in the human-level performance baseline

3. Test whether models trained on ReMI show generalization to out-of-distribution multi-image reasoning tasks outside the benchmark's specific domains
