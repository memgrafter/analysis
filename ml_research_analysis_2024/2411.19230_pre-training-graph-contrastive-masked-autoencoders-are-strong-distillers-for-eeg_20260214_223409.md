## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a unified pre-training framework that combines contrastive learning and masked autoencoder techniques for EEG data. The method addresses the challenge of limited labeled EEG data by leveraging abundant unlabeled data and transferring knowledge from high-density to low-density EEG devices. The approach introduces a novel graph topology distillation loss to handle missing electrodes during knowledge transfer. Experiments on two clinical EEG datasets demonstrate significant improvements in classification tasks while maintaining efficiency with fewer parameters.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a dual pre-training strategy combining contrastive learning and masked autoencoder techniques for EEG data. It uses a graph neural network to capture spatial relationships between EEG electrodes and implements a graph topology distillation loss to transfer knowledge from high-density to low-density EEG devices. The method handles missing electrodes by reconstructing masked electrode signals while preserving spatial dependencies through the graph structure. Pre-training on unlabeled data enables better performance on downstream classification tasks with limited labeled examples.

## Key Results
- Achieves 5.6-6.4% accuracy gains over state-of-the-art methods on clinical EEG datasets
- Demonstrates effective knowledge transfer from high-density to low-density EEG devices
- Maintains model efficiency with fewer parameters while improving performance
- Shows robustness to missing electrode information through graph topology distillation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging both temporal and spatial patterns in EEG data through contrastive learning and masked autoencoding. Contrastive learning helps the model learn meaningful representations by contrasting similar and dissimilar EEG segments, while masked autoencoding forces the model to reconstruct missing electrode signals, enhancing its ability to handle incomplete data. The graph topology distillation loss enables effective knowledge transfer between devices with different electrode configurations by preserving spatial relationships in the EEG topology.

## Foundational Learning
- **Contrastive Learning**: Why needed - to learn meaningful representations from unlabeled EEG data; Quick check - compare representations of similar vs dissimilar EEG segments
- **Masked Autoencoding**: Why needed - to handle missing electrode data and improve robustness; Quick check - measure reconstruction accuracy of masked electrodes
- **Graph Neural Networks**: Why needed - to capture spatial relationships between EEG electrodes; Quick check - verify preservation of electrode spatial dependencies
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Why needed - to transfer information from high-density to low-density devices; Quick check - compare performance on different electrode configurations
- **Pre-training**: Why needed - to leverage abundant unlabeled data for better downstream performance; Quick check - measure improvement on downstream tasks after pre-training

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Raw EEG -> Graph Construction -> Contrastive Learning + Masked Autoencoding -> Graph Topology Distillation -> Classification Head
**Critical Path**: The core pipeline processes EEG signals through graph construction, applies dual pre-training objectives, then distills knowledge for downstream classification
**Design Tradeoffs**: Balances computational efficiency with performance gains by using fewer parameters while maintaining accuracy through effective pre-training
**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance may indicate inadequate graph construction, insufficient pre-training, or mismatched electrode configurations during distillation
**First Experiments**:
1. Test basic contrastive learning performance on single EEG dataset
2. Evaluate masked autoencoder reconstruction accuracy with varying mask rates
3. Measure knowledge transfer effectiveness between different electrode configurations
