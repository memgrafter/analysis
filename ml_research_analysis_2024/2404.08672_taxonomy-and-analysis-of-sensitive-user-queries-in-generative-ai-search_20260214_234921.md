# Taxonomy and Analysis of Sensitive User Queries in Generative AI Search

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2404.08672
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08672
- **Reference count**: 14
- **Primary result**: 3-4% of daily queries are sensitive; classifier achieves 87% accuracy

## Executive Summary
This study develops a taxonomy for sensitive user queries in generative AI search systems and demonstrates its application through analysis of 70 days of Korean search engine data. The researchers created a sensitive query classifier based on a Korean LLM and identified that discrimination and controversial factuality represent the most common sensitive query categories. The analysis reveals temporal variations in sensitive query distribution linked to major social events, suggesting the need for dynamic handling approaches. The 87% accuracy classifier provides a practical tool for identifying and managing sensitive queries in real-world generative AI search applications.

## Method Summary
The researchers developed a three-stage methodology combining taxonomy construction, classifier development, and empirical analysis. They first created a comprehensive taxonomy by analyzing Korean legal documents and guidelines related to search query regulation. This taxonomy was then operationalized through a classifier built using a Korean large language model, which was trained and validated on labeled query datasets. Finally, the classifier was applied to 70 days of user query logs from a national-scale Korean search engine to quantify and categorize sensitive queries. The approach integrates legal, ethical, and service-specific considerations into a unified framework for identifying queries that could cause harm or violate regulations.

## Key Results
- 3-4% of daily user queries classified as sensitive across 70-day analysis period
- Discrimination and controversial factuality emerged as the most frequent sensitive query categories
- Sensitive query distribution showed clear temporal variations correlating with major social events
- Classifier achieved 87% overall accuracy in identifying sensitive queries

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works because it systematically integrates legal compliance requirements with practical search engine operations through a structured taxonomy that captures the multidimensional nature of query sensitivity. The Korean LLM-based classifier effectively identifies subtle contextual cues in queries that may indicate discriminatory intent or controversial factual claims, while the empirical analysis of real search logs provides validation that the theoretical taxonomy translates into actionable patterns in actual user behavior.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Sensitive query classification in LLMs** - Why needed: Essential for filtering harmful content in generative AI outputs. Quick check: Verify classification accuracy against human-annotated ground truth.
2. **Cross-cultural query analysis** - Why needed: Ensures findings generalize beyond single-language contexts. Quick check: Apply taxonomy to multilingual datasets.
3. **Temporal pattern recognition in search behavior** - Why needed: Identifies how social events influence query sensitivity. Quick check: Correlate query patterns with news event timelines.
4. **Legal framework integration in AI systems** - Why needed: Ensures compliance with regional regulations. Quick check: Map taxonomy categories to specific legal requirements.
5. **Search engine log analysis methodology** - Why needed: Provides empirical validation of theoretical taxonomies. Quick check: Verify statistical significance of query distribution patterns.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Taxonomy Construction -> Classifier Development -> Search Log Analysis -> Result Validation

**Critical Path**: Taxonomy construction feeds directly into classifier training, which processes search logs to generate quantitative results for validation and interpretation.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Korean language specificity enables precise legal compliance but limits generalizability; LLM-based classification balances accuracy with scalability but may miss nuanced context.

**Failure Signatures**: High false positive rates in classifier indicate over-broad taxonomy definitions; inconsistent temporal patterns suggest insufficient event correlation analysis; low sensitive query detection rates may indicate classifier under-sensitivity.

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Validate classifier accuracy on independently annotated Korean query set
2. Test taxonomy applicability on English-language query datasets
3. Perform event correlation analysis between major news events and sensitive query spikes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can the taxonomy be adapted for non-Korean regulatory frameworks and cultural contexts?
- What are the optimal frequency and methodology for updating the taxonomy as social norms and legal requirements evolve?
- How can the classifier be extended to handle emerging forms of sensitive queries that don't fit existing categories?
- What is the most effective balance between automated filtering and human moderation for managing sensitive queries?

## Limitations
- Korean language and cultural context specificity may limit generalizability to other regions
- 87% classifier accuracy leaves 13% of queries potentially misclassified
- 70-day study period may not capture long-term seasonal patterns or trends
- Taxonomy based on Korean legal documents may not translate to other regulatory frameworks
- LLM-based classification may struggle with highly contextual or nuanced queries
- Search engine log analysis only captures explicit user queries, not implicit sensitive topics

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: 3-4% of daily queries are sensitive (supported by direct search log analysis)
- **Medium Confidence**: Discrimination and controversial factuality are most common categories (Korean-specific findings)
- **Low Confidence**: Sensitive query distribution varies with social events (requires more granular temporal analysis)

## Next Checks
1. Cross-linguistic validation: Test taxonomy and classifier on search queries from other languages and cultural contexts
2. Longitudinal analysis: Extend study period beyond 70 days to capture seasonal patterns and long-term trends
3. Ground truth comparison: Conduct human-annotated validation using diverse annotators to verify classifier accuracy and identify biases
4. Regulatory mapping: Align taxonomy categories with legal requirements in multiple jurisdictions to assess cross-cultural applicability
5. Contextual robustness testing: Evaluate classifier performance on ambiguous or context-dependent sensitive queries
