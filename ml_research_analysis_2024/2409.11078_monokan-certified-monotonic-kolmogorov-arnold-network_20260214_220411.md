## Executive Summary
This paper proposes MonoKAN, a novel Kolmogorov-Arnold Network architecture that achieves certified partial monotonicity while enhancing interpretability. The method replaces B-splines with cubic Hermite splines and imposes constraints on their coefficients to ensure monotonicity. By using positive weights in linear combinations of these splines, the network preserves monotonic relationships between input and output. Experiments on multiple datasets (COMPAS, Blog Feedback, Loan Defaulter, Auto MPG, Heart Disease) demonstrate that MonoKAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art monotonic MLP approaches.

## Method Summary
MonoKAN is a novel Kolmogorov-Arnold Network architecture that achieves certified partial monotonicity through cubic Hermite splines. The method replaces B-splines with cubic Hermite splines and imposes constraints on their coefficients to ensure monotonicity. Positive weights in linear combinations of these splines preserve monotonic relationships between input and output. A clamping method during training ensures parameters always satisfy monotonicity conditions. The architecture is tested on multiple datasets including COMPAS, Blog Feedback, Loan Defaulter, Auto MPG, and Heart Disease, demonstrating consistent performance improvements over state-of-the-art monotonic MLP approaches.

## Key Results
- MonoKAN achieves test accuracies of 69.6% on COMPAS
- Achieves RMSE of 0.153 on Blog Feedback regression
- On Auto MPG, achieves MSE of 5.82 and test accuracy of 91%

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The replacement of B-splines with cubic Hermite splines enables the network to naturally enforce monotonicity through coefficient constraints.
- Mechanism: Cubic Hermite splines are defined by function values and derivatives at knot points. The monotonicity of the spline can be guaranteed by ensuring the derivatives at these points are non-negative (or non-positive for decreasing monotonicity) and that the parameters α and β (ratios of derivatives to secant slopes) satisfy α² + β² ≤ 9.
- Core assumption: The cubic Hermite spline approximation of the univariate functions in the KAN layer is sufficiently accurate to preserve the overall monotonicity of the network.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "To achieve this, we employ cubic Hermite splines, which guarantee monotonicity through a set of straightforward conditions."
  - [section] "A cubic Hermite spline, or cubic Hermite interpolator, is a type of spline where each segment is a third-degree polynomial defined by its values and first derivatives at the endpoints of the interval it spans."
  - [corpus] Weak. No direct corpus evidence on Hermite spline effectiveness in KANs.
- Break condition: If the function being approximated has high-frequency components or sharp discontinuities, the cubic Hermite spline approximation may not be sufficiently accurate, leading to violations of monotonicity.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The use of positive weights in the linear combinations of monotonic splines ensures the preservation of monotonic relationships between input and output.
- Mechanism: If a function is monotonic and the weights in its linear combination are positive, then the resulting function is also monotonic. This property allows the KAN to maintain monotonicity even when combining multiple univariate monotonic functions.
- Core assumption: The base function (e.g., Sigmoid or SiLU) used in the KAN layer is monotonic, and the weights associated with both the spline and the base function are positive.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Additionally, by using positive weights in the linear combinations of these splines, we ensure that the network preserves the monotonic relationships between input and output."
  - [section] "Since a linear combination of monotonic functions with positive coefficients is monotonic, and the composition of monotonic functions is also monotonic..."
  - [corpus] Weak. No direct corpus evidence on the impact of positive weights on KAN monotonicity.
- Break condition: If any of the weights in the linear combination become negative due to training or parameter updates, the monotonicity of the resulting function may be violated.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The proposed clamping method during training ensures that the parameters of the KAN always satisfy the sufficient conditions for monotonicity.
- Mechanism: At each training epoch, the parameters (weights, spline coefficients, derivatives) are adjusted to stay within the permissible range defined by the conditions in Theorem 3. This prevents the network from learning parameters that violate monotonicity.
- Core assumption: The clamping method is effective in enforcing the conditions of Theorem 3 without significantly hindering the network's ability to learn the underlying data patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "To achieve this, we employ cubic Hermite splines, which guarantee monotonicity through a set of straightforward conditions. Additionally, by using positive weights in the linear combinations of these splines, we ensure that the network preserves the monotonic relationships between input and output."
  - [section] "Therefore, by ensuring that the updated parameters meet the sufficient conditions, the algorithm ensures the KAN's partial monotonicity."
  - [corpus] Weak. No direct corpus evidence on the effectiveness of the clamping method in MonoKAN.
- Break condition: If the clamping method is too restrictive, it may prevent the network from learning complex patterns in the data, leading to underfitting. Conversely, if the clamping is not strict enough, the network may still learn parameters that violate monotonicity.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem
  - Why needed here: The KAN architecture is based on this theorem, which states that any multivariate continuous function can be decomposed into a finite sum of univariate functions. Understanding this theorem is crucial for grasping the core idea behind KANs.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem relates to the structure of a KAN layer?

- Concept: Cubic Hermite splines
  - Why needed here: MonoKAN uses cubic Hermite splines to approximate the univariate functions in the KAN layer. Knowledge of Hermite splines, including their definition and the conditions for monotonicity, is essential for understanding how MonoKAN enforces monotonicity.
  - Quick check question: What are the conditions that need to be satisfied for a cubic Hermite spline to be monotonic?

- Concept: Partial monotonicity
  - Why needed here: MonoKAN is designed to achieve certified partial monotonicity, meaning the network's predictions must align with expert-imposed monotonic constraints on specific input variables. Understanding partial monotonicity and its implications is crucial for grasping the motivation behind MonoKAN.
  - Quick check question: Can you provide an example of a real-world scenario where partial monotonicity is important in a machine learning model?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: KAN layer -> Univariate functions (cubic Hermite splines) -> Linear combination (positive weights) -> Clamping method -> Base function (Sigmoid/SiLU)

- Critical path: Training MonoKAN involves iteratively updating parameters using the clamping method to ensure they satisfy the conditions for monotonicity while minimizing the loss function.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. interpretability: MonoKAN sacrifices some flexibility in function approximation (compared to standard KANs) to achieve certified monotonicity and enhanced interpretability.
  - Complexity vs. performance: The clamping method adds complexity to the training process but is necessary to ensure monotonicity.

- Failure signatures:
  - Non-monotonic predictions: If the clamping method is not effective, the network may still learn parameters that violate monotonicity, leading to non-monotonic predictions.
  - Underfitting: If the clamping method is too restrictive, the network may not be able to learn complex patterns in the data, resulting in underfitting.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train MonoKAN on a synthetic dataset with known monotonic relationships and verify that the predictions align with the expected monotonic behavior.
  2. Compare the performance of MonoKAN with other monotonic neural network architectures (e.g., COMET, Min-Max Net) on standard benchmark datasets (e.g., COMPAS, Auto MPG).
  3. Visualize the learned cubic Hermite splines in MonoKAN to verify that they satisfy the conditions for monotonicity and provide insights into the network's decision-making process.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of MonoKAN compare to other monotonic methods when scaling to high-dimensional datasets with many monotonic features?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that KANs exhibit higher parameter counts for datasets with numerous input variables, but does not provide detailed scalability comparisons.
- Why unresolved: The experiments only tested datasets with a limited number of monotonic features, and the paper does not explore how MonoKAN performs with high-dimensional data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extensive benchmarking of MonoKAN on high-dimensional datasets with varying numbers of monotonic features, comparing both performance and parameter efficiency against other methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the monotonic constraints in MonoKAN be relaxed or adjusted to allow for non-monotonic relationships in specific regions of the input space while maintaining overall monotonicity?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses certified partial monotonicity across the entire input space but does not explore localized exceptions or flexibility in constraint application.
- Why unresolved: The current framework enforces strict monotonicity throughout, but there may be applications where localized non-monotonic behavior is acceptable or even beneficial.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of a modified MonoKAN architecture that allows for controlled exceptions to monotonicity in specific input regions, with validation on datasets where such flexibility would be advantageous.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of basis function (e.g., Sigmoid, SiLU) impact the performance and interpretability of MonoKAN?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using standard activation functions like Sigmoid or SiLU but does not provide a comparative analysis of different basis functions.
- Why unresolved: While the paper uses a specific basis function, it does not explore how different choices might affect model performance, interpretability, or the ease of enforcing monotonicity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic comparison of MonoKAN using various basis functions on multiple datasets, analyzing performance metrics, interpretability scores, and the robustness of monotonic constraints across different choices.

## Limitations
- The paper lacks comprehensive comparison with other certified monotonic architectures beyond MLPs
- Limited empirical validation of the clamping method's effectiveness across different problem domains
- Minimal evidence provided for enhanced interpretability claims, particularly for high-dimensional datasets

## Confidence
- Monotonicity claims: Medium confidence - Mathematical foundations are sound but limited empirical validation
- Interpretability claims: Low confidence - Minimal evidence provided for how learned monotonic relationships enhance human understanding
- Performance claims: Medium confidence - Strong results on tested datasets but limited comparison with other monotonic architectures

## Next Checks
1. **Monotonicity verification**: Implement a systematic test to verify that MonoKAN predictions maintain monotonic relationships across the full input domain, including regions outside the training data range, by checking the sign of partial derivatives.

2. **Ablation study**: Conduct experiments comparing MonoKAN with and without the clamping method, and with different numbers of spline knots, to quantify the trade-off between monotonicity certification and model performance.

3. **Cross-architecture comparison**: Evaluate MonoKAN against other certified monotonic architectures (COMET, Min-Max Net) on the same benchmark datasets to establish whether the KAN-based approach offers advantages in terms of accuracy, interpretability, or computational efficiency.
