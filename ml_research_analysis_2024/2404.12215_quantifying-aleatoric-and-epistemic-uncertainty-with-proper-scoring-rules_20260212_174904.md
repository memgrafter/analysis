# Quantifying Aleatoric and Epistemic Uncertainty with Proper Scoring Rules

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.12215
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12215
- Reference count: 4
- Primary result: Novel uncertainty measures for aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty using proper scoring rules

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a unified framework for quantifying aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in machine learning using proper scoring rules. The authors extend the framework to two common uncertainty representations: second-order distributions (Bayesian agents) and credal sets (Levi agents). By decomposing proper scoring rules into aleatoric and epistemic components, they derive novel uncertainty measures that offer a more faithful representation of an agent's belief compared to traditional entropy and mutual information approaches.

## Method Summary
The method involves decomposing proper scoring rules into aleatoric and epistemic components. For Bayesian agents, uncertainty is quantified using the expected loss reduction when predicting based on true knowledge versus uncertain belief. For Levi agents, uncertainty is measured using maximum and minimum expected losses over the credal set. The framework recovers and generalizes existing uncertainty measures, providing a unified approach for uncertainty quantification in different settings.

## Key Results
- Novel uncertainty measures derived by decomposing proper scoring rules into aleatoric and epistemic components
- Framework unifies Bayesian and Levi uncertainty representations under a single theoretical approach
- Proposed measures offer more faithful representation of agent's belief compared to entropy and mutual information methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Proper scoring rules naturally decompose into aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty terms
- Mechanism: The expected loss (risk) under a proper scoring rule splits into a divergence term (epistemic) and an entropy term (aleatoric)
- Core assumption: The scoring rule is strictly proper so that the divergence term is zero only when predictions match the true distribution
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We propose novel measures for the quantification of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty based on proper scoring rules"
  - [section] "It is well known that scoring rules and their corresponding expected losses can be decomposed into a divergence term and an entropy term"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Bayesian agents can quantify uncertainty by averaging over their posterior predictive distribution using proper scoring rules
- Mechanism: For a Bayesian agent, total uncertainty is the expected loss when predicting according to the posterior mean; aleatoric uncertainty is the expected loss when predicting the true distribution; epistemic uncertainty is the reduction in loss from gaining that knowledge
- Core assumption: The agent's belief is fully captured by the posterior predictive distribution p(θ)
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our framework establishes a natural bridge between these representations [Bayesian and Levi]"
  - [section] "Total uncertainty in (11) is the expected (log-)loss of the learner when predicting optimally (θ) on the basis of its uncertain belief p"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Levi agents can quantify uncertainty by taking extremal values over credal sets
- Mechanism: Aleatoric uncertainty is bounded by the infimum and supremum of entropy over the credal set; epistemic uncertainty is the maximal divergence between any two distributions in the set
- Core assumption: The credal set captures all plausible distributions under the agent's epistemic state
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We assume two common representations of (epistemic) uncertainty, namely, in terms of a credal set... or a second-order distribution"
  - [section] "For Levi agents, we have no way of computing an expectation, thus we 'max' over a (credal) set C"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Proper scoring rules
  - Why needed here: They provide the mathematical foundation for decomposing uncertainty into aleatoric and epistemic parts
  - Quick check question: What property must a scoring rule have to ensure honest probability forecasts?

- Concept: Credal sets vs second-order distributions
  - Why needed here: These are two distinct representations of epistemic uncertainty that the paper unifies under one framework
  - Quick check question: How does a credal set differ from a second-order distribution in representing ignorance?

- Concept: Entropy decomposition in information theory
  - Why needed here: It motivates the separation of total uncertainty into aleatoric and epistemic components
  - Quick check question: In the decomposition S(Y) = S(Y|Θ) + I(Y,Θ), which term corresponds to aleatoric uncertainty?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Scoring rule module → Expected loss calculator → Divergence/entropy decomposer → Uncertainty measure aggregator
- Critical path: Input distribution → scoring rule evaluation → expected loss computation → decomposition into AU and EU → output
- Design tradeoffs: Choosing log-loss vs Brier score vs spherical score trades off sensitivity to extreme probabilities vs calibration emphasis
- Failure signatures: Divergence terms blowing up with poor calibration; entropy terms dominated by a single class; mismatch between theoretical assumptions and empirical distributions
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify decomposition holds numerically on a synthetic dataset with known aleatoric/epistemic splits
  2. Compare Bayesian and Levi uncertainty estimates on a small credal set
  3. Stress test with uniform prior to ensure epistemic uncertainty behaves intuitively

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1

- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the proposed measures provide a "more faithful representation of the agent's belief and its uncertainty compared to traditional approaches based on entropy and mutual information."
- Why unresolved: The paper does not include empirical studies comparing the proposed measures to traditional information-theoretic measures
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing the proposed measures to traditional information-theoretic measures on various datasets and tasks

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do the proposed proper scoring rule-based measures of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty behave in different practical scenarios, such as in the presence of noisy data or imbalanced classes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that "In future work, we will extend the formal analysis of the proposed measures and elaborate on their properties. We will also conduct empirical studies to see how the measures behave in different practical scenarios."
- Why unresolved: The paper does not include empirical studies evaluating the behavior of the proposed measures in different practical scenarios
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies evaluating the behavior of the proposed measures in different practical scenarios, such as in the presence of noisy data or imbalanced classes

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do the proposed proper scoring rule-based measures of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty compare to other uncertainty quantification methods, such as Monte Carlo dropout or ensemble methods, in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper proposes novel uncertainty measures based on proper scoring rules, but does not compare them to other uncertainty quantification methods
- Why unresolved: The paper does not include empirical studies comparing the proposed measures to other uncertainty quantification methods
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing the proposed measures to other uncertainty quantification methods, such as Monte Carlo dropout or ensemble methods, in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency

## Limitations
- Framework relies heavily on choice of proper scoring rule, which can significantly affect uncertainty estimates
- Assumes access to true data distribution or credal sets, which may not be available in practice
- Computational complexity of evaluating extremal values over credal sets could be prohibitive for high-dimensional problems

## Confidence
- High confidence: The theoretical decomposition of proper scoring rules into divergence and entropy terms
- Medium confidence: The recovery of existing uncertainty measures through the proposed framework
- Medium confidence: The application of the framework to both Bayesian and Levi agents

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on real-world datasets with known aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty components to validate the practical utility of the proposed measures
2. Conduct sensitivity analysis to determine how the choice of scoring rule affects the uncertainty estimates and identify which rules are most appropriate for different prediction tasks
3. Evaluate the computational efficiency and scalability of the framework when applied to high-dimensional problems and large credal sets
