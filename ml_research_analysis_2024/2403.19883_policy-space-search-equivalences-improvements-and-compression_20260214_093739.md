- Three polynomial-time procedures enable efficient construction and compression of solution policies for FOND planning

## Executive Summary
This paper presents significant improvements to policy-space search for fully-observable non-deterministic (FOND) planning, specifically enhancing the A* with Non-Determinism (AND*) algorithm. The authors introduce polynomial-time procedures for constructing and compressing solution policies, along with three concepts of policy equivalence that enable substantial pruning of the search space. The work also incorporates structural state symmetries computed using group theory techniques and extends the algorithm with satisficing search methods. Empirical results demonstrate that AND* with these improvements generates two orders of magnitude fewer policies and achieves state-of-the-art coverage and solution compactness on benchmark domains, making policy-space search competitive with other state-of-the-art FOND planners.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces three core polynomial-time procedures: the concretizer, which transforms abstract policies into concrete ones; the compressor, which reduces policy size by eliminating redundant states; and a polynomial-time procedure for checking policy equivalence. Three concepts of policy equivalence are defined, enabling significant pruning of the search space by avoiding the generation of equivalent policies. The algorithm incorporates structural state symmetries using group theory techniques to further strengthen equivalence detection. The AND* algorithm is extended with satisficing search techniques including 2-WAND* and GBFSND, along with deadlock detection capabilities. These improvements collectively enable more efficient exploration of the policy space while maintaining solution quality.

## Key Results
- AND* with proposed improvements generates two orders of magnitude fewer policies compared to the original AND* algorithm
- Achieves state-of-the-art coverage and solution compactness on benchmark domains
- Makes policy-space search competitive with other state-of-the-art FOND planners

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness stems from three key mechanisms: First, the polynomial-time procedures for concretization and compression enable efficient transformation and reduction of policies without sacrificing completeness. Second, the three concepts of policy equivalence allow the algorithm to recognize when different policy search paths lead to essentially the same solution, enabling aggressive pruning of redundant exploration. Third, the incorporation of structural state symmetries using group theory techniques provides additional pruning opportunities by recognizing when states are fundamentally equivalent due to domain symmetries. These mechanisms work synergistically to reduce the effective search space while maintaining the ability to find optimal or near-optimal solutions.

## Foundational Learning

**FOND Planning**: Planning under uncertainty where actions have non-deterministic outcomes but the environment is fully observable. Why needed: This is the core problem domain the paper addresses. Quick check: The planner must handle multiple possible outcomes for each action while maintaining complete state information.

**Policy-Space Search**: A search paradigm that explores the space of policies rather than individual plans. Why needed: Unlike plan-space search, policy-space search can naturally handle non-determinism by defining policies that specify actions for all possible outcomes. Quick check: The algorithm searches through possible policies rather than individual deterministic plans.

**State Symmetries**: Structural properties where different states are equivalent under certain transformations. Why needed: Identifying symmetries allows the algorithm to avoid redundant exploration of equivalent states. Quick check: Group theory techniques are used to compute symmetries that enable additional pruning.

**Policy Equivalence**: Different policies that are semantically equivalent in their behavior. Why needed: Recognizing equivalent policies prevents redundant exploration of the search space. Quick check: Three different concepts of equivalence are defined, each enabling different levels of pruning.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input Domain -> State Symmetries Computation -> Policy Search (AND*) -> Concretizer -> Compressor -> Output Policy

Critical path: The algorithm starts with domain analysis to compute structural symmetries, then performs policy-space search using AND*, applying the concretizer to transform abstract policies and the compressor to reduce policy size. The equivalence checking procedure is applied throughout to prune redundant policies.

Design tradeoffs: The paper trades increased preprocessing time for symmetry computation against reduced search time. The polynomial-time procedures ensure scalability while the equivalence concepts provide aggressive pruning. The satisficing extensions trade optimality for faster solution discovery.

Failure signatures: Poor performance may result from domains with few symmetries (limiting pruning opportunities), overly complex domain structures that make symmetry computation expensive, or benchmark domains that don't exhibit the types of redundancies the equivalence concepts target.

First experiments:
1. Run AND* with improvements on a simple FOND domain with known symmetries to verify pruning effectiveness
2. Compare policy count and solution size against original AND* on benchmark domains
3. Test the satisficing variants (2-WAND*, GBFSND) on domains where finding any solution is challenging

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Empirical evaluation primarily compares against other policy-space planners rather than state-of-the-art heuristic search planners like LAO* or LAO*
- Structural symmetry computation may not scale to larger domains, though this is acknowledged as a limitation
- Claims about state-of-the-art coverage are based on specific benchmark domains and may not generalize to all FOND planning scenarios

## Confidence

High confidence in theoretical contributions: The polynomial-time procedures for concretizer and compressor are well-defined and the proof of equivalence concepts appears sound.

Medium confidence in empirical results: While the results show substantial improvements over AND*, the limited comparison set and benchmark selection reduce generalizability.

Low confidence in scalability claims: The paper doesn't provide comprehensive analysis of how the symmetry computation and compression techniques scale with problem size.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct comparative experiments against heuristic search planners (LAO*, LAO*) on the same benchmark domains to validate state-of-the-art claims.

2. Perform scalability analysis by testing the algorithm on larger FOND planning problems to verify practical limits of the symmetry computation and compression techniques.

3. Validate the coverage improvements on additional benchmark domains beyond those used in the paper to assess generalizability of the results.
