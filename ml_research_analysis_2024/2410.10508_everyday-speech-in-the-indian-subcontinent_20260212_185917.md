# Everyday Speech in the Indian Subcontinent

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Common Label Set (CLS) enables seamless code-switching across 13 Indian languages and English using native speaker voices

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of synthesizing multilingual speech in the Indian subcontinent, where 1369 languages with 22 official ones exist. A Common Label Set (CLS) based on phonetics was developed to handle the large vocabulary of units in End-to-End (E2E) frameworks for multilingual synthesis. The Indian language text is first converted to CLS, enabling seamless code switching across 13 Indian languages and English in a given native speaker's voice. The approach was evaluated using MOS (Mean Opinion Score) for naturalness and intelligibility, showing that monolingual synthesis using a voice other than the native tongue produces reasonable quality.

## Method Summary
The approach uses a Common Label Set (CLS) based on phonetics to address the issue of large vocabulary of units required in E2E frameworks for multilingual synthesis. Indian language text is first converted to CLS, which enables seamless code switching across 13 Indian languages and English in a given native speaker's voice. Zero-shot TTS synthesisers were built for Sanskrit and two Konkani dialects using modified CLS and parser. The system was trained on phonetic-rich datasets from IndicTTS with 13+ Indian languages recorded by native professionals at 48kHz, 16-bit resolution.

## Key Results
- Monolingual synthesis using a voice other than the native tongue produces reasonable quality (MOS 3.75-4.08)
- AXY discrimination test validated synthesis quality for two dialects of Konkani
- Text in a particular language can be synthesized using a voice from a different language, provided the languages share properties with the TTS system used

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The Common Label Set (CLS) allows multilingual TTS synthesis by mapping diverse Indian language phonemes to a unified phonetic inventory. By converting all Indian language text into CLS labels first, the system can use a single TTS model trained on one voice to synthesize speech in multiple languages. This bypasses the need for language-specific acoustic models while preserving native speaker characteristics.

### Mechanism 2
Language families and shared linguistic features enable zero-shot TTS synthesis for closely related languages. The system leverages phonetic and grammatical similarities between languages like Sanskrit and Telugu or Marathi and Konkani to synthesize speech in one language using a voice trained on another language from the same family.

### Mechanism 3
Code-switching naturalness is achieved by preserving the native speaker's voice characteristics across language boundaries. The system synthesizes mixed-language text by maintaining the original speaker's prosody and accent while switching between CLS-mapped languages, creating natural-sounding code-switched speech.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Phonetic transcription and International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how CLS maps diverse Indian language sounds to a unified phonetic system requires knowledge of phonetic transcription systems
  - Quick check question: How would you represent the retroflex consonants common in Indian languages using IPA?

- **Concept: Language families and linguistic convergence**
  - Why needed here: The paper relies on similarities between Indo-Aryan and Dravidian languages for cross-lingual synthesis, requiring understanding of language family relationships
  - Quick check question: What are the key phonological differences between Indo-Aryan and Dravidian language families?

- **Concept: End-to-End speech synthesis architectures**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses E2E frameworks, requiring understanding of how text-to-speech systems process phonetic inputs and generate audio
  - Quick check question: What is the role of duration prediction in E2E TTS systems?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Text preprocessing -> CLS conversion -> Phoneme sequence -> TTS model -> Audio output
- **Critical path**: 
  1. Text input in any of 13 Indian languages or English
  2. Parser converts text to CLS phonetic labels
  3. CLS labels fed to TTS model
  4. Model generates mel-spectrograms
  5. Vocoder converts to audio waveform
- **Design tradeoffs**: 
  - Coverage vs. precision: Expanding CLS to cover more languages increases footprint but enables more synthesis scenarios
  - Native voice preservation vs. language accuracy: Maintaining speaker characteristics may reduce language-specific pronunciation accuracy
  - Zero-shot capability vs. quality: Cross-lingual synthesis works but typically achieves lower MOS than native synthesis
- **Failure signatures**: 
  - Unintelligible output when synthesizing languages with minimal phonetic overlap
  - Naturalness degradation when code-switching between linguistically distant languages
  - Parser failures when encountering language-specific characters not in CLS
- **First 3 experiments**: 
  1. Synthesize simple sentences in Marathi using a Hindi-trained voice and measure MOS for intelligibility and naturalness
  2. Test code-switching synthesis with Hindi-English mixed text and evaluate naturalness with native speakers
  3. Evaluate zero-shot synthesis for Sanskrit using Telugu-trained voice and measure intelligibility scores

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the Common Label Set (CLS) approach perform for code-switching between languages with very different phonetic inventories (e.g., a Dravidian language and an Indo-Aryan language)?

### Open Question 2
What is the impact of the number of languages supported by the CLS on the quality of synthesis for individual languages?

### Open Question 3
How does the choice of TTS model (e.g., WaveNet, Glow-TTS) affect the quality of code-switched speech synthesis using the CLS approach?

## Limitations
- Technical implementation details are incomplete, lacking specific phonetic mappings and parser algorithms
- Evaluation scope focuses on perceptual naturalness rather than comprehensive linguistic accuracy
- Generalization claims to all Indian languages are not empirically validated across the full language spectrum

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The fundamental premise that phonetic similarities between Indian languages enable cross-lingual synthesis is well-supported by the linguistic literature and demonstrated through successful zero-shot synthesis for related languages like Konkani dialects.

**Medium Confidence**: The CLS approach for handling multilingual synthesis is conceptually sound and shows promising results, but the lack of detailed implementation specifications and limited evaluation scope reduces confidence in full reproducibility.

**Low Confidence**: Claims about seamless code-switching across all 13 Indian languages and English are supported by limited evidence. The generalization to all language pairs within the Indian subcontinent remains unproven.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Lingual Synthesis Validation**: Test the zero-shot synthesis approach by synthesizing Gujarati text using a Marathi-trained voice and measure both intelligibility and naturalness scores.

2. **Code-Switching Naturalness Assessment**: Generate code-switched sentences mixing Hindi and English, then conduct a perceptual evaluation with native speakers to determine if the synthetic output matches natural code-switching patterns.

3. **Zero-Shot Synthesis Robustness**: Attempt to synthesize Tamil text using a Hindi-trained voice and measure the degradation in quality compared to native Tamil synthesis.
