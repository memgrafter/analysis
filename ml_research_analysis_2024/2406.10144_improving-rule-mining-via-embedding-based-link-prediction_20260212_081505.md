# Improving rule mining via embedding-based link prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.10144
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10144
- Reference count: 40
- This paper proposes a novel method to improve rule mining on knowledge graphs by leveraging embedding-based link prediction

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach to enhance rule mining in knowledge graphs by leveraging embedding-based link prediction. The method uses pre-trained entity and relation embeddings to infer new plausible triples, which are then added to the original knowledge graph before applying rule mining systems. Experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that this approach can discover new rules on most knowledge graphs and achieve better link prediction performance on large datasets compared to expressive rule mining systems like AnyBURL. The method offers a scalable and effective alternative for rule mining on large knowledge graphs.

## Method Summary
The proposed method involves two main steps: first, using pre-trained entity and relation embeddings to infer new plausible triples through embedding-based link prediction; second, adding these inferred triples to the original knowledge graph and applying rule mining systems to discover new rules. The approach leverages the strengths of embedding models in capturing latent relationships between entities and relations to enrich the knowledge graph with additional information that can facilitate more comprehensive rule mining.

## Key Results
- The proposed method can discover new rules on most knowledge graphs, except for MUTAGENESIS with TransE and RotatE models
- The rules mined by the proposed approach achieve better link prediction performance on the largest datasets (DRKG and OPENBIOLINK) compared to expressive rule mining systems like AnyBURL
- The approach offers a scalable and effective alternative for rule mining on large knowledge graphs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The proposed approach works by enriching the knowledge graph with additional information that can facilitate more comprehensive rule mining. By leveraging pre-trained entity and relation embeddings to infer new plausible triples, the method captures latent relationships between entities and relations that may not be explicitly present in the original knowledge graph. This enrichment allows rule mining systems to discover new rules that might otherwise be missed, leading to improved link prediction performance on large datasets.

## Foundational Learning
- Knowledge Graphs: Structured representations of information using entities and relations - needed to understand the data structure being mined
- Rule Mining: Process of discovering logical rules from knowledge graphs - critical for understanding the core task
- Embedding-based Link Prediction: Using vector representations to infer missing links - essential for understanding how new triples are generated
- TransE and RotatE: Specific embedding models used for link prediction - important for understanding the technical implementation
- AnyBURL: An expressive rule mining system used as baseline - provides context for performance comparison

## Architecture Onboarding
Component Map: Knowledge Graph -> Embedding Model -> Inferred Triples -> Enriched Knowledge Graph -> Rule Mining System

Critical Path: The most important sequence is Knowledge Graph → Embedding Model → Inferred Triples → Rule Mining System, as each step directly feeds into the next.

Design Tradeoffs: The main tradeoff is between the computational cost of generating inferred triples and the potential improvement in rule mining quality. Using pre-trained embeddings offers efficiency but may limit flexibility.

Failure Signatures: Poor performance might manifest as:
- No new rules discovered on certain datasets
- Decreased link prediction accuracy after enrichment
- Computational resources being exhausted during triple inference

Three First Experiments:
1. Test the approach on a small, well-understood knowledge graph to verify basic functionality
2. Compare rule mining results with and without inferred triples on a medium-sized dataset
3. Evaluate the impact of different embedding models on rule mining performance using a single dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions, but potential areas for further research include:
- How to improve the method's performance on smaller datasets like MUTAGENESIS
- The impact of different embedding models and hyperparameters on rule mining performance
- The scalability and computational efficiency of the approach for very large knowledge graphs

## Limitations
- Inconsistent performance across different datasets and embedding models, with failure to discover new rules for MUTAGENESIS with TransE and RotatE models
- Uncertain scalability and computational overhead for very large knowledge graphs or multiple embedding models
- Potential quality issues with inferred triples, which could introduce noise and affect rule mining performance

## Confidence
- High confidence: The approach successfully discovers new rules on most tested knowledge graphs
- Medium confidence: The approach achieves better link prediction performance on DRKG and OPENBIOLINK compared to AnyBURL
- Low confidence: The method is scalable and computationally efficient for large knowledge graphs

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a detailed ablation study to understand the impact of different embedding models and hyperparameters on rule mining performance across various datasets
2. Perform a thorough analysis of computational complexity and runtime performance, comparing the proposed approach with baseline methods on increasingly large knowledge graphs
3. Implement a quality assessment mechanism for the inferred triples, measuring their accuracy and impact on rule mining performance through manual validation or comparison with ground truth data
