# CEL: A Continual Learning Model for Disease Outbreak Prediction by Leveraging Domain Adaptation via Elastic Weight Consolidation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.08940
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08940
- Reference count: 40
- The paper presents CEL, a continual learning model designed to predict disease outbreaks while mitigating catastrophic forgetting

## Executive Summary
The paper introduces CEL (Continual Learning for Disease Outbreak Prediction), a model that addresses catastrophic forgetting in disease outbreak prediction through domain adaptation using Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC). CEL combines LSTM networks with EWC regularization, using Fisher Information Matrix to identify and protect important parameters during incremental learning. The model segments time series data into contexts for domain-incremental learning, applying a regularization term to preserve knowledge from previous contexts while adapting to new data. Experiments on Mpox, Influenza, and Measles datasets demonstrate CEL's superior performance with higher R-squared values, 65% lower forgetting rate, and 18% higher memory stability compared to state-of-the-art models.

## Method Summary
CEL addresses continual learning for disease outbreak prediction by combining LSTM networks with Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC). The model segments time series data into discrete contexts, each representing a unique data distribution. For each context, CEL trains on 80% of the data while protecting parameters identified as important through Fisher Information Matrix calculations. EWC applies a regularization term that penalizes changes to parameters crucial for previous contexts, allowing the model to adapt to new data while retaining historical knowledge. This approach enables domain-incremental learning without task redefinition, making it suitable for evolving disease patterns.

## Key Results
- CEL achieves higher R-squared values compared to baseline models (GEM, XdG, EMC)
- CEL demonstrates 65% lower forgetting rate while maintaining historical knowledge
- CEL shows 18% higher memory stability in preserving insights from previous contexts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: EWC uses Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to identify and protect parameters most important for previous contexts, reducing catastrophic forgetting.
- Mechanism: After each context, FIM is computed as the expected value of the squared gradient of the loss with respect to parameters. Parameters with high FIM values are deemed critical and penalized for deviation from their previous values in the regularization term.
- Core assumption: High FIM values accurately reflect parameter importance across contexts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) is constructed with EWC to develop a regularization term that penalizes changes to important parameters"
  - [section] "The FIM captures the sensitivity of the learned probabilistic model to changes in the parameters" and "It penalizes changes to parameters that were important for the old context"
- Break condition: If FIM calculation does not reflect true parameter importance, EWC may over-penalize or under-penalize parameters, leading to either forgetting or inability to learn new contexts.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: CEL's data segmentation strategy divides time series into discrete contexts, enabling domain-incremental learning without task redefinition.
- Mechanism: Time series data is partitioned into N contexts, each representing a unique data distribution. Each context is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. Models are trained sequentially on cumulative training data while evaluated on context-specific test sets.
- Core assumption: Context boundaries capture meaningful shifts in data distribution relevant to disease outbreak patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We introduced a segmentation strategy by dividing the entire dataset into discrete 𝑁 contexts"
  - [section] "This segmentation strategy has two following objectives: By introducing diverse contexts and subjecting the model to both training and testing phases within each context, we simulate the model's exposure to evolving data distributions"
- Break condition: If context boundaries are poorly chosen or do not reflect actual distribution shifts, model performance may degrade due to either insufficient adaptation or unnecessary complexity.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: LSTM networks combined with EWC regularization enable sequential learning while maintaining long-term memory through gating mechanisms.
- Mechanism: LSTM uses forget gates (controlling what to retain from previous cell state), input gates (controlling what new information to store), and output gates (controlling what to output). EWC regularization protects important LSTM parameters while allowing others to adapt.
- Core assumption: LSTM's gating mechanisms effectively manage short-term and long-term dependencies in disease time series data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We chose Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) as a deep learning model for disease outbreak prediction because LSTM models are specifically designed to handle sequential data"
  - [section] "In LSTM cells, a crucial component termed the cell state 𝑐𝑡−1 acts as the long-term memory of the unit"
- Break condition: If disease data patterns are too complex or non-sequential for LSTM to capture, or if EWC regularization is too strong/weak, model performance will suffer.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Catastrophic forgetting in neural networks
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly addresses this as the core problem CEL solves
  - Quick check question: What happens to a neural network's performance on old tasks when trained on new data without any special mechanisms?

- Concept: Domain-incremental learning vs task-incremental learning
  - Why needed here: CEL operates in domain-incremental setting where the task remains constant but data distribution shifts
  - Quick check question: How does domain-incremental learning differ from task-incremental learning in terms of what changes between contexts?

- Concept: Fisher Information Matrix and its role in parameter importance
  - Why needed here: FIM is central to EWC's mechanism for identifying which parameters to protect
  - Quick check question: What does the Fisher Information Matrix measure in the context of neural network parameters?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data preprocessing: Min-max normalization and context segmentation
  - LSTM network: Core prediction model with 32 hidden dimensions
  - EWC module: Computes FIM and applies regularization
  - Evaluation framework: Custom metrics (R-squared, forgetting rate, memory stability)
  - Training loop: Sequential context processing with cumulative learning

- Critical path:
  1. Data segmentation into contexts
  2. Initialize LSTM with random weights
  3. For each context:
     - Train on context training data
     - Compute FIM for current parameters
     - Apply EWC regularization for subsequent contexts
     - Evaluate on context test data
  4. Compute forgetting and memory stability metrics

- Design tradeoffs:
  - More contexts → better adaptation but higher computational cost
  - Higher λ (EWC strength) → better retention but potentially slower learning
  - LSTM vs other architectures → good for sequential data but may struggle with very long dependencies

- Failure signatures:
  - High forgetting rate despite EWC → FIM not capturing true importance or λ too low
  - Poor adaptation to new contexts → λ too high or LSTM architecture inadequate
  - Inconsistent performance across diseases → context segmentation not appropriate for all disease patterns

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test CEL on single disease with varying numbers of contexts to find optimal N
  2. Compare CEL performance with and without EWC regularization
  3. Evaluate CEL on synthetic data with known distribution shifts to validate context segmentation strategy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the CEL model perform when applied to diseases with highly irregular or unpredictable outbreak patterns?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that CEL's effectiveness may vary depending on the characteristics of disease data, particularly when diseases demonstrate irregular or unpredictable patterns.
- Why unresolved: The experiments were conducted on three specific diseases (Mpox, Influenza, and Measles) which likely have more predictable patterns. The model's performance on diseases with truly irregular patterns remains untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing CEL on diseases with known irregular outbreak patterns (such as Ebola or Zika) and comparing its performance metrics (R-squared, forgetting rate, memory stability) to those of the baseline diseases.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How would CEL perform in a scenario where disease contexts change abruptly and significantly (e.g., emergence of a new disease variant)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that the model might face challenges when confronted with abrupt and significantly different context changes, such as emerging diseases with distinct patterns.
- Why unresolved: The experimental design used segmented time-series data where contexts changed gradually over time. No test was conducted on abrupt context shifts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Simulating abrupt context changes by training on normal disease data and then introducing data from a completely different disease or variant, then measuring performance degradation and adaptation speed.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does CEL compare to other state-of-the-art continual learning approaches when using RMSE instead of R-squared as the primary evaluation metric?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that despite the valuable insights provided by R-squared utilized in assessing the regression model, exclusive reliance on this metric is cautioned against. The inclusion of RMSE is recommended.
- Why unresolved: The paper primarily used R-squared for evaluation but acknowledged RMSE as a potentially valuable metric. No comparative analysis using RMSE was provided.
- What evidence would resolve it: Re-running all experiments and comparisons using RMSE as the primary metric, then analyzing whether the relative performance rankings of CEL versus baseline models change.

## Limitations
- The evaluation relies on relatively small disease datasets with limited context numbers, potentially restricting generalizability
- The context segmentation strategy's effectiveness across diverse disease types is not thoroughly explored
- Hyperparameter sensitivity, particularly EWC regularization strength, is not extensively studied

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core mechanism of EWC using FIM for parameter importance identification is well-established in continual learning literature and the paper correctly implements this foundational concept
- **Medium confidence**: The CEL model's superior performance metrics (higher R-squared, 65% lower forgetting rate, 18% higher memory stability) are supported by experimental results, though the small dataset sizes and limited hyperparameter exploration reduce confidence in robustness
- **Low confidence**: The generalizability of the context segmentation strategy across different disease types and the model's ability to handle highly complex or non-linear disease patterns without extensive hyperparameter tuning

## Next Checks
1. **Robustness testing**: Evaluate CEL on synthetic disease time series data with known, controllable distribution shifts to validate the context segmentation strategy's effectiveness
2. **Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary the EWC regularization strength λ and number of LSTM hidden dimensions to determine optimal configurations and assess model stability
3. **Cross-disease comparison**: Test CEL on additional disease datasets with varying temporal characteristics and outbreak patterns to evaluate generalizability beyond the three studied diseases
