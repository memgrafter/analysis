# Is it Still Fair? A Comparative Evaluation of Fairness Algorithms through the Lens of Covariate Drift

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.12428
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12428
- Reference count: 7
- Key outcome: This study examines how naturally occurring changes in data patterns—specifically covariate drift—impact the performance of fairness-aware machine learning algorithms. It evaluates 4 baseline and 7 fairness-aware algorithms across 5 real-world datasets (education, finance, employment, and criminal justice) using 3 predictive performance metrics and 10 fairness metrics. The analysis reveals that significant covariate drift, especially in important features, can lead to substantial deterioration in fairness, even for models designed to be fair. Contrary to prior assumptions, the magnitude and direction of drift do not reliably predict the resulting unfairness. None of the evaluated fairness algorithms consistently maintained their fairness guarantees under covariate drift, highlighting the need for continuous monitoring and context-specific evaluation. The findings underscore that algorithmic fairness is a complex interplay of multiple latent factors, and practitioners should consider time-varying dynamics when deploying fairness interventions.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates how naturally occurring changes in data patterns (covariate drift) impact the performance of fairness-aware machine learning algorithms. The researchers evaluate 4 baseline and 7 fairness-aware algorithms across 5 real-world datasets using 3 predictive performance metrics and 10 fairness metrics. The analysis reveals that significant covariate drift, especially in important features, can lead to substantial deterioration in fairness, even for models designed to be fair. Contrary to prior assumptions, the magnitude and direction of drift do not reliably predict the resulting unfairness. None of the evaluated fairness algorithms consistently maintained their fairness guarantees under covariate drift, highlighting the need for continuous monitoring and context-specific evaluation. The findings underscore that algorithmic fairness is a complex interplay of multiple latent factors, and practitioners should consider time-varying dynamics when deploying fairness interventions.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates 4 baseline machine learning models (Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest, SVM) and 7 fairness-aware algorithms (SUP, RW, DIR, PR, AdDeb, EQ, CEq) across 5 real-world datasets partitioned into 3 temporal seasons. The researchers measure covariate drift using Jensen-Shannon Distance and assess fairness using 10 metrics across 7 clusters. The experimental pipeline includes data partitioning by time periods, covariate importance ranking using SHAP values, drift measurement, baseline model training, fairness algorithm application, and comprehensive evaluation across performance and fairness metrics.

## Key Results
- Significant covariate drift in important features combined with high differential drift between groups is likely to cause unfairness
- Differential covariate drift does not reliably predict unfairness direction or magnitude, contrary to some existing literature
- None of the evaluated fairness algorithms consistently maintained their fairness guarantees under covariate drift
- Fairness algorithm performance is time-dependent and context-specific, making static snapshots potentially misleading

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Differential covariate drift does not reliably predict unfairness direction or magnitude
- Mechanism: Even when covariate distributions shift significantly for one demographic group, the resulting bias can favor either group, or be negligible, due to complex interactions between feature importance and decision boundaries
- Core assumption: The study's assumption that Pt(y|x) remains constant under covariate drift holds in practice
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "contrary to some existing literature, the size and direction of data distributional drift is not correlated to the resulting size and direction of unfairness"
  - [section 5.1] "unfairness does not always flow in the direction of the DCD" and "size of the DCD is not always proportional to size of the unfairness"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence; weak corpus match suggests this is a novel finding
- Break condition: If the Pt(y|x) assumption fails due to concept drift, the relationship between drift and unfairness could become more predictable

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Significant drift in important covariates combined with high differential drift between groups is likely to cause unfairness
- Mechanism: When high-importance features drift substantially and differentially across demographic groups, the model's learned relationships no longer generalize, leading to biased predictions
- Core assumption: Feature importance rankings remain stable across time periods
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.1] "Significant drifts coupled with high DCD in important covariates is likely to result in higher algorithmic unfairness"
  - [section 4.2] Discussion of covariate importance ranking using SHAP values and coefficient weights
  - [corpus] Weak corpus support; this mechanism appears to be an inference from the study's findings
- Break condition: If feature importance rankings change significantly between time periods, this mechanism may not hold

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Fairness algorithm performance is time-dependent and context-specific
- Mechanism: The fairness of an algorithm at one time point does not guarantee fairness at another, even with the same metric and domain, due to changing data distributions
- Core assumption: Covariate drift patterns vary across time periods and datasets
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "none of the evaluated fairness algorithms consistently maintained their fairness guarantees under covariate drift"
  - [section 5.2] "fairness of an algorithm is a function of time" and "claims of fairness on a static snapshot of data... can be misleading"
  - [corpus] Weak corpus support; this finding appears novel to the study
- Break condition: If data distributions remain stable over time, this mechanism would not apply

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Covariate drift vs. concept drift vs. target drift
  - Why needed here: The study focuses specifically on covariate drift, which affects feature distributions but not the underlying relationship between features and labels
  - Quick check question: If the conditional probability P(y|x) changes between training and test data, what type of drift is occurring?

- Concept: Fairness metrics classification and interpretation
  - Why needed here: The study uses 10 different fairness metrics across 7 clusters, requiring understanding of group vs. individual fairness and metric ranges
  - Quick check question: Which fairness metric measures the difference in false positive rates between demographic groups?

- Concept: Jensen-Shannon Distance for drift detection
  - Why needed here: The study uses JSD to quantify covariate drift, requiring understanding of this symmetric divergence measure
  - Quick check question: What is the range of JSD values, and what does a value of 0.1 indicate in this context?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data partitioning by time periods → Covariate importance ranking → Drift measurement using JSD → Baseline model training → Fairness algorithm application → Comprehensive evaluation across metrics and datasets
- Critical path: Time-based data partitioning → Covariate importance ranking → Drift measurement → Model training and testing → Fairness evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Balancing comprehensive evaluation (multiple algorithms, metrics, datasets) with experimental complexity; choosing appropriate drift significance threshold
- Failure signatures: Inconsistent fairness results across time periods; lack of correlation between drift magnitude and unfairness; sensitivity to baseline model choice
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce covariate drift patterns for a single dataset to verify JSD calculations and drift significance thresholds
  2. Train baseline models and verify feature importance rankings match the study's methodology
  3. Apply a single fairness algorithm to a single dataset and verify fairness metric calculations match the study's results

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The study assumes Pt(y|x) remains constant across time periods, which may not hold in real-world scenarios where concept drift occurs alongside covariate drift
- The analysis is constrained by the availability of only 5 datasets, limiting generalizability across diverse domains
- The study does not account for temporal dependencies or autocorrelation in the data, which could affect drift measurements and fairness evaluations

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the finding that fairness algorithms do not consistently maintain their guarantees under covariate drift, supported by systematic evaluation across multiple algorithms and datasets
- **Medium confidence** in the relationship between important covariate drift and unfairness, as the mechanism is inferred from the data rather than directly proven
- **Medium confidence** in the claim about the disconnect between drift magnitude and unfairness direction, as this appears to be a novel finding requiring further validation

## Next Checks
1. Test the Pt(y|x) assumption by conducting concept drift analysis on the datasets to determine if it holds in practice
2. Replicate the analysis with additional datasets from different domains to assess generalizability of the findings
3. Implement a sensitivity analysis by varying the temporal partitioning scheme to evaluate robustness of the drift measurements and fairness results
