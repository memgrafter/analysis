core_contribution: This study investigates how pretrained language models (PLMs) encode

# Probing structural constraints of negation in Pretrained Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.03070
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03070
- Reference count: 14
- This study investigates how pretrained language models encode negation scope and polarity licensing using syntactic probes.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how pretrained language models (PLMs) encode the semantic and structural impact of negation, particularly the adverb "not," using probe-based classifiers. The study tests whether contextual embeddings capture the presence of negation and the licensing of negative polarity items (NPIs) by training classifiers to predict negation presence and polarity item behavior. The method distinguishes between tokens within and outside the negation scope, controlling for distance to "not." Results indicate that embeddings from tokens inside the negation scope enable better prediction of both negation presence and correct NPI polarity, but similar trends appear for other lexical items when input tokens are in the same clause, suggesting PLMs primarily encode clause boundaries rather than negation-specific scope.

## Method Summary
The study employs probe-based classifiers trained on contextual embeddings from PLMs (BERT-base, RoBERTa-base, RoBERTa-large) to predict the presence of negation (not) and the polarity of masked NPI tokens. The dataset is constructed from a corpus of syntactic constructions known to license NPIs, with annotations identifying the syntactic zone (inside or outside negation scope) of input tokens. The probe architecture uses the [CLS] token embedding, and performance is compared across models while controlling for distance to the negation cue. Experiments include control conditions using other lexical items in the same clause to isolate negation-specific effects.

## Key Results
- Embeddings from tokens inside negation scope enable better prediction of both "not" presence and correct NPI polarity
- Similar accuracy trends appear for other lexical items when input tokens are in the same clause
- Performance varies across PLM architectures, with stronger effects in BERT-base and RoBERTa-large

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The probe methodology works by training classifiers to predict linguistic phenomena (negation presence, NPI polarity) from contextual embeddings, revealing what structural information PLMs encode. By comparing predictions based on tokens inside versus outside negation scope, the study isolates whether models capture scope boundaries. The control conditions with other lexical items help distinguish between general clause-level encoding and negation-specific structural knowledge.

## Foundational Learning
- Negation scope: The syntactic domain over which a negation operator influences meaning (why needed: central phenomenon under investigation; quick check: can you identify scope boundaries in "The boy is not in the park" vs "The boy is not happy")
- Negative polarity items: Words or phrases that require negation in their syntactic environment to be grammatical (why needed: key test case for scope licensing; quick check: is "any" licensed in "I have any money" vs "I don't have any money")
- Syntactic zone: The structural position of a token relative to a syntactic operator (why needed: operational definition for probe experiments; quick check: can you label tokens as inside/outside scope in sample sentences)
- Contextual embeddings: Word representations that vary based on surrounding context in PLMs (why needed: probe input features; quick check: do embeddings for "bank" differ in "river bank" vs "money bank")
- Probe classifiers: Simple models trained on PLM embeddings to test for specific linguistic knowledge (why needed: methodology for measuring encoded information; quick check: can you predict linguistic labels from embeddings)

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Corpus -> Probe training -> Classification accuracy comparison -> Negation vs clause boundary analysis

Critical path: The probe methodology follows the path: syntactic corpus construction → embedding extraction → classifier training → accuracy evaluation across scope conditions → comparison with control conditions to isolate negation-specific effects.

Design tradeoffs: The study trades comprehensive linguistic coverage for controlled experimental conditions, using a filtered subset of syntactic constructions to ensure reliable scope annotations. The probe-based approach measures encoded information but cannot directly observe how PLMs use this information during downstream tasks.

Failure signatures: If PLMs did not encode negation scope, we would expect similar prediction accuracy regardless of whether input tokens are inside or outside the negation scope. The observation that clause boundaries explain performance trends suggests the probe may be detecting general syntactic structure rather than negation-specific phenomena.

First experiments:
1. Train probe classifiers to predict "not" presence from embeddings of tokens at varying distances from negation
2. Compare prediction accuracy for NPI polarity using embeddings from inside versus outside negation scope
3. Test control conditions using other lexical items in the same clause to isolate negation-specific effects

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but the findings raise questions about how general clause boundary encoding relates to specific negation scope representation, and whether probe findings translate to practical language understanding in downstream tasks.

## Limitations
- Small corpus size (57 initial constructions, 13 after filtering) limits generalizability
- Probe methodology may not capture how PLMs actually use negation information during language tasks
- Findings may reflect general syntactic structure encoding rather than negation-specific phenomena
- Limited to English and specific negation forms (not + NPIs), leaving cross-linguistic questions open

## Confidence

- Negation scope encoding enables better prediction of negation presence: Medium
- PLMs encode clause boundaries more robustly than negation scope: High
- Structural constraint encoding varies across PLM architectures: Medium
- Probe accuracy reflects genuine semantic understanding of negation: Low

## Next Checks

1. Test the same probe methodology on synthetic datasets with controlled negation scope variations to isolate structural encoding from other linguistic factors
2. Conduct ablation studies removing clause boundary information to quantify its specific contribution versus negation scope effects
3. Evaluate model behavior on negation-related downstream tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis with negation) to assess whether probe findings translate to practical language understanding
