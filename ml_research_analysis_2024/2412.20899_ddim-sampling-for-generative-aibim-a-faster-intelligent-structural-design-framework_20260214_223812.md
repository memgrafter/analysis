# DDIM sampling for Generative AIBIM, a faster intelligent structural design framework

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.20899
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20899
- Reference count: 25
- Key outcome: DDIM sampling accelerates PCDM generation by factor of 100 while maintaining FID scores of 14.94-15.03

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the computational inefficiency of Generative AIBIM's PCDM module, which requires 1000 iterations for structural design generation. The authors adapt DDIM sampling to PCDM by modifying original formulations to suit PCDM's optimization process, which predicts shear walls rather than noise. Experiments demonstrate that DDIM sampling achieves the same visual quality with only 10-100 iterations, representing a 100x speedup. The study reorganizes DDIM content for practical use by non-experts in the field.

## Method Summary
The study modifies DDIM sampling to work with PCDM by changing the prediction target from noise (as in DDPM) to shear walls. This requires adapting the original DDIM formulations while preserving their mathematical properties. The modified method is tested with different sequence lengths (S=10, 20, 50, 100) and compared against the original PCDM using FID scores. The approach is validated on a modified-dataset of 700 training images and 24 test images from the Generative AIBIM repository.

## Key Results
- DDIM sampling achieves 100x acceleration compared to PCDM's original 1000 iterations
- FID scores remain comparable: PCDM (1000 iterations) = 14.94, DDIM (S=100) = 14.39
- Visual quality maintained across different sequence lengths (S=10, 20, 50, 100)
- Deterministic DDIM sampling reduces variance compared to stochastic DDPM

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: DDIM sampling for PCDM can reduce sampling iterations from 1000 to as few as 10 while maintaining image quality.
- Mechanism: By modifying the original DDIM formulations to suit PCDM's optimization process, the sampling chain length can be shortened without compromising the quality of generated structural designs.
- Core assumption: The equivalence between sub-sequences and the original sampling chain {1,2,… ,T} holds for PCDM when the sampling rule is appropriately modified.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Experimental results demonstrate that DDIM sampling for PCDM can accelerate the generation process of the original PCDM by a factor of 100 while maintaining the same visual quality in the generated results."
  - [section] "The experimental results, presented in Section 3, demonstrate that DDIM can accelerate the generation process of PCDM by a factor of 100 while maintaining the same level of generation quality."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; related papers focus on acceleration but not specifically on PCDM modification.
- Break condition: If the modified sampling rule fails to maintain equivalence with the original chain, visual quality will degrade despite faster generation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The deterministic nature of DDIM sampling reduces sampling variance compared to DDPM.
- Mechanism: Setting the hyperparameter η to 0 in DDIM eliminates stochastic noise injection during sampling, making the process deterministic while preserving generation quality.
- Core assumption: The deterministic path can reach the same quality modes as the stochastic DDPM path when properly initialized.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Then, we can notice that the DDIM sampling process is deterministic in comparison to DDPM sampling."
  - [abstract] "DDIM effectively reduces the length of sampling chains while ensuring the generation of high-quality results."
  - [corpus] Limited direct evidence; related papers discuss deterministic vs stochastic but not specifically for structural design.
- Break condition: If the deterministic path gets trapped in poor-quality modes not reachable by the stochastic process.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Modifying DDIM to predict shear walls directly (rather than noise) makes it compatible with PCDM's optimization process.
- Mechanism: Instead of predicting noise as in DDPM, PCDM predicts shear walls, requiring adaptation of DDIM formulations to work with this different prediction target.
- Core assumption: The mathematical structure of DDIM can be preserved while changing the prediction target from noise to structural elements.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "While the original DDIM was designed for DDPM and the optimization process of PCDM differs from that of DDPM, this paper designs 'DDIM sampling for PCDM,' which modifies the original DDIM formulations to adapt to the optimization process of PCDM."
  - [section] "The original DDIM is designed for DDPM, and in the optimization process of DDPM, the prediction of the neural network is noise ε̂=ε̂_θ(x_t,t). While in the optimization process of PCDM, the prediction is shear walls ŝ_0^t=f_θ(x_t,t,y,d)."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus; this appears to be novel methodology.
- Break condition: If the modified formulations fail to properly incorporate the shear wall prediction into the sampling process.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Diffusion models and their sampling process
  - Why needed here: Understanding how DDPM works is essential to grasp why DDIM can accelerate it and how modifications are made
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between the forward diffusion process and reverse denoising process in diffusion models?

- Concept: Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) metric
  - Why needed here: FID is used to quantitatively evaluate whether DDIM maintains the same visual quality as DDPM
  - Quick check question: What does a lower FID score indicate about the quality of generated images?

- Concept: Markov chains in sampling
  - Why needed here: Both DDPM and DDIM use Markov chains for sampling, and understanding this helps explain how DDIM can use subsequences
  - Quick check question: Why does DDPM require 1000 iterations while DDIM can use fewer steps?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - PCDM model (pre-trained) -> DDIM sampling module -> Conditioning inputs -> Evaluation module

- Critical path:
  1. Initialize with noise x_T ~ N(0,I)
  2. Apply modified DDIM sampling rule for S steps
  3. At each step t_i, predict shear walls ŝ_0^(t_i) = f_θ(x_t_i, t_i, y, d)
  4. Generate final design x̂_0 = ŝ_0^(t_i) + infill walls
  5. Evaluate using FID metric

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Speed vs. quality: More steps (higher S) gives better quality but slower generation
  - Deterministic vs. stochastic: DDIM eliminates noise but may miss some modes
  - Model compatibility: Modifications needed to adapt DDIM for PCDM's different prediction target

- Failure signatures:
  - FID score significantly worse than baseline PCDM
  - Visual artifacts in generated designs (e.g., missing walls, irregular boundaries)
  - Convergence issues during sampling (oscillating or stuck designs)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test DDIM sampling with S=100 steps and compare FID to PCDM's S=1000
  2. Test deterministic vs. stochastic variants by varying η parameter
  3. Test different conditioning inputs (building heights, earthquake intensities) to ensure generalization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the choice of different DDIM sampling hyperparameters (e.g., the value of $\eta$) affect the quality and diversity of the generated structural designs beyond the tested cases of $\eta = 0$ and $\eta = 1$?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that $\eta$ is a controllable hyperparameter and that DDIM sampling is deterministic when $\eta = 0$, while it becomes equivalent to DDPM sampling when $\eta = 1$.
- Why unresolved: The study only tested these two extreme values of $\eta$, leaving a gap in understanding the intermediate values and their impact on the generation process.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments varying $\eta$ across a range of values and analyzing the resulting FID scores and visual quality of generated designs.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the DDIM sampling method be further optimized for PCDM to achieve even faster generation times without compromising the quality of the structural designs?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates a 100x acceleration in generation time using DDIM sampling for PCDM, but does not explore potential further optimizations.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on proving the effectiveness of DDIM sampling but does not investigate additional optimizations that could enhance the speed or quality of the generation process.
- What evidence would resolve it: Research into alternative DDIM configurations, model architectures, or training strategies that could yield even greater speedups or improved design quality.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of DDIM sampling for PCDM compare to other accelerated sampling methods for diffusion models in terms of both speed and design quality?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper introduces DDIM sampling as a solution to the computational inefficiency of PCDM but does not compare its performance to other potential methods.
- Why unresolved: The study does not provide a comparative analysis with other sampling techniques that could potentially offer similar or better performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking DDIM sampling against other accelerated sampling methods, such as Adversarial Diffusion Distillation (ADD) or Classifier-Free Guidance, using the same dataset and evaluation metrics.

## Limitations

- The modifications to DDIM for PCDM's shear wall prediction are described conceptually but lack complete implementation details
- Evaluation relies on a small test set (24 images) and uses only FID metric without considering structural validity or architectural-specific quality measures
- The study doesn't explore whether acceleration benefits extend to other architectural elements beyond shear walls

## Confidence

- High confidence: Core claim that DDIM sampling can accelerate PCDM by factor of 100 while maintaining visual quality
- Medium confidence: Specific modifications made to adapt DDIM for PCDM's shear wall prediction
- Medium confidence: Generalizability of results across different architectural scenarios

## Next Checks

1. **Structural Validity Testing**: Implement additional validation checks to ensure that accelerated designs maintain not just visual similarity but also structural integrity and compliance with building codes. This should include expert architectural review and automated structural analysis tools.

2. **Cross-Architecture Generalization**: Test the DDIM-PCDM approach on different architectural styles and building types beyond the current dataset to verify whether the acceleration benefits transfer to diverse design scenarios. This includes testing with varying building heights, seismic zones, and architectural complexity.

3. **Ablation Studies on DDIM Modifications**: Conduct controlled experiments isolating the effects of each modification made to adapt DDIM for PCDM. This includes testing different prediction target formulations, noise schedule adaptations, and sampling rule variations to identify which modifications are essential versus optional for maintaining quality.
