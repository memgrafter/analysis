# Distantly Supervised Morpho-Syntactic Model for Relation Extraction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.10002
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10002
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Method achieves precision scores up to 0.85 on six relation types using morpho-syntactic patterns from distant supervision

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a method for extracting and categorizing relationships from text using morpho-syntactic extraction patterns obtained via distant supervision from Wikidata and Wikipedia. The approach builds Syntactic and Semantic Indices to extract and classify candidate graphs. The Syntactic Index stores morpho-syntactic extraction patterns indexed by their anchor node, while the Semantic Index is a TF-IDF weighted matrix mapping words to properties. The method achieves high precision scores of up to 0.85 on six datasets, but with lower recall and F1 scores. Most errors stem from missing anchors or patterns in the Syntactic Index. The approach enables rapid creation of rule-based information extraction systems and weakly annotated datasets for training machine learning classifiers.

## Method Summary
The method relies on distant supervision from Wikidata triples to automatically label sentences and extract morpho-syntactic patterns. It identifies anchor nodes (nodes with only outgoing edges) in dependency graphs and stores patterns under these anchors. Isomorphic graph matching is used to avoid duplicate patterns. A TF-IDF weighted Semantic Index maps words to properties for classification. Candidate graphs are extracted using the Syntactic Index and classified using the Semantic Index with harmonic mean of semantic scores. The approach is evaluated on French Wikipedia sentences for six relation types.

## Key Results
- Precision scores up to 0.85 on six relation types (spouse, dateOfBirth, educatedAt, dateOfDeath, placeOfBirth, occupation)
- Lower recall and F1 scores due to missing anchors and patterns in Syntactic Index
- Most errors attributed to distant supervision noise and insufficient semantic context
- Method enables rapid creation of rule-based IE systems and weakly annotated datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Distant supervision leverages Wikidata triples to automatically label sentences without manual annotation, enabling large-scale pattern collection. If two entities appear in a Wikidata triple, the method assumes at least one sentence mentioning both expresses that relation, providing weak labels for pattern extraction. Core assumption: Any sentence containing both entities in the triple reflects the stated relation, even though multiple relations may exist between the same entities.

### Mechanism 2
Morpho-syntactic patterns indexed by anchor nodes enable precise extraction of relation expressions from dependency graphs. The method identifies anchor nodes (nodes with only outgoing edges) in dependency graphs, stores patterns under these anchors, and uses isomorphic graph matching to avoid duplicates. Core assumption: The anchor node uniquely identifies a syntactic pattern for a relation, and isomorphic graph comparison ensures morphological and syntactic identity.

### Mechanism 3
TF-IDF weighted Semantic Index maps words to properties, enabling classification of extracted graphs by semantic similarity. For each property, word frequencies are calculated across all graphs labeled with that property, transformed into TF-IDF weights, and stored in a word×property matrix for semantic scoring. Core assumption: Word frequency in dependency graph contexts correlates with property relevance, and TF-IDF weighting appropriately balances common and discriminative terms.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Dependency parsing and Shortest Dependency Path extraction
  - Why needed here: The method relies on extracting the shortest path between entities in dependency graphs to capture relation expressions
  - Quick check question: Given a sentence "John, who was born in Paris, studied at Harvard", what would be the shortest dependency path between "John" and "Paris"?

- Concept: TF-IDF weighting and semantic similarity
  - Why needed here: The Semantic Index uses TF-IDF weights to measure association between words and properties for classification
  - Quick check question: If the word "born" appears in 10% of graphs labeled "placeOfBirth" but only 1% of all graphs, what would its TF-IDF weight look like for this property?

- Concept: Isomorphic graph matching
  - Why needed here: The method removes duplicate patterns by checking if candidate graphs are isomorphic to stored patterns
  - Quick check question: Given two dependency graphs with identical edge connectivity but different node labels, are they considered isomorphic under this method's definition?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data Collection Pipeline → Syntactic Index Builder → Semantic Index Builder → Classification Pipeline → Evaluation Pipeline
- Critical path: Data Collection → Syntactic Index Creation → Semantic Index Creation → Graph Extraction → Graph Classification → Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Distant supervision enables automatic labeling but introduces noise; morpho-syntactic patterns provide precision but may miss semantic variations; TF-IDF indexing is efficient but may miss contextual information.
- Failure signatures: High precision but low recall suggests missing patterns in Syntactic Index; misclassification errors suggest insufficient semantic context or incorrect distant supervision labels.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run classification on Development set with semantic threshold=0 and analyze precision/recall breakdown by relation type
  2. Compare isomorphic vs non-isomorphic pattern matching by running with relaxed graph matching conditions
  3. Evaluate impact of distant supervision noise by comparing Weak vs Ground Truth Semantic Index performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the performance of the morpho-syntactic approach compare to neural relation extraction models on document-level RE tasks? The paper evaluates the approach on sentence-level SDP graphs but mentions future work to evaluate document-level RE performance. This remains unresolved as the current evaluation is limited to sentence-level dependency graphs, and no comparison is made to neural models on document-level tasks.

### Open Question 2
What is the impact of using Named Entity Recognition (NER) preprocessing on the precision of the morpho-syntactic extraction patterns? The paper suggests that NER preprocessing may improve pattern precision but does not experimentally validate this claim. This remains unresolved as the current implementation relies on fuzzy matching without NER, and the potential benefits of NER are not quantified.

### Open Question 3
How scalable is the approach to languages with different syntactic structures, such as agglutinative or non-configurational languages? The method is described as multilingual but only evaluated on French; no analysis of performance across diverse language families is provided. This remains unresolved as the evaluation is limited to one language, and no discussion of challenges or adaptations needed for other language types is included.

## Limitations

- High precision but low recall due to missing anchors and patterns in Syntactic Index
- Distant supervision introduces noise when entities participate in multiple relationships
- TF-IDF based Semantic Index may not capture semantic variations or contextual information beyond candidate graph

## Confidence

- High confidence: Distant supervision for pattern collection and morpho-syntactic patterns indexed by anchors
- Medium confidence: Isomorphic graph matching for duplicate removal and TF-IDF weighting for semantic classification
- Low confidence: Claim that method can handle "an unrestricted set of relationships" given observed precision-recall tradeoffs

## Next Checks

1. Conduct error analysis to quantify distant supervision errors by manually annotating sample sentences to determine how often assumed relation matches actual expressed relation.
2. Test impact of relaxing anchor node constraint by running classification with patterns indexed by different node types and measuring recall improvements versus precision degradation.
3. Evaluate method's robustness to entity linking errors by introducing controlled noise in entity recognition and measuring degradation in precision and recall scores.
