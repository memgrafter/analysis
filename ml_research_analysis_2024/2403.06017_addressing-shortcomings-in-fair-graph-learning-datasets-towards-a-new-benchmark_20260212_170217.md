# Addressing Shortcomings in Fair Graph Learning Datasets: Towards a New Benchmark

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.06017
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06017
- Authors: Xiaowei Qian; Zhimeng Guo; Jialiang Li; Haitao Mao; Bingheng Li; Suhang Wang; Yao Ma
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces new synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets specifically designed for fair evaluation of graph-based models, addressing critical shortcomings in existing fair graph learning datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper identifies fundamental problems with existing fair graph learning datasets, which often fail to provide meaningful graph structure information, making it difficult to properly assess fair graph learning methods. The authors develop a comprehensive framework for generating new datasets with controllable bias parameters that ensure graph edges represent connections not inferable from node features alone. Their extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed datasets effectively challenge existing methods, revealing performance gaps between standard GNNs, MLPs, and fairness-focused approaches while providing a standardized evaluation protocol for the field.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a framework for generating synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets with controllable bias parameters to ensure meaningful graph structure. They implement a unified model selection strategy (Algorithm 1) using adaptive thresholds and multiple performance metrics to enable fair comparison across different methods. The evaluation pipeline trains baseline models (MLP, GCN) alongside fair models (FairGNN, NIFTY) on these datasets, measuring both utility (ACC, AUC, F1) and fairness (ΔSP, ΔEO) metrics. The approach ensures that graph structure encodes information orthogonal to node features, forcing models to utilize graph structure to improve performance while testing their ability to mitigate bias.

## Key Results
- The proposed datasets reveal significant performance gaps between standard GNNs, MLPs, and fairness-focused approaches
- Graph structure can both enhance utility and amplify bias simultaneously, requiring sophisticated fair graph learning methods
- The unified model selection strategy provides consistent evaluation across different fair graph learning methods
- Synthetic datasets with controllable bias parameters effectively challenge existing methods and highlight limitations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Graph structure provides additional predictive information when it captures non-redundant relationships not present in node features
- Mechanism: Synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets are constructed to ensure graph edges represent connections that cannot be inferred from feature similarity alone
- Core assumption: Graph structure encodes information orthogonal to node features
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Many existing datasets fail to provide meaningful graph structure information, making it difficult to properly assess fair graph learning methods"
  - [section 5.1.1]: "Our focus is on scenarios with binary sensitive attributes and binary labels, where the probability of edge creation directly influences the accuracy of specific groups"
- Break condition: If edge generation probability is set based solely on feature similarity, graph structure becomes redundant and MLP outperforms GNNs

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Fair graph learning methods can exploit graph structure for improved accuracy while simultaneously mitigating bias introduced by the structure
- Mechanism: The proposed datasets include controllable bias parameters that allow researchers to test whether models can leverage graph information without amplifying sensitive attribute correlations
- Core assumption: Graph structure can both enhance utility and amplify bias simultaneously
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The results show that graph structure can both enhance utility and amplify bias, highlighting the need for sophisticated fair graph learning methods"
  - [section 5.1.3]: "Syn-2 demonstrates an unbalanced group ratio... which engenders significant unfairness in MLP predictions"
- Break condition: If the bias amplification effect is too strong, even sophisticated fair methods cannot maintain both high accuracy and fairness

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: A unified model selection strategy is essential for fair comparison across different fair graph learning methods
- Mechanism: The proposed strategy (Algorithm 1) uses adaptive thresholds and multiple performance metrics to balance utility and fairness across different methods
- Core assumption: Inconsistent model selection strategies can mask or exaggerate performance differences between methods
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3]: "Our investigation in Section 3 highlights that the choice of model selection strategy significantly affects both model performance and fairness"
  - [section 3]: "Table 1 shows the result of running NIFTY-GCN with these three model selection strategies on the German dataset"
- Break condition: If different methods respond differently to the same model selection criteria, the strategy may need refinement

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and their message-passing mechanism
  - Why needed here: Understanding how GNNs aggregate information from neighbors is crucial for grasping why graph structure can provide additional predictive power
  - Quick check question: How does a GCN layer update node representations using neighboring information?

- Concept: Fairness metrics (Statistical Parity and Equal Opportunity)
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates models using these specific fairness metrics, so understanding their calculation and interpretation is essential
  - Quick check question: What is the mathematical difference between Statistical Parity and Equal Opportunity?

- Concept: Counterfactual fairness and causal reasoning
  - Why needed here: Some of the evaluated methods (like NIFTY) are based on counterfactual fairness principles
  - Quick check question: How does counterfactual fairness differ from traditional statistical fairness approaches?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data generation module -> Model selection strategy -> Evaluation pipeline -> Benchmark methods
- Critical path:
  1. Generate datasets with controllable bias parameters
  2. Train models using unified model selection strategy
  3. Evaluate across multiple fairness and utility metrics
  4. Compare results to identify strengths/weaknesses
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Dataset complexity vs. interpretability
  - Bias control vs. real-world applicability
  - Model selection strictness vs. practical usability
- Failure signatures:
  - MLP outperforming GNNs consistently
  - All methods showing similar fairness metrics
  - Model selection strategy producing inconsistent results
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce Table 3 results on German dataset to verify baseline performance
  2. Run Algorithm 1 on a small synthetic dataset to test model selection strategy
  3. Compare FairGNN and NIFTY performance on Syn-1 dataset to understand method differences

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we quantitatively measure and compare the utility of graph structure information across different fair graph learning datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies that many datasets fail to provide meaningful information in edges, challenging the necessity of graph structures. The authors propose new datasets specifically designed to enhance graph structure utility.
- Why unresolved: While the paper introduces new datasets designed to enhance graph structure utility, there is no established metric or framework for quantitatively measuring and comparing the utility of graph structure information across different datasets in the field.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of a standardized metric that quantifies how much additional predictive information graph structure provides beyond node features alone, along with empirical validation across multiple datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal model selection strategy for fair graph learning that balances utility and fairness without manual threshold tuning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies inconsistency in model selection strategies across fair graph learning methods and proposes a unified approach with adaptive thresholds, but acknowledges that this strategy may still require refinement.
- Why unresolved: The proposed model selection strategy in the paper uses fixed threshold intervals (90%-95%) and three classification metrics, but the optimal parameters may vary across different datasets and fairness definitions, and there is no systematic method to determine the best strategy.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic evaluation of different model selection strategies across diverse datasets, comparison of automated threshold selection methods, and empirical demonstration of improved fairness-utility trade-offs.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we systematically generate synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets that accurately reflect real-world bias patterns in graph-structured data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces a framework for generating synthetic datasets with controllable bias parameters and demonstrates its effectiveness, but acknowledges that real-world bias patterns are complex and multifaceted.
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides a method for generating datasets with controllable bias, real-world data often exhibits more complex and subtle bias patterns that may not be fully captured by the current framework, particularly in terms of structural bias amplification.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of more sophisticated data generation models that incorporate real-world bias patterns identified through empirical studies, along with validation against diverse real-world datasets.

## Limitations

- The generalizability of synthetic dataset results to complex real-world scenarios remains uncertain
- The unified model selection strategy's universal applicability across diverse graph structures and fairness definitions is not extensively tested
- The paper does not investigate whether the finding that graph structure both enhances utility and amplifies bias holds when graph structure contains more nuanced information beyond controlled bias parameters

## Confidence

**Confidence: Medium** for claims about dataset effectiveness. While the authors demonstrate that their synthetic datasets reveal performance gaps between methods, the generalizability to real-world scenarios remains uncertain.

**Confidence: Low** for the unified model selection strategy's universal applicability. The paper claims Algorithm 1 provides fair comparison across methods, but does not extensively test this across diverse graph structures or fairness definitions.

**Confidence: Medium** for the claim that graph structure both enhances utility and amplifies bias. The synthetic datasets show this pattern, but the paper does not investigate whether this finding holds when graph structure contains more nuanced information.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Test the proposed methods on additional real-world datasets not included in the original study to assess generalizability of the benchmark results.

2. **Alternative fairness metrics**: Evaluate the same models using additional fairness definitions (e.g., equalized odds, predictive parity) to determine if the observed patterns persist across different fairness criteria.

3. **Model selection robustness**: Conduct sensitivity analysis by varying the model selection thresholds in Algorithm 1 to verify that the comparison results remain consistent under different selection criteria.
