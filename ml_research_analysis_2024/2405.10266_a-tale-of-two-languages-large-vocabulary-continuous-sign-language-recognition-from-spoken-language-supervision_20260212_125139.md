# A Tale of Two Languages: Large-Vocabulary Continuous Sign Language Recognition from Spoken Language Supervision

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.10266
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10266
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Joint training on CSLR and retrieval tasks significantly outperforms strong baselines, achieving WER of 65.5 on CSLR-TEST and top-5 retrieval accuracy of 45.2% on SENT-TEST.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of large-vocabulary continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) and sign language retrieval using weak supervision from pseudo-labels and subtitles. The authors propose CSLR2, a multi-task Transformer model that jointly learns a shared embedding space between signed and spoken language. By carefully designing loss functions and leveraging context from both tasks, the model demonstrates mutual benefits: retrieval improves CSLR performance by providing context, while CSLR enhances retrieval with fine-grained supervision. The approach significantly outperforms strong baselines on both tasks.

## Method Summary
The method trains a multi-task Transformer model (CSLR2) that jointly learns a shared embedding space between signed and spoken language. The model uses sign-level pseudo-labels generated by an ISLR model and weakly-aligned subtitles as supervision. A Video-Swin model extracts isolated sign embeddings, which are then processed by a Transformer encoder for context-aware representations. The text encoder uses a frozen T5 model. The model is trained with contrastive HN-NCE losses for both sentence-level and sign-level retrieval tasks, with hard-negative reweighting to focus on difficult examples.

## Key Results
- Achieves WER of 65.5 on the new CSLR-TEST benchmark
- Top-5 retrieval accuracy of 45.2% on SENT-TEST
- Outperforms strong baselines on both CSLR and retrieval tasks
- Demonstrates mutual benefit between CSLR and retrieval tasks through joint training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Joint training on CSLR and retrieval tasks improves performance on both tasks compared to single-task training.
- Mechanism: The shared joint embedding space allows the model to leverage context from both tasks, with CSLR providing fine-grained supervision for sign-level distinctions and retrieval providing broader sentence-level context. The HN-NCE loss with hard-negative reweighting improves the quality of the learned embeddings by focusing on difficult negative examples.
- Core assumption: The shared embedding space is sufficiently rich to represent both fine-grained sign distinctions and broader sentence semantics without conflicting objectives.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We demonstrate that by a careful choice of loss functions, training the model for both the CSLR and retrieval tasks is mutually beneficial in terms of performance – retrieval improves CSLR performance by providing context, while CSLR improves retrieval with more fine-grained supervision."
  - [section] "Our model significantly outperforms strong baselines on both our new CSLR benchmark and existing retrieval benchmarks."
  - [corpus] Weak/no direct evidence in corpus that the mutual benefit is specifically due to the joint embedding space rather than just more data or training signals.
- Break condition: If the joint embedding space becomes too constrained or if the tasks require fundamentally incompatible representations, performance on one or both tasks would degrade.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Weak supervision from pseudo-labels and subtitles can effectively train a large-vocabulary CSLR model.
- Mechanism: The ISLR model provides continuous pseudo-labels that serve as training targets for the CSLR task, while the weakly-aligned subtitles provide sentence-level supervision for the retrieval task. Post-processing of pseudo-labels (confidence thresholding, removing non-consecutive predictions) reduces noise.
- Core assumption: The pseudo-labels, despite being noisy, contain enough correct information to guide the model toward learning meaningful sign representations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We further show the benefits of leveraging weak and noisy supervision from large-vocabulary datasets such as BOBSL, namely sign-level pseudo-labels, and English subtitles."
  - [section] "Our model significantly outperforms the previous state of the art on both tasks."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - the corpus mentions other works using pseudo-labels but doesn't directly validate this specific approach's effectiveness.
- Break condition: If the pseudo-label noise exceeds a threshold, the model would learn incorrect associations and performance would degrade.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The contrastive HN-NCE loss with max-pooling outperforms standard InfoNCE with CLS tokens for video-text retrieval.
- Mechanism: HN-NCE reweights hard negatives to be more influential in training, while max-pooling captures the most salient features across time rather than relying on a learned CLS token that may not be optimal for all videos.
- Core assumption: Hard negatives are more informative for learning discriminative embeddings than uniformly sampled negatives, and that max-pooling captures more relevant temporal information than CLS tokens.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We observe a clear boost in all metrics by using HN-NCE with our weakly-aligned data, which gives more weight to the hard-negatives when computing the contrastive loss: there is a minimum improvement of +7 R@1 for T2V comparisons."
  - [section] "We further observe that max-pooling the visual Transformer encoder outputs, instead of using a learnable cls token, consistently gives better results."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for these specific design choices; claims are based on the authors' ablation studies.
- Break condition: If the hard-negative reweighting overemphasizes difficult examples that are actually outliers or if max-pooling discards important contextual information.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contrastive learning and InfoNCE loss
  - Why needed here: The core training objective relies on learning embeddings where similar video-text pairs are close and dissimilar pairs are far apart in the joint embedding space.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between InfoNCE and the more traditional triplet loss, and why is InfoNCE more suitable for this problem?

- Concept: Transformer architecture and self-attention
  - Why needed here: The model uses Transformer encoders to process both video and text sequences, requiring understanding of how self-attention works and how positional encodings are handled.
  - Quick check question: How does the Transformer encoder process the sequence of sign video embeddings to produce context-aware representations?

- Concept: Weak supervision and pseudo-labeling
  - Why needed here: The model is trained using noisy pseudo-labels generated by an ISLR model rather than human-annotated sign-level labels.
  - Quick check question: What are the potential sources of noise in the pseudo-labeling process, and how does the post-processing strategy mitigate these issues?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Video-Swin model -> Isolated sign video embeddings
  - Transformer encoder -> Context-aware sign embeddings
  - Frozen T5 model -> Text embeddings
  - Projection heads -> Joint embedding space
  - HN-NCE loss functions -> Contrastive learning objectives

- Critical path:
  1. Extract isolated sign video embeddings using Video-Swin
  2. Process through Transformer encoder for context-aware embeddings
  3. Encode text using T5
  4. Project to joint embedding space
  5. Compute HN-NCE contrastive losses for both sentence and sign retrieval
  6. Backpropagate through trainable components

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Frozen vs trainable text encoder: Using frozen T5 provides strong text representations but limits adaptation to sign language domain
  - Sliding window vs full video: Sliding window allows processing long videos but may miss long-range dependencies
  - Post-processing thresholds: Balancing noise reduction against preserving true positives

- Failure signatures:
  - Low retrieval accuracy but reasonable CSLR: Likely issue with the sentence-level embedding or contrastive loss
  - High retrieval accuracy but poor CSLR: Likely issue with the sign-level embedding or pseudo-label quality
  - Both tasks failing: Likely issues with the shared embedding space or fundamental architecture problems

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify the sliding window extraction produces reasonable isolated sign embeddings by visualizing nearest neighbors in embedding space
  2. Test the Transformer encoder by comparing context-aware embeddings with isolated embeddings on a simple classification task
  3. Validate the HN-NCE loss implementation by checking that similar pairs have higher similarity than dissimilar pairs in the learned space

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of CSLR2 compare when using different types of video embeddings, such as body keypoints versus RGB frames?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that RGB-based embeddings were chosen over body keypoint estimates due to their more competitive performance in the large-vocabulary setting, but it does not provide a direct comparison between the two.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide experimental results comparing the performance of CSLR2 when using different types of video embeddings, such as body keypoints versus RGB frames.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with CSLR2 using different types of video embeddings and comparing their performance would provide evidence to resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of increasing the vocabulary size beyond 8K on the performance of CSLR2?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that future work includes increasing the vocabulary size beyond 8K, but it does not provide any results or analysis on the impact of such an increase.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any experimental results or analysis on the impact of increasing the vocabulary size beyond 8K on the performance of CSLR2.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with CSLR2 using a vocabulary size larger than 8K and comparing its performance with the current model would provide evidence to resolve this question.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of CSLR2 change when using different types of sign-level pseudo-labels, such as those generated by different ISLR models or with different post-processing strategies?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that sign-level pseudo-labels are obtained using an ISLR model and a post-processing strategy, but it does not explore the impact of using different ISLR models or post-processing strategies on the performance of CSLR2.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any experimental results or analysis on the impact of using different types of sign-level pseudo-labels on the performance of CSLR2.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with CSLR2 using different types of sign-level pseudo-labels, such as those generated by different ISLR models or with different post-processing strategies, and comparing their performance would provide evidence to resolve this question.

## Limitations

- The mutual benefit between CSLR and retrieval tasks is attributed to the joint embedding space, but the paper doesn't directly validate this claim through ablation studies comparing joint vs separate training.
- The quality and coverage of pseudo-labels from the ISLR model remain critical unknowns that could introduce systematic biases not captured in the reported results.
- The model's performance across different sign languages, signing styles, and dataset characteristics is unproven, as the paper focuses on a single dataset (BOBSL) and one sign language variant.

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The architectural design choices (Transformer-based encoders, contrastive learning framework, sliding window approach) are well-established and technically sound.
- Medium Confidence: The reported performance improvements over baselines are credible given the comprehensive experimental setup, but the attribution to specific mechanisms requires further validation.
- Low Confidence: The generalization of results across different sign languages, signing styles, and dataset characteristics remains unproven.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study on Training Tasks**: Train CSLR2 with only CSLR supervision and compare against the full multi-task model on both CSLR and retrieval benchmarks to isolate whether the joint embedding space provides benefits beyond simply more training data.

2. **Pseudo-label Quality Analysis**: Evaluate the ISLR model's pseudo-labels on a subset of the BOBSL data using manual annotation, measuring precision, recall, and error types. Correlate these metrics with CSLR performance to quantify the impact of label noise.

3. **Cross-signer Evaluation**: Split the CSLR-TEST benchmark by signer and report performance metrics separately. This would reveal whether the model's performance degrades significantly for signers not well-represented in the training data, indicating potential bias or limited generalization.
