# Tuning In: Analysis of Audio Classifier Performance in Clinical Settings with Limited Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.10100
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10100
- Reference count: 27
- DenseNet-Contrastive model achieved highest F1 score of 0.88 for clinical audio classification

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates deep learning models for audio classification in clinical settings using limited datasets. The authors prospectively collected two novel datasets from stroke patients: Dataset NIHSS (speech based on NIHSS assessment) and Dataset vowel (sustained vowel sounds). They analyzed CNNs (DenseNet, ConvNeXt), transformers (ViT, SWIN, AST), and pre-trained audio models (YAMNet, VGGish) using various preprocessing techniques including RGB spectrograms, grayscale spectrograms, and superlets. The DenseNet-Contrastive model achieved the highest F1 score of 0.88, while AST showed efficient training with only 6 epochs. CNNs demonstrated competitive performance with transformers in small dataset contexts.

## Method Summary
The study involved collecting two novel clinical audio datasets from 70 stroke patients, then preprocessing audio into RGB spectrograms, grayscale spectrograms, and superlets. Models including CNNs (DenseNet, ConvNeXt), transformers (ViT, SWIN, AST), and pre-trained audio models (YAMNet, VGGish) were evaluated. The approach used pre-training on large datasets (ImageNet, AudioSet, US8K, ESC50) followed by fine-tuning on clinical data. Performance was evaluated using AUC, F1 score, precision, recall, specificity, and ROC curves with per-participant majority voting aggregation.

## Key Results
- DenseNet-Contrastive model achieved highest F1 score of 0.88
- AST transformer showed efficient training requiring only 6 epochs
- RGB spectrogram preprocessing outperformed grayscale when using ImageNet pre-training
- CNNs demonstrated competitive performance with transformers in small dataset contexts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Pre-training on large, general datasets before fine-tuning on small clinical datasets improves model performance
- Mechanism: Transfer learning allows models to learn general feature representations applicable to target task, reducing need for large amounts of task-specific data
- Core assumption: Features learned from large datasets are relevant and transferable to specific clinical audio classification task
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our method highlights the benefits of pre-training on large datasets before fine-tuning on specific clinical data"
  - [section] "Pre-training on public datasets is crucial for developing machine learning applications tailored to clinical needs, especially when working with small datasets"
  - [corpus] Weak or missing - corpus neighbors focus on text/language models, not audio classification
- Break Condition: If features learned from pre-training datasets are not relevant to clinical task, transfer learning will not be effective

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: RGB spectrogram preprocessing outperforms grayscale when using ImageNet pre-trained models
- Mechanism: ImageNet pre-trained models are optimized for RGB images, so converting spectrograms to RGB format allows model to better leverage learned features
- Core assumption: Convolutional layers of models pre-trained on ImageNet are better attuned to features present in RGB images
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Surprisingly, the RGB preprocessing approach outperformed the grayscale triple channel approach when using the ImageNet pre-training"
  - [section] "The convolutional layers of models pre-trained on ImageNet might be better attuned to the features present in RGB images"
  - [corpus] Weak or missing - corpus neighbors focus on text/language models, not audio preprocessing
- Break Condition: If features relevant to audio classification task are not well-represented in RGB spectrograms, this preprocessing method may not be optimal

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Transformer-based models (AST) can achieve competitive performance with fewer training epochs compared to CNN-based models
- Mechanism: Transformer architectures, particularly those designed for audio (AST), can efficiently capture relevant features in data, requiring less training to achieve good performance
- Core assumption: Self-attention mechanism in transformers allows for efficient learning of relevant features in audio data
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "It's worth noting that the AST model required only 6 epochs training on our dataset to achieve these metrics, which is fewer compared to the CNN-attention hybrid models and other Transformer models explored in this study that needed significantly more epochs to train"
  - [abstract] "AST showed efficient training with only 6 epochs"
  - [corpus] Weak or missing - corpus neighbors focus on text/language models, not audio classification
- Break Condition: If audio data does not contain long-range dependencies that transformers are good at capturing, efficiency advantage may not hold

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Transfer learning and pre-training
  - Why needed here: Clinical datasets are small, so pre-training on large datasets allows model to learn general features before fine-tuning on specific task
  - Quick check question: Why is pre-training on large datasets beneficial for small clinical datasets?

- Concept: Spectrogram preprocessing techniques (RGB vs. grayscale)
  - Why needed here: Choice of preprocessing technique can significantly impact model performance, especially when using pre-trained models
  - Quick check question: How does choice between RGB and grayscale spectrograms affect model performance when using ImageNet pre-trained models?

- Concept: Transformer architectures for audio classification
  - Why needed here: Transformer models, particularly those designed for audio (AST), can achieve competitive performance with fewer training epochs compared to CNN-based models
  - Quick check question: What advantages do transformer architectures offer for audio classification compared to traditional CNN-based approaches?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Audio segmentation -> Spectrogram transformation (Mel RGB, Mel mono, Superlet) -> Model architectures (CNNs, Transformers, Pre-trained audio feature extractors) -> Pre-training on large datasets -> Fine-tuning on clinical data -> Per-participant prediction aggregation -> Performance evaluation (AUC, F1 score, Precision, Recall, Specificity, ROC curves)

- Critical path:
  1. Data collection and preprocessing
  2. Model selection and pre-training
  3. Fine-tuning on clinical data
  4. Evaluation and analysis

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Pre-training datasets: Balance between dataset size and relevance to clinical task
  - Preprocessing techniques: RGB vs. grayscale spectrograms, Mel vs. Superlet transforms
  - Model architectures: CNNs vs. Transformers, pre-trained feature extractors vs. training from scratch

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance: Model not learning relevant features, insufficient pre-training or fine-tuning
  - Overfitting: Model performing well on training data but poorly on test data, insufficient regularization or data augmentation
  - Data leakage: Training and testing data not properly separated, leading to inflated performance metrics

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline model: Train simple CNN (e.g., DenseNet) on clinical data with Mel mono preprocessing and no pre-training
  2. Pre-training experiment: Train same CNN with pre-training on large audio dataset (e.g., AudioSet) and fine-tuning on clinical data
  3. Preprocessing experiment: Compare performance of pre-trained CNN with Mel RGB and Mel mono preprocessing techniques

## Limitations

- Study based on relatively small clinical dataset (70 participants), limiting generalizability to broader patient populations
- Evaluation focused on specific clinical task (dysphagia detection via TOR-BSST), performance on other medical audio classification tasks may vary significantly
- Preprocessing parameters for spectrogram conversion not fully specified, potentially affecting reproducibility

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Transfer learning improving performance on small clinical datasets - well-established in literature and supported by study's results, particularly strong performance of ImageNet-pretrained DenseNet models

**Medium Confidence**: RGB preprocessing outperforming grayscale for ImageNet-pretrained models - supported by study's results but requires further validation across different model architectures and tasks to confirm it's not dataset-specific

**Medium Confidence**: Efficiency of AST transformers requiring fewer training epochs - demonstrated but needs validation on larger datasets to determine if advantage scales or is specific to small dataset scenarios

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset Generalization Test**: Evaluate same model architectures and preprocessing pipeline on independent clinical audio dataset (e.g., from different hospital or for different medical condition) to assess generalizability beyond current 70-participant cohort

2. **Ablation Study**: Systematically remove pre-training, compare RGB vs grayscale preprocessing across all model types, and test different loss functions to quantify individual contribution of each component to observed performance improvements

3. **Scaling Analysis**: Test efficiency claim of AST transformers by training on progressively larger datasets (starting from current small dataset and scaling up) to determine if 6-epoch advantage persists or diminishes with more data
