# VIALM: A Survey and Benchmark of Visually Impaired Assistance with Large Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.01735
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01735
- Reference count: 20
- Key outcome: Large models can address VIA tasks but struggle with environment grounding (25.7% of GPT-4's responses) and providing fine-grained guidance (32.1% of GPT-4's responses)

## Executive Summary
This study presents VIALM, a novel task for Visually Impaired Assistance (VIA) using large models. The task requires LMs to generate step-by-step, environment-grounded guidance for VI users based on an image and a language request. The research surveyed recent LM developments and conducted benchmark experiments using a newly constructed dataset of 200 images from supermarket and home environments. Results showed that while LMs can address the task, they struggle with environment grounding and providing fine-grained guidance. The study also found that visually-focused LMs excel in environment understanding, while those with advanced language models generate more user-friendly guidance.

## Method Summary
The study employed zero-shot evaluation of 6 SOTA VLMs (GPT-4, CogVLM, MiniGPT, Qwen-VL, LLaVA, BLIV A) on a newly constructed VIALM dataset containing 200 images from supermarket and home environments. Each image was paired with a question (user request) and answer (guidance). Automatic evaluation was conducted using ROUGE and BERTScore metrics, while human evaluation assessed correctness, actionability, and clarity of the generated outputs. The evaluation aimed to assess the models' ability to generate environment-grounded, fine-grained guidance for visually impaired users.

## Key Results
- Large models can address the VIA task but struggle with environment grounding (25.7% of GPT-4's responses) and providing fine-grained guidance (32.1% of GPT-4's responses)
- Visually-focused LMs excel in environment understanding, while those with advanced language models generate more user-friendly guidance
- The VIALM dataset and benchmark provide a foundation for evaluating and improving large models for VIA applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LMs can provide environment-grounded guidance by leveraging their multimodal understanding capabilities.
- Mechanism: VLMs combine visual perception through encoders (e.g., ViT) with language generation through LLMs, enabling them to process both image and text inputs to generate step-by-step guidance.
- Core assumption: The visual encoder accurately extracts environmental features, and the LLM effectively integrates these features into coherent language outputs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The research surveyed recent LM developments and conducted benchmark experiments using a newly constructed dataset."
  - [section] "A typical VLM architecture consists of three key components: a visual encoder, a LLM, and a vision-language connector."
  - [corpus] Weak - the corpus neighbors focus on real-time video assistance rather than static image-based guidance, indicating limited direct evidence for this mechanism.
- Break condition: If the visual encoder fails to capture critical environmental details, or if the LLM cannot effectively ground language generation in the visual context, the guidance will lack environment grounding.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: LMs with advanced language models generate more user-friendly and fine-grained guidance.
- Mechanism: The language model component, particularly those derived from the LLaMA family, enables the generation of detailed, step-by-step instructions that are easier for visually impaired users to follow.
- Core assumption: The LLM's training on diverse language tasks equips it with the ability to produce detailed and coherent guidance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The research found that visually-focused LMs excel in environment understanding, while those with advanced language models generate more user-friendly guidance."
  - [section] "Many VLMs, including LLaV A, MiniGPT-v2, and CogVLM, have adopted language models from the LLaMA family, such as Vicuna, Alpaca, and LLaMA-2-Chat."
  - [corpus] Weak - the corpus neighbors do not provide specific evidence about language model capabilities in generating fine-grained guidance.
- Break condition: If the LLM lacks sufficient training in detailed instruction generation, or if it prioritizes brevity over detail, the guidance will be insufficiently fine-grained.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Incorporating tactile modalities into language generation can produce more fine-grained guidance for visually impaired users.
- Mechanism: By explicitly prompting for tactile clues and integrating sensory information, LMs can generate guidance that accounts for the tactile cognition heavily relied upon by visually impaired individuals.
- Core assumption: The LLM can effectively incorporate and translate tactile information into actionable guidance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "It is crucial to involve tactile guidance as VI users heavily rely on tactile cognition to complement vision loss."
  - [section] "The output should convey environment-grounded information (blue words) and fine-grained (green words) guidance, integrating tactile support (the last sentence) for VI users."
  - [corpus] Weak - the corpus neighbors do not discuss the integration of tactile modalities in guidance generation.
- Break condition: If the LLM cannot effectively process or generate tactile information, or if the prompt engineering for tactile clues is insufficient, the guidance will lack the necessary fine-grained detail.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
  - Why needed here: Understanding MLLMs is crucial as they form the core technology for generating environment-grounded guidance by processing both visual and textual inputs.
  - Quick check question: What are the three key components of a typical VLM architecture, and how do they work together to process multimodal inputs?

- Concept: Vision-Language Connectors
  - Why needed here: Vision-language connectors are essential for effectively integrating visual features with language generation, ensuring that the guidance is grounded in the environment.
  - Quick check question: How do different designs of vision-language connectors (e.g., linear projection layers vs. Q-former) impact the performance of VLMs in generating environment-grounded guidance?

- Concept: Prompt Engineering for Tactile Information
  - Why needed here: Effective prompt engineering is necessary to elicit tactile information from LMs, which is crucial for providing fine-grained guidance to visually impaired users.
  - Quick check question: What are the key elements of a prompt that can effectively elicit tactile information and fine-grained guidance from an LLM?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Visual Encoder -> Vision-Language Connector -> Language Model -> Output Layer

- Critical path:
  1. Input image and user request
  2. Visual encoder processes the image
  3. Vision-language connector integrates visual features with the LLM
  4. LLM generates step-by-step guidance
  5. Output layer formats the guidance for the user

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Visual Encoder: Choosing between different architectures (e.g., ViT vs. ResNet) impacts the model's ability to capture environmental details
  - Vision-Language Connector: Linear projection layers offer simplicity, while Q-former provides more sophisticated integration but may be harder to train
  - Language Model: Larger models (e.g., GPT-4) offer better performance but are more resource-intensive

- Failure signatures:
  - Lack of environment grounding: Guidance does not accurately reflect the physical environment
  - Insufficiently fine-grained guidance: Instructions are too general or lack necessary detail
  - Failure to incorporate tactile information: Guidance does not account for tactile cognition needs of visually impaired users

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare the performance of different visual encoders (e.g., ViT vs. ResNet) on the VIALM benchmark to assess their impact on environment grounding
  2. Test various vision-language connector designs (e.g., linear projection vs. Q-former) to evaluate their effectiveness in integrating visual features with language generation
  3. Experiment with different prompt engineering techniques to elicit tactile information and fine-grained guidance from the LLM

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Limitations
- The evaluation framework has several significant limitations, including the zero-shot evaluation approach and the lack of testing with actual visually impaired users
- The dataset size (200 images) limits the generalizability of findings, and the static image-based evaluation may not represent real-world scenarios
- The study does not provide a specific method for incorporating tactile modalities into language generation, which is identified as a potential solution for improving guidance quality

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The finding that VLMs can address the VIA task in general is well-supported by the experimental results across multiple models. The observation that visually-focused models excel in environment understanding is also robust.
- Medium Confidence: The claim about advanced language models generating more user-friendly guidance is supported but could be strengthened with larger-scale experiments. The performance gap between models (25.7% environment grounding failures for GPT-4) is reliably measured within this dataset.
- Low Confidence: The assertion that incorporating tactile modalities would significantly improve guidance quality remains speculative, as this aspect was not empirically tested in the current study.

## Next Checks
1. **Dataset Expansion and User Testing**: Expand the VIALM dataset to 1000+ images and conduct evaluations with actual visually impaired users to validate the findings and assess real-world applicability.
2. **Fine-tuning Experiments**: Compare zero-shot performance against fine-tuned models on the VIA task to determine if the current evaluation underestimates VLM capabilities.
3. **Dynamic Visual Input Testing**: Replicate the experiments using video streams rather than static images to evaluate performance in more realistic scenarios where continuous visual information is available.
