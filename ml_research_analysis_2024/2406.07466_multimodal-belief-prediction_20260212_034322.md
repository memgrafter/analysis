# Multimodal Belief Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.07466
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07466
- Authors: John Murzaku; Adil Soubki; Owen Rambow
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Late fusion of BERT and Whisper achieves 12.7% relative MAE reduction and 6.4% correlation increase over text-only models

## Executive Summary
This paper explores multimodal belief prediction by combining text and audio features from the CB-Prosody corpus of 338 utterances. The authors extract acoustic-prosodic features using openSMILE and fine-tune pre-trained models (BERT for text, Whisper for audio) to predict speaker belief levels on a 7-point scale. They compare early and late fusion strategies, finding that late fusion significantly outperforms text-only approaches. The study demonstrates that incorporating audio signals substantially improves belief detection compared to text-only approaches.

## Method Summary
The method involves extracting IS09 acoustic features with openSMILE from aligned text and audio pairs in the CB-Prosody corpus. Pre-trained BERT and Whisper models are fine-tuned with regression heads for belief prediction. The authors compare early fusion (concatenating features before prediction) and late fusion (combining model outputs) strategies. A 5-fold cross-validation approach is used for evaluation, with Mean Absolute Error and Pearson correlation as primary metrics. The study also performs correlation analysis to identify significant acoustic features correlated with belief levels.

## Key Results
- Late fusion of BERT and Whisper achieves 12.7% relative reduction in MAE and 6.4% relative increase in Pearson correlation over text-only models
- Acoustic-prosodic features (particularly MFCC, F0, and voice probability) show significant correlation with belief levels
- Whisper audio model outperforms openSMILE acoustic features alone in belief prediction
- Early fusion performs worse than late fusion, consistent with theoretical expectations for small datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Late fusion of text and audio features outperforms both text-only and audio-only models in belief prediction.
- Mechanism: By combining the final representations from BERT and Whisper models through late fusion, the model leverages complementary information from both modalities, resulting in improved performance.
- Core assumption: Text and audio modalities provide non-redundant, complementary information about speaker belief.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "late fusion of BERT and Whisper significantly outperforms text-only models, achieving a 12.7% relative reduction in MAE and a 6.4% relative increase in Pearson correlation"
  - [section] "Comparing our models by fusion strategy we see that, as theory predicts given our small dataset, the late fusion models tend to perform better regardless of the features being incorporated"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Acoustic-prosodic features (e.g., MFCC, F0, voice probability) are correlated with speaker belief levels.
- Mechanism: Acoustic features capture prosodic cues that indicate speaker commitment, such as emphasis and intonation patterns.
- Core assumption: Prosodic features can distinguish between different levels of speaker belief.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We perform an acoustic-prosodic analysis of CBP using openSMILE features [14], and find 25 significant features"
  - [section] "The most represented features are MFCC measures/coefficients, showing in 8 of our top 11 features. We also find F0 and voiceProb measures/coefficients as significant features"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Fine-tuning pre-trained models (BERT for text, Whisper for audio) on the CBP corpus improves belief prediction performance.
- Mechanism: Pre-trained models have learned general representations that can be adapted to the specific task of belief prediction through fine-tuning.
- Core assumption: The pre-trained models' representations are transferable to the belief prediction task.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We then present text and audio baselines for the CBP corpus fine-tuning on BERT and Whisper respectively"
  - [section] "We use the pre-trained BERT model [15] for our fine-tuning experiments, specifically bert-base-uncased which contains 110M parameters"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multimodal learning and fusion strategies
  - Why needed here: The paper explores different fusion methods (early and late) to combine text and audio modalities for belief prediction.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between early and late fusion, and when might one be preferred over the other?

- Concept: Acoustic-prosodic feature extraction and analysis
  - Why needed here: The paper uses openSMILE to extract acoustic features and performs correlation analysis to identify significant features for belief prediction.
  - Quick check question: How do MFCC, F0, and voice probability features capture prosodic information relevant to speaker belief?

- Concept: Pre-trained model fine-tuning
  - Why needed here: The paper fine-tunes BERT and Whisper models on the CBP corpus for text and audio belief prediction, respectively.
  - Quick check question: What are the key considerations when fine-tuning pre-trained models for a specific task?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Text encoder: BERT model
  - Audio encoder: Whisper model
  - Fusion module: Early or late fusion strategy
  - Regression head: Linear layer for continuous belief prediction

- Critical path: Text/Audio input → Encoder → Fusion → Regression head → Belief prediction

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Early vs. late fusion: Early fusion may capture cross-modal interactions but requires more data; late fusion is simpler and may perform better with limited data.
  - Feature selection: Using all IS09 features vs. only significant features impacts model complexity and performance.
  - Model selection: BERT vs. RoBERTa for text; Whisper vs. Hubert for audio.

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on text-only or audio-only baselines: Indicates issues with individual modality encoders.
  - No improvement with multimodal fusion: Suggests redundancy or incompatibility between modalities.
  - Overfitting on small dataset: May require regularization or simpler models.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train text-only BERT baseline on CBP corpus and evaluate performance.
  2. Train audio-only Whisper baseline on CBP corpus and evaluate performance.
  3. Implement and compare early and late fusion strategies for BERT and Whisper models.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the multimodal belief prediction model scale with larger training datasets?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors note that "Theoretical work comparing early and late fusion methods predicts that, with enough training data, early fusion will perform best but, in the absence of sufficient data, late fusion will do better" and mention their dataset is relatively small (338 examples).
- Why unresolved: The current study uses a small dataset with fixed 5-fold cross-validation, making it impossible to assess performance on larger scales.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training and evaluating the same model architectures on progressively larger subsets of a similar corpus or additional belief prediction datasets would reveal how performance scales.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the relative contribution of acoustic-prosodic features versus lexical/semantic features in multimodal belief prediction?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors compare Whisper (audio) to openSMILE features and find Whisper performs better, but do not perform ablation studies to isolate the contribution of acoustic features from text features.
- Why unresolved: The current experiments fuse all features together without separating their individual contributions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies that systematically remove either text or audio features while keeping the other modality would quantify their relative importance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can multimodal belief prediction models transfer to other languages or cultural contexts?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The study uses only English Switchboard data with English-speaking annotators, and belief expression can vary across languages and cultures.
- Why unresolved: The current work is limited to a single language and cultural context without cross-linguistic validation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating the same model architecture on multilingual belief corpora or conducting cross-cultural annotation studies would demonstrate transferability.

## Limitations

- Small dataset size (338 utterances) constrains model complexity and may lead to overfitting
- Single domain (Switchboard dialogues) limits generalizability to other conversational contexts
- Manual alignment of audio and text clips introduces potential timing errors and truncation

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** Late fusion outperforms text-only models (12.7% MAE reduction, 6.4% correlation increase)
- **Medium confidence:** Acoustic-prosodic features are significantly correlated with belief levels
- **Medium confidence:** Pre-trained model fine-tuning improves belief prediction for this specific dataset

## Next Checks

1. Test model performance on additional conversational datasets (e.g., DailyDialog, MELD) to assess generalizability beyond Switchboard and verify if multimodal fusion provides similar benefits across domains.

2. Perform systematic ablation studies that remove groups of acoustic features (MFCC, F0, voice probability) to determine which contribute most to performance gains and validate the significance of the 25 identified features.

3. Implement and evaluate more sophisticated fusion approaches (e.g., tensor fusion, attention-based fusion) to determine if late fusion remains optimal as dataset size increases or if cross-modal interactions could be better captured with more complex architectures.
