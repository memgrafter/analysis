# Transformer-based approach for Ethereum Price Prediction Using Crosscurrency correlation and Sentiment Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.08077
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08077
- Reference count: 31
- This paper investigates using transformer models for Ethereum price prediction by integrating cross-currency correlation and sentiment analysis

## Executive Summary
This paper explores the use of transformer-based models for Ethereum price prediction by incorporating cross-currency correlation and sentiment analysis. The study combines Ethereum price data with correlated cryptocurrencies (ADA, DOT) and sentiment scores derived from Twitter and Reddit using FinBert. Three experimental setups were tested: single-feature (Ethereum price only), multi-feature (price, volume, sentiment), and full-feature (including correlated coin prices). Despite using a smaller dataset and simpler transformer architecture, the model outperformed ANN and MLP baselines on certain metrics. Results showed MSE of 0.0051 for the transformer with Ethereum data alone, outperforming LSTM in some cases, though LSTM achieved better RMSE and MAPE.

## Method Summary
The study employs a transformer-based approach for Ethereum price prediction, integrating cross-currency correlation and sentiment analysis. Three experimental setups were tested: single-feature (Ethereum price only), multi-feature (price, volume, sentiment), and full-feature (including correlated coin prices). The model combines Ethereum price data with correlated cryptocurrencies (ADA, DOT) and sentiment scores derived from Twitter and Reddit using FinBert. Despite using a smaller dataset and simpler transformer architecture, the model outperformed ANN and MLP baselines on certain metrics.

## Key Results
- Transformer with Ethereum data alone achieved MSE of 0.0051, outperforming LSTM in some cases
- LSTM achieved better RMSE and MAPE metrics compared to the transformer model
- Sentiment and cross-currency correlation showed limited predictive power, possibly due to "illusion of causality"

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The transformer model leverages self-attention mechanisms to capture complex temporal dependencies in Ethereum price data. By integrating sentiment analysis from social media and cross-currency correlations, the model attempts to incorporate external factors that may influence price movements. The FinBert model is used to derive sentiment scores from Twitter and Reddit data, providing a nuanced understanding of market sentiment. The inclusion of correlated cryptocurrency prices (ADA, DOT) aims to capture broader market trends and potential spillover effects.

## Foundational Learning
- **Self-attention mechanism**: Allows the model to weigh the importance of different input features dynamically, crucial for capturing complex temporal dependencies in financial data.
  - Why needed: To effectively model long-range dependencies and relationships in time-series data
  - Quick check: Verify that the model can attend to relevant past time steps when making predictions

- **FinBert sentiment analysis**: A pre-trained language model fine-tuned for financial sentiment analysis, used to derive sentiment scores from social media data.
  - Why needed: To quantify market sentiment from unstructured text data, potentially capturing investor psychology
  - Quick check: Ensure sentiment scores correlate with known market events or price movements

- **Cross-currency correlation**: The inclusion of prices from correlated cryptocurrencies (ADA, DOT) to capture broader market trends.
  - Why needed: To account for potential spillover effects and market-wide influences on Ethereum price
  - Quick check: Verify that correlation coefficients between cryptocurrencies are statistically significant

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Twitter/Reddit data -> FinBert -> Sentiment scores; Ethereum price data + correlated coin prices + volume -> Feature engineering -> Transformer model
- **Critical path**: Data collection -> Sentiment analysis -> Feature engineering -> Transformer prediction
- **Design tradeoffs**: Simpler transformer architecture vs. time-series-specific models; smaller dataset vs. broader feature set
- **Failure signatures**: Poor performance on RMSE and MAPE metrics; limited predictive power from sentiment and cross-currency features
- **3 first experiments**:
  1. Compare performance of basic transformer vs. time-series-specific transformer variants (e.g., Informer, Autoformer)
  2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the exact contribution of each feature (sentiment, volume, correlated coin prices) to prediction accuracy
  3. Test the model architecture on a larger, more comprehensive dataset spanning multiple years to assess scalability and robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Inconsistent performance across different evaluation measures (MSE vs. RMSE and MAPE)
- Limited predictive power from sentiment and cross-currency correlation features
- Smaller dataset size compared to other studies

## Confidence
- Transformer superiority claim: Medium
- Cross-currency correlation and sentiment analysis contribution: Low
- Robustness of findings: Limited due to smaller dataset and simpler architecture

## Next Checks
1. Test the model architecture on a larger, more comprehensive dataset spanning multiple years to assess scalability and robustness
2. Implement and compare time-series-specific transformer variants (such as Informer or Autoformer) against the basic transformer used in this study
3. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the exact contribution of each feature (sentiment, volume, correlated coin prices) to prediction accuracy
