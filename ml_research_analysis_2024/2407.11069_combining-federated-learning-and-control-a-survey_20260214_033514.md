# Combining Federated Learning and Control: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.11069
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11069
- Reference count: 40
- This survey comprehensively reviews combining Federated Learning and control to enhance privacy, scalability, and generalization in nonlinear control applications.

## Executive Summary
This survey addresses the emerging intersection of Federated Learning (FL) and control systems, highlighting how FL's privacy-preserving distributed learning framework can enhance control applications. The paper bridges the gap between FL's focus on global model learning and control's emphasis on localized optimal performance. It provides a comprehensive overview of how FL can be integrated with system identification, controller design, and multi-agent decision-making scenarios. The survey identifies key opportunities and challenges in applying FL to control problems, including communication efficiency, client heterogeneity, and privacy preservation.

## Method Summary
The paper conducts a systematic literature review across three main areas: distributed control systems, learning and control methods focusing on system identification and controller design, and existing FL applications in control. The authors analyze state-of-the-art approaches through qualitative assessment rather than empirical experimentation, organizing the findings around how FL can enhance different aspects of control systems including collaborative learning of linear systems, federated LQR concepts, and neural network integration in adaptive PID control for autonomous vehicles.

## Key Results
- FL shows strong potential for collaborative learning in system identification of linear systems while preserving privacy
- Federated LQR concepts demonstrate promise for distributed controller design
- Integration of neural networks within adaptive PID control systems enables enhanced learning capabilities for connected autonomous vehicles
- FL enables knowledge transfer and sensor fusion in multi-agent decision-making scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FL works in control applications by enabling multiple clients to collaboratively learn models without sharing raw data, thus preserving privacy while leveraging distributed computational resources. The federated aggregation mechanism allows local models to be trained on individual devices or systems, then combined to form a global model that benefits from diverse experiences across the network. This approach addresses the fundamental tension between the need for personalized control solutions and the advantages of shared learning, particularly in scenarios where data privacy, communication efficiency, or data locality are critical constraints.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Federated Learning Basics** - Understanding the FL architecture (why needed: provides foundation for how distributed learning works; quick check: can you explain FedAvg algorithm?)
2. **Control System Fundamentals** - Knowledge of PID controllers, LQR, and system identification (why needed: essential for understanding control-specific challenges; quick check: can you derive state-feedback control law?)
3. **Multi-Agent Systems** - Principles of coordination and consensus in distributed systems (why needed: critical for understanding collaborative control scenarios; quick check: can you explain consensus algorithm convergence?)
4. **Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning** - Differential privacy and secure aggregation concepts (why needed: explains how FL maintains privacy guarantees; quick check: can you describe how secure aggregation works?)
5. **Nonlinear Control Theory** - Lyapunov stability and adaptive control principles (why needed: necessary for understanding advanced control applications; quick check: can you prove stability of a given nonlinear system?)

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Clients (control systems) -> Local Training -> Parameter Server -> Global Aggregation -> Updated Global Model -> Client Update

Critical Path: Data Collection → Local Model Training → Secure Parameter Upload → Federated Aggregation → Global Model Distribution → Local Model Update → Control Action

Design Tradeoffs: Privacy vs. Communication Efficiency (federated averaging reduces communication but may compromise privacy guarantees), Model Accuracy vs. Computational Resources (larger models provide better accuracy but require more computational power on clients), Client Participation vs. Convergence Speed (more clients improve generalization but slow convergence)

Failure Signatures: Communication bottlenecks causing delayed model updates, Model divergence due to heterogeneous client data distributions, Privacy breaches from insufficient encryption or aggregation, System instability from poorly tuned hyperparameters affecting control performance

First Experiments: 1) Compare federated vs centralized system identification accuracy on linear systems with varying noise levels, 2) Test federated LQR controller performance against traditional centralized LQR under communication constraints, 3) Evaluate adaptive PID control with federated neural network augmentation in multi-vehicle platooning scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions, focusing instead on surveying the current state of the field and identifying general challenges such as communication efficiency, client heterogeneity, and privacy preservation in FL-control applications.

## Limitations

- The survey lacks quantitative evaluation of proposed federated learning and control approaches
- Limited case studies are presented rather than extensive experimental validation
- No comparative analysis of different FL-control methods' performance across various control tasks

## Confidence

High: FL can enhance privacy in control systems due to well-established privacy-preserving nature of FL
Medium: FL can improve scalability and generalization in control applications, though requires further validation
Medium: The potential of FL in control applications is primarily supported by theoretical analysis and limited case studies

## Next Checks

1. Conduct extensive experiments comparing FL-based control methods with traditional centralized approaches across various control tasks including system identification, LQR design, and adaptive control

2. Perform comprehensive analysis of communication overhead and energy consumption in federated control systems under different network conditions and client participation levels

3. Investigate the impact of client heterogeneity on the convergence and stability of federated learning algorithms in control applications, particularly focusing on systems with different dynamics and operating conditions
