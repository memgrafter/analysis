## Executive Summary
This paper proposes AdaWaveNet, an adaptive wavelet network for time series analysis that addresses non-stationary data challenges. The core innovation is a lifting scheme-based wavelet decomposition with learnable convolutional filters, enabling multi-scale feature extraction across seasonal and trend components. The method employs a channel-wise attention mechanism and grouped linear modules for enhanced trend modeling. Evaluated on 10 datasets across forecasting, imputation, and super-resolution tasks, AdaWaveNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with 7.7% MSE improvement over frequency-domain methods in forecasting. The model demonstrates competitive efficiency while maintaining strong predictive accuracy, particularly in capturing temporal dynamics in complex time series data.

## Method Summary
AdaWaveNet uses a lifting scheme-based wavelet decomposition where convolutional filters replace fixed wavelet bases, enabling adaptive multi-scale feature extraction. The network splits time series into seasonal and trend components, processing the seasonal path through AdaWave blocks with learnable wavelet transformations, channel-wise attention, and InvAdaWave reconstruction blocks. The trend component is refined through K-means clustering and grouped linear modules. Outputs are combined for final predictions. The method was evaluated on 10 datasets across forecasting, imputation, and super-resolution tasks.

- Competitive efficiency while maintaining strong predictive accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The adaptive wavelet decomposition enables multi-scale feature extraction that matches the non-stationary nature of real-world time series. By iteratively applying convolutional kernels in the lifting scheme, the model learns wavelet filters that are tuned to the data rather than relying on fixed bases. This allows capturing both trend and seasonal dynamics at multiple resolutions. The core assumption is that the lifting scheme's predict-update structure can be effectively replaced with learned convolutional filters without losing invertibility.

### Mechanism 2
Channel-wise attention after the final decomposition level refines the seasonal component without losing the multi-scale decomposition structure. Applying self-attention only at the deepest decomposition level concentrates computation where the sequence length is shortest, allowing efficient modeling of long-range dependencies across channels. The core assumption is that global contextual information is most critical at the deepest level where fine-grained detail has been abstracted.

### Mechanism 3
Grouped linear modules with clustering improve trend component modeling by tailoring transformations to channel-specific patterns. K-means clustering partitions channels into groups, and each group receives a distinct linear head, enabling regime-specific trend modeling. The core assumption is that channels within a cluster share similar statistical behavior and thus benefit from the same linear transformation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Wavelet transform and multi-scale decomposition**: Provides the mathematical foundation for understanding how the lifting scheme decomposes signals into trend and seasonal components. *Quick check*: What is the difference between the approximation and detail sub-bands in wavelet decomposition?

- **Lifting scheme mechanics**: Essential to understand how the predict-update steps can be replaced with learnable convolutions. *Quick check*: In the lifting scheme, what roles do the even and odd indexed components play?

- **Convolutional neural network basics**: Core to grasping how learned kernels replace fixed wavelet filters in the adaptive scheme. *Quick check*: How does a 1D convolution operate differently on even vs. odd indexed sequences in the lifting context?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input → Time series decomposition → Seasonal/trend split → Seasonal path: AdaWave blocks → Channel-wise attention → InvAdaWave blocks → Trend path: K-means clustering → Grouped linear module → Outputs: Sum of reconstructed seasonal and refined trend components
- **Critical path**: Seasonal component flow through AdaWave → attention → InvAdaWave determines most of the forecasting quality
- **Design tradeoffs**: Multi-scale decomposition vs. computational cost (handled by late attention placement), learned wavelet filters vs. interpretability (filters adapt but become dataset-specific), clustering granularity vs. overfitting risk (too many clusters may overfit to noise)
- **Failure signatures**: Degraded performance on datasets with mixed periodicity indicates inadequate filter adaptation, channel attention at final layer underperforms suggests early attention or alternative mechanisms needed, poor clustering separation indicates that grouped linear modules may be ineffective for certain datasets
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Train with fixed Haar wavelet instead of learned filters to isolate the impact of adaptability, 2) Move channel-wise attention to an earlier decomposition level to test placement sensitivity, 3) Remove the grouped linear module and replace with a single global linear layer to measure its contribution to trend modeling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions. However, several areas remain unexplored including scalability analysis with increasing time series length, optimal decomposition depth across different time series characteristics, and direct comparison with attention-based models for long-range dependency capture.

## Limitations

- Exact architectural details for AdaWave blocks remain unspecified, limiting precise reproduction
- Channel-wise attention placement at final level lacks ablation studies testing alternative positions
- Grouped linear module performance sensitivity to clustering algorithm and hyperparameter settings is unexplored

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Multi-scale decomposition framework's theoretical soundness, as it builds on well-established wavelet theory
- **Medium confidence**: Adaptive lifting scheme's practical benefits, given the weak corpus evidence for this specific implementation
- **Low confidence**: Universal applicability of channel-wise attention placement and grouped linear modules across diverse time series datasets

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a comprehensive ablation study testing attention placement at multiple decomposition levels to verify the claimed efficiency-accuracy tradeoff
2. Evaluate the sensitivity of grouped linear module performance to different clustering algorithms and hyperparameter settings
3. Test the model's generalization to datasets with abrupt regime shifts or mixed periodicity patterns not present in the evaluation suite
