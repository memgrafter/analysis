# Probing the Robustness of Vision-Language Pretrained Models: A Multimodal Adversarial Attack Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.13461
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13461
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces JMTFA, a novel adversarial attack method for vision-language pretrained (VLP) transformers that jointly perturbs both visual and textual modalities using attention relevance scores.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents JMTFA, a multimodal adversarial attack framework designed to probe the robustness of vision-language pretrained (VLP) models. The approach leverages attention relevance scores to identify and disrupt important cross-modal features, addressing the gap in existing attack methods that fail to account for interactions between visual and textual modalities. The method demonstrates high attack success rates on vision-language understanding and reasoning tasks, revealing significant vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art VLP architectures.

## Method Summary
JMTFA employs a joint multimodal attack strategy that perturbs both visual and textual inputs simultaneously. The method calculates aggregated attention relevance scores to identify the most influential features across modalities, then uses Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) for image perturbations and BERT-Attack for text modifications. The attack is optimized to maximize the disruption of cross-modal interactions by targeting features with the highest attention relevance scores. The framework is evaluated on four VLP models (ViLT, VisualBERT, VLE, LXMERT) using VQAv2 and VSR datasets, measuring attack success rates and adversarial accuracy under various attack scenarios.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 88.27% attack success rate on VQA tasks and 91.90% on VSR tasks
- Text modality has significantly stronger influence on fusion processes than visual modality
- No apparent relationship between model size and adversarial robustness
- Dual-modality attacks outperform single-modality attacks, with stronger effects when both modalities are perturbed

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
JMTFA exploits the cross-modal attention mechanisms in VLP models by identifying and disrupting the most influential features across both visual and textual inputs. The method leverages attention relevance scores to pinpoint critical features that the model relies on for multimodal reasoning. By jointly perturbing both modalities rather than attacking them independently, JMTFA creates synergistic effects that amplify the attack's effectiveness. The approach specifically targets the fusion process where cross-modal interactions occur, making it particularly effective against models that heavily rely on textual information for multimodal reasoning tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- **Attention Relevance Scores**: Measures of feature importance derived from cross-modal attention weights; needed to identify which features most influence the model's predictions
- **Cross-modal Fusion**: The process where visual and textual features are combined in VLP models; quick check: verify attention weights between image and text tokens
- **Adversarial Perturbations**: Small, intentional modifications to inputs designed to fool models; quick check: ensure perturbations stay within ε bounds
- **Multimodal Attack Transferability**: How attacks on one model affect other models; quick check: test black-box attacks on different VLP architectures
- **Feature Importance Ranking**: The method of ordering features by their impact on model predictions; quick check: validate ranking correlates with actual prediction changes
- **PGD Optimization**: Iterative optimization technique for generating adversarial examples; quick check: monitor convergence and perturbation magnitude

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Image/text input → Feature extraction → Cross-modal attention → Attention relevance scoring → Feature ranking → Perturbation generation → Adversarial example

**Critical Path**: The most critical components are the cross-modal attention mechanism and attention relevance scoring, as these determine which features are targeted for perturbation. The PGD optimization loop for image attacks and BERT-Attack for text attacks form the core perturbation generation pipeline.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades computational complexity for attack effectiveness by calculating attention relevance scores across all layers and attention heads. This comprehensive scoring approach is more expensive than simple gradient-based methods but yields significantly higher attack success rates by targeting truly influential features.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor attack performance typically indicates incorrect attention relevance score calculation or improper feature ranking. Text attacks may fail if candidate filtering in BERT-Attack is too restrictive, while image attacks may underperform if ε bounds are too conservative or if the optimization doesn't converge properly.

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify attention relevance score calculation matches Equation 1-2 implementation
2. Test single-modality attacks (text-only and image-only) to establish baseline performance
3. Run dual-modality attacks on a single VLP model to confirm synergistic effects

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but several emerge from the findings: (1) How does the effectiveness of JMTFA scale with the complexity of cross-modal interactions in VLP architectures? (2) How do JMTFA attacks transfer across different VLP model families (single-stream vs dual-stream)? (3) Can JMTFA be adapted to defend against adversarial attacks in VLP models?

## Limitations
- Limited to English-only datasets (VQAv2, VSR) without addressing multilingual robustness
- Does not explore transferability across different VLP architectures systematically
- No defensive applications proposed or tested despite potential insights for robust model development

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Attack success rates and comparative performance against baselines - the experimental methodology is clearly described with specific datasets, metrics, and perturbation parameters
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about model size not correlating with robustness and spatial relation attack patterns - while results are presented, the sample size for VSR (1K test set) could influence these conclusions
- **Low Confidence**: The broader generalizability of findings to non-English datasets and real-world applications - the study is limited to controlled benchmark datasets

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the aggregated attention relevance score calculation and verify that ASR matches reported values (88.27% for VQA, 91.90% for VSR) within 5% tolerance across all four VLP models
2. Conduct controlled experiments to confirm that text-only attacks consistently outperform image-only attacks (as claimed), with at least 10% ASR difference in dual-modality versus single-modality settings
3. Test the hypothesis that model size does not correlate with robustness by including at least two additional VLP models (one smaller, one larger than the current set) and analyzing ASR variance across the expanded model spectrum
