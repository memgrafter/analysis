- This paper proposes FAIM, a fairness-aware interpretable modeling framework for improving AI fairness in healthcare without sacrificing performance

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces FAIM (Fairness-Aware Interpretable Modeling), a framework designed to address fairness concerns in machine learning models for healthcare applications. FAIM identifies fairer models from a set of high-performing models and enables interactive model selection with clinical expertise. The framework was tested on two real-world emergency department datasets (MIMIC-IV-ED and SGH-ED) and demonstrated significant reductions in biases related to sex and race while maintaining comparable model performance to baseline approaches.

The FAIM framework outperformed commonly used bias-mitigation methods and provided interpretable explanations of model changes, fostering multidisciplinary collaboration in shaping contextualized AI fairness. The study demonstrates that it's possible to improve fairness metrics by 53.5%-57.6% for MIMIC-IV-ED and 17.7%-21.7% for SGH-ED without sacrificing predictive accuracy, while aligning model behavior with clinical evidence by reducing contributions from sex and race variables.

## Method Summary
FAIM works by generating multiple interpretable models and systematically evaluating them for both performance and fairness metrics. The framework uses a set of predefined fairness criteria to assess each model, then presents the highest-performing fair models to clinical experts for final selection. This interactive approach combines quantitative fairness metrics with clinical expertise to ensure that fairness improvements align with medical knowledge and patient care requirements. The models are designed to be interpretable, allowing clinicians to understand how variables contribute to predictions and identify potential biases in the decision-making process.

## Key Results
- FAIM significantly reduced biases related to sex and race while maintaining comparable performance to baseline models
- Fairness metrics improved by 53.5%-57.6% for MIMIC-IV-ED and 17.7%-21.7% for SGH-ED datasets
- FAIM models excluded race and reduced contributions of sex and other bias-related variables, aligning with clinical evidence
- The framework outperformed commonly used bias-mitigation methods while providing interpretable explanations of model changes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FAIM works by leveraging the inherent flexibility of interpretable modeling approaches to explore multiple model configurations that balance performance and fairness. By generating multiple models and systematically evaluating them against fairness criteria, the framework can identify configurations that reduce bias while maintaining predictive accuracy. The interactive component ensures that fairness improvements are clinically meaningful and aligned with medical expertise rather than purely algorithmic optimization.

## Foundational Learning
- Interpretability in healthcare models: Essential for clinical trust and understanding of AI decisions; quick check: Can clinicians explain model predictions to patients?
- Fairness metrics in healthcare: Critical for ensuring equitable treatment across demographic groups; quick check: Are fairness improvements consistent across different patient populations?
- Interactive model selection: Combines algorithmic optimization with human expertise; quick check: Does clinician input improve fairness outcomes compared to purely automated approaches?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map:
FAIM generates multiple interpretable models -> Evaluates each model for performance and fairness metrics -> Presents fair high-performing models to clinicians -> Clinician selects final model based on clinical expertise

Critical path:
Model generation → Fairness evaluation → Performance assessment → Clinical review → Final model selection

Design tradeoffs:
- Multiple models increase computational cost but enable better fairness-performance balance
- Clinical involvement ensures relevance but introduces potential subjectivity
- Interpretability may limit model complexity but enables bias detection

Failure signatures:
- If fairness metrics don't improve across model variations, underlying data bias may be too severe
- Poor performance retention suggests fairness constraints are too restrictive
- Clinical disagreement on model selection indicates need for clearer fairness criteria

First experiments:
1. Test FAIM on datasets with known demographic disparities to verify fairness improvements
2. Compare FAIM-selected models against single-model approaches on fairness metrics
3. Evaluate clinician agreement rates in model selection across different clinical scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Analysis focused primarily on sex and race as protected attributes, potentially overlooking other relevant demographic factors
- Generalizability to other healthcare settings and populations beyond tested datasets remains uncertain
- Computational complexity of generating multiple models may limit practical implementation in resource-constrained environments
- Reliance on clinician expertise introduces potential subjectivity in fairness assessment

## Confidence

High confidence: The performance-accuracy trade-off results showing FAIM maintaining comparable performance to baseline models while improving fairness metrics.

Medium confidence: The clinical relevance of the reduced contributions from sex and race variables, as this interpretation depends on clinical domain expertise.

Low confidence: The absolute generalizability of the fairness improvements across different healthcare systems and patient populations beyond the tested datasets.

## Next Checks
1. External validation on diverse healthcare datasets from different geographic regions and demographic populations to assess generalizability of fairness improvements.
2. Real-world implementation study measuring the impact of FAIM on actual clinical decision-making and patient outcomes.
3. Comparative analysis of FAIM against emerging fairness-aware methods as they develop, to ensure continued superiority in both fairness and performance metrics.
