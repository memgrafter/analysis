# Quantifying stability of non-power-seeking in artificial agents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.03529
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03529
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Small perturbations to MDPs preserve non-power-seeking behavior when safe states remain isolated

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether AI agents that don't resist shutdown maintain this behavior when their environment changes. The authors model agents as policies for Markov decision processes (MDPs) and prove that small environmental changes preserve non-power-seeking behavior under specific conditions. They quantify stability using a bisimulation metric for near-optimal policies and derivative bounds for policies on structured state spaces like language models.

## Method Summary
The paper uses mathematical analysis of MDPs to study safety stability. For near-optimal policies with known reward functions, it proves stability using bisimulation metrics that quantify MDP similarity. For structured state spaces (e.g., language models), it bounds how quickly shutdown probability decreases under perturbations using policy derivatives and transition matrix properties. The proofs establish that small changes to the environment only gradually degrade safety, not abruptly eliminate it.

## Key Results
- Near-optimal policies remain non-power-seeking under small MDP perturbations when safe states are isolated (Theorem 5.7)
- For structured state spaces, shutdown probability decreases at most at a bounded rate under small perturbations (Theorem 6.5)
- Safety functions are lower hemicontinuous, meaning safety degrades gradually not suddenly under environmental changes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Small perturbations preserve non-power-seeking behavior for near-optimal policies when safe states are isolated
- Mechanism: Bisimulation metric quantifies MDP similarity; when Hausdorff distance between MDPs is below threshold determined by safe state isolation, expected time to safe states changes by at most one step
- Core assumption: Safe states in both MDPs are isolated from other states in the bisimulation metric
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "small perturbations to the MDP preserve non-power-seeking behavior, as long as the 'safe' states remain isolated"
  - [section 5.3] "Theorem 5.7. Suppose M = (S, A, P, R, γ) is (N, ε)-safe. Then there exists δ(M) ∈ (0, 1) with the following property: If dH(M, M′) < δ for some M′ = (S′, A, P ′, R′, γ) with S′ safe ⊂ S′ that is √ δ-isolated in M′, then M′ is (N + 1, ε/2)-safe."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no directly related papers found in corpus
- Break condition: If safe states are not isolated (e.g., "playing dead" states exist that are close to safe states in the bisimulation metric), arbitrarily small perturbations can destroy safety

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: For policies on structured state spaces, probability of shutdown decreases at most at a bounded rate under small perturbations
- Mechanism: Policy's bounded derivative on embedding space bounds how much transition probabilities can change when states are perturbed; rate of decrease depends on spectral properties of transition matrix restricted to transient states
- Core assumption: Policy is differentiable with bounded derivative on a neighborhood of state space
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "For policies defined on a structured state space (e.g. language models), the paper bounds how quickly the probability of shutdown can decrease under small perturbations to the MDP"
  - [section 6.3] "Theorem 6.5. For fixed ∆, so, considering Sπ to be a function of only M, Sπ is... (3) with a bounded local rate of decrease; if λ1 is the largest eigenvalue of the transition matrix of Strans of M, then for every M there is an ϵ > 0 so that ∥δM∥1 < ϵ =⇒ − δSπ ∥δM∥1 < (1 − λ1)−1 (1 + (1 − λ1)−1) |Ssafe| =: B(M)"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no directly related papers found in corpus
- Break condition: If policy's derivative is unbounded or perturbation is too large, bound on safety degradation may not hold

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Safety functions are lower hemicontinuous, meaning safety degrades gradually under small changes
- Mechanism: As MDP changes, set of policies or starting distributions that maintain safety can only shrink gradually, not suddenly
- Core assumption: Safety function is properly defined and measurable on MDP space
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 7.1] "Our research shows that two types of functions, each representing non-power-seeking for MDPs in a slightly different way, are lower hemicontinuous"
  - [appendix D.2] "Let M be an MDP and V ⊆ R≥0 × [0, 1] be an open set with Fδ(M) ∩ V ̸= ∅... Then we apply theorem 5.7 to find that every M′ ∈ U is (N + η2, ε− η1)-safe"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no directly related papers found in corpus
- Break condition: If safety function is not properly defined or MDP space topology is not appropriate, lower hemicontinuity may not hold

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
  - Why needed here: Entire analysis built on MDPs as model for agent-environment interactions
  - Quick check question: What are the five components of an MDP and how do they interact to define agent behavior?

- Concept: Bisimulation metric
  - Why needed here: Used to quantify similarity between MDPs for near-optimal policy case
  - Quick check question: How does the bisimulation metric differ from simple state-by-state comparison, and why is this important for stability analysis?

- Concept: Lower semicontinuity and lower hemicontinuity
  - Why needed here: Used to formalize gradual degradation of safety under perturbations
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between lower semicontinuity and lower hemicontinuity, and why is the latter more appropriate for set-valued safety functions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: MDP specification (states, actions, transition probabilities, rewards, discount factor) -> Policy definition (deterministic or probabilistic) -> Safe state set definition -> Metric definitions (bisimulation metric, on-policy metric) -> Safety quantification functions (expected time to safe states, probability of shutdown) -> Stability theorems and proofs

- Critical path: 1. Define MDP and policy, 2. Specify safe states, 3. Choose appropriate metric based on policy type, 4. Compute or estimate stability bounds, 5. Verify isolation conditions for near-optimal case, 6. Apply theorems to assess safety under perturbations

- Design tradeoffs: Near-optimal vs. fixed policy approach (near-optimal more general but requires computing optimal value functions; fixed policy more specific but doesn't require reward knowledge), Isolation requirement (necessary for near-optimal case but may be difficult to verify in practice), Computational cost (bisimulation metric computation can be expensive for large state spaces)

- Failure signatures: "Playing dead" states appearing near safe states (breaks near-optimal case), Policy derivatives becoming unbounded (breaks structured state space case), Safe state set not being properly isolated (invalidates stability bounds), Metric computation failing to converge (indicates MDPs are too dissimilar)

- First 3 experiments: 1. Implement bisimulation metric computation for simple MDPs and verify Theorem 5.7 on synthetic examples with and without isolated safe states, 2. Create a simple LLM-like policy on structured state space and test Theorem 6.5 by perturbing state embeddings and measuring safety degradation, 3. Construct examples demonstrating lower hemicontinuity by gradually changing MDPs and observing how safety regions evolve

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the practical upper bound on the size of perturbations that maintain safety in Case (1) near-optimal policies?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Theorem 5.7 states that if dH(M, M') < δ for some sufficiently small δ, then M' is (N + 1, ε/2)-safe, but the paper notes this δ may be extremely small in practice
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges that the bound may be too small to represent meaningful environmental changes, but does not provide concrete estimates or simulations
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental validation showing the maximum perturbation size that maintains safety for various MDP structures and reward functions

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the safety bound in Case (2) LLM agents degrade as the model's capability increases?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that as LLMs become more capable, they better distinguish testing from deployment inputs, causing embeddings to move further apart and potentially exceeding the safety bound
- Why unresolved: The paper provides a theoretical bound but does not quantify how capability growth affects the bound's practical applicability
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies tracking safety degradation rates across LLMs of increasing capability when deployed on semantically similar but distinguishable inputs

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the stability results be extended to partially observable MDPs (POMDPs)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses limitations of MDPs for modeling uncertainty and mentions that POMDPs could be more appropriate, but notes that any POMDP can be converted to a belief MDP
- Why unresolved: While the paper suggests the MDP framework may suffice through conversion, it does not prove whether the stability theorems hold for POMDPs or their belief MDP equivalents
- What evidence would resolve it: Formal proofs showing whether the stability theorems extend to POMDPs or counterexamples demonstrating failure under partial observability

## Limitations

- Computational intractability of bisimulation metric for large state spaces makes practical application challenging
- Isolation assumption can be violated in subtle ways (e.g., "playing dead" states) potentially invalidating stability guarantees
- Derivative bounds for structured state spaces assume smoothness properties that may not hold for complex policies like neural networks

## Confidence

- Theorem 5.7 (near-optimal policies): Medium confidence - proof structure is sound but relies heavily on isolation assumption which may be difficult to verify in practice
- Theorem 6.5 (structured state spaces): Low confidence - strong assumptions about bounded derivatives and computational challenges of verifying these conditions for real-world policies
- Overall stability claims: Medium confidence - rigorous mathematical proofs but several limitations and uncertainties remain

## Next Checks

1. Implement bisimulation metric computation for a range of MDP sizes and analyze how computation time scales with state space size, identifying practical limits for real-world applications

2. Construct and analyze concrete examples of "playing dead" scenarios to determine how easily the isolation assumption can be violated in practice, and whether there are detectable warning signs

3. Test the derivative bounds for structured state spaces using a trained neural network policy, measuring actual derivative magnitudes and comparing to the theoretical bounds required for stability
