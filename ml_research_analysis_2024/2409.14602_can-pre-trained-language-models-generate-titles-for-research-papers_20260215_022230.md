# Can pre-trained language models generate titles for research papers?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.14602
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14602
- Reference count: 37
- Primary result: PEGASUS-large outperforms larger models for abstract-to-title generation on computer science papers

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether pre-trained language models can effectively generate research paper titles from abstracts. The authors fine-tune several transformer models including T5-base, BART-base, PEGASUS-large, and LLaMA-3-8B on a computer science paper dataset, then evaluate their performance on both the training dataset and a new dataset of recent conference papers. The results demonstrate that PEGASUS-large consistently outperforms other models across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving ROUGE-1 scores of 46.75% on the training dataset and 49.85% on the new dataset. The study reveals that lighter models fine-tuned on domain-specific data can outperform much larger general-purpose models for this specialized task.

## Method Summary
The authors fine-tune transformer models (T5-base, BART-base, PEGASUS-large, LLaMA-3-8B) on the CSPubSum dataset of computer science paper abstracts and titles for 5 epochs with specific hyperparameters. They evaluate these fine-tuned models alongside ChatGPT-3.5 and zero-shot LLaMA-3-8B on both the CSPubSum test set and a new LREC-COLING-2024 dataset. The evaluation employs standard metrics including ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore, and SciBERTScore, plus entity-level factual consistency measures. Manual human evaluation by a single annotator provides additional qualitative assessment of title quality.

## Key Results
- PEGASUS-large achieves the highest ROUGE-1 scores: 46.75% on CSPubSum and 49.85% on LREC-COLING-2024
- Fine-tuned PEGASUS-large outperforms larger models like GPT-3.5 (175B parameters) despite having only 568M parameters
- Human evaluation shows PEGASUS-large titles are preferred in 80% of cases on CSPubSum
- Zero-shot LLMs show strong semantic similarity to original titles but lower n-gram overlap scores

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Fine-tuning domain-specific datasets improves title generation quality more than using large LLMs without fine-tuning
- Mechanism: Domain-specific fine-tuning adapts general language patterns to academic writing style, enabling better capture of technical terminology and research conventions
- Core assumption: Academic abstracts and titles have distinctive linguistic patterns that can be learned through targeted fine-tuning
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We fine-tune pre-trained and large language models to generate titles of papers from their abstracts" and "Our experiments show that PEGASUS-large outperforms the other models"
  - [section]: "We believe the reason PEGASUS-large wins the competition is that it is trained with an objective function that favors summarization" and "Our observations show that although the LLMs show excellent performance on a wide range of NLP tasks, smaller models fine-tuned on custom datasets may exhibit better performance on a given task"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus neighbors focus on general language models but don't directly compare fine-tuning effectiveness for academic titles
- Break condition: If the domain-specific dataset is too small or unrepresentative, fine-tuning may not capture sufficient patterns

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Encoder-decoder models like PEGASUS-large outperform decoder-only LLMs for abstract-to-title generation
- Mechanism: Encoder-decoder architecture allows bidirectional context understanding of abstracts and autoregressive title generation, while decoder-only models lack this bidirectional encoding
- Core assumption: Understanding the full abstract context bidirectionally is crucial for generating coherent, relevant titles
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We choose several pre-trained transformer models which we fine-tune with a dataset of abstracts and titles"
  - [section]: "We have chosen the following pre-trained models from the Hugging Face repository for fine-tuning on the CSPubSum dataset: T5-base, BART-base, PEGASUS-large" and "PEGASUS-large contains 568M parameters" vs "GPT-3.5... has 175B parameters"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus neighbors discuss model architectures but not specifically for academic title generation
- Break condition: If the task requires more open-ended creativity than strict summarization, decoder-only models might perform better

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Semantic similarity metrics (BERTScore, SciBERTScore) better capture title quality than n-gram overlap metrics (ROUGE)
- Mechanism: Semantic metrics use contextual embeddings to measure meaning similarity rather than exact word matching, which is more appropriate for abstractive tasks
- Core assumption: High-quality titles can use different wording while preserving the same meaning as ground truth
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The performance of the models is measured with ROUGE, METEOR, MoverScore, BERTScore and SciBERTScore metrics"
  - [section]: "BERTScore calculates the cosine similarity between the BERT embeddings of the words in the two text sequences" and "SciBERTScore... uses SciBERT to generate the embeddings"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus neighbors discuss evaluation metrics but not specifically for title generation quality assessment
- Break condition: If titles require specific phrasing for SEO or citation purposes, n-gram overlap metrics may be more appropriate

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Transformer architecture and attention mechanisms
  - Why needed here: All models used are transformer-based; understanding how attention enables context understanding is crucial for debugging and improving results
  - Quick check question: How does the multi-head attention mechanism in transformers differ from traditional RNN approaches for handling long-range dependencies?

- Concept: Abstractive vs extractive summarization
  - Why needed here: Title generation is framed as abstractive summarization, requiring generation of new text rather than selecting existing sentences
  - Quick check question: What are the key architectural differences between models designed for abstractive vs extractive summarization?

- Concept: Entity recognition and factual consistency
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates factual consistency at entity level, requiring understanding of named entity recognition and its importance in scientific text
  - Quick check question: Why is entity-level evaluation particularly important for scientific paper title generation compared to general text summarization?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data pipeline → Model fine-tuning → Inference → Evaluation
- Critical path: Abstract → Tokenization → Model (fine-tuned) → Title generation → Evaluation metrics
- Design tradeoffs: Model size vs performance vs computational cost
  - PEGASUS-large (568M parameters) outperforms much larger models (175B for GPT-3.5)
  - Fine-tuning requires computational resources but enables domain adaptation
  - Zero-shot approaches are faster but may lack domain-specific quality
- Failure signatures:
  - Incomplete titles: Output token limit too restrictive
  - Hallucinated entities: Model generating content not supported by abstract
  - Poor semantic match: Wrong model architecture or insufficient fine-tuning
  - Low ROUGE scores but high semantic scores: Model generating creative but different wording
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test each model with fixed abstract input to verify basic functionality and compare outputs
  2. Vary temperature settings to find optimal balance between creativity and accuracy
  3. Compare entity-level precision between fine-tuned vs zero-shot models on sample abstracts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of PEGASUS-large compare to GPT-4 for title generation tasks when both models are fine-tuned on domain-specific data?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper suggests that PEGASUS-large outperforms other models including GPT-3.5 and LLaMA-3-8B on the tested datasets, and notes that larger models like GPT-4 might enhance quality, but doesn't directly compare PEGASUS-large to GPT-4.
- Why unresolved: The paper explicitly states GPT-4 is only available to paid subscribers and wasn't used, leaving the comparison untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Direct experimentation comparing PEGASUS-large and GPT-4 (both fine-tuned on domain-specific data) on the same datasets using identical evaluation metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between model size and fine-tuning data quality for title generation tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper observes that PEGASUS-large (568M parameters) outperforms much larger models like GPT-3.5 (175B parameters) and suggests that lighter models fine-tuned on domain-specific data may be more suitable than massive general-purpose models.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates PEGASUS-large's superiority in their experiments, it doesn't systematically explore the relationship between model size, data quality, and performance across different parameter scales.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying both model sizes (small, medium, large, extra-large) and data quality levels (generic vs. domain-specific) while measuring performance across multiple metrics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the abstractive nature of LLM-generated titles affect their perceived quality by domain experts compared to more extractive approaches?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that LLMs like ChatGPT-3.5 produce highly abstractive outputs with lower ROUGE scores but similar semantic similarity to original titles, and mentions that human evaluation showed PEGASUS-large titles were preferred in 80% of cases on CSPubSum.
- Why unresolved: The paper only reports preference rates without exploring why experts prefer certain titles or what characteristics make abstractive titles more or less acceptable.
- What evidence would resolve it: Qualitative analysis of expert feedback explaining their preferences, including specific examples of why abstractive vs. extractive titles are deemed more appropriate for different types of research papers.

## Limitations

- The CSPubSum dataset contains only 10,147 examples, which is relatively small for fine-tuning language models
- Zero-shot evaluation lacks transparency regarding prompt engineering, introducing variability not accounted for in comparative analysis
- Evaluation metrics may not fully capture title quality, particularly the balance between creativity and adherence to conventions

## Confidence

- **High Confidence (8/10)**: PEGASUS-large outperforms other models on both datasets
- **Medium Confidence (6/10)**: Fine-tuning on domain-specific data is more effective than using large LLMs without fine-tuning
- **Low Confidence (4/10)**: Encoder-decoder architecture is the primary reason for PEGASUS-large's superiority

## Next Checks

- **Validation Check 1**: Conduct a controlled experiment comparing PEGASUS-large with a fine-tuned decoder-only model of similar size to isolate the impact of encoder-decoder architecture versus other factors
- **Validation Check 2**: Perform prompt sensitivity analysis for the zero-shot models by testing multiple prompt variations to establish confidence intervals for their performance
- **Validation Check 3**: Expand the evaluation to include domain-specific quality metrics beyond entity-level factual consistency, such as keyword presence and readability scores
