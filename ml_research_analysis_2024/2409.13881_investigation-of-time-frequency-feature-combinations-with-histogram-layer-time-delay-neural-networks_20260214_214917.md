# Investigation of Time-Frequency Feature Combinations with Histogram Layer Time Delay Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.13881
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13881
- Reference count: 38
- Primary result: Optimal combination of VQT, MFCC, STFT, and GFCC achieves 66.17% ± 1.10% classification accuracy on DeepShip sonar dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how combining different time-frequency features affects underwater acoustic target recognition performance using a Histogram Layer Time Delay Neural Network (HLTDNN). The study evaluates six feature types—mel-frequency spectrogram, mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, short-time Fourier transform, gammatone-frequency cepstral coefficients, constant-Q transform, and variable-Q transform—and their combinations. An adaptive padding layer enables fusion of features with different dimensions before processing by the HLTDNN model. The research identifies that combining VQT, MFCC, STFT, and GFCC yields superior performance (66.17% accuracy) compared to using single features, demonstrating the synergistic benefits of multi-feature fusion for acoustic classification.

## Method Summary
The study uses the DeepShip sonar dataset containing audio segments from four ship types, with audio resampled to 16 kHz and segmented into 3-second intervals. Six time-frequency features are extracted using specified parameters (window/hop length: 250/64 ms, MFCC: 16 coefficients, STFT: 48 bins, others: 64 bins). An adaptive padding layer resizes and concatenates these features along the channel dimension to create a unified input. The HLTDNN architecture incorporates histogram layers parallel to convolutional blocks, with the histogram layer capturing statistical texture information and convolutional blocks capturing structural texture. The model is trained using Adagrad optimizer (learning rate 0.001), batch size 128, dropout rate 0.5, and early stopping after 15 epochs of no validation loss improvement.

## Key Results
- The optimal feature combination of VQT, MFCC, STFT, and GFCC achieves 66.17% ± 1.10% classification accuracy
- This outperforms the best single feature (MFCC) with 59.34% ± 3.16% accuracy
- The repeated appearance of MFCC and STFT across top-performing combinations indicates their importance in capturing impactful signal characteristics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Adaptive padding layer enables meaningful feature fusion by aligning different time-frequency resolutions without destroying intrinsic signal characteristics. Features with different dimensions are zero-padded symmetrically to a common spatial size before channel concatenation, allowing the HLTDNN to process heterogeneous inputs while preserving relative frequency/time positioning. Core assumption: Symmetric zero-padding does not distort the statistical distribution of feature values within local regions. Break condition: Padding introduces excessive empty regions, diluting feature density.

### Mechanism 2
Histogram layer captures statistical texture information that complements the structural texture learning of convolutional blocks. The histogram layer processes each input feature dimension using radial basis functions over learned bin centers and widths, generating output histograms that encode the distribution of feature values within local spatial regions. Core assumption: Statistical texture information is complementary to structural texture information for underwater acoustic classification. Break condition: Learned bin parameters do not align with actual feature distributions.

### Mechanism 3
Certain feature combinations capture complementary acoustic signatures, leading to synergistic performance gains. Different time-frequency features are sensitive to different aspects of sound signals (MFCC captures perceptual spectral envelope, STFT provides consistent local spectra, VQT offers improved low-frequency resolution). Combining these features provides a richer representation that captures multiple acoustic characteristics simultaneously. Core assumption: Acoustic characteristics captured by different features are complementary rather than redundant. Break condition: Feature combinations include redundant information that doesn't improve and may degrade performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Time-frequency representation of audio signals
  - Why needed here: Understanding how spectrograms capture acoustic signatures is essential for appreciating why different feature types might be complementary
  - Quick check question: What is the primary difference between MFCC and STFT in terms of how they represent audio signals?

- Concept: Feature fusion and its impact on model performance
  - Why needed here: The paper investigates combining different features to improve classification, requiring understanding of how feature fusion works and its potential benefits/drawbacks
  - Quick check question: Why might combining multiple time-frequency features lead to better classification performance than using a single feature?

- Concept: Statistical vs. structural texture analysis
  - Why needed here: The HLTDNN combines histogram layers (statistical) with convolutional blocks (structural), so understanding this distinction is crucial for grasping the model architecture
  - Quick check question: How does a histogram layer differ from a convolutional layer in terms of what type of information it captures from an image or spectrogram?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Adaptive padding layer -> Feature concatenation -> HLTDNN backbone (convolutional blocks + histogram layer) -> Classification layer
- Critical path: Feature combination → Adaptive padding → HLTDNN processing → Classification
- Design tradeoffs: Balancing complementary information vs. redundancy in feature selection; symmetric padding preserves structure but may introduce empty regions; adding histogram layers increases parameter count and computational cost
- Failure signatures: Performance degrades when combining features that capture similar information; model overfits when too many features are combined relative to dataset size; classification accuracy plateaus or decreases when adding additional features beyond optimal combination
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement adaptive padding layer and verify it correctly resizes and concatenates different feature dimensions
  2. Test HLTDNN with single feature inputs (MFCC, STFT, VQT, GFCC) to establish baseline performance
  3. Test HLTDNN with all possible two-feature combinations to identify initial synergies and redundancies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How do different window and hop length parameters affect the performance of feature combinations in HLTDNN for underwater acoustic target recognition? The paper specifies using 250 ms window and 64 ms hop length but does not explore the impact of varying these parameters on classification performance. Systematic experiments varying window and hop lengths for each feature type would resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
What is the computational efficiency trade-off between using feature combinations versus single features in HLTDNN models? While the paper demonstrates improved accuracy with feature combinations, it does not discuss the computational cost or inference time differences. Comparative analysis of inference times, memory usage, and computational complexity would resolve this question.

### Open Question 3
How do feature combinations perform across different underwater environments and noise conditions? The DeepShip dataset includes recordings under various sea states and noise levels but the study does not specifically analyze performance variations across these conditions. Detailed analysis of classification accuracy across different environmental conditions would resolve this question.

### Open Question 4
What is the optimal number of histogram bins for different feature combinations in HLTDNN? The paper states that the number of bins was set to 16 following previous work but does not investigate whether this is optimal for the specific feature combinations used. Systematic experiments varying the number of histogram bins for each feature combination would resolve this question.

## Limitations

- The adaptive padding layer's impact on feature alignment is not empirically validated, lacking analysis of how different padding strategies affect model performance
- The HLTDNN architecture details beyond the histogram layer integration are sparse, with only "multiple convolution layers" mentioned without specifying depth or kernel sizes
- The DeepShip dataset composition is unclear, with no discussion of sample distribution per class or potential class imbalance that could impact generalization claims

## Confidence

- High confidence: The empirical finding that combining VQT, MFCC, STFT, and GFCC achieves 66.17% ± 1.10% accuracy is well-supported by experimental results and statistical analysis
- Medium confidence: The mechanism explaining why certain feature combinations work better (complementary acoustic signatures) is plausible but not definitively proven through ablation studies
- Low confidence: The claim that the adaptive padding layer preserves intrinsic signal characteristics without distortion lacks supporting evidence or comparison to alternative fusion strategies

## Next Checks

1. Conduct an ablation study comparing the adaptive padding layer to alternative feature fusion strategies (e.g., interpolation, cropping) to quantify its contribution to performance gains

2. Perform feature importance analysis on the optimal feature combination to determine which features contribute most to classification decisions and validate the complementary information hypothesis

3. Test the HLTDNN with varying numbers of histogram bins and radial basis function parameters to determine if the current configuration is optimal or if performance could be improved through hyperparameter tuning
