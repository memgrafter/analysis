# Exploring and Applying Audio-Based Sentiment Analysis in Music

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.17379
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17379
- Authors: Etash Jhanji
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: LSTM models achieved RMSE of 0.235 for validation and MSE of 0.0005 for validation in predicting arousal and valence values from music audio

## Executive Summary
This study explored the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for audio-based sentiment analysis in music. Two tasks were addressed: predicting the emotion of a musical clip over time and determining the next emotion value for seamless transitions. Utilizing the Emotions in Music Database, models were trained on Mel Spectrograms of audio clips. The first task involved predicting arousal and valence values of 0.5-second clips, achieving a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.235 for validation and 0.21 for training, indicating the model's ability to match human predictions. The second task focused on predicting the next pair of arousal and valence values from a time sequence of length 10, resulting in a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0004 for training and 0.0005 for validation, demonstrating effective performance. A linear regression approach was also explored but showed limitations in predicting exact values. Overall, the LSTM models effectively performed the designed tasks, showcasing their potential for applications in music therapy and intelligent music queueing.

## Method Summary
The study utilized the Emotions in Music Database containing 700 free-use songs annotated with arousal and valence values. Audio clips were processed into 128x44 Mel Spectrograms, and LSTM models were trained to predict continuous arousal and valence values. Two tasks were addressed: predicting emotions of 0.5-second clips and determining next emotion values for seamless transitions. The first task used an LSTM with 2 layers, 20 hidden units, and dropout 0.1, while the second task employed an LSTM with 2 modules, 32 hidden units, and no dropout. Both models were trained using the Adam optimizer with mean squared error loss and early stopping.

## Key Results
- Task 1 (0.5-second clip emotion prediction): RMSE of 0.235 for validation and 0.21 for training
- Task 2 (next emotion value prediction): MSE of 0.0004 for training and 0.0005 for validation
- Linear regression baseline showed limitations in predicting exact values
- Models effectively performed designed tasks, demonstrating potential for music therapy and intelligent music queueing

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LSTM models effectively capture temporal dependencies in audio signals, enabling accurate emotion prediction over time.
- Mechanism: LSTM networks maintain a hidden state that encodes previous inputs, allowing them to remember information over long sequences and learn patterns in arousal and valence values across time.
- Core assumption: The emotional content of music exhibits temporal continuity and patterns that can be learned from sequential data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Utilizing data from the Emotions in Music Database... models are trained for both tasks. Overall, the performance of these models reflected that they were able to perform the tasks they were designed for effectively and accurately."
  - [section]: "LSTMs solve this problem with a more sophisticated architecture. This type of model is able to outperform traditional models where long-term dependencies play a part in prediction, such as in audio where data takes place over time."
  - [corpus]: Weak or missing evidence from corpus.
- Break condition: If emotional transitions in music become highly unpredictable or chaotic, breaking the temporal continuity assumption.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Mel spectrograms provide a suitable representation of audio features for emotion prediction in music.
- Mechanism: Mel spectrograms transform audio waveforms into frequency domain representations that emphasize human-perceivable frequencies, capturing timbral and harmonic information relevant to emotional content.
- Core assumption: The emotional characteristics of music are encoded in its spectral content and can be extracted from Mel spectrograms.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Utilizing data from the Emotions in Music Database, which contains clips of songs selected from the Free Music Archive annotated with levels of valence and arousal... models are trained for both tasks."
  - [section]: "The extracted Mel Spectrogram dataset was then tied to its continuous arousal and valence coordinates."
  - [corpus]: Weak or missing evidence from corpus.
- Break condition: If emotional information in music is primarily encoded in features not captured by Mel spectrograms (e.g., lyrics, higher-level musical structure).

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The circumplex model of affect provides a valid framework for quantifying musical emotions in a regression task.
- Mechanism: Russell's model represents emotions as points in a two-dimensional space defined by arousal and valence dimensions, allowing for continuous prediction of emotional states rather than discrete classification.
- Core assumption: Musical emotions can be accurately represented and predicted as continuous values of arousal and valence.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The dataset used also utilizes Russel's model on audio samples as the samples are annotated to show the emotion intended to be induced by the clip."
  - [section]: "Russell's circumplex model of affect proposes that emotions arise as a product of two separate circuits: arousal and valence."
  - [corpus]: Weak or missing evidence from corpus.
- Break condition: If musical emotions cannot be adequately captured by a two-dimensional continuous space or if the circumplex model does not accurately represent the emotional space of music.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: LSTM architecture and its advantages over traditional RNNs
  - Why needed here: LSTMs are crucial for capturing temporal dependencies in audio signals, which is essential for predicting emotions over time in music clips.
  - Quick check question: What problem do LSTMs solve that traditional RNNs struggle with, and why is this important for audio-based sentiment analysis?

- Concept: Audio signal processing and feature extraction techniques
  - Why needed here: Understanding how audio signals are transformed into features (like Mel spectrograms) is critical for working with audio data and interpreting model inputs and outputs.
  - Quick check question: How does a Mel spectrogram differ from a regular spectrogram, and why might it be preferred for audio-based sentiment analysis in music?

- Concept: Regression vs. classification in machine learning
  - Why needed here: The task involves predicting continuous values of arousal and valence rather than discrete emotion categories, requiring an understanding of regression techniques.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between regression and classification tasks in machine learning, and why is regression more appropriate for this sentiment analysis problem?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data preprocessing -> Mel spectrogram extraction -> LSTM model -> Arousal and valence prediction

- Critical path:
  1. Load and preprocess audio data into Mel spectrograms
  2. Train LSTM model on arousal and valence prediction task
  3. Evaluate model performance and adjust hyperparameters
  4. Implement intelligent queuing task using trained model

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model complexity vs. training time: Deeper LSTMs may capture more complex patterns but require more computational resources
  - Input resolution vs. model capacity: Higher-resolution Mel spectrograms provide more information but increase computational load
  - Generalization vs. overfitting: Regularization techniques like dropout help prevent overfitting but may limit model capacity

- Failure signatures:
  - High training error but low validation error: Potential underfitting, model may be too simple
  - Low training error but high validation error: Overfitting, model may be too complex or data may be insufficient
  - Consistently high error across training and validation: Model architecture or feature extraction may be inadequate for the task

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Vary the learning rate and observe its effect on convergence and final performance
  2. Compare model performance with and without dropout regularization
  3. Experiment with different input resolutions (e.g., varying Mel spectrogram parameters) to find the optimal balance between information content and model capacity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper does not explore genre-specific performance variations or cultural music differences.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on a general dataset without genre or cultural segmentation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the model on segmented datasets by genre or cultural origin and comparing performance metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the long-term effects of using this model in therapeutic settings for patients with neurological disorders?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions potential therapeutic applications but does not explore long-term effects or clinical trials.
- Why unresolved: The study is exploratory and does not include clinical application or longitudinal studies.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting clinical trials and longitudinal studies to assess therapeutic outcomes over time.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the inclusion of additional features, such as lyrics or visual elements, impact the model's accuracy in sentiment prediction?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses solely on audio-based sentiment analysis without considering multimodal inputs.
- Why unresolved: The study does not explore the integration of lyrics or visual elements into the model.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimenting with multimodal inputs and comparing sentiment prediction accuracy with and without additional features.

## Limitations
- Results based on a single dataset may not generalize to other musical styles or cultural contexts
- Lack of extensive validation across diverse musical genres and emotional expression patterns
- Comparison with human prediction variation provides baseline but doesn't fully establish practical utility in real-world applications

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The LSTM architecture's ability to capture temporal dependencies in audio signals for emotion prediction
- Medium Confidence: The effectiveness of Mel spectrograms as features for emotion prediction
- Medium Confidence: The circumplex model of affect as a valid framework for continuous emotion prediction

## Next Checks
1. Test the model's performance on an independent dataset with different musical genres to assess generalizability across diverse musical styles and cultural contexts.
2. Conduct a user study comparing the model's predictions with human listeners' emotional assessments in real-world listening scenarios to validate practical utility.
3. Implement the intelligent queueing system in a controlled experiment to evaluate its effectiveness in creating seamless emotional transitions between musical pieces in actual playback systems.
