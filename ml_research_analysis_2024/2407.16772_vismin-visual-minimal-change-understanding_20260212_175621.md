# VisMin: Visual Minimal-Change Understanding

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.16772
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16772
- Authors: Rabiul Awal; Saba Ahmadi; Le Zhang; Aishwarya Agrawal
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: VLMs struggle with spatial relationships and counting tasks; fine-tuning on minimal-change data significantly improves fine-grained understanding across multiple benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces VisMin, a benchmark designed to evaluate fine-grained visual understanding in vision-language models. VisMin requires models to predict the correct image-caption match given two images and two captions, with minimal changes (object, attribute, count, or spatial relation) between each pair. The authors developed an automated pipeline using large language models and diffusion models, followed by rigorous human verification, to curate the benchmark. Empirical results show that current VLMs struggle with spatial relationships and counting tasks. The authors also generated a large-scale training dataset and fine-tuned CLIP and Idefics2 models, resulting in significant improvements across various benchmarks and in general image-text alignment. The benchmark, training data, and fine-tuned models are publicly available.

## Method Summary
The paper presents an automated pipeline for creating minimal-change image-text pairs using LLMs for edit instruction generation, diffusion models for image synthesis, and VQA models for filtering. Human verification ensures quality across three stages: edit instruction selection, synthetic image validation, and minimal-change property verification. The benchmark consists of 2,084 human-verified samples across four categories (object, attribute, count, spatial relation). Fine-tuning is performed on a synthetic dataset of 64,392 samples using standard CLIP loss without architectural modifications, demonstrating significant improvements in fine-grained understanding.

## Key Results
- Current VLMs exhibit notable deficiencies in understanding spatial relationships, with both VLMs and MLLMs performing below random chance on spatial relation tasks
- Fine-tuning CLIP and Idefics2 on minimal-change data results in significant improvements across benchmarks including VSR, CountBench, SPEC, Winoground, and EQBEN
- MLLMs like Idefics2 show better performance on spatial reasoning tasks compared to foundational VLMs, highlighting the importance of multi-image processing capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: VisMin improves spatial reasoning by forcing models to distinguish minimal changes in object spatial relationships.
- Mechanism: The benchmark generates image pairs where only the spatial relation between objects changes while keeping all other attributes constant, isolating spatial reasoning from object recognition.
- Core assumption: Spatial reasoning ability can be measured independently of object recognition performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Empirical experiments reveal that current VLMs exhibit notable deficiencies in understanding spatial relationships"
  - [section]: "For spatial relation understanding, although MLLMs perform better than VLMs, both families of models perform below random chance!"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus neighbors focus on spatial reasoning benchmarks but don't directly support this mechanism
- Break condition: If models can succeed by memorizing object positions rather than understanding spatial relations, or if spatial reasoning cannot be isolated from other visual skills.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Fine-tuning on minimal-change data improves fine-grained understanding across multiple benchmarks.
- Mechanism: Training on synthetic pairs with minimal differences teaches models to attend to subtle visual differences rather than relying on dominant features.
- Core assumption: Models can generalize from synthetic minimal changes to real-world fine-grained distinctions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We generate a large-scale training dataset to finetune CLIP and Idefics2, showing significant improvements in fine-grained understanding across benchmarks"
  - [section]: "Fine-tuning CLIP (a foundational VLM) and Idefics2 (a MLLM) on our minimal-change data, without any additional modifications to the model architecture or loss functions, results in significant improvements in fine-grained understanding"
  - [corpus]: Moderate - corpus includes papers on spatial reasoning evaluation but doesn't directly support generalization claims
- Break condition: If synthetic minimal changes don't transfer to natural image differences, or if models overfit to synthetic patterns.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multi-image processing in MLLMs improves spatial reasoning performance.
- Mechanism: Models that can process multiple images in a sequence better capture spatial relationships between objects compared to models that only see single images.
- Core assumption: Spatial reasoning requires comparing multiple visual contexts simultaneously.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "For spatial relation understanding, although MLLMs perform better than VLMs, both families of models perform below random chance"
  - [section]: "Notably, Idefics2, which supports multi-image processing, performs similarly on text and image scores, underscoring the importance of multi-image data during pretraining"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus neighbors don't provide evidence for multi-image processing benefits
- Break condition: If spatial reasoning performance doesn't correlate with multi-image processing capability, or if single-image models can achieve similar performance through other mechanisms.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Minimal-change data generation
  - Why needed here: The benchmark and training data rely on creating synthetic image-caption pairs with controlled, minimal differences
  - Quick check question: How does the pipeline ensure that only one aspect changes between image pairs while others remain constant?

- Concept: Spatial reasoning evaluation
  - Why needed here: Understanding why current models fail at spatial tasks and how VisMin addresses this gap
  - Quick check question: What specific types of spatial relationships does VisMin test, and why are they challenging for current models?

- Concept: Fine-tuning methodology for VLMs
  - Why needed here: The paper demonstrates significant improvements through fine-tuning on synthetic data without architectural changes
  - Quick check question: What specific training protocol is used for fine-tuning CLIP and Idefics2 on minimal-change data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: LLM-guided edit instructions -> Diffusion models -> VQA filtering -> Human verification -> Benchmark creation
- Critical path: Data generation → Human verification → Model fine-tuning → Benchmark evaluation → Generalization testing
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Synthetic vs. natural data: Synthetic allows controlled minimal changes but may have naturalness issues
  - Human verification: Ensures quality but limits scalability
  - Multi-image vs. single-image processing: Multi-image helps spatial reasoning but increases computational cost
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor spatial reasoning despite good object recognition
  - Overfitting to synthetic patterns that don't transfer to natural images
  - Degradation in general image-text alignment after fine-tuning
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Generate minimal-change pairs for object and attribute categories using the LLM-guided edit instructions pipeline
  2. Evaluate baseline CLIP and Idefics2 models on VisMin benchmark to establish performance baselines
  3. Fine-tune CLIP on the synthetic minimal-change dataset and measure improvements on VisMin and COCO retrieval tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the automated pipeline for creating minimal-change image-text pairs scale to larger datasets or more complex scenes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper describes an automated pipeline using LLMs and diffusion models, but does not provide details on scalability or performance with larger or more complex datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the methodology and results of the benchmark but does not address potential challenges or limitations when scaling the pipeline to larger datasets or more complex scenes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing the pipeline's performance and scalability with larger datasets or more complex scenes would provide insights into its practical applicability and limitations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do the fine-tuned models perform on other visual understanding tasks beyond those evaluated in the paper?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper evaluates the fine-tuned models on various benchmarks but does not explore their performance on a broader range of visual understanding tasks.
- Why unresolved: The paper's focus is on specific benchmarks, and it does not investigate the generalization capabilities of the fine-tuned models to other visual understanding tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results demonstrating the fine-tuned models' performance on a diverse set of visual understanding tasks would provide insights into their generalization capabilities and potential applications.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do the models handle real-world scenarios where objects, attributes, counts, and spatial relations are more complex and varied than in the benchmark dataset?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The benchmark dataset is designed to test fine-grained understanding, but real-world scenarios often involve more complex and varied visual information.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not address the models' performance in real-world scenarios where the visual information is more complex and varied than in the benchmark dataset.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing the models' performance in real-world scenarios with complex and varied visual information would provide insights into their practical applicability and limitations.

## Limitations
- The benchmark's reliance on synthetic data generation introduces potential domain shift issues where models trained on automatically generated minimal changes may not generalize to naturally occurring fine-grained distinctions
- The human verification process, while ensuring quality, creates scalability bottlenecks and may introduce subjective biases in what constitutes acceptable minimal changes
- Current evaluation focuses primarily on COCO-style images, limiting generalizability to more diverse visual domains

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The benchmark construction methodology and empirical results showing VLMs' poor spatial reasoning performance are well-supported by the experimental data.

**Medium Confidence**: Claims about fine-tuning improvements transferring to multiple benchmarks are supported but could benefit from more extensive testing on diverse datasets.

**Medium Confidence**: The mechanism by which multi-image processing improves spatial reasoning is plausible but not conclusively demonstrated through ablation studies.

## Next Checks
1. Test the fine-tuned models on naturally occurring fine-grained distinctions in datasets like Visual Genome or localized COCO images to verify transfer from synthetic to natural data.
2. Conduct controlled ablation studies comparing single-image vs. multi-image model variants on spatial reasoning tasks while controlling for other architectural differences.
3. Evaluate model robustness to minimal changes across diverse visual domains (medical imaging, satellite imagery, etc.) to assess generalizability beyond the COCO domain.
