## Executive Summary
This study explores the use of multimodal fusion-based deep learning for detecting facial palsy, addressing the limitations of current labor-intensive and subjective clinical assessments. The proposed approach integrates unstructured data (RGB images and facial line segments) with structured data (facial expression features) to improve detection accuracy. Using a dataset of 21 facial palsy patients, the research evaluates various data modalities and model architectures, including feed-forward neural networks and ResNet-based models. The ResNet-based model using facial line segment images achieved the highest recall (83.47%), while the feed-forward neural network using facial expression features achieved the highest precision (76.22%). Multimodal fusion models, combining line segment images and facial expression features, slightly improved precision (77.05%) but reduced recall. The findings demonstrate the potential of multimodal fusion for enhancing facial palsy detection while highlighting areas for further optimization.

## Method Summary
The study employs a multimodal fusion approach to detect facial palsy using deep learning models. Three types of data were collected: RGB facial images, facial line segment images, and facial expression features. Two model architectures were evaluated: a feed-forward neural network and a ResNet-based model. The ResNet model was pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned for this task. Data preprocessing included cropping faces to 224x224 pixels and normalizing pixel values. Facial expression features were extracted using the OpenFace toolkit. The multimodal fusion was implemented by concatenating the feature vectors from different modalities before the final classification layer. Models were trained using binary cross-entropy loss with Adam optimization. Evaluation metrics included precision, recall, and F1-score, calculated using a confusion matrix approach.

## Key Results
- ResNet-based model using facial line segment images achieved highest recall (83.47%)
- Feed-forward neural network using facial expression features achieved highest precision (76.22%)
- Multimodal fusion models combining line segment images and facial expression features slightly improved precision (77.05%) but reduced recall

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The multimodal fusion approach leverages complementary information from different data sources to improve facial palsy detection. RGB images capture overall facial appearance and symmetry, while line segment images highlight facial muscle movements and deformations. Facial expression features provide quantitative measurements of facial action units. By combining these modalities, the model can capture both visual and quantitative aspects of facial palsy, potentially leading to more robust and accurate detection compared to single-modality approaches.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Raw Data -> Preprocessing -> Feature Extraction -> Multimodal Fusion -> Classification

**Critical Path:**
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
2. Feature Extraction from Multiple Modalities
3. Multimodal Fusion and Classification

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Choice of fusion strategy (early vs. late fusion)
- Selection of individual modality models
- Balance between model complexity and dataset size

**Failure Signatures:**
- Overfitting due to small dataset size
- Poor generalization across different facial palsy severities
- Imbalanced precision and recall trade-offs

**First Experiments:**
1. Evaluate individual modality models separately to establish baseline performance
2. Implement early fusion strategy and compare to late fusion
3. Conduct ablation study to determine contribution of each modality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Small dataset size (21 facial palsy patients) limits generalizability
- Mixed performance metrics indicate potential challenges with false positives/negatives
- Lack of comparison to existing clinical assessment methods

## Confidence
- Major claim (Multimodal fusion improves facial palsy detection): Medium
- Results generalizability: Low
- Clinical utility: Low

## Next Checks
1. Validate the models on a larger, more diverse dataset that includes different severities and types of facial palsy, as well as healthy controls, to assess generalizability and potential biases.
2. Conduct a head-to-head comparison of the deep learning models against standard clinical assessment tools (e.g., House-Brackmann scale) to evaluate real-world clinical utility and potential improvements in detection accuracy.
3. Perform ablation studies to determine the individual and combined contributions of each data modality (RGB images, line segments, and facial expression features) to the overall performance, and optimize the fusion strategy accordingly.
