# ProAct: Progressive Training for Hybrid Clipped Activation Function to Enhance Resilience of DNNs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.06313
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06313
- Reference count: 40
- Improves DNN resilience up to 6.4x at high bit error rates with 134.28x reduced memory overhead

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of improving the reliability of deep neural networks (DNNs) against hardware faults, particularly in safety-critical applications. The authors propose ProAct, a progressive training methodology that employs a hybrid clipped activation function to enhance fault resilience while minimizing memory overhead. ProAct uses knowledge distillation to iteratively train threshold parameters for the hybrid clipped ReLU (HyReLU) activation function, applying neuron-wise clipping only in the last layer and layer-wise clipping in preceding layers. Experimental results demonstrate that ProAct improves DNN resilience up to 6.4x at high bit error rates compared to state-of-the-art methods, while reducing memory overhead by up to 134.28x.

## Method Summary
ProAct introduces a progressive training approach that combines knowledge distillation with a hybrid clipped activation function. The method trains threshold parameters for the HyReLU activation function through iterative rounds, where each round involves (1) fixing thresholds for previous layers and training the next layer's thresholds using knowledge distillation, and (2) fine-tuning the entire network. The hybrid clipping strategy applies neuron-wise clipping only to the last layer and layer-wise clipping to preceding layers, reducing memory overhead while maintaining resilience. The progressive training schedule allows the network to gradually adapt to the clipping constraints, resulting in improved fault tolerance without significant accuracy degradation.

## Key Results
- ProAct improves DNN resilience up to 6.4x at high bit error rates compared to state-of-the-art methods
- Achieves up to 134.28x reduction in memory overhead compared to neuron-wise clipping baselines
- Maintains competitive accuracy on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets across AlexNet, VGG-16, and ResNet-50 architectures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ProAct's effectiveness stems from its progressive training approach that gradually adapts the network to hybrid clipping constraints. By using knowledge distillation, the method preserves knowledge from the original unclipped network while training threshold parameters for the HyReLU activation function. The hybrid clipping strategy (neuron-wise for last layer, layer-wise for others) balances resilience benefits with memory efficiency. Progressive training allows the network to maintain accuracy while developing fault tolerance, as each training round builds upon previously learned thresholds.

## Foundational Learning
- Knowledge distillation: A technique for transferring knowledge from a larger model to a smaller one; needed for preserving network knowledge during threshold training
- Quick check: Verify that temperature scaling is properly applied during distillation

- Hybrid clipping strategies: Neuron-wise vs layer-wise clipping tradeoffs; needed for balancing resilience and memory overhead
- Quick check: Confirm that neuron-wise clipping is only applied to the final layer

- Progressive training: Iterative approach to gradually adapt network parameters; needed for stable convergence to fault-tolerant configuration
- Quick check: Validate that each training round builds upon previous threshold values

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Input -> Hybrid Clipped Activation (HyReLU) -> Progressive Threshold Training -> Fault-Tolerant Output
- Critical path: Knowledge distillation phase -> Threshold parameter optimization -> Fine-tuning phase
- Design tradeoffs: Neuron-wise clipping offers better resilience but higher memory cost; layer-wise clipping reduces memory but may sacrifice some resilience
- Failure signatures: Bit errors in weight/activation values cause misclassification; progressive training mitigates this through threshold adaptation
- First experiments: 1) Test single-layer HyReLU threshold training with knowledge distillation, 2) Compare neuron-wise vs layer-wise clipping memory usage, 3) Validate progressive training schedule convergence

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to convolutional architectures and image classification tasks
- Unclear performance at extremely high bit error rates beyond tested ranges
- Memory overhead comparisons depend on specific implementation choices for baseline methods

## Confidence
- High: Improvement in fault resilience compared to existing methods
- High: Reduction in memory overhead
- Medium: Scalability across different DNN architectures and datasets
- Low: Sensitivity of results to different initialization strategies or training schedules

## Next Checks
1. Test ProAct on transformer-based architectures and natural language processing tasks to assess cross-domain applicability
2. Evaluate performance under bit error rates exceeding those tested in the current study to determine robustness limits
3. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of neuron-wise versus layer-wise clipping to overall resilience improvement
