# A Measure for Transparent Comparison of Linguistic Diversity in Multilingual NLP Data Sets

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.03909
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03909
- Reference count: 40
- Most popular multilingual datasets are missing languages with rich morphology

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a transparent framework for comparing linguistic diversity across multilingual NLP datasets by representing languages as sets of typological features and measuring coverage using a generalized Jaccard similarity index. The approach combines traditional typological features from databases like WALS with automatically extracted text-based features to create a comprehensive measure of linguistic diversity. The study reveals that datasets with more languages or language families don't necessarily have higher linguistic diversity, and identifies specific gaps in current datasets, particularly the underrepresentation of morphologically rich languages with longer words.

## Method Summary
The authors propose representing each language as a set of typological features and measuring dataset diversity by comparing the union of these language sets against a reference set of all considered languages. They use a generalized Jaccard similarity index that accounts for both shared and unique features between the dataset and reference. The method incorporates features from WALS for traditional typological properties and automatically extracts features like mean word length from Wikipedia text. The approach is validated by correlating diversity scores with low-resource language performance on machine translation tasks, showing that more diverse datasets tend to perform better on unseen languages.

## Key Results
- Most popular multilingual datasets are missing languages with rich morphology, particularly those with longer words
- Datasets with more languages or families don't necessarily have higher linguistic diversity
- Text-based features can serve as effective approximations of morphological complexity
- The generalized Jaccard similarity index successfully captures linguistic diversity coverage

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by quantifying linguistic diversity through feature overlap, where each language is represented as a vector of typological properties. The generalized Jaccard index measures how much of the reference linguistic space is covered by a given dataset, with higher scores indicating better coverage. By using both curated typological features and automatically extracted text features, the method captures both high-level linguistic properties and specific morphological patterns. The validation with downstream task performance confirms that datasets with higher diversity scores tend to generalize better to unseen languages, suggesting that typological coverage translates to practical benefits in multilingual NLP systems.

## Foundational Learning

**Generalized Jaccard Similarity Index**
- Why needed: To measure overlap between feature sets while accounting for unique elements in each set
- Quick check: Calculate Jaccard index between two simple sets (e.g., {1,2,3} and {2,3,4} should yield 0.5)

**Typological Features**
- Why needed: To represent languages in a comparable, quantifiable format
- Quick check: Verify WALS feature mappings for at least 3 languages across different families

**Feature Extraction from Text**
- Why needed: To obtain morphological properties when typological databases are incomplete
- Quick check: Extract mean word length from sample texts in different languages and compare

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
- Typological Databases (WALS) -> Feature Vector Construction -> Diversity Calculation -> Performance Validation

**Critical Path**
1. Feature extraction and representation
2. Diversity score computation using generalized Jaccard index
3. Validation through downstream task performance

**Design Tradeoffs**
The approach balances between using curated typological features (more reliable but incomplete) and automatically extracted features (more comprehensive but potentially noisier). This dual approach provides robustness but requires careful feature selection to ensure meaningful comparisons.

**Failure Signatures**
- Over-reliance on text-based features may bias toward languages with sufficient digital content
- Missing or incorrect feature values in typological databases can distort diversity measurements
- The method assumes feature independence, which may not hold for all linguistic properties

**First 3 Experiments**
1. Compare diversity scores using only WALS features versus only text-based features
2. Test sensitivity by removing one major feature category and observing score changes
3. Validate the correlation between diversity scores and low-resource language performance across different task types

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The approach relies heavily on feature selection, which can influence which languages appear underrepresented
- Typological databases like WALS have known gaps and biases that affect the diversity measurement
- Wikipedia-based feature extraction may introduce sampling bias as content varies across languages

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The methodological framework for measuring linguistic diversity using feature-based similarity is sound and reproducible

**Medium confidence**: The finding that popular datasets underrepresent morphologically rich languages is well-supported, though the specific impact on model performance needs further validation

**Medium confidence**: The assertion that more languages or families don't necessarily increase diversity is valid within the feature-based framework but may not capture all aspects of linguistic diversity

## Next Checks

1. Test the framework's sensitivity to different feature selection strategies by systematically varying feature sets and measuring impact on diversity rankings

2. Conduct controlled experiments adding specifically identified underrepresented language types to existing datasets and measuring downstream model performance changes

3. Validate the Wikipedia-based feature extraction approach by comparing results with features derived from other text sources and assessing stability across different text domains
