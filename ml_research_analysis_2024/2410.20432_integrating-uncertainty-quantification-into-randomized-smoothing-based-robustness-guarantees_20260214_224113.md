# Integrating uncertainty quantification into randomized smoothing based robustness guarantees

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2410.20432
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20432
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Proposed RNCL robustness radius can be up to 20.93% larger than standard randomized smoothing approaches while improving out-of-distribution detection

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel framework that integrates uncertainty quantification into randomized smoothing-based robustness guarantees. The authors derive two new robustness radii - RCC (radius for consistent and confident predictions) and RNCL (radius guaranteeing no wrong confident predictions) - that leverage uncertainty estimates from base classifiers. Through a sample-based estimation procedure, the method outperforms the one-vs-all approach of Cohen et al. [2019] on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, demonstrating that incorporating uncertainty can substantially increase certified robustness while also improving out-of-distribution detection capabilities.

## Method Summary
The paper extends randomized smoothing by incorporating uncertainty quantification into the certification process. Rather than relying solely on majority voting as in standard approaches, the authors use uncertainty measures from base classifiers to derive tighter robustness bounds. The RCC radius ensures predictions remain both consistent and confident within the certified region, while RNCL guarantees no wrong confident predictions. A sample-based estimation procedure is proposed that samples multiple points within the smoothing distribution and aggregates uncertainty estimates to compute these radii. This approach systematically evaluates robustness across different architectures and uncertainty measures, providing a framework that can be applied to various model types beyond the standard randomized smoothing setup.

## Key Results
- RNCL robustness radius up to 20.93% larger than standard randomized smoothing approaches on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet
- Sample-based estimation procedure outperforms the one-vs-all method of Cohen et al. [2019] in both accuracy and robustness
- Incorporating uncertainty quantification improves out-of-distribution detection while maintaining certified robustness
- The framework enables systematic evaluation of robustness across different architectures and uncertainty measures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging uncertainty information that is typically discarded in standard randomized smoothing. While traditional approaches only consider majority voting outcomes, this framework uses uncertainty measures (such as entropy or confidence scores) from the base classifier to make more informed robustness guarantees. By requiring not just consistency but also confidence in predictions within the certified radius, the method can exclude regions where the classifier is uncertain, leading to tighter and more meaningful robustness bounds. The sample-based estimation procedure aggregates uncertainty information across multiple samples, providing more robust estimates than point-based methods.

## Foundational Learning

**Randomized Smoothing:** A technique that smooths classifier decisions by adding noise to inputs, providing certified robustness guarantees against $\ell_2$ norm bounded adversarial perturbations. Why needed: Forms the foundation upon which uncertainty quantification is built. Quick check: Verify that noise level $\sigma$ is properly tuned for the dataset.

**Uncertainty Quantification:** Methods to estimate the confidence or uncertainty of classifier predictions, including entropy, confidence scores, and other probabilistic measures. Why needed: Provides the additional information leveraged to improve robustness bounds. Quick check: Ensure uncertainty measures are properly calibrated across different classes.

**Certified Robustness:** Mathematical guarantees that classifier predictions remain unchanged within a specified radius around input points. Why needed: Provides provable security guarantees rather than empirical robustness. Quick check: Verify that certification bounds are computed correctly using concentration inequalities.

**Sample-based Estimation:** Statistical methods that use multiple samples to estimate quantities of interest, reducing variance compared to point estimates. Why needed: Enables aggregation of uncertainty information across multiple points for more reliable estimates. Quick check: Verify sample size is sufficient for desired confidence levels.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Base classifier -> Uncertainty estimator -> Sample generator -> Robustness certifier -> Final robustness radius

**Critical Path:** The most critical components are the uncertainty estimator and the sample-based aggregation procedure. The quality of uncertainty estimates directly impacts the tightness of the final robustness bounds, while the sample-based approach determines computational efficiency and statistical reliability.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework trades computational overhead (due to multiple samples and uncertainty calculations) for tighter robustness bounds and improved out-of-distribution detection. Alternative uncertainty measures can be plugged in, but their calibration and reliability become critical factors.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor uncertainty calibration will lead to overly conservative or overly optimistic robustness bounds. Insufficient sampling will result in high-variance estimates. The method may fail when base classifiers provide unreliable uncertainty estimates, particularly for out-of-distribution inputs.

**First Experiments:** 1) Verify uncertainty calibration on clean data across different classes, 2) Test sample-based estimation with varying sample sizes to assess variance reduction, 3) Compare RCC and RNCL radii against standard randomized smoothing on a small subset of ImageNet.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but implicit limitations include the scalability of the sample-based approach to larger models and datasets, the generalizability of results across different uncertainty measures, and the performance under different types of adversarial attacks beyond those evaluated.

## Limitations
- Computational overhead of sample-based estimation may limit scalability to larger models or datasets
- Performance depends on the reliability of uncertainty estimates from base classifiers, which may not be well-calibrated for all architectures
- Empirical evaluation is limited to CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with specific attack methods, leaving generalizability to other domains open

## Confidence

- **Theoretical framework validity:** High - The mathematical foundations for RCC and RNCL radii are rigorously derived
- **Empirical performance claims:** Medium - Results are promising but limited to specific datasets and attack types
- **Scalability and computational efficiency:** Medium - Sample-based approach adds overhead that may impact large-scale deployment
- **Generalization across architectures:** Low - Experiments focus on CNNs, leaving performance on other architectures unclear

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate the proposed method across diverse datasets (medical imaging, speech) and architectures (Vision Transformers, MLPs) to assess generalizability beyond CNNs.
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the contribution of different uncertainty measures (e.g., entropy vs. confidence) to identify which provide the most robust improvements.
3. Benchmark computational overhead against standard randomized smoothing, measuring the trade-off between increased robustness and inference time on large-scale models.
