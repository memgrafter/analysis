## Executive Summary
This systematic literature review comprehensively examines the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in forecasting and anomaly detection across diverse domains. The review synthesizes findings from 40 papers published between 2010-2024, highlighting how LLMs can transform traditional approaches through their ability to process sequential data, capture complex patterns, and generate contextual insights. The analysis reveals significant potential while also identifying critical challenges including reliance on extensive historical datasets, generalizability issues, model hallucinations, computational efficiency, and knowledge boundaries. The review provides actionable insights for researchers and practitioners looking to leverage LLMs for these applications.

## Method Summary
The review employed a systematic literature review methodology following PRISMA guidelines, searching databases including Web of Science, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore. The corpus consists of 40 papers published between 2010-2024, focusing on LLM applications in forecasting and anomaly detection. The methodology involved three-stage screening, data extraction using a structured coding form, and synthesis of findings. Studies were categorized based on their approaches (prompt-based, fine-tuning, zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot learning, reprogramming, hybrid methods) and evaluated across multiple datasets including time series (Amazon Review, Darts, ECL, ICEWS, ETT, M3, M4, Monash, TETS) and log data (BGL, HDFS, OpenStack, Spirit, SMD, Thunderbird, Yahoo S5). Performance metrics varied by task, with forecasting studies using MAE, MAPE, sMAPE, MSE, RMSE, and anomaly detection studies using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and AUROC.

## Key Results
- LLMs demonstrate significant potential in forecasting and anomaly detection by converting numerical time series into text-like sequences for pattern recognition
- Critical challenges include reliance on extensive historical datasets, generalizability issues, model hallucinations, computational efficiency, and knowledge boundaries
- Future directions include integrating multimodal data, advancements in learning methodologies, emphasizing model explainability, and addressing sustainability concerns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs can perform time series forecasting and anomaly detection by converting numerical data into text-like sequences that the model can process using its pre-trained language understanding.
- Mechanism: The approach involves encoding time series data as strings of numerical digits, transforming the forecasting problem into a sequence prediction task similar to next-token prediction in NLP. The LLM then uses its pre-trained understanding of patterns and relationships to extrapolate future values or detect anomalies.
- Core assumption: The LLM's pre-trained knowledge of language patterns and structures can be effectively mapped to the temporal patterns and anomalies present in numerical time series data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The review states that LLMs "have demonstrated significant potential in parsing and analyzing extensive datasets to identify patterns, predict future events, and detect anomalous behavior."
  - [section] Gruver et al. (2023) [45] introduce an approach where time series data is encoded as strings of numerical digits, allowing LLMs like GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 to perform forecasting without task-specific prior training.
  - [corpus] The corpus contains papers like "Research and application of Transformer based anomaly detection model: A literature review" which suggests a growing interest in applying transformer-based models to anomaly detection tasks.
- Break condition: The approach may fail if the numerical patterns in time series data do not align well with the linguistic patterns the LLM was trained on, or if the LLM lacks sufficient understanding of the specific domain or context of the data.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: LLMs can leverage their ability to understand context and long-term dependencies to improve the accuracy of forecasting and anomaly detection compared to traditional statistical methods.
- Mechanism: LLMs, with their deep learning architectures and vast parameter spaces, can learn complex patterns and relationships in data that traditional models may miss. They can capture non-linear interactions, seasonality, and external factors that influence time series, leading to more accurate predictions and anomaly identification.
- Core assumption: The LLM's deep learning capabilities and pre-training on large datasets equip it with the ability to learn and generalize complex patterns that are relevant to forecasting and anomaly detection tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The review highlights the "significant potential" of LLMs in "identifying patterns, predict future events, and detect anomalous behavior."
  - [section] Shi et al. (2023) [47] propose LAMP, a framework that incorporates a large language model in event prediction, demonstrating its ability to reason about real-world events and improve prediction accuracy.
  - [corpus] The corpus includes papers like "Large Language Model for Vulnerability Detection and Repair: Literature Review and the Road Ahead" which suggests the potential of LLMs in various domains beyond NLP.
- Break condition: The LLM's performance may be limited by the quality and representativeness of the training data, the complexity of the task, or the presence of noise and missing values in the data.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: LLMs can be fine-tuned or adapted for specific forecasting and anomaly detection tasks, leveraging their pre-trained knowledge and improving their performance on domain-specific data.
- Mechanism: Fine-tuning involves adjusting the parameters of a pre-trained LLM on a smaller, task-specific dataset. This process allows the model to learn the nuances and patterns of the target domain, improving its accuracy and relevance for the specific task.
- Core assumption: The pre-trained knowledge of the LLM serves as a strong foundation that can be adapted to new tasks with relatively small amounts of domain-specific data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The review mentions "potential solutions" including "advancements in learning methodologies" and "emphasizing model explainability and computational efficiency."
  - [section] Jin et al. (2024) [52] demonstrate that large language models' rich semantic understanding and contextual learning abilities can be effectively adapted for time series forecasting through reprogramming.
  - [corpus] The corpus includes papers like "Adaptive Anomaly Detection for Identifying Attacks in Cyber-Physical Systems: A Systematic Literature Review" which suggests the importance of adapting models to specific domains and tasks.
- Break condition: Fine-tuning may be ineffective if the task-specific dataset is too small or unrepresentative, or if the LLM's pre-trained knowledge is not relevant to the target domain.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data Preprocessing -> LLM Model -> Post-processing -> Evaluation
- Critical path: 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing 2. Model Selection and Configuration 3. Training or Fine-tuning 4. Evaluation and Validation 5. Deployment and Monitoring
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model Size vs. Computational Efficiency: Larger models may offer better performance but require more computational resources.
  - Pre-training Data vs. Task-specific Data: More pre-training data can improve the model's general knowledge, while more task-specific data can enhance its performance on the target task.
  - Interpretability vs. Accuracy: Some models may be more interpretable but less accurate, while others may be more accurate but less interpretable.
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor Performance: The model may fail to accurately forecast or detect anomalies, resulting in high error rates or false positives/negatives.
  - Overfitting: The model may perform well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data, indicating that it has memorized the training data rather than learning generalizable patterns.
  - Bias: The model may exhibit bias towards certain groups or patterns in the data, leading to unfair or inaccurate results.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Data Preprocessing Experiment: Test different data preprocessing techniques to see how they affect the model's performance.
  2. Model Configuration Experiment: Experiment with different LLM configurations, such as model size and hyperparameters, to find the optimal setup for the task.
  3. Evaluation Metric Experiment: Compare the performance of different evaluation metrics to determine which one best captures the model's effectiveness for the specific task.
