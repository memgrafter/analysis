# Adaptive Sampling to Reduce Epistemic Uncertainty Using Prediction Interval-Generation Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.10570
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10570
- Reference count: 40
- This paper proposes an adaptive sampling method to reduce epistemic uncertainty in predictive models using prediction intervals generated by neural networks.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of reducing epistemic uncertainty in predictive models through adaptive sampling. The authors introduce ASPINN (Adaptive Sampling with Prediction Interval-Generation Neural Networks), which uses prediction intervals to estimate potential epistemic uncertainty and employs Gaussian processes as surrogate models for efficient batch sampling. The method is evaluated on synthetic 1-D regression problems and a multi-dimensional agricultural field dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches in terms of faster convergence to minimum epistemic uncertainty levels.

## Method Summary
ASPINN combines a dual neural network architecture with adaptive sampling strategies to reduce epistemic uncertainty. The method employs prediction interval-generation networks trained with a DualAQD loss function to produce comprehensive uncertainty estimates. A novel metric based on prediction intervals is used to estimate potential epistemic uncertainty without assuming noise distribution. Gaussian processes serve as surrogate models to simulate the effect of sampling at different locations, enabling batch sampling that maximizes reduction of global epistemic uncertainty across the input domain.

## Key Results
- ASPINN consistently achieves faster convergence to minimum epistemic uncertainty levels compared to Normalizing Flows Ensembles, MC-Dropout, and simple GPs
- Statistically significant improvements in area under the uncertainty curve (AUUC) across all tested scenarios
- Superior performance demonstrated on both synthetic 1-D regression problems and a multi-dimensional agricultural field dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The prediction interval-based metric accurately estimates potential epistemic uncertainty without assuming noise distribution
- Mechanism: ASPINN uses prediction intervals generated by neural networks to quantify uncertainty, calculating a metric based on PI width and nearby data point density
- Core assumption: PI width reflects epistemic uncertainty and nearby data points provide context for uncertainty estimation
- Evidence anchors: The abstract states development of a metric that estimates potential epistemic uncertainty leveraging PI-generation neural networks; section describes reflecting potential levels of epistemic uncertainty rather than estimating noise distribution directly
- Break condition: If PI generation fails or data density is too low, the metric may not accurately reflect epistemic uncertainty

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Batch sampling strategy efficiently reduces epistemic uncertainty by selecting sampling locations that maximize uncertainty reduction
- Mechanism: Uses GP as surrogate model to simulate sampling effects on epistemic uncertainty, with acquisition function selecting batches that maximize global uncertainty reduction
- Core assumption: GP surrogate accurately represents PI generation network behavior and acquisition function effectively identifies uncertainty-reducing locations
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions batch sampling strategy based on GPs; section describes using GP to design acquisition function selecting combinations of sampling locations
- Break condition: If GP surrogate fails to represent the network or acquisition function doesn't identify uncertainty-reducing locations effectively

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: ASPINN outperforms other methods in reducing epistemic uncertainty due to its novel metric and batch sampling strategy
- Mechanism: Consistent faster convergence to minimum epistemic uncertainty levels demonstrated through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
- Core assumption: Experiments accurately reflect real-world scenarios and comparison methods are state-of-the-art
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states method consistently converges faster than MC-Dropout, GP, and NF-Ensemble; section shows evolution of mean PI values across repetitions
- Break condition: If experiments aren't representative or comparison methods aren't state-of-the-art, superiority claim may not hold

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Prediction Intervals (PIs)
  - Why needed here: PIs provide comprehensive uncertainty representation by estimating bounds within which predictions fall with given probability
  - Quick check question: How do PIs differ from confidence intervals in uncertainty quantification context?

- Concept: Gaussian Processes (GPs)
  - Why needed here: GPs serve as surrogate models to simulate sampling effects on epistemic uncertainty
  - Quick check question: What are key GP components and how do they contribute to uncertainty modeling?

- Concept: Adaptive Sampling
  - Why needed here: Select samples intelligently that contribute most to improving model accuracy and reducing uncertainty
  - Quick check question: How does adaptive sampling differ from traditional methods and what are its advantages?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Prediction Interval Generation Network -> Gaussian Process Surrogate Model -> Acquisition Function
- Critical path: Train PI generation network → Calculate potential epistemic uncertainty metric → Update GP surrogate model → Select batch of sampling locations using acquisition function
- Design tradeoffs: Trades computational complexity for accuracy in uncertainty quantification; GP surrogate and metric calculation add overhead but improve estimation and sampling efficiency
- Failure signatures: Inaccurate PIs, poor GP surrogate performance, or suboptimal sampling location selection leading to slow convergence or divergence
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train PI generation network on simple dataset and evaluate generated PI quality
  2. Implement potential epistemic uncertainty metric and test its ability to reflect epistemic uncertainty
  3. Integrate GP surrogate model and acquisition function, test batch sampling strategy on synthetic dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed potential epistemic uncertainty metric perform when dealing with multi-modal aleatoric noise distributions?
- Basis in paper: Explicit statement that method doesn't inherently handle multi-modal aleatoric noise and needs PI-generation capable of producing multiple bounds based on identified modes
- Why unresolved: Current metric relies on single PI per location, which may not adequately capture epistemic uncertainty with multiple noise modes
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing ASPINN performance on problems with known multi-modal noise distributions versus methods designed for such cases

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does computational complexity of ASPINN scale with increasing input dimensionality, and what strategies could mitigate this scaling issue?
- Basis in paper: Inferred from paper mentioning computational cost becomes prohibitive in high-dimensional problems due to need to evaluate all potential locations
- Why unresolved: Paper acknowledges as limitation but doesn't provide quantitative analysis of scaling or specific solutions
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying input dimensionality while measuring computational time and epistemic uncertainty reduction performance

### Open Question 3
- Question: How sensitive is ASPINN's performance to choice of hyperparameters (θ, r, η) and what are optimal ranges for different problem types?
- Basis in paper: Explicit description of using grid search for hyperparameter selection without systematic analysis of sensitivity or guidelines for selection across problem characteristics
- Why unresolved: While specific values chosen through grid search, paper doesn't explore robustness of these choices or provide principles for new applications
- What evidence would resolve it: Sensitivity analysis showing performance variation across hyperparameter ranges, or empirical rules relating problem characteristics to optimal hyperparameter values

## Limitations

- The PI-based metric assumes PI width correlates with epistemic uncertainty, which may not hold for all data distributions or model architectures
- Batch sampling with GP surrogate introduces computational overhead that scales poorly with dimensionality
- Performance comparison relies on synthetic datasets and single agricultural field dataset, limiting generalizability to diverse real-world scenarios

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Core mechanism of using prediction intervals to estimate epistemic uncertainty and batch sampling strategy are well-grounded in established uncertainty quantification principles with rigorous mathematical formulation and statistically significant experimental results.

**Medium Confidence**: Superiority over competing methods demonstrated but experiments limited to specific problem types; claim of consistently faster convergence needs validation on broader range of problems.

**Low Confidence**: Scalability to high-dimensional problems and robustness to different data distributions not thoroughly evaluated; computational complexity trade-offs not fully characterized.

## Next Checks

1. Test ASPINN on high-dimensional regression problems (5+ dimensions) to evaluate scalability and identify dimensionality bottlenecks
2. Validate the method on real-world datasets with known epistemic uncertainty patterns (e.g., medical imaging, autonomous driving) to assess generalizability
3. Conduct ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of PI-based metric versus GP surrogate model to overall performance improvements
