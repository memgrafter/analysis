- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00532
- Authors: Samita Bai; Sidra Nasir; Rizwan Ahmed Khan; Alexandre Meyer; Hubert Konik
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: SHAP is the most frequently used XAI technique in breast cancer diagnosis, with XGBoost often showing superior performance (AUC ~93.7%, c-index ~0.73)

## Executive Summary
This comprehensive review examines 36 studies from 2019-2023 on explainable artificial intelligence techniques for breast cancer diagnosis. The paper analyzes how methods like SHAP, LIME, and Grad-CAM can be integrated with machine learning and deep learning models to improve transparency in detecting breast cancer from various imaging modalities including mammograms, ultrasounds, and genomic data. The research identifies key performance patterns and limitations across different XAI approaches while highlighting the need for standardized evaluation metrics and further research to enhance clinical trust in AI-assisted diagnosis.

## Method Summary
The study conducted a systematic review of literature from 2019-2023, analyzing 36 papers that applied XAI techniques to breast cancer diagnosis. The review examined how various XAI methods (SHAP, LIME, Grad-CAM, CAM, CBR, etc.) were integrated with ML/DL models across different imaging modalities including mammograms, ultrasounds, histopathology images, and genomic data. Performance was evaluated using metrics like AUC, c-index, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with particular attention to model interpretability and clinical applicability.

## Key Results
- SHAP emerged as the most frequently used XAI technique across the reviewed studies
- XGBoost consistently demonstrated strong performance, achieving a c-index of approximately 0.73 for survival analysis
- AUC values reached 93.7% and 91.7% for invasive disease event prediction using XAI-enhanced models
- Grad-CAM effectively generated interpretable heatmaps for CNN-based breast cancer detection models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: SHAP values provide mathematically grounded feature attribution that satisfies three key properties (local accuracy, missingness, consistency), enabling trust in model predictions.
- Mechanism: SHAP uses Shapley values from cooperative game theory to fairly distribute prediction contributions among features. For a given prediction, it computes how much each feature shifts the output from the baseline model prediction.
- Core assumption: Features can be treated as "players" in a cooperative game where the "payout" is the prediction, and all possible feature coalitions can be evaluated.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "SHAP as the most frequently used technique"
  - [section] "SHAP values provide a mathematically rigorous, fair, and consistent method for interpreting machine learning model predictions"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct SHAP-specific papers in neighbors, but related XAI techniques mentioned
- Break condition: If the model has too many features, computational cost becomes prohibitive as all feature subsets must be evaluated.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Grad-CAM generates interpretable heatmaps by leveraging gradients of the target class with respect to feature maps, highlighting regions most influential for classification.
- Mechanism: Grad-CAM computes gradients of the target class score flowing into the final convolutional layer, then performs global average pooling to obtain importance weights for each feature map. These weights are combined with the feature maps and passed through ReLU to highlight positive contributions.
- Core assumption: The deeper convolutional layers capture high-level semantic information that correlates with class-specific features.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "LcGrad−CAM=ReLU(XkαckAk)" and explanation of how gradients indicate feature map importance
  - [abstract] "various XAI approaches, such as SHAP, LIME, Grad-CAM, and others"
  - [corpus] Weak - neighbors mention XAI but not specifically Grad-CAM applications
- Break condition: If the model is not CNN-based, Grad-CAM cannot be directly applied as it requires convolutional feature maps.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: LIME provides local interpretability by approximating complex model behavior with sparse linear models in the vicinity of specific instances.
- Mechanism: LIME generates perturbed samples around a specific instance, obtains predictions from the complex model, assigns weights based on proximity, and fits an interpretable linear model to these weighted samples. This creates a locally accurate explanation for that instance.
- Core assumption: The complex model's decision boundary is approximately linear in the local region around the instance being explained.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "LIME Equation: The explanation is derived as: ξ(x)=argming∈GL(f,g,πx)+Ω(g)"
  - [abstract] "LIME" listed among XAI techniques used in breast cancer diagnosis
  - [corpus] Weak - no specific LIME applications found in neighbor papers
- Break condition: If the model has highly non-linear decision boundaries in the local region, the linear approximation may be poor.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Shapley values and cooperative game theory
  - Why needed here: Understanding the mathematical foundation of SHAP is crucial for correctly interpreting its outputs and limitations
  - Quick check question: Why does SHAP compute all possible feature coalitions rather than using a simpler feature importance method?

- Concept: Convolutional neural networks and gradient flow
  - Why needed here: Grad-CAM relies on understanding how gradients propagate through CNN layers to identify important regions
  - Quick check question: What makes Grad-CAM applicable only to convolutional networks and not to fully connected networks?

- Concept: Local vs global interpretability
  - Why needed here: Different XAI techniques serve different purposes - some explain individual predictions while others explain model behavior overall
  - Quick check question: When would you prefer LIME's local explanations over SHAP's global explanations in a clinical setting?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data → Model training → XAI integration → Explanation generation → Visualization component → Clinical validation interface
- Critical path: Data → Model training → XAI integration → Explanation generation → Clinical validation → Feedback loop
- Design tradeoffs: Model-agnostic methods (SHAP, LIME) offer flexibility but may be computationally expensive; model-specific methods (Grad-CAM) are efficient but limited to certain architectures
- Failure signatures: Explanations that contradict clinical expertise, explanations that highlight irrelevant features, explanations that are computationally infeasible for real-time use
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement SHAP with a pre-trained XGBoost model on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, comparing SHAP values against permutation importance
  2. Add Grad-CAM visualization to a ResNet model trained on mammography images, validating highlighted regions against radiologist annotations
  3. Compare LIME explanations with SHAP explanations on the same dataset to understand differences in local vs global interpretability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What standardized evaluation metrics should be developed to assess the quality of XAI explanations in clinical settings?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper emphasizes the need for standardized metrics to evaluate XAI's effectiveness in clinical settings.
- Why unresolved: While the paper discusses the importance of such metrics, it does not propose specific metrics or frameworks for their development.
- What evidence would resolve it: Research demonstrating validated metrics that measure explanation quality, clinical utility, and impact on diagnostic accuracy.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do different XAI techniques (SHAP, LIME, Grad-CAM) compare in terms of their impact on user trust and comprehension among medical practitioners?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the need to study the impact of XAI on user trust and comprehension.
- Why unresolved: The paper reviews various XAI techniques but does not provide empirical evidence on how these techniques affect practitioner trust and understanding.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled studies comparing medical practitioners' trust and comprehension when using different XAI methods.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the computational limitations of using SHAP values for real-time breast cancer diagnosis, and how can they be addressed?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that SHAP's computational burden can be significant, potentially slowing down analysis.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges this limitation but does not explore potential solutions or quantify the computational impact.
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance benchmarks comparing SHAP computation times with alternative methods, and research on optimization techniques.

## Limitations

- The review is constrained by its reliance on published literature from 2019-2023, potentially missing recent methodological advances
- The heterogeneous nature of included studies makes direct comparison difficult due to varying datasets, evaluation metrics, and implementation details
- Clinical validation of XAI techniques remains limited, with most studies focusing on technical performance rather than real-world clinical impact

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: SHAP being the most frequently used XAI technique (supported by multiple studies and explicit mention)
- **Medium Confidence**: XGBoost showing superior performance (based on reported metrics but with limited sample size)
- **Low Confidence**: Clinical utility and trust enhancement claims (lacking direct clinical trial evidence)

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a head-to-head comparison of SHAP, LIME, and Grad-CAM on the same breast cancer dataset using standardized metrics and evaluation protocols
2. Perform a multi-center validation of the top-performing XAI-enhanced models across different imaging modalities and patient populations
3. Design a clinical study to evaluate whether XAI-enhanced explanations improve radiologist diagnostic accuracy and confidence compared to black-box models
