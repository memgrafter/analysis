# Industrial-Grade Smart Troubleshooting through Causal Technical Language Processing: a Proof of Concept

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.20700
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20700
- Reference count: 40
- 80% average accuracy in root cause classification

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a causal approach to smart troubleshooting in industrial environments using technical language from Return on Experience (RoX) records. The method leverages vectorized linguistic knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) and causal associations from embedded failure modes in industrial assets. The approach combines causal Bayesian Networks with BERTopic embeddings and Llama2 LLM for root cause analysis and solution generation. Experimental results on a Predictive Maintenance setting show an 80% average accuracy in root cause classification and demonstrate the system's ability to provide relevant solutions.

## Method Summary
The system combines causal Bayesian Networks with BERTopic embeddings and Llama2 LLM for industrial troubleshooting. It processes RoX records through BERTopic to create discrete categorical representations, which are then used to train a causal Bayesian Network that models relationships between subsystems, root causes, and solutions. For inference, the system performs root cause analysis using observational probabilities and generates solutions through interventional causal inference. The Llama2 LLM synthesizes actionable troubleshooting guidance by combining predicted root causes with retrieved solution examples from the RoX database.

## Key Results
- 80% average accuracy in root cause classification
- Precision and recall over 70% for root cause prediction
- Demonstrated ability to generate relevant troubleshooting solutions using LLM synthesis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The system achieves 80% average accuracy in root cause classification by combining BERTopic embeddings with a discrete causal Bayesian Network.
- Mechanism: BERTopic converts unstructured RoX text into discrete categorical representations, which the Bayesian Network uses to model causal relationships between subsystems, root causes, and solutions. This structure allows probabilistic inference of root causes given observed problems.
- Core assumption: The discrete representation preserves sufficient information about the causal structure of the problem, and the RoX records contain enough representative examples of failure modes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Experimental results on a Predictive Maintenance setting show an 80% average accuracy in root cause classification"
  - [section 3.2.1] "The discrete causal Bayesian Network is suitable for exploiting the categorized description of an observed problem"
- Break condition: If the RoX dataset lacks sufficient diversity or the embedding fails to capture key causal features, the Bayesian Network will not learn accurate associations, dropping classification accuracy below useful thresholds.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The system generates unbiased solution predictions through interventional causal inference.
- Mechanism: By applying Pearl's do-calculus and intervention rules, the system adjusts for confounding bias when predicting solutions, computing the causal effect of root causes on solutions rather than just observing correlations.
- Core assumption: The causal graph structure (Subsystem → Root Cause → Observation → Solution) correctly represents the true causal relationships, and the assumptions for identifiability hold.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2.2] "To obtain an unbiased result, an (atomic) intervention shall be performed"
  - [section 3.2.2] "the aforementioned confounding bias in the estimation is reduced through the following adjustment formula"
- Break condition: If the causal graph is misspecified or unmeasured confounders exist, the adjustment formula will produce biased estimates, leading to incorrect solution recommendations.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Llama2 LLM synthesis produces actionable troubleshooting guidance by combining predicted root causes with retrieved solution examples.
- Mechanism: The system retrieves textual examples from RoX records matching the predicted solution category, then uses these as context in a carefully engineered prompt to Llama2, which synthesizes coherent, actionable advice.
- Core assumption: The LLM can generalize from the retrieved examples to generate appropriate new guidance, and the prompt engineering sufficiently constrains the output.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2.2] "Once the representation of the most likely Solution category (S) is reliably determined, the associated text needs to be generated"
  - [section 3.2.2] "the LLM can now synthesize the following enhanced advisory"
- Break condition: If the retrieved examples are too dissimilar from the current problem or the LLM hallucinates, the generated advice may be irrelevant or incorrect, reducing system trustworthiness.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Causal Bayesian Networks
  - Why needed here: They provide the probabilistic framework for modeling causal relationships between failure modes, root causes, and solutions in the industrial troubleshooting domain.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between a Bayesian Network and a Causal Bayesian Network?

- Concept: Intervention and Do-Calculus
  - Why needed here: Standard conditional probabilities capture correlations, but interventions allow unbiased estimation of causal effects needed for accurate solution prediction.
  - Quick check question: Why can't we just use P(Solution|Root Cause) to predict solutions without interventions?

- Concept: Text Embeddings and Clustering
  - Why needed here: Converting unstructured RoX text into numerical representations that preserve semantic relationships is essential for both the Bayesian Network and the LLM retrieval.
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of reducing dimensionality before clustering in BERTopic?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw RoX records → BERTopic embedding → Bayesian Network RCA → Intervention formula → Solution category → Llama2 generation → Output guidance
- Critical path: Observation text → BERTopic embedding → Bayesian Network RCA → Intervention formula → Solution category → Llama2 generation → Output guidance
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Discrete vs continuous representations: Discrete simplifies the Bayesian Network but loses some information
  - Manual vs automated causal structure: Expert knowledge speeds development but may miss data-driven patterns
  - Retrieval vs generation: Retrieval ensures factual grounding but limits coverage; generation is more flexible but riskier
- Failure signatures:
  - Low RCA accuracy: Poor embedding quality or insufficient training data
  - Biased solution predictions: Incorrect causal graph structure or unmeasured confounders
  - Hallucinated LLM output: Insufficient or irrelevant retrieved examples, poorly engineered prompts
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate embedding quality by checking if similar RoX records cluster together in the categorical space
  2. Test causal model identifiability by attempting to recover known causal effects from synthetic data
  3. Evaluate LLM generation quality by comparing generated solutions against human-written ones for a held-out test set

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we objectively evaluate the quality of solutions generated by Large Language Models in industrial troubleshooting applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges that "the way to quantitatively (i.e., objectively) evaluate the LLM-generated outcomes is still an open research question driven by correlational (i.e., not necessarily causal) scores"
- Why unresolved: Current evaluation methods for LLM outputs in technical domains rely on subjective assessments rather than objective metrics. The challenge lies in developing evaluation frameworks that capture both technical accuracy and practical utility.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of evaluation metrics that correlate with expert assessments, including quantitative measures of solution correctness, completeness, and actionability in real-world industrial scenarios.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we effectively handle the curse of dimensionality when using vector databases for natural language processing in causal Bayesian networks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses potential improvements using vector databases to improve granularity of linguistic representation, noting that "it remains to be seen how the curse of dimensionality will affect the technical setting"
- Why unresolved: High-dimensional vector representations can lead to computational inefficiencies and degraded performance in similarity searches, particularly when dealing with large industrial datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing different dimensionality reduction techniques and their impact on retrieval accuracy and computational efficiency in industrial troubleshooting applications.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the most effective methods for integrating counterfactual analysis into predictive maintenance systems for algorithmic recourse?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper proposes exploring counterfactual worlds through interventions to "help in the recognition and understanding of the general root causes that lead to the system failure"
- Why unresolved: While the theoretical framework for counterfactual analysis is established, practical implementation in industrial settings faces challenges in balancing computational complexity with actionable insights.
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies demonstrating improved troubleshooting outcomes using counterfactual analysis compared to traditional methods, including measurable improvements in failure prediction and solution generation.

## Limitations
- The reported 80% accuracy is based on a specific industrial dataset without clear details about its diversity, representativeness, or potential biases, limiting generalizability claims
- The paper lacks detailed ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each component (BERTopic, causal Bayesian Network, LLM synthesis) to the final performance
- No explicit discussion of computational costs or latency requirements for industrial deployment scenarios

## Confidence
- Root Cause Classification Accuracy (80%): Medium - Single reported metric without confidence intervals or cross-validation details
- Causal Inference Validity: Medium - Theoretical framework appears sound but limited empirical validation of causal assumptions
- Solution Generation Quality: Low - No systematic evaluation of generated solutions beyond accuracy of category prediction

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-domain validation by testing the system on RoX records from different industrial sectors to assess generalizability beyond the initial dataset
2. Perform ablation studies to quantify the individual contribution of BERTopic embeddings, causal Bayesian Network structure, and LLM synthesis to overall system performance
3. Implement human evaluation studies where domain experts assess the relevance and actionability of generated solutions compared to standard troubleshooting practices
