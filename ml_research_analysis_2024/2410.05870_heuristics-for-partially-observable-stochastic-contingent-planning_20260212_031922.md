# Heuristics for Partially Observable Stochastic Contingent Planning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.05870
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05870
- Reference count: 6
- Key result: Belief-based delete relaxation heuristic achieves order of magnitude improvement over standard heuristics in information-gathering POMDPs

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces new heuristics for solving goal-based POMDPs using the RTDP-BEL algorithm, specifically targeting problems requiring substantial information gathering. The key innovation is a belief-based delete relaxation heuristic that computes plans in relaxed belief space while accounting for the value of information from sensing actions. Unlike traditional heuristics that aggregate state-based values, this method maintains achieved facts for each possible state and enables actions only when preconditions hold across all valid states.

The empirical evaluation demonstrates that while the belief-based hff heuristic is computationally slower than MDP-based methods like QMDP, it requires significantly fewer RTDP iterations to converge. In domains requiring substantial information gathering such as maze and wumpus problems, the method achieves an order of magnitude improvement over standard heuristics, particularly excelling in complex domains with large action spaces and when long sequences of sensing actions are needed.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a belief-based delete relaxation heuristic that operates in relaxed belief space rather than traditional state-based heuristics. The approach maintains achieved facts for each possible state within the belief, enabling actions only when preconditions hold across all valid states. This allows the heuristic to capture the value of information-gathering sensing actions that traditional methods often undervalue. The heuristic is integrated with the RTDP-BEL algorithm, providing a more informed search direction for planning in partially observable environments. The method is specifically designed for goal-based POMDPs where information gathering is crucial before optimal actions can be determined.

## Key Results
- Belief-based hff heuristic achieves order of magnitude fewer RTDP iterations compared to standard heuristics in maze and wumpus domains
- The heuristic excels in domains requiring substantial information gathering through sensing actions
- While computationally slower to calculate than QMDP, the reduced iteration count leads to overall efficiency gains
- Particularly effective in complex domains with large action spaces where traditional heuristics undervalue sensing actions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The belief-based delete relaxation heuristic works by maintaining achieved facts for each possible state within the belief, rather than aggregating values across states. This allows the heuristic to capture the value of information-gathering sensing actions that traditional state-based heuristics often undervalue. By operating in relaxed belief space and only enabling actions when preconditions hold across all valid states, the method can properly evaluate the necessity of information gathering before acting. This is particularly valuable in POMDPs where optimal action selection depends on gathering sufficient information through sensing actions before taking decisive actions.

## Foundational Learning

**POMDP Fundamentals**
- Why needed: Understanding the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process framework is essential for grasping the problem being solved
- Quick check: Can identify states, observations, actions, and transition/observation probabilities in a POMDP

**Delete Relaxation Heuristics**
- Why needed: The core innovation builds on classical delete relaxation techniques from classical planning
- Quick check: Understand how delete relaxation simplifies planning by assuming facts once achieved remain true

**RTDP-BEL Algorithm**
- Why needed: The heuristic is designed to work specifically with this RTDP variant for belief space planning
- Quick check: Can explain how RTDP-BEL performs value iteration in belief space for POMDPs

**Belief Space vs State Space Planning**
- Why needed: The key distinction between this approach and traditional heuristics
- Quick check: Can articulate why planning in belief space is necessary for POMDPs versus state space for MDPs

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Belief State -> Delete Relaxation Computation -> Heuristic Value -> RTDP-BEL Search

**Critical Path**
Belief state evaluation → Delete relaxation computation → Heuristic value calculation → RTDP-BEL action selection → Environment interaction → New belief state

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Accuracy vs computation time: Belief-based heuristic is more accurate but slower than QMDP
- Information gathering vs action: Better evaluation of sensing actions' value vs traditional methods
- State aggregation vs state maintenance: Maintains facts per state rather than aggregating values

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor performance in domains where information gathering is not crucial
- Computational overhead may outweigh benefits in simple domains
- May struggle with highly stochastic domains beyond deterministic goal-based POMDPs

**First Experiments**
1. Test on simple maze domain to verify basic functionality
2. Compare iteration counts vs QMDP on wumpus domain
3. Evaluate performance on a domain requiring multiple sensing steps before action

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Empirical validation limited to deterministic goal-based POMDPs, leaving stochastic domain performance unclear
- Computational overhead of belief-based hff is acknowledged but not fully characterized across problem scales
- Claims about "order of magnitude improvement" based on specific domains may not generalize to all POMDP structures

## Confidence

**Theoretical Formulation**
- High confidence in the relationship to existing belief-based heuristics and theoretical soundness

**Empirical Performance Claims**
- Medium confidence due to limited domain coverage (only maze and wumpus tested)
- Need broader validation across different POMDP types

**Computational Complexity Characterization**
- Medium confidence - while slower than QMDP is acknowledged, the exact trade-offs across scales are underspecified

## Next Checks

1. Test the belief-based hff heuristic on stochastic goal-based POMDPs to verify if performance gains extend beyond deterministic domains

2. Benchmark computational overhead systematically across problem sizes to better characterize the speed-accuracy tradeoff

3. Evaluate performance on non-goal-based POMDPs (e.g., reward maximization problems) to assess general applicability
