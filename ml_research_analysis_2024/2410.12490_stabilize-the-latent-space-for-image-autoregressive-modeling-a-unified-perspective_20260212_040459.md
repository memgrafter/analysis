# Stabilize the Latent Space for Image Autoregressive Modeling: A Unified Perspective

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.12490
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12490
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: DiGIT achieves state-of-the-art performance in both image understanding and generation tasks, becoming the first GPT-style autoregressive model for images to outperform LDMs

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the performance gap between autoregressive image generative models and iterative models like LDMs and MIMs by focusing on latent space stability. The authors propose a unified perspective that emphasizes the importance of stable latent representations in image generative modeling. They introduce DiGIT (Discrete Image Tokenizer), which applies K-Means clustering on latent features from self-supervised learning models to create discrete tokens for image autoregressive modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that DiGIT achieves state-of-the-art performance in both image understanding and generation tasks, with scaling improvements observed as model size increases. Notably, DiGIT becomes the first GPT-style autoregressive model for images to outperform LDMs, highlighting the potential of optimized latent spaces and discrete tokenization in advancing image generative modeling capabilities.

## Method Summary
The proposed method leverages self-supervised learning models to extract stable latent representations of images, which are then discretized using K-Means clustering to create a discrete image tokenizer (DiGIT). This approach stabilizes the latent space by transforming continuous latent features into discrete tokens that can be effectively modeled using autoregressive architectures. The K-Means clustering is applied to the latent features extracted from self-supervised models, creating a codebook that maps image regions to discrete tokens. During training, the autoregressive model learns to predict sequences of these discrete tokens, enabling stable image generation and understanding. The method unifies image understanding and generation tasks within a single framework, demonstrating that a well-optimized latent space combined with discrete tokenization can significantly improve the performance of autoregressive image models compared to traditional approaches.

## Key Results
- DiGIT achieves state-of-the-art performance in both image understanding and generation tasks
- DiGIT becomes the first GPT-style autoregressive model for images to outperform LDMs
- Further performance improvements are observed when scaling up the model size
- The approach demonstrates the effectiveness of using self-supervised features and discrete tokenization for stabilizing latent spaces

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of DiGIT stems from its ability to create stable, discrete representations of image latent spaces using self-supervised features. Traditional autoregressive models for images often struggle with the continuous nature of latent representations, leading to unstable training and suboptimal generation quality. By leveraging self-supervised learning models, DiGIT extracts meaningful latent features that capture semantic information from images. The subsequent K-Means clustering transforms these continuous features into discrete tokens, creating a stable codebook that can be effectively modeled using autoregressive architectures. This discretization process reduces the complexity of the modeling task while preserving essential image information. The stability of the latent space enables more robust training of autoregressive models, leading to improved generation quality and better performance on understanding tasks. The unified framework demonstrates that optimizing the latent space through self-supervised features and discrete tokenization is a key factor in advancing the capabilities of image autoregressive models.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Image -> Self-supervised encoder -> Latent features -> K-Means clustering -> Codebook -> Discrete tokens -> Autoregressive model -> Generated tokens -> Image decoder

Critical path: The most critical components are the self-supervised encoder for extracting meaningful latent features and the K-Means clustering for creating stable discrete representations. The quality of the latent features directly impacts the effectiveness of the clustering and subsequent autoregressive modeling. The autoregressive model must effectively learn the sequential dependencies between discrete tokens to enable high-quality generation.

Design tradeoffs: The main tradeoff involves balancing the granularity of discrete tokens (affecting reconstruction quality) against the complexity of the autoregressive modeling task. More fine-grained discretization may improve reconstruction but increase modeling difficulty, while coarser discretization simplifies the task but may lose important details. The choice of self-supervised backbone also presents tradeoffs between feature quality, computational efficiency, and compatibility with the autoregressive architecture.

Failure signatures: Common failure modes include poor clustering quality leading to ambiguous token assignments, insufficient semantic information in latent features causing loss of image content during reconstruction, and autoregressive model collapse due to unstable token sequences. Visual inspection of generated samples often reveals artifacts such as blurring, missing details, or inconsistent structures when the latent space is not properly stabilized.

First experiments: 1) Evaluate clustering quality on a held-out validation set by measuring reconstruction accuracy and token diversity metrics. 2) Test autoregressive model performance on pixel-level prediction tasks to assess its ability to learn sequential dependencies. 3) Compare generation quality with and without discrete tokenization to isolate the contribution of the proposed latent space stabilization approach.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Scalability analysis lacks thorough characterization of computational overhead and efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs across different model sizes
- K-Means clustering approach may exhibit brittleness when applied to domains outside ImageNet-1K or with different self-supervised backbones
- The claim of being "the first GPT-style autoregressive model for images to outperform LDMs" may not generalize across all LDM implementations and requires further validation

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The core methodology of using self-supervised features for stable latent representations is well-founded and the experimental design is rigorous
- Medium Confidence: The claim that DiGIT is "the first GPT-style autoregressive model for images to outperform LDMs" is based on specific model comparisons and may not generalize across all LDM implementations
- Medium Confidence: The assertion that an "optimized latent space" is the key differentiator requires further ablation studies to isolate the contribution of discrete tokenization versus other architectural choices

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic scaling studies across multiple model sizes and compute budgets to establish the efficiency-accuracy tradeoff curve for DiGIT versus competing approaches

2. Perform ablation studies comparing DiGIT's performance using different self-supervised backbones (e.g., MAE, BEiT) and tokenization strategies to isolate the contribution of the proposed latent space stabilization

3. Evaluate DiGIT's generalization across diverse image domains (medical imaging, satellite imagery, scientific visualization) to assess the robustness of the K-Means clustering approach beyond natural images
