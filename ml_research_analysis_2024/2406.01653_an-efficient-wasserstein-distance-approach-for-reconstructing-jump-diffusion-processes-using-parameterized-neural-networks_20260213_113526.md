- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01653

- Key outcome: Temporally decoupled squared Wasserstein distance method reconstructs multidimensional jump-diffusion processes with both upper and lower error bounds, outperforming benchmark methods

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach for reconstructing jump-diffusion processes using parameterized neural networks and a temporally decoupled squared Wasserstein distance (W2) as the loss function. The method provides both upper and lower error bounds for the drift, diffusion, and jump functions by comparing two jump-diffusion processes through their Wasserstein distance. The temporally decoupled formulation makes the loss function computationally efficient by allowing evaluation using finite-sample observations at discrete time points. Numerical experiments demonstrate superior performance compared to other benchmark methods in reconstructing one- and two-dimensional jump-diffusion processes.

## Method Summary
The method reconstructs jump-diffusion processes by parameterizing the drift, diffusion, and jump functions using separate feed-forward neural networks. The loss function is a temporally decoupled squared Wasserstein distance, computed as a sum of Wasserstein distances at discrete time points between empirical distributions of finite samples. This approach provides both upper and lower error bounds on the discrepancies between the ground truth and reconstructed processes. The neural networks are trained using AdamW optimizer to minimize this loss, with trajectory generation performed via Euler-Maruyama scheme. The method demonstrates effectiveness across various forms of drift, diffusion, and jump functions.

## Key Results
- The temporally decoupled squared W2-distance provides both upper and lower error bounds for drift, diffusion, and jump functions
- Incorporating prior information on drift function significantly improves accuracy of reconstructed diffusion and jump functions, even with limited trajectories
- The method outperforms benchmark methods (MSE, MMD, mean2+var, W1 distance, squared W2 distance) in reconstruction accuracy
- Optimal neural network architecture identified as 3 hidden layers with ~400 neurons for 2D processes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The temporally decoupled squared W2-distance provides a computationally tractable loss function that can be efficiently evaluated using finite-sample empirical distributions. By decomposing the squared W2-distance into time-discretized components, the integral over time becomes a sum of Wasserstein distances at discrete time points. Each Wasserstein distance can be approximated using empirical distributions of finite samples, making the loss function scalable and differentiable.

### Mechanism 2
The temporally decoupled squared W2-distance provides both upper and lower error bounds for the drift, diffusion, and jump functions. The temporally decoupled formulation allows for a lower bound that depends on the integrated squared error of the drift function and the trace of the difference between covariance matrices of the diffusion and jump processes. The upper bound comes from the classic W2-distance via the triangle inequality, ensuring the loss function is both necessary and sufficient for accurate reconstruction.

### Mechanism 3
Incorporating prior information on the drift function significantly improves the accuracy of reconstructed diffusion and jump functions, even with limited training trajectories. Prior knowledge on the drift function reduces the complexity of the optimization landscape by constraining the drift component, allowing the neural networks to focus on learning the diffusion and jump functions with higher precision.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Wasserstein distance as a metric for probability distributions**
  - Why needed here: The Wasserstein distance provides a natural metric for comparing the distributions of trajectories generated by the ground truth and reconstructed jump-diffusion processes, capturing both the spatial and temporal structure.
  - Quick check question: How does the Wasserstein distance differ from the KL-divergence in measuring discrepancies between probability distributions?

- **Concept: Jump-diffusion processes and their properties**
  - Why needed here: Understanding the structure of jump-diffusion processes, including the drift, diffusion, and jump components, is essential for formulating the reconstruction problem and analyzing the error bounds.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the compensated Poisson process in defining a jump-diffusion process, and how does it differ from a standard Poisson process?

- **Concept: Parameterized neural networks for function approximation**
  - Why needed here: Parameterized neural networks are used to represent the drift, diffusion, and jump functions in the reconstructed jump-diffusion process, requiring knowledge of their expressive power and training dynamics.
  - Quick check question: How does the choice of neural network architecture (e.g., number of layers, activation functions) affect the accuracy of function approximation in this context?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Trajectory generation -> Empirical distribution creation -> Temporally decoupled W2-distance calculation -> Neural network parameter updates via AdamW optimization

- **Critical path:**
  1. Generate training trajectories from the ground truth jump-diffusion process
  2. Discretize the trajectories into time points and create empirical distributions
  3. Initialize the neural networks for drift, diffusion, and jump functions
  4. Compute the temporally decoupled squared W2-distance loss using the empirical distributions
  5. Perform gradient descent to update the neural network parameters
  6. Evaluate the reconstruction errors and iterate until convergence

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Time discretization: Finer discretization improves accuracy but increases computational cost
  - Neural network architecture: Deeper or wider networks may improve accuracy but require more memory and training time
  - Prior information: Incorporating prior knowledge on the drift function improves accuracy but requires accurate measurement or estimation of the drift

- **Failure signatures:**
  - High reconstruction errors despite low loss values: Indicates potential issues with the neural network capacity or optimization process
  - Instability or divergence during training: Suggests problems with the learning rate, gradient clipping, or numerical precision
  - Poor generalization to unseen data: Implies overfitting or insufficient training data

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reconstruct a simple 1D jump-diffusion process with known drift, diffusion, and jump functions to validate the method's accuracy and convergence
  2. Vary the time discretization and neural network architecture to study their impact on reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency
  3. Incorporate prior information on the drift function and compare the reconstruction accuracy with and without prior knowledge

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How does the proposed method perform on higher-dimensional jump-diffusion processes (beyond 2D) with complex noise correlation structures? The mathematical framework is developed but numerical experiments are limited to low dimensions.

- **Open Question 2:** What is the theoretical relationship between the temporally decoupled squared W2 distance and the errors in both the diffusion and jump functions simultaneously? The current bounds are either upper bounds or lower bounds that don't fully capture both errors.

- **Open Question 3:** How does the performance compare to other loss functions when reconstructing jump-diffusion processes with non-constant jump intensity or Lévy processes with infinite activity? The current analysis assumes finite jump intensity and constant jump measures.

- **Open Question 4:** What is the optimal neural network architecture (depth and width) for reconstructing jump-diffusion processes across different dimensions and noise structures? The paper only provides limited exploration for one specific 2D case.

## Limitations

- The method's effectiveness depends critically on the orthogonality condition of the compensated Poisson process and the convergence properties of the finite-time-point approximation
- The Lipschitz continuity assumptions for the drift, diffusion, and jump functions are essential for the derived error bounds, but these may not hold in practical scenarios
- Computational cost scales with the number of time discretization points, potentially limiting application to processes with fine temporal resolution

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The computational efficiency of the temporally decoupled squared W2-distance loss function and its suitability for training parameterized neural networks
- **Medium Confidence:** The error bounds provided by the method, given their dependence on specific regularity conditions
- **Medium Confidence:** The improvement in reconstruction accuracy when incorporating prior information on the drift function

## Next Checks

1. **Robustness to Non-Lipschitz Functions:** Test the method on jump-diffusion processes where the drift, diffusion, or jump functions have non-Lipschitz behavior to assess the validity of the error bounds in practical scenarios.

2. **Scalability Analysis:** Evaluate the computational cost and reconstruction accuracy as the time discretization becomes finer and the dimensionality increases, identifying the practical limits of the method.

3. **Prior Information Sensitivity:** Systematically vary the accuracy and type of prior information on the drift function to determine how sensitive the method is to incorrect or incomplete prior knowledge, and quantify the trade-off between prior accuracy and reconstruction performance.
