# Belief in the Machine: Investigating Epistemological Blind Spots of Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.21195
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21195
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: LLMs show significant limitations in differentiating between belief, knowledge, and fact, with accuracy dropping from 86% on factual scenarios to 54.4% on false belief tasks.

## Executive Summary
This study systematically evaluates the epistemic reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art language models across 13,000 questions in 13 tasks. While models achieve high accuracy on factual scenarios (86%), their performance drops sharply with false statements (54.4% in first-person belief tasks). Notably, models struggle to affirm personal false beliefs, especially when these contradict training data, posing risks in healthcare and counseling contexts. The findings reveal critical blind spots in LLMs' understanding of belief vs knowledge and their ability to handle first-person vs third-person epistemic states.

## Method Summary
The study introduces the KaBLE dataset containing 13,000 questions across 13 tasks covering both factual and false statements. Models are evaluated using zero-shot prompting with a standardized format requiring "(A) Yes", "(B) No", or "(C) Undeterminable" responses. The evaluation uses exact match and soft-match methodologies with the string2string library. Models tested include GPT-4, Claude-3, and Llama-3 across various sizes and configurations.

## Key Results
- Models achieve 86% accuracy on factual scenarios but drop to 54.4% on false first-person belief tasks
- Significant performance gap between third-person beliefs (80.7% accuracy) and first-person beliefs (54.4% accuracy)
- Models struggle with recursive knowledge tasks, with accuracy dropping from 86.7% in confirmation to 77.5% in awareness tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: LLMs exhibit lower accuracy on false epistemic scenarios than factual ones due to reliance on training data consistency.
- **Mechanism**: When models encounter false beliefs or facts, they struggle to reconcile these with their learned representations of truth. Instead of affirming the belief as stated, they often default to fact-checking mode, rejecting or hedging on the false content.
- **Core assumption**: LLMs encode factual correctness as a stronger signal than belief attribution during training.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "while LMs achieve 86% accuracy on factual scenarios, their performance drops significantly with false scenarios, particularly in belief-related tasks"
  - [section]: "models are biased toward rejecting false beliefs, possibly due to their instruction-following data emphasizing factual accuracy over belief acknowledgment"
  - [corpus]: Found 25 related papers - weak direct evidence on false belief handling
- **Break condition**: If models were trained with balanced exposure to false beliefs or given explicit belief-contextualization prompts, this accuracy gap would narrow.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: First-person beliefs are harder for LLMs to affirm than third-person beliefs due to perceived epistemic authority.
- **Mechanism**: When a belief is attributed to the model itself ("I believe"), it triggers self-consistency checks. The model questions whether it "really" holds this belief, especially if the belief contradicts known facts. Third-person beliefs bypass this internal scrutiny.
- **Core assumption**: LLMs treat first-person statements as requiring self-verification, while third-person statements are processed as external reports.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "models perform better on third-person tasks (80.7%) compared to first-person tasks (54.4%)"
  - [section]: "when the same belief is attributed to a third party... models were more willing to accept the belief as true for the person in question"
  - [corpus]: Limited corpus evidence on first vs third-person belief handling
- **Break condition**: If models were trained with more first-person belief examples or prompted to separate belief from fact-checking, the asymmetry would reduce.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: LLMs lack a robust understanding of the factive nature of knowledge, leading to inconsistent handling of false knowledge claims.
- **Mechanism**: Knowledge is traditionally factive—if someone claims to "know" something, that statement must be true. LLMs often fail to enforce this constraint, sometimes accepting false knowledge claims or rejecting true ones, indicating incomplete grasp of this logical relationship.
- **Core assumption**: LLMs have not fully internalized the logical entailment between knowledge and truth during training.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "LMs lack a robust understanding of the factive nature of knowledge, namely, that knowledge inherently requires truth"
  - [section]: "models rarely recognized the inherent tension in false knowledge claims and seldom chose 'undeterminable'"
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence on factive knowledge understanding
- **Break condition**: If models were explicitly trained on the logical relationship between knowledge and truth, or given formal reasoning constraints, they would handle false knowledge claims more consistently.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Distinction between belief and knowledge
  - Why needed here: Models must differentiate between what someone believes (regardless of truth) and what they know (which must be true). This distinction is fundamental to epistemic reasoning tasks.
  - Quick check question: If someone says "I know Paris is the capital of France," should the model accept this as true? What if they say "I know Paris is the capital of Germany"?

- **Concept**: First-person vs third-person perspective in belief attribution
  - Why needed here: Models process beliefs differently depending on whether they're attributed to the speaker or another person. Understanding this distinction is crucial for handling personal beliefs vs reports about others.
  - Quick check question: If a model is told "I believe X" vs "James believes X," how should it respond differently when confirming the belief?

- **Concept**: Recursive knowledge reasoning
  - Why needed here: Some tasks require understanding nested knowledge claims (e.g., "James knows that Mary knows that p"). Models must track multiple layers of epistemic states.
  - Quick check question: If James knows that Mary knows p, and p is true, does James know p? How should a model reason through this?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input parser -> Belief vs knowledge classifier -> Perspective handler -> Recursive reasoner -> Output formatter
- **Critical path**: Input → Parse epistemic type → Classify belief/knowledge → Handle perspective → Apply recursive reasoning (if needed) → Generate answer
- **Design tradeoffs**: 
  - Simplicity vs accuracy: Adding more nuanced epistemic handling improves accuracy but increases complexity
  - Fact-checking vs belief acknowledgment: Models must balance factual correctness with proper belief attribution
  - Context sensitivity vs prompt independence: More context-aware models perform better but require more sophisticated prompting
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Consistently lower accuracy on false scenarios indicates fact-belief confusion
  - Large gap between first-person and third-person performance suggests perspective handling issues
  - Inconsistent handling of knowledge vs belief statements indicates missing logical constraints
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Test model with balanced factual/false statements to measure fact-belief confusion
  2. Compare first-person vs third-person belief confirmation accuracy to identify perspective bias
  3. Evaluate recursive knowledge reasoning with nested statements to assess logical consistency

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What mechanisms underlie LMs' systematic difficulty in affirming false first-person beliefs, particularly when these beliefs contradict training data?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - The paper highlights that LMs struggle with recognizing and affirming personal beliefs, especially when those beliefs contradict factual data, achieving only 54.4% accuracy on false first-person belief tasks compared to 92.1% on factual beliefs.
- Why unresolved: The study identifies the phenomenon but doesn't investigate the underlying cognitive or architectural mechanisms causing this specific difficulty.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments comparing model behavior when beliefs are attributed to first-person vs third-person subjects, with varying degrees of contradiction to training data, and analysis of attention patterns or activation states during these tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do LMs process recursive epistemic reasoning tasks (e.g., "James knows that Mary knows that p") and what architectural limitations prevent robust performance?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - The paper notes that models demonstrate substantial difficulties with recursive knowledge tasks, with accuracy dropping significantly from 86.7% in confirmation to 78.4% in verification and 77.5% in awareness tasks.
- Why unresolved: The study identifies the performance gap but doesn't explore whether this stems from architectural constraints, training data limitations, or fundamental reasoning deficits.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis of model internal representations during recursive reasoning tasks, comparison of performance across different model architectures (e.g., dense vs mixture-of-experts), and controlled experiments varying the depth of epistemic nesting.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the relationship between model size, architectural design, and performance on epistemic reasoning tasks, given that larger models don't always outperform smaller ones?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - The paper notes that model performance does not necessarily correlate with model size in all tasks, with smaller models like Claude-3 Haiku and GPT-3.5 sometimes outperforming larger counterparts.
- Why unresolved: The study observes this pattern but doesn't investigate whether it's due to architectural differences, training methodologies, data quality, or other factors.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic comparison of models with similar architectures but different sizes, analysis of training data composition across model families, and controlled experiments testing specific architectural components' impact on epistemic reasoning.

## Limitations
- Study focuses on English language tasks and specific model families (GPT-4, Claude-3, Llama-3)
- Zero-shot prompting methodology may not generalize to all prompting strategies
- Evaluation metrics may not capture all nuances of epistemic reasoning
- Dataset generation process may introduce biases based on seed sentence selection

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The overall finding that LLMs struggle with false epistemic scenarios, particularly first-person beliefs, is well-supported by systematic evaluation across 13,000 questions. The 86% vs 54.4% accuracy gap is substantial and consistent.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim about models' bias toward third-person beliefs is supported but may be influenced by specific task design and prompt wording. The 80.7% vs 54.4% performance difference is notable but could vary with different experimental setups.
- **Low Confidence**: The assertion that models lack a robust understanding of knowledge's factive nature is based on observed inconsistencies but lacks direct evidence of the underlying mechanisms.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-linguistic validation**: Test the KaBLE dataset and methodology with multilingual models to determine if the epistemic blind spots are language-specific or universal across languages.
2. **Prompt engineering impact**: Systematically vary prompt templates, temperature settings, and few-shot examples to assess how different prompting strategies affect model performance on false epistemic scenarios.
3. **Fine-tuning intervention**: Fine-tune selected models on a balanced dataset of true and false beliefs, including explicit instruction on belief attribution vs. fact-checking, to measure the potential for reducing epistemic blind spots through targeted training.
