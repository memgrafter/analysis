# Smart Information Exchange for Unsupervised Federated Learning via Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.09629
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09629
- Reference count: 19
- This paper addresses unsupervised federated learning with non-i.i.d. local datasets by using RL to discover optimal D2D communication graphs for data transfer, improving convergence speed and robustness to stragglers.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a reinforcement learning method to discover optimal device-to-device (D2D) communication graphs in unsupervised federated learning settings. The approach uses PCA and K-means++ to characterize dataset dissimilarity between devices, then employs RL to select communication links that balance data diversity and transmission costs. After D2D exchanges, autoencoders are used for unsupervised learning. The method is evaluated on FashionMNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, showing improvements over baselines in convergence speed, downstream classification accuracy, and straggler resilience across multiple FL schemes.

## Method Summary
The method operates in an unsupervised federated learning setting with non-i.i.d. local datasets. It uses PCA for dimensionality reduction and K-means++ clustering to characterize dataset dissimilarity between devices. A reinforcement learning agent (Q-learning) per device selects communication links based on a reward function balancing data dissimilarity and communication cost. After D2D exchanges, devices train autoencoders to reconstruct data and learn latent representations. The federated learning proceeds with local updates and global aggregation, evaluated on reconstruction loss and downstream classification accuracy.

## Key Results
- The RL-based D2D graph discovery improves convergence speed compared to baseline FL without D2D exchange
- The method shows improved downstream classification accuracy through better latent representations learned by autoencoders
- The approach provides robustness against stragglers, maintaining performance when some devices do not participate in aggregation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The RL-based D2D graph discovery improves convergence speed by selectively exchanging data between devices with dissimilar data distributions. The RL agent learns to select edges between devices based on a reward function that balances data dissimilarity (measured via PCA + K-means++ centroids) and communication cost (probability of failed transmission). By exchanging data with dissimilar devices, the global model learns a more generalized representation, accelerating convergence.

### Mechanism 2
The global reward formulation incorporating both local rewards and network performance leads to improved robustness against stragglers. Each device calculates a local reward based on data dissimilarity and transmission cost. These local rewards are shared across devices to compute a global reward that also considers network performance. This encourages the formation of links that benefit the overall network, making the system more resilient when some devices do not participate in aggregation.

### Mechanism 3
Using autoencoders for unsupervised learning after D2D exchanges improves downstream classification accuracy by learning better latent representations. After data exchange, devices train autoencoders to reconstruct the input data. The encoder part of the autoencoder learns latent representations that separate different classes better. Linear evaluation on these embeddings shows improved classification accuracy, indicating that the exchanged data helped the model learn more discriminative features.

## Foundational Learning

- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** - Specifically Q-learning with experience replay
  - Why needed here: To learn an optimal policy for forming D2D communication links without labeled data, by maximizing a reward based on data dissimilarity and communication cost
  - Quick check question: How does the agent balance exploration (trying new links) and exploitation (using known good links) in this setup?

- **Federated Learning (FL)** - Decentralized training with periodic aggregation
  - Why needed here: The framework operates in a federated setting where devices collaborate to train a global model without sharing raw data, preserving privacy
  - Quick check question: What happens to the global model when a significant number of devices (stragglers) do not participate in aggregation?

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means++ clustering**
  - Why needed here: To reduce dimensionality of high-dimensional data and characterize dataset dissimilarity between devices for the reward function
  - Quick check question: Why is PCA used before K-means++ in this context, and what problem does it solve?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: RL Agent (per device) -> Communication Layer (RSS measurement) -> Data Processing (PCA, K-means++) -> Federated Learning Engine (local updates, global aggregation)

- **Critical path**:
  1. Devices measure RSS to neighbors
  2. RL agents select communication links based on policy
  3. Data exchange occurs over selected links (subject to trust matrix)
  4. Autoencoders are trained on exchanged data
  5. Federated learning proceeds with local updates and global aggregation

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Communication cost vs. data diversity: Higher dissimilarity may require more expensive links
  - Exploration vs. exploitation in RL: More exploration may find better links but slows convergence
  - Local model capacity vs. autoencoder reconstruction quality: Larger models may reconstruct better but increase communication overhead

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Slow convergence: RL not finding effective links, poor data diversity after exchange
  - Low downstream accuracy: Autoencoder not learning discriminative features, insufficient data exchange
  - High communication failure: Poor link selection, unstable network conditions

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline comparison: Run FL without any D2D exchange on FashionMNIST and CIFAR-10 to establish performance metrics
  2. Random graph exchange: Implement uniform random D2D graph and compare convergence and accuracy against baseline
  3. RL graph discovery: Implement the proposed RL-based D2D graph discovery and evaluate improvement in convergence speed and downstream classification accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How does the proposed method perform in highly dynamic wireless environments with fluctuating channel conditions and node mobility?
- **Basis in paper**: The paper mentions a possible future work considering scenarios with unstable and dynamic communication links, but does not explore this
- **Why unresolved**: The current evaluation assumes relatively stable communication conditions with constant transmission rates and does not account for node mobility or highly variable channel conditions
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Testing the method in simulated or real-world dynamic wireless environments with varying channel conditions, node mobility, and link failures, comparing performance metrics against static scenarios

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: What is the impact of different PCA dimensionality reduction ratios on the performance of the graph discovery and subsequent learning tasks?
- **Basis in paper**: The paper uses PCA to retain important features but does not explore the effect of different dimensionality reduction ratios on the overall performance
- **Why unresolved**: The paper does not provide an ablation study on the effect of varying the number of principal components retained by PCA
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Conducting experiments with different PCA dimensionality reduction ratios and analyzing the impact on graph discovery quality, convergence speed, and downstream task performance

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: How does the proposed method scale with an increasing number of devices and larger datasets?
- **Basis in paper**: The paper evaluates the method on a network of 30 clients with FashionMNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, but does not explore scalability to larger networks or datasets
- **Why unresolved**: The scalability of the method to larger federated learning systems with hundreds or thousands of devices and larger datasets is not investigated
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Evaluating the method on larger federated learning systems with varying numbers of devices and dataset sizes, analyzing computational complexity, communication overhead, and performance degradation

## Limitations
- The method assumes local devices have sufficient data points in each cluster for meaningful exchanges, but "sufficient" is not quantified
- The effectiveness depends heavily on unspecified reward function parameters (α1, α2, γ) and RL hyperparameters
- Evaluation focuses on synthetic non-i.i.d. partitions with only 3 classes per client, limiting generalizability to more extreme data heterogeneity scenarios

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims:**
- The RL framework for D2D graph discovery is technically sound and follows established Q-learning principles
- Autoencoders can learn useful latent representations from exchanged data for downstream classification
- The method improves convergence speed compared to baseline FL without D2D exchange

**Medium Confidence Claims:**
- The method provides robustness against stragglers as claimed
- The specific improvements in downstream classification accuracy are directly attributable to the proposed D2D exchange mechanism
- The method scales effectively to larger numbers of devices and more complex datasets

**Low Confidence Claims:**
- The method's performance under extreme non-i.i.d. distributions (e.g., clients with only 1-2 classes)
- The impact of wireless communication failures on the overall system performance
- The computational overhead and communication costs of the proposed method in resource-constrained edge devices

## Next Checks

1. **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary the reward weights (α1, α2) and RL hyperparameters (M, E, γ) to understand their impact on convergence speed and final accuracy. This will help identify optimal parameter ranges and robustness to hyperparameter choices.

2. **Extreme Heterogeneity Test**: Evaluate the method with more severe non-i.i.d. scenarios where clients have only 1-2 classes each, rather than the 3 classes used in the paper. This will test the method's limits and identify failure conditions.

3. **Communication Overhead Measurement**: Implement a detailed accounting of the total communication cost (including D2D exchanges, RL signaling, and federated aggregation) and compare it against the accuracy improvements to assess the practical utility in resource-constrained edge environments.
