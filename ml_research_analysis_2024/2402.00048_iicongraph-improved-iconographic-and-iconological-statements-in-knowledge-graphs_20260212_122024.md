# IICONGRAPH: improved Iconographic and Iconological Statements in Knowledge Graphs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.00048
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00048
- Authors: Bruno Sartini
- Reference count: 35
- IICONGRAPH demonstrates superior performance compared to ArCo and Wikidata with a score of 0.9111 overall, excelling particularly in structure (0.5357) and content (0.9111)

## Executive Summary
IICONGRAPH is a knowledge graph that addresses gaps in granularity and representation of cultural symbolism in existing knowledge graphs by re-engineering and enriching the iconographic and iconological statements of ArCo and Wikidata. The development involved converting and aligning depicted entities to the ICON ontology, enhancing them with symbolic data from HyperReal, and applying simplified versions of ICON to ArCo's free-text descriptions. The knowledge graph is released following FAIR principles and serves as a valuable resource for cultural heritage research, with demonstrated ability to expose serendipitous symbolic connections and analyze iconological meanings in 20th-century Italian billboards.

## Method Summary
The method involved extracting iconographic and iconological statements from ArCo and Wikidata, then re-engineering them following the ICON ontology structure. This process included converting depicted entities to ICON classes, aligning with HyperReal symbolic data, and applying a simplified ICON ontology to ArCo's free-text descriptions. The development utilized SPARQL queries for data extraction, manual annotation of top Wikidata classes to ICON classes, and automated conversion to the IICONGRAPH format. The approach focused on creating a FAIR-compliant knowledge graph that could better support research questions requiring detailed iconographic and iconological analysis.

## Key Results
- IICONGRAPH achieved a quantitative evaluation score of 0.9111 overall, significantly outperforming ArCo and Wikidata
- The knowledge graph demonstrated superior performance in exposing serendipitous symbolic connections between artworks
- IICONGRAPH successfully identified the most symbolic paintings and analyzed iconological meanings in 20th-century Italian billboards

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Re-engineering existing knowledge graphs using ICON ontology improves granularity of iconographic and iconological statements
- Mechanism: The ICON ontology provides a structured framework that differentiates between pre-iconographic, iconographic, and iconological levels of interpretation, enabling more precise representation of artistic statements
- Core assumption: The linear and descriptive nature of existing knowledge graph data can be parsed and mapped to the ICON ontology structure
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "IICONGRAPH is a KG developed from the iconographic and iconological statements of Wikidata and ArCo, first re-engineered following the ICON ontology structure"
  - [section] "By transforming the free-text description into structured data following ICON, it will be possible to isolate and then measure the frequency of iconological meanings"
- Break condition: If the free-text descriptions cannot be parsed consistently or the ICON ontology structure is insufficient to capture the nuances of existing interpretations

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Enriching knowledge graphs with symbolic data from HyperReal exposes serendipitous connections between artworks
- Mechanism: HyperReal provides a comprehensive database of cultural symbolism that can be aligned with depicted entities, creating new symbolic interpretations that weren't explicitly stated in the original data
- Core assumption: Symbolic meanings from HyperReal can be accurately aligned with depicted entities in existing knowledge graphs
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "IICONGRAPH was also driven by a series of requirements emerging from research case studies that were unattainable in the non-reengineered versions of the KGs"
  - [section] "The research hypothesis is that after enriching Wikidata with HyperReal, the number of serendipitous connections will substantially increase"
- Break condition: If the alignment between HyperReal symbols and depicted entities is inaccurate or if the symbolic interpretations are too context-dependent to be automated

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: FAIR principles compliance ensures reusability and long-term value of IICONGRAPH
- Mechanism: By following FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), IICONGRAPH becomes a sustainable resource that can be easily discovered, accessed, integrated with other systems, and reused for various research purposes
- Core assumption: Adherence to FAIR principles translates directly to practical usability and research value
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "IICONGRAPH is released and documented in accordance with the FAIR principles to guarantee the resource's reusability"
  - [section] "The algorithms used to create it and assess the research questions have also been made available to ensure transparency and reproducibility"
- Break condition: If the implementation of FAIR principles is superficial or if the documentation is insufficient for practical reuse

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Iconography and iconology as domains of cultural heritage interpretation
  - Why needed here: Understanding the difference between these domains is crucial for appreciating why IICONGRAPH's improvements matter
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes iconography from iconology in the context of cultural heritage?

- Concept: Linked Open Data (LOD) principles and SPARQL queries
  - Why needed here: The paper relies heavily on LOD and SPARQL for data extraction and manipulation
  - Quick check question: How does SPARQL enable querying of knowledge graphs in the context of cultural heritage data?

- Concept: Knowledge graph evaluation metrics
  - Why needed here: The paper uses specific criteria to evaluate the performance of IICONGRAPH against existing knowledge graphs
  - Quick check question: What are the key criteria used to evaluate the quality of iconographic and iconological statements in knowledge graphs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Wikidata/ ArCo -> ICON ontology alignment -> HyperReal enrichment -> IICONGRAPH
- Critical path:
  1. Extract iconographic/iconological statements from source KGs
  2. Align depicted entities with ICON ontology classes
  3. Enrich with symbolic data from HyperReal
  4. Convert to IICONGRAPH format
  5. Evaluate against source KGs and research requirements
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Manual vs. automated annotation: Automated approach scales better but may sacrifice some accuracy
  - Simplified vs. full ICON ontology: Simplified version captures most use cases with less complexity
  - Polyvocal vs. creator-intended interpretations: Polyvocal approach offers broader cultural perspectives but may introduce ambiguity
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor alignment scores between source data and ICON ontology
  - Low number of serendipitous connections despite enrichment
  - Evaluation scores that don't show improvement over source KGs
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test alignment accuracy between top 100 Wikidata depicted entities and ICON classes
  2. Measure serendipitous connection increase after HyperReal enrichment on a small subset
  3. Evaluate IICONGRAPH performance on a sample of 50 research questions from cultural heritage scholars

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can IICONGRAPH be effectively integrated with Large Language Models (LLMs) to create question-answering systems for cultural heritage research?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Future work section mentions implementing IICONGRAPH as a backbone of LLM-based question answering systems
- Why unresolved: The paper only mentions this as a future direction without detailing implementation approaches or technical challenges
- What evidence would resolve it: A working prototype demonstrating LLM-IICONGRAPH integration, evaluation metrics comparing traditional vs LLM-enhanced query performance, and analysis of technical challenges encountered

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal method for automatically converting free-text iconographic descriptions into structured LOD following ICON ontology?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Future work mentions using ArCo descriptions and IICONGRAPH RDF as fine-tuning arguments for an LLM capable of autonomously generating iconographic linked open data
- Why unresolved: The paper only suggests this as a potential application without validating its effectiveness or exploring alternative approaches
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study evaluating LLM-generated structured data against manual annotations, with metrics on accuracy, precision, and recall of the conversion process

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can IICONGRAPH be expanded to include more diverse cultural perspectives and artistic interpretations beyond European traditions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on ArCo (Italian heritage) and Wikidata, with HyperReal providing multicultural symbolic meanings, suggesting potential for broader cultural coverage
- Why unresolved: The current version is limited in scope and doesn't address representation of non-Western artistic traditions or interpretation methodologies
- What evidence would resolve it: An expanded version of IICONGRAPH incorporating multiple cultural traditions, evaluation of its coverage across different artistic cultures, and analysis of cross-cultural interpretation patterns

## Limitations

- Representation granularity may be insufficient for capturing all nuances of iconographic and iconological interpretation
- Manual annotation of top 700 Wikidata classes represents a relatively small subset, raising questions about consistency across the entire knowledge graph
- Symbolic interpretations are culturally specific and context-dependent, which may limit the effectiveness of automated alignment

## Confidence

- High Confidence: Quantitative evaluation results (0.9111 overall score) and successful demonstration of research use cases
- Medium Confidence: Methodological approach of simplified ICON ontology and automated parsing, though long-term sustainability remains to be validated
- Low Confidence: Claims about LLM-based question answering systems integration are speculative and not empirically validated

## Next Checks

1. Test IICONGRAPH's performance on iconographic and iconological statements from non-Italian cultural heritage datasets to assess generalizability across different cultural contexts

2. Conduct a longitudinal study tracking how symbolic connections and serendipitous discoveries evolve over time as more data is added

3. Organize a blind evaluation with cultural heritage scholars to assess whether re-engineered statements accurately capture intended interpretations
