# VisAidMath: Benchmarking Visual-Aided Mathematical Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.22995
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22995
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: VisAidMath exposes "reasoning illusion" in LMMs—high accuracy masks severe failures in generating and reasoning from visual aids

## Executive Summary
VisAidMath introduces a benchmark to evaluate visual-aided mathematical reasoning, targeting the gap where current models rely on text-only reasoning despite visual contexts. The authors propose a Three-Layered Funnel Evaluation Framework—ACCU, PVA, and SPRS—to assess final-answer correctness, process validity, and solution robustness. Experiments on models like Doubao-Seed-1.6 and o4 reveal a "reasoning illusion": high accuracy masks severe failures in generating valid visual aids and reasoning from them. The Direct Visual-Aided Reasoning (D-V AR) task induces the largest reliability and robustness gaps, exposing fundamental weaknesses in spatial and logical planning. Qualitative analysis shows models mostly evade visual reasoning, with flawed visual-aid attempts often leading to incorrect answers.

## Method Summary
VisAidMath is a benchmark designed to evaluate visual-aided mathematical reasoning capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs). The benchmark consists of 1,200 mathematical problems sourced from Chinese high school and competition materials, manually translated to English. Each problem includes optional visual context, textual question, generated or provided visual aids (textual descriptions), and a deterministic answer. The evaluation uses a Three-Layered Funnel Framework measuring ACCU (standard accuracy), PVA (process-verified accuracy filtering procedurally flawed reasoning), and SPRS (fine-grained solution process robustness). The benchmark tests three task types: General Reasoning (GR), Direct Visual-Aided Reasoning (D-V AR), and Indirect Visual-Aided Reasoning (I-V AR), using few-shot prompts without model training.

## Key Results
- High ACCU scores mask severe failures in visual aid generation and reasoning, revealing a "reasoning illusion"
- D-V AR task shows largest reliability and robustness gaps, exposing weaknesses in spatial and logical planning
- Manual analysis reveals only 3.0% of correct D-V AR solutions use intended visual aid reasoning paths; most rely on non-visual shortcuts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: VisAidMath exposes reasoning illusions by using layered evaluation that moves beyond surface accuracy to inspect process validity and robustness.
- **Mechanism**: The Three-Layered Funnel Evaluation Framework decomposes model performance into ACCU, PVA, and SPRS, creating a funnel that narrows correct answers to those derived via valid reasoning chains.
- **Core assumption**: A correct answer does not guarantee valid reasoning; therefore, separate metrics for process validity and robustness are needed.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "We propose a Three-Layered Funnel Evaluation Framework—ACCU, PVA, and SPRS—to assess final-answer correctness, process validity, and solution robustness."
  - [section] "This framework moves beyond standard accuracy (ACCU), which often masks procedural flaws."
- **Break condition**: If models consistently produce correct answers via valid reasoning, the reliability and robustness gaps would collapse.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: The Direct Visual-Aided Reasoning (D-VAR) task uniquely stresses models because it forces generation and use of visual aids, which most models evade or fail at.
- **Mechanism**: D-VAR requires models to (1) plan a geometric construction (visual aid) and (2) reason from it. Failure in either step leads to invalid solutions.
- **Core assumption**: Spatial and logical planning are distinct and fragile skills for current LMMs; requiring both in sequence amplifies weaknesses.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "Experiments on models like Doubao-Seed-1.6 and o4 reveal a 'reasoning illusion': high accuracy masks severe failures in generating valid visual aids and reasoning from them."
  - [section] "Direct Visual-Aided Reasoning (D-VAR) tasks the model with generating a visual aid Vg to solve a problem."
- **Break condition**: If models improve spatial planning or if visual aid generation becomes trivial, the gap between D-VAR and other tasks would narrow.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Evasion of visual reasoning is a dominant failure mode; models often solve problems using non-visual shortcuts even when visual aids are expected.
- **Mechanism**: Manual analysis shows that only a small fraction of correct answers use the intended visual-aid path; most rely on arithmetic or general reasoning that ignores visual context.
- **Core assumption**: The benchmark's design does not force models to use visual aids; they can still achieve high ACCU via alternative reasoning paths.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "Qualitative analysis shows models mostly evade visual reasoning, with flawed visual-aid attempts often leading to incorrect answers."
  - [section] "Our manual analysis of 200 correctly answered D-V AR samples shows that a staggering majority relied on non-visual shortcuts."
- **Break condition**: If the task design is modified to penalize non-visual shortcuts, evasion would decrease.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Geometric reasoning and auxiliary construction
  - Why needed here: VisAidMath problems often require constructing auxiliary lines or coordinate systems to simplify complex geometry, which is central to the D-VAR task.
  - Quick check question: Given a triangle with known side lengths, can you construct the median and use it to derive the length of another segment?

- **Concept**: Visual context integration vs. textual-only reasoning
  - Why needed here: The benchmark tests whether models can integrate visual information (e.g., diagrams, coordinates) into their reasoning, not just process text.
  - Quick check question: How would you modify your reasoning strategy if a problem provides a diagram of a solid geometry figure versus a purely textual description?

- **Concept**: Multimodal chain-of-thought and visual chain-of-thought
  - Why needed here: The evaluation framework and task design assume models can interleave visual and textual reasoning steps, a capability still under development.
  - Quick check question: Can you outline a reasoning chain that alternates between interpreting a diagram and applying a geometric theorem?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input → Visual Context (C) / Question (Q) → Task type (GR/D-VAR/I-VAR) → Model output (Answer / Visual Aid + Answer) → Evaluation (ACCU → PVA → SPRS)
- **Critical path**: For D-VAR: C,Q → generate visual aid Vg → reason from Vg → answer A; evaluation checks if Vg is valid and reasoning sound
- **Design tradeoffs**: Task difficulty vs. model capability; strict process filtering vs. leniency; visual aid generation vs. reasoning quality
- **Failure signatures**: High ACCU but low PVA (lucky guesses); high PVA but low SPRS (minor but systematic flaws); near-zero visual aid generation (evasion)
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Run models on D-VAR with ACCU only; record high scores to confirm illusion
  2. Apply PVA filter; measure reliability gap to confirm process failures
  3. Compute SPRS; analyze robustness gap and failure patterns (catastrophic vs. systemic)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can models be improved to better generate visual aids that effectively reduce hallucinations during mathematical reasoning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the correlation between visual-aid error rates and hallucination levels, noting that lower visual-aid error rates lead to more truthful outputs.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies a correlation, it does not provide specific methods or architectural changes to enhance visual aid generation capabilities in models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of models with improved spatial understanding and visual reasoning capabilities, demonstrating reduced hallucination rates and improved accuracy in visual-aided mathematical reasoning tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the most effective evaluation metrics for assessing the quality and utility of generated visual aids in mathematical problem-solving?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the need for semantic-based evaluation metrics for visual aids, as current metrics often fail to capture the nuances of visual reasoning.
- Why unresolved: The paper proposes a framework for evaluating visual aids but does not provide a definitive set of metrics that can universally assess their effectiveness.
- What evidence would resolve it: Creation and validation of a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics that can accurately measure the semantic quality, relevance, and impact of visual aids on mathematical reasoning outcomes.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can mathematical image generation be improved to support more effective visual-aided reasoning in models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies significant deficiencies in mathematical image generation, including poor comprehension of mathematical captions and spatial relationships.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not propose specific solutions or architectural changes to address the challenges in generating accurate and meaningful mathematical images.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of advanced image generation models specifically trained on mathematical contexts, demonstrating improved accuracy and relevance in generated visual aids for mathematical reasoning tasks.

## Limitations
- Benchmark uses textual descriptions of visual aids rather than actual images, which may not fully capture real-world visual reasoning demands
- Manual analysis of 200 samples showing 3.0% visual aid usage is a small sample size, limiting generalizability
- Evaluation framework reliability depends on judgment quality of evaluator model and may vary with different implementations

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The layered evaluation framework design and the basic finding that models evade visual reasoning tasks are well-supported by the paper's analysis and align with broader literature on multimodal reasoning challenges
- **Medium confidence**: The quantitative reliability and robustness gaps between task types, while clearly documented, depend on the specific implementation of the evaluation framework
- **Low confidence**: The exact prevalence of visual reasoning evasion (3.0% figure) and the generalizability of the "reasoning illusion" across different problem types or model architectures remain uncertain

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the ACCU→PVA→SPRS funnel analysis on a larger sample (e.g., 500-1000 samples) to verify the consistency of the reasoning illusion patterns and the 3.0% visual aid usage rate
2. Test alternative evaluator models or human judges to assess the inter-rater reliability of the PVA and SPRS metrics, ensuring the evaluation framework's stability
3. Extend the benchmark to include actual image-based visual aids and problems requiring spatial transformations, to validate whether the reasoning challenges persist in more realistic visual contexts
