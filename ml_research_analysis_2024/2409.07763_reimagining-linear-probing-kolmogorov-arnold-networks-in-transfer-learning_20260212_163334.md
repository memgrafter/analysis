# Reimagining Linear Probing: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks in Transfer Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.07763
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07763
- Authors: Sheng Shen; Rabih Younes
- Reference count: 15
- Primary result: KAN matches linear probing performance on CIFAR-10 but doesn't significantly outperform it

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates replacing traditional linear probing layers with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) in transfer learning scenarios. The authors integrate KAN with a pre-trained ResNet-50 model and evaluate performance on CIFAR-10. Through systematic hyperparameter tuning of grid size and spline degree, they find that KAN achieves comparable accuracy to linear probing on this relatively simple dataset. While KAN offers potential advantages for modeling non-linear relationships and faster convergence, the results suggest these benefits may only become apparent on more complex datasets where linear probing struggles.

## Method Summary
The study replaces the final classification layer of a pre-trained ResNet-50 (frozen) with a KAN layer containing learnable spline functions on edges. The authors systematically vary grid size and spline degree parameters while training on CIFAR-10. The implementation uses Adam optimizer (lr=0.001), batch size of 64, and early stopping based on validation loss. Performance is compared against a baseline linear probing layer using identical training conditions.

## Key Results
- KAN achieves comparable accuracy to linear probing on CIFAR-10 (approximately 95% validation accuracy)
- Best KAN configurations use moderate grid sizes (4-8) with spline degree 3
- Training with KAN required fewer epochs to converge compared to traditional linear probing
- Larger grid sizes showed overfitting tendencies despite better training performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: KAN's spline-based edge activations provide non-linear modeling capability beyond linear probing
- Mechanism: The Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem allows complex multivariate functions to be decomposed into sums of univariate functions. By placing learnable spline functions on network edges rather than fixed activations on nodes, KAN can approximate intricate non-linear relationships that linear probing cannot capture.
- Core assumption: The CIFAR-10 dataset contains non-linear relationships that would benefit from KAN's spline-based representation
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "KAN leverages spline-based representations to approximate intricate functions"
  - [section]: "KAN employs spline-based activation functions on the edges of the network, rather than nodes, which provides a more powerful mechanism to capture non-linear relationships"
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence in corpus papers, though related work mentions KAN's spline-based edge activation as key differentiator
- Break condition: If the underlying data relationships are predominantly linear, KAN's additional complexity provides no benefit over linear probing

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: KAN achieves faster convergence than linear probing
- Mechanism: The flexible spline-based edge functions allow KAN to model complex patterns more efficiently during training, reaching comparable accuracy in fewer epochs than traditional linear probing which requires more iterations to approximate non-linear boundaries.
- Core assumption: The convergence speed advantage of KAN is independent of dataset complexity
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "KAN offers potential for modeling non-linear relationships and faster convergence"
  - [section]: "training with KAN required fewer epochs to converge compared to traditional linear probing"
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence in corpus papers, but KAN literature generally discusses efficient convergence due to edge-based learning
- Break condition: If overfitting occurs with larger grid sizes, the convergence advantage may be offset by reduced generalization

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: KAN provides parameter efficiency through edge-based function representation
- Mechanism: By placing learnable parameters on edges rather than nodes, KAN can achieve comparable function approximation with fewer total parameters than traditional fully connected networks, making it computationally efficient for transfer learning applications.
- Core assumption: Edge-based parameterization provides meaningful efficiency gains for the CIFAR-10 task
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "KAN leverages spline-based representations" suggesting efficient function approximation
  - [section]: "KAN offers a more powerful mechanism for modeling non-linear relationships within data" while maintaining efficiency
  - [corpus]: Related papers mention KAN's parameter efficiency as a key advantage over MLPs
- Break condition: If grid size must be increased significantly to achieve performance, the parameter efficiency advantage diminishes

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem
  - Why needed here: This theorem is the mathematical foundation that allows KAN to decompose complex functions into sums of univariate functions, which is the core mechanism enabling KAN's non-linear modeling capabilities
  - Quick check question: How does the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem differ from traditional neural network approaches in representing multivariate functions?

- Concept: Spline functions and B-spline basis
  - Why needed here: KAN uses spline-based activation functions on edges, requiring understanding of how spline functions provide flexible, smooth approximations of univariate functions compared to fixed activation functions
  - Quick check question: What properties of B-splines make them suitable for learnable activation functions in KAN?

- Concept: Transfer learning with frozen feature extractors
  - Why needed here: The paper uses a pre-trained ResNet-50 with frozen convolutional layers, training only the KAN layer, which requires understanding how feature extractors work in transfer learning scenarios
  - Quick check question: What are the implications of freezing convolutional layers while training only the final classification layer?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: CIFAR-10 images (224x224) -> ResNet-50 feature extraction -> KAN layer (spline computation) -> Classification output -> Loss calculation -> Backpropagation (only through KAN)

- Critical path: Input → ResNet-50 feature extraction → KAN layer (spline computation) → Classification output → Loss calculation → Backpropagation (only through KAN)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Grid size vs. overfitting: Larger grids provide more flexibility but risk overfitting on simple datasets
  - Spline degree vs. computational cost: Higher degrees enable more complex functions but increase computation
  - Edge-based vs. node-based activations: Edge-based provides flexibility but requires different optimization approaches

- Failure signatures:
  - Training loss decreases but validation loss plateaus or increases (overfitting)
  - Performance similar to linear probing despite increased complexity (dataset too simple)
  - Slow convergence despite spline flexibility (poor hyperparameter choice)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline: Replace ResNet-50 final layer with standard linear probing, measure accuracy and convergence speed
  2. Minimal KAN: Grid size 2, spline degree 1, compare performance and convergence to baseline
  3. Grid size sweep: Test grid sizes 2, 4, 8, 16 with fixed spline degree to find optimal balance of flexibility and generalization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does KAN provide significant advantages over linear probing on more complex datasets like CIFAR-100, ImageNet, or medical imaging datasets where non-linear relationships are more prominent?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly state that "KAN's potential is better realized in more complex datasets where non-linear relationships are harder to capture with simple linear models" and that "Future work should focus on evaluating KAN's performance in more complex and challenging datasets."
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluated KAN on CIFAR-10, which is a relatively simple dataset. The authors acknowledge that KAN did not significantly outperform linear probing on this dataset, suggesting that its benefits may only manifest in more complex scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic evaluation of KAN on progressively more complex datasets (CIFAR-100, ImageNet, specialized domains) comparing its performance against linear probing would determine whether KAN's advantages materialize in more challenging scenarios.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal regularization strategy for KAN to prevent overfitting while maintaining its modeling flexibility?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest that "exploring the role of regularization techniques, such as dropout or weight decay, to better control overfitting in KAN-based models" could be a valuable direction for future work, noting that overfitting tendencies were observed for larger grid sizes.
- Why unresolved: While the paper implemented early stopping to prevent overfitting, it did not systematically explore regularization techniques specifically designed for KAN's unique architecture where non-linearities are applied at edges rather than nodes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments applying different regularization strategies (dropout, weight decay, edge-specific regularization) to KAN layers across various datasets would identify optimal regularization approaches that balance flexibility and generalization.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does KAN's computational efficiency compare to linear probing when considering both training and inference across different hardware platforms?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that "KAN offers efficient training by requiring fewer epochs to reach convergence" and notes that "optimizing KAN's computational efficiency" is a potential future direction, but does not provide comprehensive computational benchmarks.
- Why unresolved: While the authors note faster convergence in terms of epochs, they do not provide detailed analysis of computational costs including memory usage, inference latency, or performance across different hardware platforms, which are critical practical considerations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive benchmarking of KAN versus linear probing measuring wall-clock training time, memory consumption, inference speed, and energy efficiency across CPU, GPU, and edge devices would clarify KAN's practical computational advantages or disadvantages.

## Limitations

- Dataset complexity constraint: The study only demonstrates KAN performance on CIFAR-10, a relatively simple dataset where linear probing already performs well
- Implementation specification gaps: Critical details about spline parameterization and edge connection architecture are unspecified
- Limited computational analysis: The paper does not provide comprehensive analysis of KAN's computational overhead compared to linear probing

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The core finding that KAN matches linear probing performance on CIFAR-10 is well-supported by the experimental results
- Medium Confidence: The assertion that KAN offers potential for modeling non-linear relationships is theoretically sound but not strongly validated on the tested dataset
- Low Confidence: Claims about KAN's benefits on more complex datasets and general convergence speed improvements are speculative

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset Complexity Test**: Implement KAN on a more challenging dataset such as ImageNet-10 or a medical imaging dataset where non-linear decision boundaries are known to be important. Compare both accuracy and convergence speed against linear probing under identical conditions.

2. **Implementation Reproducibility**: Create a minimal KAN implementation following the paper's description, then systematically vary spline parameterization methods and edge connection schemes to determine which implementation choices most significantly impact performance.

3. **Computational Overhead Analysis**: Measure wall-clock training time for KAN versus linear probing across multiple epochs, including spline computation costs. Calculate the break-even point where KAN's faster convergence compensates for its higher per-iteration computational cost.
