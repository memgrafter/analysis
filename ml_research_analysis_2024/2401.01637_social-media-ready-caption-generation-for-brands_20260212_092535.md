# Social Media Ready Caption Generation for Brands

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2401.01637
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01637
- **Reference count**: 34
- **Primary result**: Proposed two-stage pipeline for Instagram captions achieves CLIPScore of 0.830 and 42.34% brand personality accuracy using G-Eval, outperforming baselines like Flamingo and InstructBLIP.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a new task of generating Instagram captions for brand images that are aligned with the brand's personality traits. The authors propose a pipeline approach consisting of two stages: first, using a vision-language model (BLIP-2) to generate a plain caption from the image, then using a fine-tuned language model (FlanT5) or GPT to transform that caption into a catchy, personality-aligned social media caption. The system also allows optional inclusion of hashtags, usernames, URLs, and named entities. Experiments show that the proposed pipeline achieves higher CLIPScore and brand personality alignment than existing models like Flamingo and InstructBLIP. Using a fine-tuned FlanT5 model, the system reaches a CLIPScore of 0.830 and a brand personality accuracy of 42.34% with the G-Eval metric.

## Method Summary
The proposed approach consists of a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, a vision-language model (BLIP-2) generates a plain caption from the input brand image. In the second stage, this plain caption is transformed into a catchy, personality-aligned social media caption using a fine-tuned language model (FlanT5) or GPT. The system allows for optional inclusion of hashtags, usernames, URLs, and named entities to produce "social media ready" captions. The pipeline is evaluated using automated metrics like CLIPScore and G-Eval, with the fine-tuned FlanT5 model achieving a CLIPScore of 0.830 and 42.34% brand personality accuracy.

## Key Results
- Proposed two-stage pipeline achieves CLIPScore of 0.830 and 42.34% brand personality accuracy using G-Eval
- Outperforms baselines like Flamingo and InstructBLIP on both CLIPScore and brand personality alignment metrics
- System allows optional incorporation of hashtags, usernames, URLs, and named entities for "social media ready" captions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The two-stage pipeline approach works by first generating a descriptive caption from the image using a vision-language model, then transforming that caption to align with brand personality using a fine-tuned language model. This allows the system to leverage the strengths of both vision and language models while focusing the language model's training on the specific task of brand-aligned caption generation. The optional inclusion of social media elements like hashtags and usernames further enhances the "social media ready" nature of the captions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Vision-language models (BLIP-2)**: Combine image and text understanding for multimodal tasks; needed to generate descriptive captions from images; quick check: verify input image is properly preprocessed and fed to BLIP-2.
- **Language models (FlanT5, GPT)**: Generate text based on learned patterns; needed to transform plain captions into catchy, personality-aligned social media captions; quick check: confirm language model is properly fine-tuned on brand-aligned captions.
- **CLIPScore**: Evaluates image-text alignment using CLIP model; needed to measure how well the generated caption matches the input image; quick check: ensure CLIPScore is computed using the correct image-text pairs.
- **G-Eval**: LLM-based metric for evaluating text generation quality; needed to assess brand personality alignment of generated captions; quick check: verify G-Eval prompt and scoring are correctly implemented.
- **Brand personality traits**: Set of characteristics associated with a brand (e.g., sophistication, sincerity); needed to guide the caption generation towards aligning with the brand's image; quick check: confirm brand personality traits are correctly encoded in the fine-tuning data.
- **Social media elements (hashtags, usernames, URLs)**: Optional additions to enhance social media readiness; needed to make captions more engaging and platform-appropriate; quick check: verify optional elements are correctly parsed and incorporated if present.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Image -> BLIP-2 -> Plain Caption -> FlanT5/GPT (fine-tuned) -> Brand-Aligned Caption -> Optional Elements (hashtags, usernames, URLs, entities) -> Final Social Media Caption

**Critical Path:** Image -> BLIP-2 -> Plain Caption -> FlanT5/GPT (fine-tuned) -> Brand-Aligned Caption

**Design Tradeoffs:** The two-stage pipeline allows for focused training of the language model on brand alignment, but may miss opportunities for end-to-end optimization. Using a fine-tuned FlanT5 vs. GPT involves tradeoffs between customization and leveraging larger, more general models.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor image captioning from BLIP-2 can lead to low-quality plain captions and subsequent brand-aligned captions. Inadequate fine-tuning of the language model may result in captions that fail to align with the desired brand personality.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Generate plain captions from a set of brand images using BLIP-2 and evaluate their quality using automated metrics.
2. Fine-tune FlanT5 on a dataset of brand-aligned captions and evaluate the fine-tuned model's performance on held-out data.
3. Integrate the plain caption generation and fine-tuning components into the full pipeline and evaluate the system's performance on brand-aligned caption generation using CLIPScore and G-Eval.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies primarily on automated metrics rather than human judgments, leaving questions about real-world effectiveness
- Dataset is not publicly available, limiting reproducibility and independent validation
- 42.34% brand personality accuracy, while higher than baselines, remains modest and suggests room for improvement
- Focus on English Instagram captions and specific brand personality traits limits generalization to other languages, platforms, or personality frameworks

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Pipeline architecture and reported automated metric improvements over baselines
- **Medium confidence**: Practical utility of generated captions for real-world social media engagement, due to lack of human evaluation
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability to other platforms, languages, or personality models, as these were not tested

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a human evaluation study comparing generated captions against human-written ones for perceived brand alignment, engagement potential, and overall quality.
2. Release or replicate the dataset publicly to enable independent verification and benchmarking.
3. Test the pipeline on additional social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, TikTok) and with non-English captions to assess cross-platform and cross-lingual generalization.
