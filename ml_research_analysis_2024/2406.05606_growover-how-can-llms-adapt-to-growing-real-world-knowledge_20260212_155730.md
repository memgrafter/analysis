# GrowOVER: How Can LLMs Adapt to Growing Real-World Knowledge?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.05606
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05606
- Authors: Dayoon Ko; Jinyoung Kim; Hahyeon Choi; Gunhee Kim
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proposed retrieval-interactive LLM framework achieves F1 scores up to 45.7 for QA and BLEU scores up to 4.74 for dialogue without continuous training.

## Executive Summary
GrowOVER addresses the challenge of keeping language models updated with rapidly evolving real-world knowledge by introducing dynamic QA and dialogue benchmarks. The method proposes a retrieval-interactive LLM framework that evaluates its own answers and provides feedback for re-retrieval, enabling intermittent updates without continuous training. Experiments show that the approach significantly improves performance, achieving F1 scores of up to 45.7 for QA and BLEU scores of up to 4.74 for dialogue, outperforming baselines and rivaling continuously pre-trained models.

## Method Summary
The GrowOVER framework combines a Decision Gate classifier with Adaptive Re-Retrieval to create a training-free method for updating LLM knowledge. The system uses Wikipedia snapshots as a knowledge base, with articles linked to Portal:Current Events. A classifier trained on GrowOVER data predicts answer reliability, and when answers are deemed unreliable, the retriever performs re-retrieval using a weighted combination of the original query and generated answer. The framework is evaluated on monthly benchmarks tracking knowledge evolution from August to December 2023.

## Key Results
- F1 scores improved from 40.7 to 45.7 for QA tasks
- BLEU scores increased from 3.46 to 4.74 for dialogue tasks
- Outperformed baselines including continuously pre-trained models
- Decision Gate accuracy reached 86.8% in classifier evaluation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The Decision Gate classifier effectively filters out unreliable LLM-generated answers by leveraging temporal information from the GrowOVER dataset.
- Mechanism: The classifier is trained to distinguish between three types of knowledge - unchanged, changed, and new - by comparing current answers with the model's training data and retrieved documents. It assigns a "reliable" probability score that determines whether an answer should be accepted or trigger re-retrieval.
- Core assumption: The LLM's knowledge about a topic can be inferred from whether the knowledge was present in its training data (unchanged), has been updated since training (changed), or is entirely new (new).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our research indicates that retrieval-augmented language models (RaLMs) struggle with knowledge that has not been trained on or recently updated."
  - [section 4.1] "We assume that the LLM knows the answer if the data it has been trained on remains unchanged and the retrieval succeeds."
- Break condition: If the classifier cannot accurately predict knowledge types, or if the knowledge evolution patterns don't align with the unchanged/changed/new categories.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Adaptive Re-Retrieval improves retrieval relevance by incorporating LLM-generated answers weighted by their reliability.
- Mechanism: When an answer is deemed unreliable, the retriever uses a weighted combination of the original query and the generated answer to perform re-retrieval. The weight (ω) is determined by the reliable probability from the classifier.
- Core assumption: Generated answers contain useful information that can improve retrieval, but only to the extent that the LLM is confident about them.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2] "The retriever relies on the LLM's answer to the extent that it is reliable" and "we adjust the reflection of the generated answer based on the LLM's predicted reliable probability"
  - [section 5.2.2] "In the QA task, ARR improves Q and Q:yLLM by approximately 1.2 and 0.3, respectively"
- Break condition: If the generated answers consistently mislead the retriever, or if the reliable probability predictions are inaccurate.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The RiLM framework achieves performance comparable to continuously pre-trained models without requiring parameter updates.
- Mechanism: By combining the Decision Gate and Adaptive Re-Retrieval, RiLM can effectively handle both unchanged knowledge (using the model's existing knowledge) and new/changed knowledge (using retrieval and re-retrieval) without fine-tuning.
- Core assumption: LLMs can be effectively augmented with retrieval mechanisms to handle evolving knowledge without continuous training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our exhaustive experiments demonstrate that our training-free framework significantly improves upon existing methods, performing comparably to or even surpassing continuously trained language models."
  - [section 5.2.3] "For New, RiLM improves RaLM from 1.2 in September to 2.7 in November" and "it significantly outperforms other baselines"
- Break condition: If the retrieval mechanism cannot provide sufficient coverage of new knowledge, or if the model's base knowledge becomes too outdated to be useful even with retrieval.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Temporal knowledge evolution
  - Why needed here: Understanding how knowledge changes over time is crucial for creating effective benchmarks and determining when LLM knowledge is reliable
  - Quick check question: How would you categorize a fact that was true when the LLM was trained but has since been updated in reality?

- Concept: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
  - Why needed here: The core approach relies on retrieving relevant documents to augment the LLM's knowledge, making understanding RAG fundamentals essential
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of a RAG system and how do they interact?

- Concept: Natural Language Inference (NLI)
  - Why needed here: The sentence labeling process uses NLI to classify whether sentences are unchanged, changed, or new by comparing them across time
  - Quick check question: How does NLI help determine if two sentences convey the same information or contradict each other?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Retriever (SentBERT/Contriever) → LLM (Llama2-7B) → Decision Gate (classifier) → Adaptive Re-Retrieval module → Final Answer
- Critical path: Query → Retrieval → LLM generation → Decision Gate evaluation → (if unreliable) Adaptive Re-Retrieval → Final selection
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Training vs inference: Training a classifier vs continuous LLM training
  - Retrieval quality vs computational cost: Using top-k documents vs full database search
  - Temporal accuracy vs automation: Automated sentence labeling vs manual verification
- Failure signatures:
  - Classifier consistently rejects reliable answers (overly conservative)
  - Re-retrieval doesn't improve document relevance (misleading feedback)
  - Performance degrades over time despite framework (insufficient knowledge coverage)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test Decision Gate accuracy on held-out GrowOVER data with different classifier architectures
  2. Evaluate ARR performance with synthetic queries and known document relevance
  3. Compare end-to-end performance with different λ values in the re-retrieval weighting formula

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the RiLM framework handle cases where the LLM's answer is only partially correct or contains subtle errors?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the classifier's ability to predict reliability, but doesn't address nuanced cases of partial correctness.
- Why unresolved: The classifier only predicts three labels (reliable, misleading, uncertain), which may not capture the full spectrum of answer quality.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments evaluating RiLM's performance on questions with partially correct answers or subtle errors, and analysis of the classifier's behavior in these cases.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of using different retrievers (e.g., SentBERT vs. Contriever) on the overall performance of RiLM?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using both SentBERT and Contriever in experiments, but doesn't provide a detailed comparison of their impact on RiLM's performance.
- Why unresolved: The choice of retriever could significantly influence RiLM's effectiveness, but the paper doesn't explore this relationship in depth.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive comparison of RiLM's performance using different retrievers on the same datasets, including analysis of how retriever choice affects the Decision Gate and Adaptive Re-Retrieval components.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the RiLM framework scale to larger, more diverse knowledge bases beyond the selected 112K Wikipedia articles?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses a subset of Wikipedia articles for experiments, but doesn't discuss scalability to larger or more varied knowledge sources.
- Why unresolved: Real-world applications may require handling much larger and more diverse knowledge bases, which could affect RiLM's performance and efficiency.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing RiLM on progressively larger and more diverse knowledge bases, with analysis of performance trends and potential bottlenecks.

## Limitations

- Temporal Generalization: The framework's performance relies heavily on Wikipedia's change patterns, which may not generalize to other knowledge domains with different update frequencies or patterns.
- Classifier Reliability: The Decision Gate classifier's effectiveness depends on accurately predicting whether the LLM possesses knowledge about a topic, which may not capture nuanced cases of partial correctness.
- Retrieval Quality Degradation: As knowledge evolves over longer time periods, the retrieval mechanism may struggle to maintain relevance, particularly for topics with sparse documentation or rapid information changes.

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The experimental methodology and benchmark creation process are well-defined and reproducible. The performance improvements demonstrated in controlled experiments with Wikipedia data are robust within the tested timeframe.
- Medium Confidence: The generalizability of the unchanged/changed/new classification scheme to other knowledge domains and the long-term effectiveness of the Decision Gate classifier. While effective for Wikipedia, these components may require adaptation for different knowledge sources.
- Low Confidence: The framework's ability to handle extremely rapid knowledge changes or highly specialized domains where Wikipedia coverage is limited. The assumption that retrieval can adequately compensate for LLM knowledge gaps may not hold in all scenarios.

## Next Checks

1. Cross-Domain Validation: Test the framework on non-Wikipedia knowledge sources (e.g., scientific literature, news articles, social media) to assess generalization beyond Wikipedia's update patterns and coverage.

2. Longitudinal Performance Analysis: Evaluate the framework's effectiveness over extended time periods (6+ months) to identify potential degradation in retrieval quality and classifier accuracy as knowledge gaps widen.

3. Knowledge Domain Sensitivity: Systematically test the framework across different knowledge domains (technical, cultural, political) to identify which types of knowledge changes it handles best and where it struggles most.
