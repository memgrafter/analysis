# Text Is Not All You Need: Multimodal Prompting Helps LLMs Understand Humor

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2412.05315
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05315
- **Reference count**: 13
- **Primary result**: Multimodal prompting with text and audio significantly improves LLM humor understanding, particularly for puns

## Executive Summary
This paper explores how Large Language Models can better understand humor by incorporating multimodal prompts that include both text and audio. The study introduces a simple yet effective approach where jokes are presented to LLMs in both written and spoken forms, with the audio capturing phonetic cues essential for understanding certain types of humor, especially puns. The research demonstrates that providing audio alongside text substantially improves the model's ability to explain humor compared to text-only approaches, addressing a critical gap in current LLMs' capabilities.

The findings highlight the importance of phonetic ambiguity in humor comprehension and suggest that multimodal inputs can significantly enhance LLMs' understanding of subtle linguistic features that are often lost in text-only processing. This approach represents a promising direction for improving AI systems' ability to engage with and explain humor, which has been a challenging area for language models due to the reliance on phonetic and contextual cues that are not always apparent in written form.

## Method Summary
The study employs a straightforward multimodal prompting approach where both text and spoken versions of jokes are provided to an LLM. The spoken versions are generated using an off-the-shelf text-to-speech (TTS) system, specifically Amazon Polly, which captures phonetic cues crucial for understanding humor, particularly puns. The method involves taking a joke in text form, converting it to speech using TTS, and then presenting both versions to the LLM as part of the prompt. This dual presentation allows the model to access both the written content and the phonetic nuances that are essential for humor comprehension, especially in cases where wordplay and sound similarities are key to understanding the joke.

## Key Results
- Multimodal prompting increased win rate by approximately 4% for homographic puns on the SemEval dataset
- Similar 4% improvement observed for heterographic puns on the SemEval dataset
- Audio cues significantly improved LLM explanations across three humor datasets compared to text-only prompts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism behind this approach's success lies in the fact that humor, particularly puns, often relies on phonetic ambiguity and sound similarities that are not fully captured in text alone. By providing both text and audio representations, the LLM gains access to phonetic information that helps it recognize wordplay, homophones, and other sound-based humor elements. The audio component captures timing, emphasis, and pronunciation nuances that are crucial for understanding why certain jokes are funny, enabling the model to make connections between words that sound similar but have different meanings.

## Foundational Learning

**Phonetic Ambiguity in Humor**
- Why needed: Many jokes, especially puns, rely on words that sound similar but have different meanings
- Quick check: Can the model identify homophonic puns when given audio cues?

**Text-to-Speech Systems**
- Why needed: Converts written jokes into spoken form to capture phonetic nuances
- Quick check: Does the TTS system accurately pronounce words as they would be spoken in natural conversation?

**Multimodal Prompting**
- Why needed: Combines multiple input types to provide richer context for comprehension
- Quick check: Does the model perform better with multimodal inputs compared to single-mode inputs?

**Humor Comprehension in LLMs**
- Why needed: Understanding how LLMs process and explain humor is crucial for improving their capabilities
- Quick check: Can the model explain why a joke is funny, not just recognize it as humorous?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
TTS System -> Text Prompt + Audio Prompt -> LLM -> Humor Explanation

**Critical Path**
Joke Text -> TTS Conversion -> Multimodal Prompt Construction -> LLM Processing -> Explanation Generation

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Computational overhead of generating and processing audio versus improved performance
- Quality of TTS system affecting the accuracy of phonetic cues
- Limited to languages and joke types that can be effectively converted to speech

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor TTS pronunciation leading to missed phonetic cues
- LLM failing to integrate audio information with text context
- Performance degradation with jokes that don't rely on phonetic ambiguity

**First Experiments**
1. Test the approach on a diverse set of joke types beyond puns
2. Compare performance using different TTS systems to identify optimal audio quality
3. Evaluate the model's ability to explain humor in languages other than English

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Relies on a single TTS system (Amazon Polly) which may not capture all phonetic nuances
- Evaluation primarily focused on English puns with limited testing on other humor types or languages
- Requires additional computational resources and processing time compared to text-only methods

## Confidence

**High confidence** in the core finding that audio cues improve LLM performance on homographic and heterographic puns

**Medium confidence** in the generalizability to other types of humor beyond puns

**Medium confidence** in the scalability of the approach for practical applications

## Next Checks
1. Test the multimodal prompting approach across different TTS systems and languages to assess robustness and cross-linguistic applicability
2. Evaluate performance on broader humor categories beyond puns, including visual humor and cultural jokes
3. Conduct ablation studies to determine which specific audio features (timing, pitch, emphasis) contribute most to humor understanding
