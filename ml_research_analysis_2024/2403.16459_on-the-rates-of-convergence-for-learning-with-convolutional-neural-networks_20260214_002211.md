# On the rates of convergence for learning with convolutional neural networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.16459
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16459
- Authors: Yunfei Yang; Han Feng; Ding-Xuan Zhou
- Reference count: 40
- This paper establishes minimax-optimal convergence rates for CNNs in nonparametric regression and binary classification with explicit weight constraints.

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of approximation and learning rates for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with one-side zero-padding and multiple channels. The authors introduce a weight constraint mechanism that enables tighter covering number bounds, leading to minimax-optimal convergence rates in both regression and classification tasks. By carefully controlling network complexity through polynomial weight growth, they demonstrate that CNNs can achieve the same theoretical guarantees as fully connected networks while maintaining their efficient parameter sharing structure.

## Method Summary
The paper studies CNNs with one-side zero-padding and multiple channels, using a weight constraint function to control network complexity. The method involves three key components: (1) proving approximation bounds for smooth functions using weight-constrained CNNs, (2) deriving covering number bounds that depend polynomially on network depth, and (3) applying these results to establish minimax-optimal rates for least squares regression and classification with hinge/logistic losses. The analysis leverages the Tsybakov noise condition for classification and provides explicit control over network weights.

## Key Results
- Proves CNNs with weight constraints achieve approximation rate O(L^(-α/d)) for smooth functions in Sobolev space
- Establishes minimax-optimal convergence rates for least squares regression with CNNs
- Derives optimal classification rates under Tsybakov noise conditions for hinge and logistic losses
- Shows weight constraints lead to better covering number bounds than general networks when constraints grow polynomially with depth

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: CNNs with constrained weights achieve optimal convergence rates by providing tighter covering number bounds.
- Mechanism: Weight constraint function ensures network complexity grows polynomially with depth, enabling covering number bounds of O(L log(LM/ε)) instead of O(L² log(L/ε)).
- Core assumption: Weight constraint ν(θ) ≲ M with M growing at most polynomially in L captures essential complexity without being too restrictive.
- Evidence anchors: Theorem 2.7 shows entropy bound O(L log(LM/ε)); abstract notes advantage of explicit weight control.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: One-sided zero-padding enables exact implementation of fully-connected networks within CNNs.
- Mechanism: Convolution matrix structure allows implementing linear combinations of ReLUs through appropriate filter choices.
- Core assumption: One-sided padding preserves approximation capabilities of fully-connected networks.
- Evidence anchors: Lemma 2.2 provides explicit construction for implementing shallow networks; section 2.1 notes improved approximation rate.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Explicit weight control enables optimal classification rates under Tsybakov noise conditions.
- Mechanism: Balances approximation and generalization errors by preventing over-complexity while maintaining approximation power.
- Core assumption: Tsybakov noise condition and smoothness allow weight-constrained CNNs to achieve optimal bias-variance tradeoff.
- Evidence anchors: Theorem 4.1 states convergence rate is minimax optimal; section 4.1 shows calibration inequality optimality.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Covering numbers and metric entropy in statistical learning theory
  - Why needed here: Convergence rate analysis relies on bounding covering numbers to control generalization error
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why tighter covering number bounds lead to faster convergence rates?

- Concept: Approximation theory for neural networks
  - Why needed here: Proves approximation rates for smooth functions using weight-constrained CNNs
  - Quick check question: What is the significance of approximation rate O(L^(-α/d)) and why is restriction α < (d+3)/2 important?

- Concept: Nonparametric regression and classification theory
  - Why needed here: Derives minimax-optimal rates for regression and classification problems
  - Quick check question: How does Tsybakov noise condition affect achievable classification rates?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input: [0,1]^d vectors -> Convolution layers with one-sided zero-padding and ReLU -> Weight-constrained layers -> Output: scalar

- Critical path:
  1. Construct CNN with constrained weights to approximate target function
  2. Bound covering number using weight constraint
  3. Apply statistical learning theory to derive convergence rates
  4. Optimize depth L and weight bound M to balance approximation and generalization

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Weight constraint strength: Tighter constraints improve generalization but may reduce approximation capacity
  - Channel size J: Larger J increases capacity but also increases parameter count
  - Depth L: Deeper networks improve approximation but require stronger weight constraints

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor approximation rates: May indicate weight constraint is too restrictive or depth is insufficient
  - Slow convergence in practice: Could suggest covering number bound is loose or regularization is too strong
  - Numerical instability: May occur when weight constraints are near their limits

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify one-sided padding implementation by comparing CNN output with equivalent fully-connected network
  2. Test approximation capacity by measuring error on smooth functions with varying depth and weight constraints
  3. Evaluate classification performance under different Tsybakov noise conditions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the smoothness restriction α < (d+3)/2 in approximation results be removed or relaxed?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Restriction is due to proof techniques; future work could use ideas from related works
- Why unresolved: Current proof relies on specific approximation bounds with this restriction
- What evidence would resolve it: Proof showing CNNs can approximate smooth functions with α ≥ (d+3)/2 at same rates

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do approximation and learning rates of CNNs compare to fully connected networks for low-dimensional distributions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Paper notes other works achieved similar rates with fully connected networks
- Why unresolved: Paper does not provide direct comparison of CNN versus fully connected network performance
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical or theoretical comparisons on regression and classification tasks

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can logarithmic factors in convergence rates be removed or reduced?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] States many rates are minimax optimal "up to a logarithmic factor"
- Why unresolved: Logarithmic factors arise from covering number bounds and network construction
- What evidence would resolve it: Proofs showing rates without logarithmic factors or lower bounds demonstrating necessity

## Limitations

- The analysis relies on specific one-sided zero-padding convolution structure that may not generalize to other padding schemes
- Weight constraint mechanism may be challenging to implement effectively in practical deep learning frameworks
- Approximation rates require smoothness conditions that may not hold for many real-world datasets

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Theoretical framework for covering numbers and approximation rates under stated assumptions is mathematically rigorous
- **Medium Confidence**: Extension to specific CNN architecture with one-sided padding and weight constraints depends on careful implementation details
- **Low Confidence**: Practical performance under real-world conditions where assumptions may be violated remains largely untested

## Next Checks

1. Implement the one-sided padding convolution and verify it can implement operations of a fully-connected network on simple test functions
2. Develop and test methods for enforcing the weight constraint ν(θ) ≲ M during training
3. Conduct experiments on datasets where Tsybakov noise condition or smoothness assumptions are only approximately satisfied
