# CTG-KrEW: Generating Synthetic Structured Contextually Correlated Content by Conditional Tabular GAN with K-Means Clustering and Efficient Word Embedding

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.01628
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01628
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Achieves up to 99% less CPU time and 33% less memory usage while maintaining superior performance in skillset variability, distributional similarity, and associativity

## Executive Summary
CTG-KrEW is a framework that extends CTGAN to handle datasets containing contextually correlated word sequences, such as skill sets in worker profiles. It introduces a preprocessing pipeline combining word2vec encoding with K-Means clustering to preserve semantic relationships while significantly reducing memory and training time. The framework demonstrates superior performance in maintaining skillset variability, distributional similarity, and associativity among skills compared to baseline methods, validated using real-world Upwork datasets.

## Method Summary
CTG-KrEW preprocesses data by transforming individual skills into dense vector representations using word2vec, followed by K-Means clustering to group semantically related skills. The cluster-encoded representation is fed into CTGAN instead of high-dimensional multi-hot vectors, enabling efficient synthetic data generation. A decoding function maps synthetic cluster counts back to skills using probability tables, ensuring realistic co-occurrence patterns. The framework is validated on Upwork worker and task datasets and includes a web application for easy synthetic data generation.

## Key Results
- Up to 99% reduction in CPU time and 33% reduction in memory usage compared to baseline methods
- Higher entropy scores indicating greater skillset variability in synthetic data
- Lower KL divergence and higher Pearson correlation demonstrating better preservation of distributional similarity and skill associations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
CTG-KrEW reduces high-dimensionality and preserves semantic associations by encoding skills as word vectors and clustering them. Individual skills are transformed into dense vector representations using word2vec, then grouped via K-Means clustering to create compact cluster IDs, which are fed into CTGAN instead of high-dimensional multi-hot vectors. This works because skills that frequently co-occur in the same profile will be mapped to the same cluster due to the word2vec window size of 1 and subsequent clustering.

### Mechanism 2
CTG-KrEW maintains dataset variability by generating multiple synthetic skill clusters rather than duplicating fixed skill combinations. The cluster-encoded representation allows CTGAN to sample varying counts of skills from each cluster per synthetic record, producing novel combinations not seen in the original dataset. This works because CTGAN can learn the conditional distribution of cluster IDs from the encoded data and generate plausible new cluster count patterns.

### Mechanism 3
CTG-KrEW preserves co-occurrence and association patterns among skills by mapping cluster membership probabilities back during decoding. During encoding, each skill is assigned a probability of belonging to a cluster. During decoding, synthetic cluster counts are mapped back to skills using these probabilities, ensuring realistic co-occurrence patterns. This works because the probability distributions learned during encoding accurately reflect the co-occurrence tendencies in the source data.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Word2vec and distributional semantics
  - Why needed here: To transform discrete, semantically related skills into continuous vector space where similar skills cluster together
  - Quick check question: If "Java" and "JavaScript" often appear in the same profiles, will their word2vec vectors be closer than "Java" and "R"? (Yes, due to the sliding window capturing co-occurrence.)

- Concept: K-Means clustering
  - Why needed here: To reduce dimensionality and group semantically related skills into manageable clusters for CTGAN input
  - Quick check question: If a cluster contains {HTML, JavaScript}, can a synthetic record contain both? (Yes, because CTGAN will sample from that cluster count.)

- Concept: CTGAN architecture and conditional generation
  - Why needed here: To generate realistic tabular data conditioned on encoded cluster IDs while preserving inter-column dependencies
  - Quick check question: Does CTGAN use the cluster IDs as categorical conditioning variables? (Yes, in the same way it uses other categorical attributes.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Corpus builder -> Word2vec model -> K-Means clusterer -> Encoder -> CTGAN model -> Decoder -> Web UI
- Critical path: 1) Preprocess source data → encode with word2vec+K-Means → train CTGAN → save model. 2) User requests synthetic data → load model → generate samples → decode → deliver CSV
- Design tradeoffs:
  - K clusters: Too few → loss of semantic granularity; too many → sparsity, high memory/time
  - Word2vec window size: Larger window → broader context but weaker co-occurrence capture
  - CTGAN architecture: Tradeoff between model capacity and training time; PacGAN used to reduce mode collapse
- Failure signatures: Extremely low entropy in synthetic data → clusters too coarse or model not learning; KL divergence high → cluster mapping losing frequency distribution; Pearson correlation low → decoding step not preserving associations
- First 3 experiments: 1) Run CTG-KrEW on a toy skill dataset (5 profiles, 10 skills), check cluster assignments and synthetic variety. 2) Compare entropy and KL divergence of CTG-KrEW vs CTGAN-MHE on worker-data. 3) Validate that co-occurrence Pearson correlation of synthetic data matches source.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does CTG-KrEW's performance scale with increasing dataset size and complexity beyond the tested parameters? The paper evaluates CTG-KrEW on datasets of moderate size (1575 worker profiles) and mentions its efficiency, but does not explore performance at larger scales. Systematic testing of CTG-KrEW on progressively larger datasets, measuring training time, memory usage, and output quality metrics as dataset size increases would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
How robust is CTG-KrEW to noise and outliers in the source dataset? The paper evaluates CTG-KrEW on a real-world dataset but does not explicitly test its resilience to noisy or outlier-containing data. Controlled experiments introducing varying levels of noise and outliers into the source dataset, followed by evaluation of CTG-KrEW's output quality and robustness metrics would resolve this.

### Open Question 3
Can CTG-KrEW be extended to handle multi-lingual skill sets and contextually correlated phrases in different languages? The paper mentions that CTG-KrEW is designed for skill-oriented datasets but does not explore multi-lingual capabilities. Testing CTG-KrEW on multi-lingual datasets, evaluating the quality of synthetic data generation and semantic preservation across different languages would resolve this.

## Limitations
- Dataset Generalization: Performance on datasets with sparse, noisy, or non-semantic word sequences remains untested
- Hyperparameter Sensitivity: Optimal number of clusters K and its impact on downstream performance is not explored
- Decoding Accuracy: Risk of hallucinated skills in synthetic data is not directly quantified

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The preprocessing pipeline (word2vec + K-Means) demonstrably reduces dimensionality and memory usage; the reported CPU time and memory savings are consistent with the reduced input size.

**Medium Confidence**: The preservation of semantic associations (Pearson correlation) and distributional similarity (KL divergence) is supported by evaluation metrics, but the robustness across diverse datasets is unverified.

**Low Confidence**: Claims about maintaining "greater variability" (entropy) and outperforming all baseline methods are based on a single dataset type and may not generalize.

## Next Checks

1. Cross-Dataset Robustness Test: Apply CTG-KrEW to a non-freelance dataset (e.g., medical diagnosis codes or product feature lists) and measure whether semantic preservation (Pearson correlation) and variability (entropy) remain high.

2. Cluster Count Sensitivity Analysis: Systematically vary K (e.g., 5, 10, 20, 50) and evaluate the impact on synthetic data quality metrics (KL divergence, Pearson correlation, entropy) to identify optimal ranges and failure points.

3. Hallucination Rate Quantification: After decoding, compare synthetic skillsets against the source vocabulary to count the proportion of skills that do not appear in the original dataset, assessing the risk of introducing non-existent skills.
