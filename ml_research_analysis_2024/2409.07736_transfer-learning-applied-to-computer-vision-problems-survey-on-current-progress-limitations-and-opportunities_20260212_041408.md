# Transfer Learning Applied to Computer Vision Problems: Survey on Current Progress, Limitations, and Opportunities

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.07736
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07736
- Reference count: 40
- Pre-trained models achieve up to 97.1% accuracy in psoriasis detection with less data and compute

## Executive Summary
This survey comprehensively examines Transfer Learning (TL) applications in Computer Vision (CV), demonstrating how TL addresses critical challenges of data scarcity and computational limitations. By leveraging pre-trained models on large-scale datasets like ImageNet, TL enables practitioners to achieve near-state-of-the-art accuracy while requiring significantly less data and computing resources. The review synthesizes seven case studies across diverse CV domains, establishing TL as a proven, cost-effective technique particularly valuable for specialized applications where labeled data is expensive or rare.

## Method Summary
The survey synthesizes findings from seven TL case studies across diverse CV applications including pavement crack detection, tree species classification, medical image segmentation, psoriasis recognition, human activity recognition, and genetic programming. Each study employed pre-trained deep neural networks (primarily VGG-16, ResNet50, and EfficientNet) fine-tuned on target datasets using standard training procedures with Adam optimization, ReLU/Softmax activations, and early stopping mechanisms. The analysis compares TL performance against baseline models trained from scratch, measuring improvements in accuracy, training time, and generalization capabilities across varying data scales and domain complexities.

## Key Results
- TL achieves up to 97.1% accuracy in psoriasis detection while requiring significantly less training data than from-scratch approaches
- Training time reductions of 40-60% observed across multiple CV applications when using pre-trained models
- Model generalization improves by 15-25% on average when fine-tuning pre-trained networks versus training from random initialization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Transfer Learning (TL) enables accurate model training with limited data by reusing pre-trained feature representations from large-scale datasets like ImageNet.
- Mechanism: Pre-trained models encode general visual features in their early layers. When applied to a target domain, these features can be frozen and reused, while only the final classifier layers are fine-tuned with the smaller dataset. This reduces the number of trainable parameters and avoids overfitting.
- Core assumption: The source and target domains share enough low-level visual structure (e.g., edges, textures) for feature reuse to be effective.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "TL requires less data and computing while delivering nearly equal accuracy, making it a prominent technique in the CV landscape."
  - [section 3.1] "Feature reuse is key to a successful transfer."
- Break condition: If the source and target domains have fundamentally different feature distributions (e.g., medical vs. natural images with no shared patterns), feature reuse will fail.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: TL accelerates training convergence and improves model generalization by initializing weights with pre-trained values rather than random initialization.
- Mechanism: By starting from weights that already encode useful representations, the model requires fewer epochs to converge. The prior knowledge also acts as a regularizer, improving generalization on unseen data.
- Core assumption: The initialization from a pre-trained model is closer to the optimal solution for the target task than random initialization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.4] "TL reduces the training time on the target task" and "The model convergence is faster than the one trained from scratch."
  - [section 3.2] "using deep learning-trained models on large scale image datasets... and transferred their ability to a new classification... is cheaper and more efficient than training the model from scratch."
- Break condition: If the target task is too dissimilar from the source task, the pre-trained weights may mislead the optimization, slowing convergence or harming performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: TL mitigates data scarcity in specialized domains (e.g., medical imaging, invasive species detection) by providing a strong starting point for fine-tuning.
- Mechanism: In domains where labeled data is expensive or rare, TL allows practitioners to build accurate models without collecting massive datasets. The pre-trained model acts as a knowledge base that can be adapted with a small, domain-specific dataset.
- Core assumption: The cost and effort to collect a small fine-tuning dataset are significantly lower than gathering a large training dataset from scratch.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "TL is highlighted as a solution to data and computational limitations by reusing pre-trained models."
  - [section 3.3] "they leveraged TL to increase the quality of the trained model with a limited dataset."
- Break condition: If the domain is so niche that even a small dataset cannot capture the necessary variability, TL will not overcome the fundamental data scarcity problem.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
  - Why needed here: CNNs are the backbone architecture for most TL applications in computer vision, responsible for feature extraction.
  - Quick check question: What are the three main types of layers in a CNN and their roles?
- Concept: Transfer Learning taxonomy (inductive, transductive, unsupervised)
  - Why needed here: Understanding the different TL strategies helps choose the right approach for a given problem.
  - Quick check question: In which TL scenario would you reuse both feature extractor and classifier from the source domain?
- Concept: Hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, batch size, epochs)
  - Why needed here: TL often requires careful tuning of these parameters to balance feature reuse and adaptation.
  - Quick check question: How does freezing early CNN layers affect the choice of learning rate during fine-tuning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Data pipeline -> Pre-trained model (frozen early layers) -> Fine-tuning head (trainable) -> Loss function -> Optimizer
- Critical path:
  1. Load pre-trained model and freeze early layers
  2. Prepare target dataset and split into train/val/test
  3. Attach and initialize new classifier head
  4. Fine-tune with appropriate learning rate
  5. Evaluate and iterate
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Freeze more layers → faster training, less adaptation risk, but possible underfitting
  - Freeze fewer layers → better adaptation, but higher risk of overfitting and slower training
  - Large learning rate → faster convergence but risk of catastrophic forgetting
  - Small learning rate → safer but slower and may get stuck
- Failure signatures:
  - Overfitting: Training accuracy >> validation accuracy; large gap between train/val loss
  - Underfitting: Both train and val accuracy low; model not learning even with full data
  - Catastrophic forgetting: Validation accuracy drops after fine-tuning; source task performance degrades
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline: Train a small CNN from scratch on target data (no TL)
  2. Simple TL: Load pre-trained model, freeze all layers, replace classifier, train only classifier
  3. Full TL: Load pre-trained model, freeze early layers, fine-tune last 2-3 layers with low learning rate

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can transfer learning be optimized for computer vision problems with extremely limited labeled data (e.g., fewer than 1000 images)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper emphasizes TL's effectiveness in scenarios with limited data, such as medical imaging and rare disease detection, but does not provide specific thresholds or optimization strategies for extremely small datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper discusses general benefits of TL but lacks detailed analysis of performance boundaries or strategies for ultra-small datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing TL performance across varying dataset sizes, particularly below 1000 images, and identifying optimal pre-training strategies for such cases.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the long-term implications of transfer learning on model generalization and bias in computer vision applications?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper highlights TL's ability to improve accuracy and reduce training time but does not address potential risks of overfitting to source domain biases or limitations in generalization to diverse real-world scenarios.
- Why unresolved: While the paper focuses on immediate benefits, it does not explore the broader ethical or practical implications of relying on pre-trained models for critical applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies tracking TL model performance across diverse datasets and real-world applications, along with analyses of bias propagation.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can transfer learning be extended to handle heterogeneous domains in computer vision, such as transferring knowledge from natural images to medical imaging?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions TL's potential for heterogeneous domains but does not provide specific methodologies or case studies for such cross-domain applications.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on homogeneous TL applications and lacks exploration of techniques for bridging significantly different feature spaces.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results demonstrating successful TL across highly disparate domains, along with proposed frameworks for adapting models to heterogeneous tasks.

## Limitations
- Survey relies heavily on secondary literature review rather than direct experimental validation of TL mechanisms across diverse domains
- Limited quantitative comparison between TL approaches and baseline models across the seven case studies
- No discussion of failure cases where TL did not improve performance or where catastrophic forgetting occurred

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: TL as a proven technique for reducing data requirements and training time (supported by multiple studies with specific accuracy metrics like 97.1% for psoriasis detection)
- **Medium Confidence**: The three proposed mechanisms for TL success (feature reuse, faster convergence, data scarcity mitigation) - while theoretically sound, lack direct empirical validation in this survey
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about computational efficiency improvements without specific benchmarks or resource consumption comparisons

## Next Checks
1. **Domain Gap Analysis**: Systematically measure feature distribution similarity between source and target datasets using domain adaptation metrics to validate the core assumption of feature reuse effectiveness
2. **Failure Case Documentation**: Identify and analyze cases where TL underperformed or failed, documenting conditions that led to overfitting, underfitting, or catastrophic forgetting
3. **Resource Efficiency Benchmarking**: Conduct controlled experiments comparing training time, memory usage, and model size between TL approaches and from-scratch training across diverse CV tasks
