core_contribution: This paper introduces a Cantor-Kantorovich metric for measuring
  distances between Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and demonstrates its potential
  application in transfer learning. The metric is based on extending previous work
  on Markov chains to MDPs, using a discounted difference between dynamics under fixed
  policies.

# A Cantor-Kantorovich Metric Between Markov Decision Processes with Application to Transfer Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.08324
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08324
- Reference count: 9
- Primary result: Introduces a Cantor-Kantorovich metric for MDPs that correlates with transfer learning performance in grid-world settings

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel metric for measuring distances between Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) that extends previous work on Markov chains to the MDP setting. The Cantor-Kantorovich metric is based on the discounted difference between dynamics under fixed policies and can be efficiently approximated using a finite horizon. The authors demonstrate its practical utility by showing that this metric correlates with transfer learning performance, where smaller distances between source and target MDPs lead to better jumpstart reward in a grid-world domain.

## Method Summary
The authors extend the Cantor-Kantorovich metric from Markov chains to MDPs by considering the maximum discounted difference between transition dynamics under all possible policies. The metric is defined as the supremum over all state distributions and policies of the discounted total variation distance between transition kernels. For practical computation, the metric can be approximated using a finite horizon, making it computationally tractable. The paper also provides theoretical guarantees about the metric's properties, including its relationship to policy differences and its ability to capture structural similarities between MDPs.

## Key Results
- The Cantor-Kantorovich metric can be efficiently approximated using finite horizon computation
- In grid-world experiments, sources with smaller Cantor-Kantorovich distances to the target MDP yield better jumpstart reward
- The metric captures meaningful structural differences between MDPs that affect transfer learning performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The metric works by quantifying the structural differences between MDPs through their transition dynamics under all possible policies. By considering the supremum over all policies, it captures the worst-case dissimilarity between how different policies would behave in each MDP. The discounted nature ensures that differences in transition probabilities are weighted by their importance over time. This approach effectively measures the "distance" between MDPs in a way that correlates with how difficult it will be to transfer knowledge between them.

## Foundational Learning
- **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**: Framework for sequential decision making under uncertainty; needed to understand the problem domain and solution space
- **Transfer Learning in RL**: Technique for leveraging knowledge from one task to improve learning in another; needed to contextualize the metric's application
- **Total Variation Distance**: Measure of difference between probability distributions; needed to quantify transition dynamics differences
- **Discounted Metrics**: Time-weighted evaluation of differences; needed to prioritize immediate vs. future discrepancies
- **Policy-based Analysis**: Evaluating MDPs through the lens of policies; needed to capture behavioral differences between MDPs
- **Grid-world Environments**: Simple testbeds for RL algorithms; needed to validate the metric empirically

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: MDPs -> Policy Space -> Transition Kernels -> Discounted Differences -> Supremum -> Cantor-Kantorovich Metric
- **Critical Path**: Compute transition kernels under policies → Calculate discounted differences → Take supremum over policies and state distributions → Approximate with finite horizon
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Finite horizon approximation vs. exact computation (computational efficiency vs. precision); fixed policies vs. adaptive policies (simplicity vs. dynamic capture)
- **Failure Signatures**: Metric may fail to capture important differences when policies are similar but optimal actions differ; may be less effective for continuous state spaces
- **First Experiments**: 1) Compute metric between simple MDPs with known policy differences, 2) Validate finite horizon approximation accuracy, 3) Test correlation with jumpstart reward across multiple grid-world variations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited to single grid-world domain for numerical validation, constraining generalizability
- Assumes fixed policies in metric formulation, potentially missing dynamic policy optimization effects
- Relationship between metric and jumpstart reward requires further exploration for broader applicability

## Confidence
- Theoretical framework: High confidence (builds on established mathematical foundations)
- Empirical results: Medium confidence (limited scope of experiments)
- Scalability to complex MDPs: Low confidence (not extensively tested)

## Next Checks
1. Validate the metric across diverse MDP domains including continuous state spaces and non-grid environments to assess generalizability
2. Compare the Cantor-Kantorovich metric against alternative similarity measures (e.g., bisimulation metrics, policy similarity) in transfer learning scenarios
3. Evaluate the impact of different policy selection strategies on the metric's effectiveness, particularly in cases where optimal policies are unknown or difficult to compute
