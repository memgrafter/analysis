# S-SIRUS: an explainability algorithm for spatial regression Random Forest

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.05537
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05537

- Reference count: 9
- Primary result: S-SIRUS achieves 81% rule stability vs 67% for SIRUS while maintaining predictive accuracy on spatially correlated PM10 data

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces S-SIRUS, a spatial extension of the SIRUS explainability algorithm designed specifically for Random Forest regression models operating on spatially dependent data. The key innovation replaces the standard Random Forest with RF-GLS (Random Forest with Generalized Least Squares) during rule extraction, allowing the model to account for spatial correlation patterns. The method is validated through simulation studies using pseudo-real PM10 air quality data, demonstrating significant improvements in rule stability and interpretability while maintaining comparable predictive performance to the baseline SIRUS algorithm.

## Method Summary
S-SIRUS extends the SIRUS algorithm by incorporating spatial correlation awareness into the Random Forest model used for rule extraction. While SIRUS uses standard Random Forest to generate interpretable rule sets, S-SIRUS employs RF-GLS, which explicitly models spatial dependencies through a generalized least squares framework. The algorithm follows the same overall structure as SIRUS - generating multiple bootstrap samples, extracting frequent rules, and identifying stable rules across iterations - but with the crucial difference that the underlying regression model accounts for spatial autocorrelation. This modification allows the extracted rules to better capture the true underlying spatial relationships in the data, resulting in more stable and interpretable rule sets when spatial correlation is present.

## Key Results
- S-SIRUS achieves 81% rule stability compared to 67% for standard SIRUS on simulated PM10 data
- S-SIRUS produces fewer rules (11 vs 15) while maintaining similar predictive accuracy (unexplained variance ~0.49)
- The method shows particular effectiveness when spatial correlation contributes significantly to response variable variability
- Rule stability improvements are most pronounced in scenarios with moderate to strong spatial correlation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of S-SIRUS stems from replacing the standard Random Forest with RF-GLS during the rule extraction process. RF-GLS explicitly models spatial correlation through a covariance structure, which allows it to better capture the underlying spatial dependencies that would otherwise be treated as noise by standard RF. This results in more stable splits in the tree-building process, leading to rules that are less sensitive to bootstrap sampling variation. When spatial correlation is present, standard RF tends to create unstable rules because it assumes independence between observations, while S-SIRUS accounts for the true spatial structure, producing rules that are more consistent across different bootstrap samples.

## Foundational Learning
**Spatial Correlation**: The statistical dependence between observations based on their geographic proximity - needed to understand why standard RF fails on spatial data; quick check: examine Moran's I statistic on residuals.
**Generalized Least Squares (GLS)**: An extension of ordinary least squares that accounts for correlated error structures - needed to understand RF-GLS methodology; quick check: compare OLS vs GLS coefficient estimates on spatially correlated data.
**Bootstrap Stability**: The consistency of model outputs across different bootstrap samples - needed to evaluate rule stability metrics; quick check: compute stability scores for simple decision tree on resampled data.
**Rule Extraction**: The process of converting tree-based models into interpretable IF-THEN rules - needed to understand SIRUS methodology; quick check: extract rules from a simple decision tree and count unique conditions.
**RF-GLS vs Standard RF**: The distinction between random forests that account for spatial correlation versus those that assume independence - needed to understand the core innovation; quick check: compare tree structures from both methods on spatially correlated data.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Data -> RF-GLS Model -> Tree Structure -> Rule Extraction -> Stability Evaluation -> Final Rule Set
**Critical Path**: The algorithm's performance critically depends on the RF-GLS model's ability to correctly capture spatial correlation structure, which directly influences the stability and interpretability of the extracted rules.
**Design Tradeoffs**: Computational intensity of RF-GLS versus interpretability gains; model complexity versus rule simplicity; spatial correlation modeling assumptions versus generality.
**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance when spatial correlation is weak or absent; instability when spatial correlation structure is misspecified; computational bottlenecks with large datasets.
**First Experiments**:
1. Apply S-SIRUS to synthetic spatial data with known correlation structure to verify stability improvements
2. Compare rule stability across different spatial correlation strengths and ranges
3. Evaluate computational scaling with increasing number of spatial locations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies entirely on simulated pseudo-real PM10 data rather than real-world datasets
- Computational efficiency is not addressed despite RF-GLS being more intensive than standard RF
- The stability metric may not fully capture practical interpretability or real-world utility
- Limited exploration of different spatial correlation structures and their impact on performance

## Confidence
**High Confidence**: S-SIRUS achieves higher stability (81% vs 67%) with fewer rules (11 vs 15) while maintaining predictive accuracy is well-supported by simulation results.

**Medium Confidence**: S-SIRUS is particularly effective when spatial correlation contributes significantly to response variability is supported by simulation design but needs broader testing.

**Low Confidence**: Practical interpretability improvements of S-SIRUS rules over SIRUS rules cannot be fully assessed without qualitative analysis or user studies.

## Next Checks
1. Apply S-SIRUS to real-world spatial datasets with known spatial correlation structures (e.g., air quality monitoring networks) to validate performance on actual data.

2. Conduct computational benchmarking comparing S-SIRUS runtime and memory usage against SIRUS and other spatial regression methods across varying dataset sizes.

3. Perform sensitivity analysis by varying the spatial correlation strength and range in simulations to map conditions where S-SIRUS provides maximum benefit over standard SIRUS.
