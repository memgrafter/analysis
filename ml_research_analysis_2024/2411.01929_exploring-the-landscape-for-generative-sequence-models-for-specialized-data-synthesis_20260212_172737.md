# Exploring the Landscape for Generative Sequence Models for Specialized Data Synthesis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.01929
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01929
- Reference count: 25
- One-line primary result: RNN achieves 87.9% inlier rate for synthetic network traffic generation, outperforming Transformer (84.9%) and WaveNet (69.2%)

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses synthetic data generation for structured datasets in sensitive domains like cybersecurity by proposing a novel approach that transforms numerical data into text and leverages sequence models as language models. The authors evaluate three generative models—WaveNet, RNN, and Transformer Decoder—on malicious network traffic data, finding that RNN achieves the highest inlier percentage (87.9%) when compared to the original data distribution. The work provides both a practical methodology for specialized data synthesis and a comprehensive survey of synthetic data generation techniques, applications, and privacy considerations.

## Method Summary
The approach transforms numerical network traffic data into symbolic sequences using CICFlowmeter to extract 80 flow-based features, which are then encoded into 49 discrete symbols representing 1% intervals of numeric features. Three sequence models (WaveNet, RNN, Transformer Decoder) are trained as language models to predict the next symbol in a sequence using cross-entropy loss. Synthetic data is generated by sampling from these trained models, and quality is evaluated using a one-class SVM to measure the percentage of generated points classified as inliers relative to the original distribution. The method reframes numerical data generation as a classification problem rather than continuous regression.

## Key Results
- RNN model achieves highest inlier percentage at 87.9% compared to original data distribution
- Transformer Decoder follows with 84.9% inlier rate
- WaveNet performs least effectively with 69.2% inlier rate
- All models outperformed traditional GAN approaches in terms of generalization and data quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Transforming numerical network traffic data into symbolic sequences reframes the problem as language modeling, which is more tractable for sequence models than direct numerical generation.
- Mechanism: Numerical attributes are discretized into 49 symbol intervals, converting structured data into sequences of discrete tokens. This discretization reduces the complexity of continuous distributions into categorical classification tasks.
- Core assumption: Symbolic encoding preserves enough statistical structure of the original data for effective generative modeling.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our approach uniquely transforms numerical data into text, re-framing data generation as a language modeling task"
  - [section] "By encoding each data point as a sequence of symbols, we frame the task as the prediction of the next symbol in a sequence, given a preceding set of symbols"
- Break condition: If the symbolic representation loses critical distributional information, model performance will degrade despite tractable modeling.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Sequence models (RNN, Transformer, WaveNet) effectively capture temporal dependencies in the symbolic representation, producing synthetic data with higher fidelity than traditional generative models like GANs.
- Mechanism: Sequence models process the encoded symbolic sequences using attention (Transformer) or recurrence (RNN) to model context-dependent probabilities, enabling coherent synthetic sequence generation.
- Core assumption: Temporal dependencies in the symbolic domain correspond meaningfully to dependencies in the original numerical data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "leverages three generative models of varying complexity... to synthesize... Malicious Network Traffic"
  - [section] "Our approach uniquely transforms numerical data into text... significantly improves generalization and the quality of the synthetic data"
  - [section] "The RNN outperformed the other models in terms of generating inliers, likely due to its ability to capture sequential dependencies in the data"
- Break condition: If the sequence models fail to learn long-range dependencies, synthetic data quality will not match real data distribution.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Evaluation using one-class SVM on synthetic data determines statistical similarity to real data, validating the quality of synthetic generation.
- Mechanism: Synthetic data points classified as inliers by a one-class SVM trained on real data indicate alignment with the original distribution, providing a quantitative quality metric.
- Core assumption: One-class SVM can reliably distinguish between real and synthetic data distributions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "we employed a one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel to determine whether the generated data is statistically similar to real data"
  - [section] "The results indicate that while all models performed well, the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) achieved the highest percentage of inliers at 87.9%"
- Break condition: If the SVM decision boundary is too strict or too lenient, inlier percentage may not accurately reflect synthetic data quality.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Symbolic encoding of numerical data
  - Why needed here: Converts continuous numerical features into discrete tokens, enabling sequence models to handle structured network traffic data as language modeling tasks.
  - Quick check question: What is the size of the symbol set used to encode each numerical feature in this approach?

- Concept: Sequence modeling architectures (RNN, Transformer, WaveNet)
  - Why needed here: These architectures are designed to capture dependencies in sequential data, which is essential for generating coherent synthetic network traffic sequences.
  - Quick check question: Which sequence model achieved the highest inlier percentage in the experimental results?

- Concept: One-class SVM for distributional similarity
  - Why needed here: Provides a quantitative method to assess whether synthetic data aligns with the original data distribution, validating synthetic data quality.
  - Quick check question: What metric was used to evaluate the quality of synthetic data in relation to the original dataset?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data preprocessing: CICFlowmeter extraction → Symbolic encoding (49 symbols)
  - Sequence models: WaveNet, RNN, Transformer Decoder
  - Evaluation: One-class SVM for inlier detection
  - Framework: Network traffic → Symbolic sequences → Model training → Synthetic generation → Quality validation

- Critical path:
  1. Transform raw network traffic to structured CSV via CICFlowmeter
  2. Apply symbolic encoding (49 symbols per feature)
  3. Train sequence model on symbolic sequences
  4. Generate synthetic symbolic sequences
  5. Evaluate synthetic data via one-class SVM inlier percentage

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Symbolic encoding simplifies modeling but may lose fine-grained numerical relationships
  - Sequence models offer tractable modeling vs. GANs but may struggle with high-dimensional data
  - One-class SVM evaluation is interpretable but may not capture all distributional nuances

- Failure signatures:
  - Low inlier percentages indicate synthetic data deviates from real distribution
  - Poor sequence model convergence suggests encoding or architecture mismatch
  - Symbolic representation collapse indicates loss of critical data structure

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train RNN on symbolic sequences and measure inlier percentage vs. real data
  2. Compare RNN, Transformer, and WaveNet inlier percentages to identify best model
  3. Vary symbolic encoding granularity (symbol count) to assess impact on generation quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the RNN's superior performance in generating inliers (87.9%) compare to other generative models when applied to larger, more complex datasets with higher dimensionality or heterogeneity?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that while the RNN achieved the highest percentage of inliers, it also suggests that as datasets grow more complex, the Transformer-based Decoder model is expected to excel due to its self-attention mechanism.
- Why unresolved: The paper's experiments were limited to a specific dataset, and the authors acknowledge that the RNN's performance may not scale as effectively as the Transformer's in more complex scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results comparing the RNN, Transformer, and other generative models on datasets with varying levels of complexity, dimensionality, and heterogeneity.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the trade-offs between using symbolic encoding (discretization) and direct numerical modeling for synthetic data generation, particularly in terms of computational efficiency and data fidelity?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces a novel encoding strategy that transforms numerical data into a symbolic, textual domain, framing the task as a classification problem rather than continuous regression. However, the authors do not provide a direct comparison between this approach and direct numerical modeling.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the performance or limitations of symbolic encoding compared to other methods, leaving uncertainty about its advantages or drawbacks in different contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies evaluating the performance, efficiency, and fidelity of symbolic encoding versus direct numerical modeling across various datasets and applications.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can privacy-preserving techniques, such as differential privacy, be effectively integrated with sequence models like RNNs and Transformers to ensure synthetic data generation without compromising individual privacy?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses privacy risks and prevention in synthetic data generation, highlighting the need for privacy-enhancing methods. However, it does not explore the integration of these techniques with sequence models.
- Why unresolved: While the paper mentions privacy concerns, it does not address how sequence models can be adapted to incorporate privacy-preserving mechanisms like differential privacy.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of privacy-preserving techniques, such as differential privacy, when applied to sequence models for synthetic data generation.

## Limitations
- The evaluation relies solely on one-class SVM inlier percentage, which may not fully capture semantic fidelity or downstream utility
- The symbolic encoding scheme (49 symbols) is a critical design choice whose optimality is not explored
- Experimental results are based on a single dataset, limiting generalizability across different structured data domains

## Confidence
- High confidence: RNN achieving 87.9% inlier rate being superior to other models - directly supported by experimental results
- Medium confidence: Symbolic encoding "significantly improves generalization and the quality of the synthetic data" - supported by results but lacks comparative baselines
- Medium confidence: Sequence models capturing sequential dependencies in symbolic representation - plausible but not rigorously validated against alternatives

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies varying the number of symbolic categories (e.g., 25, 49, 100 symbols) to quantify the impact of discretization granularity on generation quality
2. Evaluate synthetic data quality using multiple metrics beyond inlier percentage, including task-specific performance and distributional similarity measures
3. Test the framework on additional structured data domains (e.g., healthcare time series, financial transactions) to assess generalizability
