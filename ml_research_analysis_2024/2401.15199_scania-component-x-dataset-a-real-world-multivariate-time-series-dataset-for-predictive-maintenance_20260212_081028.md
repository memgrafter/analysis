# SCANIA Component X Dataset: A Real-World Multivariate Time Series Dataset for Predictive Maintenance

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2401.15199
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15199
- **Reference count**: 31
- **Primary result**: Real-world multivariate time series dataset for predictive maintenance with 23,550 vehicles and 107 features

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a real-world multivariate time series dataset collected from a single anonymized engine component across a fleet of SCANIA trucks. The dataset includes operational data, repair records, and specifications while maintaining confidentiality through anonymization. It is designed for machine learning applications including classification, regression, survival analysis, and anomaly detection in predictive maintenance scenarios. The dataset serves as a benchmark for reproducible research in predictive maintenance, enabling comparison of methods across the research community.

## Method Summary
The dataset was collected from Component X across 23,550 unique vehicles, featuring 107 variables including 14 anonymized features (8 numerical counters and 6 histograms with multiple bins). Data was collected at varying readout frequencies with less than 1% missing values. The dataset is divided into training (70%), validation (15%), and testing (15%) sets. A cost function is proposed for model evaluation, with higher penalties for false negative predictions to reflect the importance of preventing unexpected failures. The anonymization process preserves confidentiality while maintaining statistical properties for machine learning applications.

## Key Results
- 23,550 unique vehicles with 107 features including 14 anonymized variables
- Data split into training (70%), validation (15%), and testing (15%) sets
- Cost function with higher penalties for false negative predictions
- Less than 1% missing values across the dataset
- Designed for classification, regression, survival analysis, and anomaly detection tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dataset's effectiveness stems from its real-world collection from actual fleet operations, capturing genuine operational patterns and failure modes. The multivariate time series structure allows models to learn temporal dependencies and complex interactions between operational parameters. The cost function design aligns model optimization with practical maintenance priorities by penalizing missed failures more heavily than false alarms, reflecting the real-world consequences of unexpected component failures.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multivariate time series analysis**: Needed to capture temporal dependencies and interactions between multiple sensor readings; quick check: verify autocorrelation and cross-correlation structures
- **Anonymized feature interpretation**: Required due to the removal of component identity; quick check: assess whether anonymized features maintain predictive power
- **Cost-sensitive learning**: Essential for aligning model predictions with business priorities; quick check: validate cost function weights against actual maintenance costs
- **Data partitioning strategies**: Critical for proper model evaluation and preventing data leakage; quick check: verify temporal consistency within partitions
- **Missing value handling**: Important given the less than 1% missing data; quick check: assess impact of different imputation strategies

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Vehicles -> Component X sensors -> Operational features -> Failure labels -> Cost function

**Critical path**: Sensor data collection → Feature engineering → Model training → Cost-sensitive evaluation → Deployment

**Design tradeoffs**: 
- Anonymization preserves confidentiality but reduces interpretability
- Varying readout frequencies provide flexibility but complicate temporal analysis
- High penalty for false negatives prioritizes safety over efficiency
- Single component focus enables depth but limits generalizability

**Failure signatures**: 
- Temporal patterns in operational parameters preceding failures
- Correlations between multiple sensor readings during degradation
- Statistical anomalies in numerical counters and histogram distributions

**First experiments**:
1. Baseline classification performance using anonymized features
2. Temporal pattern analysis across varying readout frequencies
3. Cost function sensitivity analysis with different penalty weights

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Complete anonymization prevents domain expert validation of feature relevance
- Focus on single component limits generalizability to other maintenance scenarios
- Varying readout frequencies may introduce bias in temporal analysis
- Unproven generalizability of findings to different component types or manufacturers

## Confidence
- Classification and regression: High
- Survival analysis: Medium
- Anomaly detection: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct feature importance analysis using domain-agnostic methods to verify that the anonymized features capture meaningful patterns for failure prediction
2. Test model performance across different temporal granularities to assess sensitivity to varying readout frequencies
3. Validate the cost function weights through expert consultation or simulation studies to ensure they reflect realistic maintenance scenarios
