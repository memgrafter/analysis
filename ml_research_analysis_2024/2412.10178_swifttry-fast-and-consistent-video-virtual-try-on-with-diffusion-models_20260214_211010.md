# SwiftTry: Fast and Consistent Video Virtual Try-On with Diffusion Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.10178
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10178
- Reference count: 32
- Achieves 2.27 FPS video generation with superior temporal consistency

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SwiftTry, a novel approach for video virtual try-on that addresses the challenges of frame-to-frame inconsistencies and computational inefficiency. By reframing video try-on as a conditional video inpainting task and enhancing diffusion models with temporal attention layers, SwiftTry achieves significant improvements in both speed and visual quality. The method introduces ShiftCaching to maintain temporal smoothness while reducing redundant computations, and presents TikTokDress, a new high-resolution dataset designed to challenge existing methods with diverse backgrounds, complex movements, and varied garment types.

## Method Summary
SwiftTry approaches video virtual try-on as a conditional video inpainting problem, leveraging diffusion models with specialized temporal attention mechanisms. The core innovation involves adapting image-based diffusion models to handle temporal coherence across video frames through temporal attention layers that capture motion dynamics. ShiftCaching is introduced as an optimization technique that caches intermediate computations across video clips to maintain temporal consistency while reducing computational overhead. The method is evaluated on a newly curated TikTokDress dataset featuring high-resolution videos with diverse backgrounds, challenging movements, and complex garments.

## Key Results
- Achieves 2.27 FPS video generation compared to 1.41 FPS for prior best method
- Demonstrates superior VFID scores indicating better visual quality and temporal coherence
- Outperforms existing methods in video consistency metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SwiftTry's effectiveness stems from reframing video try-on as conditional video inpainting, which naturally addresses the temporal coherence challenge. The temporal attention layers in diffusion models enable the system to capture and maintain consistent garment appearance across frames despite motion and viewpoint changes. ShiftCaching reduces redundant computations by leveraging cached information across video clips, maintaining smoothness while improving efficiency. The TikTokDress dataset provides challenging real-world scenarios that push the boundaries of existing methods.

## Foundational Learning

Temporal attention mechanisms: Needed to capture motion dynamics and maintain consistency across video frames. Quick check: Verify that temporal attention weights properly align garment features across consecutive frames.

Conditional video inpainting: Required to seamlessly integrate new garments into existing video content. Quick check: Assess inpainting quality by measuring garment-background blending and artifact presence.

Diffusion model adaptation: Essential for extending image-based models to video with temporal constraints. Quick check: Compare generation quality between vanilla diffusion and temporally-aware diffusion on test videos.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: User video + Reference garment -> Temporal attention layers -> ShiftCaching -> Output video

Critical path: The temporal attention layers are the critical path, as they directly determine frame-to-frame consistency. Without proper temporal modeling, even perfect inpainting would result in flickering or inconsistent garment appearance.

Design tradeoffs: SwiftTry trades some computational efficiency (due to temporal attention layers) for significantly improved temporal consistency. The ShiftCaching mechanism partially mitigates this by reducing redundant computations.

Failure signatures: Temporal inconsistencies manifest as flickering garments, misaligned clothing edges, or sudden appearance changes between frames. These failures typically occur when motion is too rapid for cached information to remain relevant.

First experiments:
1. Test temporal attention effectiveness on synthetic motion sequences with known ground truth
2. Evaluate ShiftCaching performance degradation with increasing frame-to-frame motion
3. Compare VFID scores on TikTokDress versus existing video try-on datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Method's effectiveness may be limited by quality of reference garments and specific body pose representations
- Temporal attention layers' performance needs validation across broader video datasets
- ShiftCaching may struggle with highly dynamic scenes where cached information becomes outdated

## Confidence

*Video consistency improvements (High):* The reported 2.27 FPS speed and better VFID scores are well-supported by the experimental setup, though cross-dataset validation would strengthen these claims.

*Temporal attention effectiveness (Medium):* While the architectural modifications show promise, the specific contribution of temporal attention versus other components could benefit from more ablation studies.

*ShiftCaching innovation (Medium):* The caching mechanism appears sound, but its performance edge over simpler temporal smoothing techniques needs clearer demonstration.

## Next Checks

1. Test SwiftTry on diverse video datasets beyond TikTokDress to assess generalization to different motion patterns and garment types.

2. Conduct user studies comparing temporal consistency perception between SwiftTry and baseline methods across longer video sequences.

3. Evaluate computational efficiency gains when processing videos with rapid motion or complex backgrounds where cached information may become stale.
