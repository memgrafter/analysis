# Prompting Large Language Models with Audio for General-Purpose Speech Summarization

## Quick Facts

- One-line primary result: Proposed audio-LLM approach outperforms cascade baseline on CNN/DailyMail speech summarization task

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach for speech summarization that leverages large language models (LLMs) by combining an instruction-tuned LLM with an audio encoder. The system is trained to generate consistent responses to prompts regardless of whether the input is speech or text, enabling speech summarization by simply prompting the LLM. By keeping the LLM frozen and training only the audio encoder, the method allows the LLM to process speech inputs in the same way as text, and can produce summaries in different styles by varying the prompting strategy.

## Method Summary
The proposed system combines an audio encoder with an instruction-tuned LLM (MiniChat-3B) to enable speech summarization through prompting. The audio encoder converts speech into token embeddings that align with the LLM's text embedding space. The overall system is trained using modality invariance - keeping the LLM frozen while training the audio encoder to produce the same LLM response for a speech prompt as for a matching text prompt with the same semantic content. This is achieved through next-token prediction loss and knowledge distillation losses (logit and feature distillation).

## Key Results
- The proposed audio-LLM approach outperforms a cascade baseline of speech recognition followed by LLM text processing on the CNN/DailyMail dataset
- The system can generate summaries in different styles by varying the LLM prompting strategy
- Training only the audio encoder while keeping the LLM frozen enables the LLM to process speech inputs similarly to text inputs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The system can summarize speech from any domain because the LLM retains its general text summarization capabilities while being given speech inputs through audio tokens.
- Mechanism: The audio encoder converts speech into token embeddings that align with the LLM's text embedding space. Because the LLM is frozen, it can process these audio-derived tokens just as it would text tokens, allowing it to apply its learned text summarization skills to speech.
- Core assumption: The audio encoder successfully produces embeddings that the LLM interprets as semantically equivalent to text embeddings for the same content.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "the resulting framework allows the LLM to process speech inputs in the same way as text, enabling speech summarization by simply prompting the LLM"
  - [section]: "we keep the LLM weights frozen during all of our experiments, with the audio encoder being the only trainable component of our system"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no direct corpus paper confirming cross-domain generalization for this specific architecture.
- Break condition: If the audio encoder fails to produce embeddings that the LLM interprets as semantically equivalent to text, the LLM will not be able to apply its text summarization capabilities to speech.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The system can generate summaries in different styles by varying the prompt to the LLM.
- Mechanism: The LLM's instruction-tuned nature allows it to follow varied prompts. By changing the prompt (e.g., asking for a summary without names, or focusing on a specific aspect), the LLM generates summaries in different styles, even when the input is speech-derived tokens.
- Core assumption: The LLM's instruction-tuning is robust enough to follow varied summarization instructions regardless of input modality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "it can produce summaries in different styles by varying the LLM prompting strategy"
  - [section]: "Because our system leverages the general-purpose abilities of LLMs to process any arbitrary input, it can summarize spoken content from any domain"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no direct corpus paper confirming style control for this specific architecture.
- Break condition: If the LLM's instruction-tuning does not generalize across input modalities, varying prompts may not produce the desired stylistic changes for speech inputs.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The audio encoder is trained to produce consistent responses to prompts with the same semantic information regardless of input modality.
- Mechanism: The audio encoder is trained using modality invariance - it is guided to produce the same LLM response for a speech prompt as for a matching text prompt with the same semantic content. This is achieved through next-token prediction loss and knowledge distillation losses (logit and feature distillation).
- Core assumption: The training losses effectively align the LLM's outputs for audio and text inputs, ensuring semantic consistency.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "the overall system is trained to generate consistent responses to prompts with the same semantic information regardless of the input modality"
  - [section]: "Using a dataset with paired speech-text data; while keeping the LLM weights frozen, we train the audio encoder to convert speech inputs into token representations that the LLM can interpret"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no direct corpus paper confirming modality invariance training for this specific architecture.
- Break condition: If the training losses do not effectively align the LLM's outputs for audio and text inputs, the system will not produce consistent responses regardless of input modality.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Modality Invariance
  - Why needed here: This concept is the foundation for training the audio encoder to produce embeddings that the LLM interprets as semantically equivalent to text embeddings, enabling the system to process speech inputs in the same way as text.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how modality invariance is used to train the audio encoder in this system?

- Concept: Knowledge Distillation
  - Why needed here: Knowledge distillation is used to guide the audio encoder to produce LLM responses that match those from text inputs more explicitly, by matching the LLM's token prediction logits and hidden states between text and audio inputs.
  - Quick check question: How does knowledge distillation help in aligning the LLM's outputs for audio and text inputs?

- Concept: Token Embeddings
  - Why needed here: Understanding token embeddings is crucial for grasping how the audio encoder converts speech into a format that the LLM can interpret, and how the LLM processes these embeddings to generate summaries.
  - Quick check question: Can you describe the role of token embeddings in this speech summarization system?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Speech input -> Audio Encoder -> Token Embeddings -> LLM (MiniChat-3B) -> Summary output

- Critical path:
  1. Speech input is fed into the audio encoder
  2. The audio encoder converts the speech into token embeddings
  3. These token embeddings are fed into the LLM as part of the prompt
  4. The LLM generates a summary based on the prompt and token embeddings

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Freezing the LLM weights preserves its general text summarization capabilities but prevents it from learning any additional information from the speech input beyond the linguistic content
  - Using a smaller LLM (MiniChat-3B) makes the system more computationally efficient but may limit its summarization performance compared to larger models

- Failure signatures:
  - If the audio encoder is not trained effectively, the LLM may generate nonsensical or irrelevant summaries for speech inputs
  - If the knowledge distillation losses are not balanced properly, the system may not produce consistent responses for audio and text inputs with the same semantic content

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the system's ability to generate coherent summaries for speech inputs from the Librispeech dataset, comparing the results to summaries generated from the corresponding text inputs
  2. Evaluate the system's performance on the CNN/DailyMail dataset, measuring the quality of the generated summaries against reference summaries using ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore metrics
  3. Assess the system's ability to generate summaries in different styles by varying the prompts to the LLM, and evaluate the quality and relevance of the generated summaries for each style

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly mentioned in the paper

## Limitations
- The effectiveness of the audio encoder in producing consistent responses for audio and text inputs with the same semantic content is not directly validated
- The system's ability to generate summaries in different styles for speech inputs is assumed but not directly tested
- The system's performance on speech inputs from domains outside of the training data is not evaluated

## Confidence
- High confidence: The paper's claims about the system's architecture and the general approach of using an audio encoder to convert speech into token embeddings for the LLM are well-supported by the provided information
- Medium confidence: The claims about the system's ability to generate summaries in different styles by varying the prompt to the LLM are plausible given the LLM's instruction-tuned nature, but the paper does not provide direct evidence to confirm this for speech inputs
- Low confidence: The claims about the audio encoder's ability to produce embeddings that the LLM interprets as semantically equivalent to text embeddings for the same content are critical to the system's performance, but the paper does not provide direct evidence to validate this alignment

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a human evaluation study to assess the semantic equivalence of the LLM's responses to audio and text inputs with the same content
2. Test the system's ability to generate summaries in different styles for speech inputs by varying the prompts to the LLM
3. Evaluate the system's performance on speech inputs from domains outside of the training data to assess its ability to summarize speech from any domain
