# Can we hop in general? A discussion of benchmark selection and design using the Hopper environment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.08870
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08870
- Reference count: 20
- Primary result: Different implementations of the same benchmark (OpenAI Gym vs. DeepMind Control) lead to drastically different algorithm performance rankings

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how benchmark selection impacts reinforcement learning evaluation through a systematic comparison of four RL algorithms across different implementations of the Hopper environment. The authors demonstrate that algorithmic performance and relative rankings vary dramatically between OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control versions of the same task, suggesting current benchmarks may not be interchangeable or representative of broader problem classes. The study calls for benchmark design to be treated as a scientific discipline, requiring a common language for description, measurable properties for assessment, and explicit consideration of how benchmark choices affect algorithm development and evaluation.

## Method Summary
The paper evaluates four reinforcement learning algorithms (SAC, MBPO, ALM, DIAYN) across three Hopper environment variants: OpenAI Gym Hopper, OpenAI Gym Hopper without termination, and DeepMind Control Hopper. Using MuJoCo physics simulator, the authors train each algorithm with 30 random seeds per environment variant and compare cumulative reward over training steps. They also perform qualitative analysis of skill emergence in DIAYN by visualizing agent behaviors. The experiments systematically vary implementation details while keeping algorithms and evaluation metrics constant to isolate the impact of benchmark design on algorithm performance.

## Key Results
- SAC performs well on OpenAI Gym Hopper but poorly on DeepMind Control Hopper, while model-based approaches show the opposite pattern
- Algorithm rankings differ significantly between implementations, with the top-performing algorithm on one platform performing near-random on another
- DIAYN produces diverse dynamic skills on OpenAI Gym but static poses on DeepMind Control, despite identical training procedures
- Simple changes like removing termination conditions can substantially alter algorithm rankings and performance profiles

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The dramatic performance differences between benchmark implementations stem from variations in physics parameters, termination conditions, and reward shaping that create fundamentally different optimization landscapes. These implementation differences affect how algorithms explore, learn value functions, and generalize, leading to algorithmic behaviors that are specific to each benchmark rather than transferable across implementations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Reinforcement Learning fundamentals** - Understanding the relationship between environment dynamics, reward structure, and policy optimization is essential for interpreting performance differences across benchmarks
  - Why needed: The paper's core argument relies on understanding how algorithmic choices interact with environmental properties
  - Quick check: Can you explain why removing termination conditions might help model-based methods but hurt others?

- **Continuous control and MuJoCo physics** - Knowledge of physics simulation parameters and their impact on agent behavior is crucial for understanding benchmark differences
  - Why needed: The paper attributes performance differences partly to physics parameter variations between implementations
  - Quick check: Can you identify which physics parameters would most affect a hopper's ability to learn jumping?

- **Benchmark design principles** - Understanding how environment design choices (termination, rewards, dynamics) influence learning is key to the paper's argument
  - Why needed: The paper advocates for treating benchmark design as a scientific discipline
  - Quick check: Can you list three environmental design choices that could significantly impact RL algorithm performance?

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: OpenAI Gym Hopper <-> DeepMind Control Hopper <-> MuJoCo Physics
**Critical path**: Environment implementation → Physics parameters → Reward structure → Algorithm training → Performance evaluation
**Design tradeoffs**: Benchmark fidelity vs. computational efficiency; standardization vs. task diversity; reproducibility vs. innovation
**Failure signatures**: Complete algorithm failure (zero rewards), performance inversion (best algorithm becomes worst), qualitative behavioral changes (dynamic skills vs. static poses)
**First experiments**: 1) Run SAC on both Hopper variants to confirm performance reversal, 2) Modify termination conditions in OpenAI Gym to match DeepMind Control, 3) Visualize DIAYN skills to verify dynamic vs. static behavior differences

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Focuses exclusively on continuous control tasks with a single environment (Hopper), limiting generalizability to other task types
- Analysis of why benchmarks differ is preliminary and doesn't systematically investigate all contributing factors
- Doesn't explore whether performance differences persist across other environment families or algorithm classes

## Confidence
- **High**: The experimental design is straightforward and results clearly demonstrate benchmark sensitivity through reward curves and skill visualizations
- **Medium**: The call for benchmark design as a scientific discipline is compelling but relies more on theoretical arguments than additional empirical evidence

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the Hopper experiment across additional continuous control tasks (HalfCheetah, Walker2d) to verify if performance discrepancies generalize beyond a single environment
2. Systematically vary termination conditions and physics parameters in controlled experiments to isolate which factors most strongly influence algorithm rankings
3. Test additional algorithm families (value-based, policy gradient, evolutionary) to determine if the benchmark sensitivity affects all approaches equally or shows systematic patterns
