# Improving Fairness in Credit Lending Models using Subgroup Threshold Optimization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.10652
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10652
- Reference count: 26
- Authors: Cecilia Ying; Stephen Thomas
- Primary result: Proposed subgroup threshold optimization approach improves fairness in credit lending models while maintaining reasonable accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach called subgroup threshold optimization to enhance fairness in credit lending models. The method focuses on optimizing decision thresholds for different subgroups to achieve more equitable outcomes across sensitive attributes. By adjusting thresholds at the subgroup level rather than applying a single global threshold, the approach aims to mitigate disparities in lending decisions.

The proposed method demonstrates promising results in improving fairness metrics while maintaining model performance. The authors argue that this targeted threshold adjustment can help address historical biases in credit lending without significantly compromising the overall accuracy of the model.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a subgroup threshold optimization approach that adjusts decision thresholds for different subgroups to improve fairness in credit lending models. The method involves:

1. Identifying subgroups based on sensitive attributes
2. Optimizing individual thresholds for each subgroup to maximize a fairness objective
3. Applying these optimized thresholds to make lending decisions

The optimization process aims to balance fairness considerations with model performance, seeking to reduce disparities in approval rates and outcomes across different demographic groups while maintaining overall model accuracy.

## Key Results
- The subgroup threshold optimization approach significantly improves fairness metrics across multiple credit lending datasets
- Model accuracy is maintained at reasonable levels despite the focus on fairness improvements
- The method demonstrates effectiveness in reducing disparities in lending decisions across sensitive attributes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The subgroup threshold optimization approach works by recognizing that different demographic groups may have varying characteristics that affect their creditworthiness. By allowing for individualized thresholds, the method can account for these differences while still maintaining overall model performance. This targeted approach helps to mitigate the impact of historical biases in lending data and practices.

## Foundational Learning
- Fairness metrics in machine learning (why needed: to quantify and measure equity in model outcomes; quick check: can you define and calculate metrics like demographic parity and equal opportunity?)
- Threshold optimization techniques (why needed: to understand how adjusting decision boundaries affects model performance and fairness; quick check: can you explain how threshold changes impact precision-recall trade-offs?)
- Subgroup analysis in credit lending (why needed: to recognize the importance of considering different demographic groups in lending decisions; quick check: can you identify common sensitive attributes used in credit lending fairness studies?)
- Model evaluation in imbalanced datasets (why needed: credit lending often involves class imbalance; quick check: can you describe techniques for handling imbalanced data in model evaluation?)

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Data Preprocessing -> Subgroup Identification -> Threshold Optimization -> Fairness-Aware Decision Making

Critical Path:
The critical path involves identifying relevant subgroups, optimizing thresholds for each subgroup, and applying these thresholds to make final lending decisions. This process ensures that fairness considerations are integrated at the decision-making stage rather than relying solely on model training adjustments.

Design Tradeoffs:
- Fairness vs. Accuracy: Balancing improved fairness metrics with maintaining model performance
- Computational complexity: The optimization process may increase computational requirements
- Generalizability: Ensuring the approach works across different datasets and demographic distributions

Failure Signatures:
- Over-optimization leading to decreased overall model performance
- Threshold adjustments that create new forms of unfairness or discrimination
- Inability to handle subgroups with limited data points effectively

First Experiments:
1. Apply the method to a publicly available credit lending dataset with known fairness issues
2. Compare fairness metrics before and after threshold optimization across multiple sensitive attributes
3. Analyze the impact on model accuracy and business metrics to ensure practical viability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions. However, potential areas for further investigation include the scalability of the approach to larger, more complex datasets and its performance across diverse credit lending scenarios.

## Limitations
- The extent to which the approach generalizes beyond specific credit lending datasets used in the study is uncertain
- The impact on model performance trade-offs, particularly between fairness and accuracy, remains unclear
- Limited discussion of computational efficiency and scalability when applying the method to larger, more complex datasets

## Confidence
- Major claims: Medium
- Methodology: Medium
- Results: Medium
- Applicability: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive experiments on diverse credit lending datasets with varying characteristics and class imbalances to assess the method's generalizability.
2. Perform a comprehensive comparison of the proposed approach against other fairness-enhancing techniques in terms of both fairness metrics and model performance trade-offs.
3. Investigate the computational efficiency and scalability of the subgroup threshold optimization method on larger, more complex datasets and real-world credit lending scenarios.
