# GeoBiked: A Dataset with Geometric Features and Automated Labeling Techniques to Enable Deep Generative Models in Engineering Design

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.17045
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17045
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces GeoBiked dataset with 4,355 annotated bicycle images and explores automated labeling using foundation models

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the GeoBiked dataset and demonstrates how foundation models can automate data labeling for engineering design applications. The authors present two automated labeling techniques: using diffusion model Hyperfeatures to detect geometric points in structural images, and employing GPT-4o to generate diverse text descriptions. The work addresses the challenge of creating labeled datasets for engineering design by leveraging the capabilities of large-scale foundation models, enabling downstream applications in design generation and analysis.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a two-pronged approach to automated data annotation for engineering design images. First, it uses diffusion model Hyperfeatures to detect geometric correspondences between annotated source images and target images by computing cosine similarity between feature representations. Second, it employs GPT-4o to generate diverse text descriptions of technical images using different grounding strategies (image-only, label-only, and image+label). The methods are validated on the GeoBiked dataset containing 4,355 bicycle images with geometric and technical annotations, demonstrating improved accuracy when using multiple source images and exploring tradeoffs between description diversity and accuracy.

## Key Results
- Using multiple annotated source images significantly improves geometric point detection accuracy compared to single-reference approaches
- GPT-4o successfully generates creative text descriptions of technical images, with accuracy depending on input grounding strategy
- Image+label grounding provides the best balance between description diversity and accuracy for technical image understanding
- The GeoBiked dataset enables systematic evaluation of foundation model capabilities on engineering design tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Diffusion Hyperfeatures can detect geometric reference points in unseen structural images by leveraging learned spatial-semantic understanding from large-scale diffusion models. The pretrained aggregation network consolidates latent feature maps from Stable Diffusion across multiple layers and timesteps into interpretable Hyperfeature maps. These maps encode spatial and semantic information that allows cosine similarity comparisons between annotated source points and target image features, enabling geometric correspondence detection.

### Mechanism 2
GPT-4o can generate diverse and accurate text descriptions of technical images when provided appropriate input configurations and carefully engineered prompts. The vision-language model leverages its learned context understanding and visual reasoning capabilities to analyze input images or technical labels, then generates descriptions adhering to specified length, vibe, and style constraints through temperature-controlled sampling.

### Mechanism 3
Using multiple annotated source images improves geometric point detection accuracy by capturing the diversity of bicycle geometries and styles in the dataset. Each source image provides Hyperfeature representations of geometric points. By computing similarity matrices between all source-point Hyperfeatures and target image Hyperfeatures, then selecting the maximum similarity per point, the method can draw from the most relevant source image for each specific prediction.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Diffusion models and latent feature extraction
  - Why needed here: Understanding how diffusion models learn spatial-semantic representations and how these can be consolidated into Hyperfeatures for downstream tasks
  - Quick check question: How do diffusion models encode spatial relationships differently than traditional CNNs, and why does this matter for geometric correspondence?

- Concept: Vision-language model capabilities and limitations
  - Why needed here: Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of VLMs like GPT-4o for technical image understanding and text generation
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between how VLMs process visual information versus traditional computer vision models?

- Concept: Few-shot learning and transfer learning principles
  - Why needed here: Understanding how pretrained models can be leveraged for domain-specific tasks with limited annotated data
  - Quick check question: What factors determine whether knowledge learned on natural images will transfer effectively to technical CAD-like images?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: GeoBiked dataset loading → image preprocessing → Hyperfeature extraction → geometric point prediction; Stable Diffusion (feature extraction), aggregation network (Hyperfeature consolidation), GPT-4o (text generation)
- Critical path: For geometric feature detection - image preprocessing → Hyperfeature extraction from multiple source images → similarity computation → point prediction. For text generation - input preparation → GPT-4o API call → output parsing → evaluation.
- Design tradeoffs: Single vs. multiple source images: Accuracy vs. computational overhead; Image-only vs. label-grounded text generation: Diversity vs. accuracy/hallucination control; Resolution: Higher resolution provides more detail but increases computation
- Failure signatures: Geometric detection: High MSE indicates poor generalization; tube intersection confusion suggests structural similarity issues; Text generation: High hallucination rate indicates insufficient prompt constraints; low diversity suggests over-grounding
- First 3 experiments: Test Hyperfeature geometric detection on a small subset with known ground truth to establish baseline accuracy; Compare GPT-4o text generation performance across different input configurations on a validation set; Evaluate the impact of source image diversity on geometric detection accuracy by systematically varying source image combinations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How do the accuracy and diversity of text descriptions generated by GPT-4o compare when using different combinations of input information (image only, labels only, image and labels)? The paper explicitly evaluates the accuracy and diversity of GPT-4o-generated descriptions using these three input configurations, measuring unique outputs, Levenshtein distance, and accuracy compared to ground-truth labels.

### Open Question 2
How can the system prompt for GPT-4o be optimized to minimize hallucinations and maximize the quality of generated text descriptions for technical images? The paper mentions that careful prompt engineering is necessary to avoid hallucinations and improve the quality of generated descriptions.

### Open Question 3
How can the Diffusion Hyperfeatures approach be improved to accurately predict geometric reference points in unseen images of technical objects, especially for uncommon or outlier samples? The paper shows that using multiple source images improves accuracy, but acknowledges that outlier samples still pose challenges.

## Limitations
- Diffusion model Hyperfeatures may not generalize effectively from natural images to technical CAD-like images beyond the bicycle domain
- Computational overhead of processing multiple source images for geometric detection is not fully characterized
- GPT-4o text generation is sensitive to prompt engineering and may hallucinate technical details without careful constraints

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The methodology for using multiple source images to improve geometric point detection accuracy is well-supported by empirical results within the bicycle dataset, with clear quantitative improvements in MAE and MSE metrics.
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of GPT-4o for generating diverse technical descriptions depends heavily on prompt engineering and input configuration, with results showing sensitivity to grounding strategy but limited validation on broader technical image domains.
- **Low confidence**: The claim that diffusion Hyperfeatures can generalize to any structural engineering domain is based on a single case study (bicycles) and lacks validation on other technical image types.

## Next Checks

1. Test Hyperfeature geometric detection accuracy on non-bicycle technical images (e.g., architectural plans, mechanical parts) to validate cross-domain generalization.
2. Conduct ablation studies varying the number of source images and their diversity to quantify the accuracy-computational overhead tradeoff.
3. Implement a human evaluation study comparing GPT-4o-generated technical descriptions against expert annotations across multiple technical domains to assess hallucination rates and domain specificity.
