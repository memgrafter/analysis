# ENCLIP: Ensembling and Clustering-Based Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining for Fashion Multimodal Search with Limited Data and Low-Quality Images

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.16096
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16096
- Reference count: 23
- ENCLIP improves CLIP-based multimodal search in fashion by training and ensembling multiple fine-tuned CLIP models across different epochs and clustering similar images in latent space. It addresses challenges of limited data and low-quality images. Evaluated on a dataset of 44k Indian fashion products, ENCLIP outperformed both pre-trained CLIP (mAP@10: 0.552–0.827) and FashionCLIP (mAP@10: 0.797–0.965) across categories, achieving 0.651–0.947 mAP@10. Clustering and ensemble ranking improved retrieval relevance and robustness, demonstrating ENCLIP’s effectiveness for fashion intelligence under data and quality constraints.

## Executive Summary
ENCLIP introduces a novel approach to enhance CLIP-based multimodal search for fashion products by combining model ensembling and image clustering. The method addresses the challenges of limited data and low-quality images by fine-tuning multiple CLIP models at different epochs, clustering similar images in the latent space, and using ensemble ranking to improve retrieval relevance and robustness. Evaluated on a dataset of 44k Indian fashion products, ENCLIP significantly outperformed both pre-trained CLIP and FashionCLIP across all product categories, achieving higher mAP@10 scores. This approach demonstrates the potential for scalable and effective fashion intelligence under data and quality constraints.

## Method Summary
ENCLIP enhances CLIP-based multimodal search by training and ensembling multiple fine-tuned CLIP models across different epochs, then clustering similar images in the latent space to improve retrieval relevance and robustness. The method leverages ensemble ranking to combine predictions from diverse models, addressing challenges of limited data and low-quality images. By clustering images based on their latent representations, ENCLIP reduces redundancy and improves the quality of retrieved results. The approach is evaluated on a proprietary dataset of 44k Indian fashion products, showing significant improvements over both pre-trained CLIP and FashionCLIP across all product categories.

## Key Results
- ENCLIP achieved 0.651–0.947 mAP@10 across categories, outperforming pre-trained CLIP (0.552–0.827) and FashionCLIP (0.797–0.965).
- Clustering and ensemble ranking improved retrieval relevance and robustness in fashion multimodal search.
- ENCLIP demonstrated effectiveness for fashion intelligence under data and quality constraints.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ENCLIP works by leveraging the strengths of both ensembling and clustering to address the limitations of CLIP in fashion multimodal search. By training multiple CLIP models at different epochs, the method captures diverse representations of the data, which are then combined through ensemble ranking to improve robustness and reduce overfitting. Clustering similar images in the latent space further enhances retrieval quality by grouping semantically related items, reducing redundancy, and improving the relevance of results. This dual approach mitigates the challenges of limited data and low-quality images, making the system more effective for real-world fashion applications.

## Foundational Learning
- **Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)**: A model trained to align images and text in a shared embedding space. *Why needed*: Forms the basis for multimodal retrieval. *Quick check*: Ensure embeddings for matching image-text pairs are closer than non-matching pairs.
- **Model Ensembling**: Combining predictions from multiple models to improve robustness and accuracy. *Why needed*: Reduces overfitting and captures diverse data representations. *Quick check*: Compare ensemble performance against individual models.
- **Image Clustering in Latent Space**: Grouping images based on their embeddings to reduce redundancy and improve retrieval relevance. *Why needed*: Enhances the quality of retrieved results by focusing on semantically similar items. *Quick check*: Verify clusters contain visually and semantically coherent images.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Adapting a pre-trained model to a specific domain or task. *Why needed*: Improves model performance on domain-specific data. *Quick check*: Measure performance gain after fine-tuning on fashion data.
- **mAP@10 (Mean Average Precision at 10)**: A metric evaluating the quality of top-10 retrieval results. *Why needed*: Quantifies retrieval effectiveness for fashion search. *Quick check*: Ensure mAP@10 scores are consistent across product categories.
- **Latent Space**: The embedding space where images and text are represented for comparison. *Why needed*: Enables semantic similarity matching in multimodal retrieval. *Quick check*: Visualize latent embeddings to confirm meaningful clustering.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Fine-tuned CLIP models (multiple epochs) -> Clustering in latent space -> Ensemble ranking -> Retrieval results
- **Critical Path**: Fine-tuning -> Clustering -> Ensemble ranking -> Evaluation (mAP@10)
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Ensembling improves robustness but increases computational cost; clustering reduces redundancy but may miss rare items.
- **Failure Signatures**: Overfitting to limited data; poor clustering leading to irrelevant results; ensemble averaging out strong individual predictions.
- **3 First Experiments**:
  1. Compare mAP@10 of single fine-tuned CLIP vs. ENCLIP ensemble on a held-out test set.
  2. Evaluate clustering quality by measuring intra-cluster similarity and inter-cluster dissimilarity.
  3. Test ensemble ranking with varying numbers of models to find optimal ensemble size.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluated only on a single proprietary dataset of 44k Indian fashion products, limiting generalizability.
- No comparison with recent state-of-the-art multimodal models (e.g., LLaVA, SigLIP).
- Lack of detailed analysis on computational overhead and scalability for large-scale deployments.

## Confidence
- **High**: Observed improvements on the tested dataset (clear experimental setup and consistent results).
- **Medium**: Broader applicability to other fashion or multimodal domains (limited evaluation scope).
- **Low**: Claims about computational efficiency and scalability (not empirically validated).

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate ENCLIP on multiple diverse fashion datasets (e.g., from different regions, styles, or product categories) to test generalizability and robustness beyond the Indian fashion domain.
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of ensembling, clustering, and fine-tuning on retrieval performance, and quantify their individual contributions.
3. Benchmark ENCLIP against recent state-of-the-art multimodal models (e.g., LLaVA, SigLIP) on standard retrieval tasks to establish its relative effectiveness and efficiency.
