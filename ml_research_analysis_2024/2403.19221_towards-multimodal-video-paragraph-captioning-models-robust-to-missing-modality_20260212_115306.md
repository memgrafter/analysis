# Towards Multimodal Video Paragraph Captioning Models Robust to Missing Modality

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.19221
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19221
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: MR-VPC achieves superior performance in both modality-complete and modality-missing settings for video paragraph captioning

## Executive Summary
This work introduces MR-VPC, a multimodal video paragraph captioning framework designed to handle missing auxiliary modalities during inference. The framework integrates a multimodal VPC architecture (MVPC) that processes video, speech, and event boundary inputs in a unified manner, alongside two training strategies: DropAM, which simulates missing modalities via random input omission during training, and DistillAM, which employs knowledge distillation from modality-complete teacher models to improve robustness. Extensive experiments on YouCook2 and ActivityNet Captions demonstrate that MR-VPC achieves superior performance in both modality-complete and modality-missing settings, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and specialized robustness techniques. The approach highlights the importance of building adaptive, resilient models for real-world multimodal video understanding tasks.

## Method Summary
The MR-VPC framework consists of a Multimodal VPC (MVPC) architecture and two training strategies. The MVPC architecture integrates video, speech, and event boundary inputs using a shared text encoder for ASR and event boundaries, with video features extracted via CLIP ViT-L/14 and a T5v1.1-base decoder. The DropAM strategy randomly omits auxiliary inputs during training to reduce model dependence on specific modalities, while DistillAM employs sequence-level knowledge distillation from modality-complete teacher models to improve performance in missing-modality scenarios. The framework is trained on YouCook2 and ActivityNet Captions datasets with video frames, ASR transcriptions, event boundaries, and ground-truth captions.

## Key Results
- MR-VPC achieves consistent performance improvements across CIDEr, METEOR, BERTScore, BARTScore, and EMScore metrics on both modality-complete and modality-missing settings
- The two-stage training approach (DropAM + DistillAM) provides significant gains over single-modality baselines and specialized robustness techniques
- MR-VPC demonstrates superior zero-shot generalization on Charades dataset compared to state-of-the-art methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: MVPC architecture integrates video, speech, and event boundary inputs in a unified manner to process various auxiliary inputs.
- Mechanism: A shared text encoder processes both ASR and event boundary inputs, allowing the model to leverage all available modalities end-to-end.
- Core assumption: Event boundaries can be tokenized into discrete time tokens and processed as text alongside ASR.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Under this framework, we propose the Multimodal VPC (MVPC) architecture integrating video, speech, and event boundary inputs in a unified manner to process various auxiliary inputs."
  - [section]: "We adopt the relative time tokenization to map continuous timestamps into discrete time tokens... Et transforms the concatenation of the ASR sequence and event boundary sequence"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct evidence in corpus, but aligns with related work on multimodal integration.
- Break condition: If event boundaries contain complex semantic information that cannot be adequately captured through simple time tokenization.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: DropAM strategy simulates missing modalities during training to improve generalization in noisy situations.
- Mechanism: Randomly omitting auxiliary inputs during training reduces the model's reliance on them.
- Core assumption: Randomly dropping modalities during training creates a distribution shift that mimics real-world missing modality scenarios.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we introduce DropAM, a data augmentation strategy that randomly omits auxiliary inputs"
  - [section]: "We randomly drop the auxiliary modalities A and E to reduce the dependence of the model on them"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct evidence in corpus, but aligns with dropout techniques in related robustness literature.
- Break condition: If the random dropping probability is too high, the model may not learn to utilize any modalities effectively.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: DistillAM transfers knowledge from modality-complete teacher models to improve learning in modality-deficient environments.
- Mechanism: Sequence-level knowledge distillation using predictions from a teacher model trained on complete data as augmented training targets.
- Core assumption: A teacher model trained on complete data can provide useful guidance for handling modality-missing scenarios.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "DistillAM, a regularization target that distills knowledge from teacher models trained on modality-complete data"
  - [section]: "we create a new training set Dkd by replacing the ground-truth caption C with the predictions given by Ft based on the modality-complete data"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct evidence in corpus, but aligns with knowledge distillation literature.
- Break condition: If the teacher model's predictions are significantly different from ground truth in modality-missing scenarios.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multimodal fusion strategies
  - Why needed here: The paper needs to integrate different modalities (video, speech, event boundaries) effectively.
  - Quick check question: How does the model handle modality fusion - concatenation, attention, or another method?

- Concept: Knowledge distillation
  - Why needed here: The paper uses sequence-level knowledge distillation to transfer information from complete to incomplete modality settings.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between word-level and sequence-level knowledge distillation in this context?

- Concept: Data augmentation through dropout
  - Why needed here: The paper simulates missing modalities through random input omission during training.
  - Quick check question: How does randomly dropping modalities during training help with real-world robustness?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Video encoder (CLIP ViT-L/14 + 12-layer Transformer) -> text encoder (shared for ASR and event boundaries) -> fusion module (concatenation) -> text decoder (T5v1.1-base)
- Critical path: Video/text encoding → fusion → decoding
- Design tradeoffs: Parameter-free concatenation vs. learned fusion, freezing vs. fine-tuning image encoder
- Failure signatures: Large performance drop when modalities are missing, inconsistent predictions between modality-complete and missing scenarios
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test MVPC performance on modality-complete vs. modality-missing data
  2. Evaluate impact of DropAM alone vs. combined with DistillAM
  3. Compare sequence-level vs. word-level knowledge distillation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does MR-VPC's performance degrade when faced with multiple simultaneous missing modalities (e.g., both ASR and event boundaries absent)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper extensively studies single modality missing (ASR or event boundaries), but does not explore scenarios where both are simultaneously absent.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on robustness to individual missing modalities but lacks analysis of compound missing modality scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing MR-VPC's performance degradation when both ASR and event boundaries are missing simultaneously, compared to single modality missing cases.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the computational overhead of MR-VPC compared to single-modality baselines like Vid2Seq?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions using 8 NVIDIA A40 GPUs and unfreezing CLIP layers for MR-VPC, but does not provide detailed computational efficiency analysis.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates superior performance, it does not quantify the trade-off between performance gains and increased computational cost.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed comparison of training/inference time, memory usage, and parameter count between MR-VPC and Vid2Seq across different hardware configurations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does MR-VPC perform on datasets with different video lengths and content types compared to YouCook2 and ActivityNet Captions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper evaluates on YouCook2 and ActivityNet Captions but only briefly mentions Charades for zero-shot evaluation.
- Why unresolved: The current evaluation is limited to two specific datasets, leaving questions about generalization to other video domains.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive evaluation on diverse video datasets (e.g., instructional videos, sports, movies) showing performance across different video lengths, content types, and annotation styles.

## Limitations
- Framework's robustness claims rely heavily on controlled experiments with simulated missing modalities
- Parameter-free concatenation strategy may limit ability to learn complex modality relationships compared to learned attention-based approaches
- Evaluation focuses on two datasets with relatively clean data and well-defined event boundaries

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The MR-VPC framework improves robustness to missing modalities compared to baseline methods on tested datasets
- **Medium confidence**: The two-stage training approach (DropAM + DistillAM) provides consistent improvements across metrics
- **Medium confidence**: The architectural choices (CLIP + T5 + concatenation) are sufficient for the task but may not be optimal

## Next Checks
1. Test MR-VPC on truly missing modality scenarios (e.g., videos without speech or event boundary annotations) to validate robustness claims
2. Compare parameter-free concatenation with learned attention-based fusion to quantify architectural limitations
3. Evaluate performance on additional diverse video domains with different characteristics and noise levels
