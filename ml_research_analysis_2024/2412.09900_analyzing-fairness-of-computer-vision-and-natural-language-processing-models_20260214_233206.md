# Analyzing Fairness of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.09900
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09900
- Reference count: 36
- Primary result: Fairlearn and AIF360 libraries effectively detect and mitigate bias in ML models, with trade-offs between fairness and accuracy that vary by algorithm and model type

## Executive Summary
This study comprehensively evaluates bias detection and mitigation techniques in both computer vision and natural language processing domains using Fairlearn and AIF360 libraries. The research systematically applies pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing techniques to address bias across different model types and datasets. For computer vision, the UTKFace dataset was analyzed for age group classification with gender and ethnicity as sensitive features. In the NLP domain, the California IMR dataset was used for medical intervention classification with gender and age group as sensitive features. The study demonstrates that both libraries are effective in bias mitigation, though they present varying trade-offs between fairness and accuracy depending on the specific algorithms employed.

## Method Summary
The study employed a systematic approach to evaluate bias mitigation across two distinct domains. For computer vision, the UTKFace dataset was used to classify age groups while considering gender and ethnicity as sensitive features. Various algorithms from Fairlearn and AIF360 were applied, including Correlation Remover, Exponentiated Gradient, Threshold Optimizer, Reweighing, and Disparate Impact Remover. The NLP component utilized the California IMR dataset for medical intervention classification, with gender and age group serving as sensitive features. The Threshold Optimizer algorithm from Fairlearn was specifically evaluated for its effectiveness in this domain. Performance metrics included accuracy, Equalized Odds Difference, Demographic Parity Difference, and other fairness metrics to comprehensively assess both bias reduction and model performance.

## Key Results
- Fairlearn's Correlation Remover and Exponentiated Gradient algorithms reduced bias in computer vision while maintaining reasonable accuracy, though Threshold Optimizer eliminated bias at significant accuracy cost
- AIF360's Reweighing and Disparate Impact Remover algorithms showed similar effectiveness to Fairlearn's approaches in bias mitigation
- For NLP tasks, Fairlearn's Threshold Optimizer reduced Equalized Odds Difference while preserving accuracy in medical intervention classification
- Both libraries demonstrated effectiveness in bias mitigation with trade-offs between fairness and accuracy that varied by algorithm and model type

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study's effectiveness stems from its systematic application of bias detection and mitigation frameworks across multiple domains. By leveraging established libraries (Fairlearn and AIF360) that implement well-researched algorithms, the study ensures methodological rigor. The use of multiple sensitive features (gender, ethnicity, age) across different datasets allows for comprehensive evaluation of bias patterns. The comparison of pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing techniques provides insights into when and how different approaches work best. The quantitative evaluation of both fairness metrics and accuracy measures enables clear understanding of the trade-offs inherent in bias mitigation strategies.

## Foundational Learning

**Demographic Parity Difference** - Measures whether different groups receive similar outcomes regardless of their actual likelihood of needing intervention; needed to quantify basic fairness across groups; quick check: calculate as difference in positive outcome rates between privileged and unprivileged groups.

**Equalized Odds Difference** - Evaluates whether false positive and false negative rates are similar across groups; needed for understanding whether models make mistakes equally across demographics; quick check: compute as maximum difference in TPR and FPR between groups.

**Pre-processing vs. In-processing vs. Post-processing** - Different temporal approaches to bias mitigation; needed to understand when fairness interventions can be most effective; quick check: pre-processing transforms data, in-processing modifies training, post-processing adjusts predictions.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Data Preprocessing -> Bias Detection -> Bias Mitigation Algorithm -> Model Training -> Fairness Evaluation -> Performance Assessment

**Critical Path:** Data Preprocessing -> Bias Detection -> Bias Mitigation Algorithm -> Model Training -> Fairness Evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs:** Accuracy vs. Fairness (lower accuracy often yields higher fairness), Computational Complexity (some algorithms require more resources), Temporal Timing (when to apply mitigation), Algorithm Selection (different algorithms work better for different bias types).

**Failure Signatures:** Significant accuracy drop after bias mitigation indicates over-correction, persistent bias despite mitigation suggests inadequate algorithm selection, high computational cost may limit practical deployment, failure to converge during training indicates algorithmic incompatibility with data characteristics.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Baseline model training without bias mitigation to establish performance benchmarks
2. Application of Threshold Optimizer to evaluate post-processing effectiveness
3. Comparative analysis of pre-processing algorithms (Reweighing vs. Correlation Remover) on same dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation constrained by specific datasets (UTKFace for CV, California IMR for NLP) which may not represent full diversity of real-world applications
- Focus on demographic attributes (gender, ethnicity, age) as sensitive features, potentially overlooking other important dimensions of bias
- Does not deeply explore underlying mechanisms behind varying trade-offs between fairness and accuracy across different algorithms

## Confidence
- High: Effectiveness of Fairlearn and AIF360 libraries in bias detection and mitigation
- Medium: Trade-off analysis between fairness and accuracy due to limited exploration of underlying mechanisms
- Medium: Comparison between Fairlearn and AIF360 libraries as study doesn't investigate performance on more complex or larger-scale datasets

## Next Checks
1. Replicate experiments with additional diverse datasets to test generalizability across different application domains
2. Evaluate long-term stability of bias mitigation when models are deployed in dynamic environments with changing data distributions
3. Investigate computational efficiency and scalability of different bias mitigation algorithms when applied to larger, more complex models
