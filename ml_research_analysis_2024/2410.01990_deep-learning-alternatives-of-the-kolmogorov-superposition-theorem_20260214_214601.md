# Deep Learning Alternatives of the Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.01990
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01990
- Authors: Leonardo Ferreira Guilhoto; Paris Perdikaris
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: ActNet outperforms KANs and competes with MLPs on PINN benchmarks while being inspired by KST

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ActNet, a novel neural network architecture inspired by the Laczkovich formulation of the Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem (KST). Unlike traditional MLPs and KANs that use fixed activation functions, ActNet employs trainable basis functions in each layer, allowing for more flexible function approximation. The architecture demonstrates strong performance in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), consistently outperforming KANs and competing with state-of-the-art MLP approaches across multiple PDE benchmarks.

## Method Summary
ActNet implements the inner functions from Laczkovich's KST formulation using trainable basis functions, creating ActLayers that compute S(Λ ⊙ Φ(x)) where the inner functions are linear combinations of basis functions. The architecture uses sinusoidal basis functions with trainable frequencies and phases, initialized to ensure stable activations through depth. Training employs Adam optimization with learning rate warmup and decay, adaptive gradient clipping for basis functions, and exact boundary condition enforcement.

## Key Results
- ActNet consistently outperforms KANs across all tested PDE benchmarks
- Achieves up to two orders of magnitude better accuracy than KANs on advection and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations
- Maintains competitive performance with state-of-the-art MLP approaches
- Shows particular strength on high-frequency problems where KANs struggle

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Trainable basis functions enable more flexible function approximation than fixed activation functions in MLPs
- Mechanism: Parametrizing inner functions as linear combinations of basis functions allows ActNet to adapt both shape and scaling of activations
- Core assumption: Sinusoidal basis functions can approximate any continuous univariate function when combined linearly
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "ActNet employs trainable basis functions in each layer, allowing for more flexible function approximation."
  - [section]: "The main idea behind the ActNet architecture is implementing and generalizing the structure of the inner functions implied by theorem 3.1."
- Break condition: If chosen basis functions cannot approximate required inner functions within acceptable error bounds

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: ActNet maintains stable activations across depth and width, preventing vanishing/exploding gradients
- Mechanism: Initialization ensures each ActLayer output has mean 0 and variance 1, maintaining stable statistics through central limit theorem
- Core assumption: Input distribution is approximately normal, and basis functions are properly normalized
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The method's effectiveness is attributed to its ability to learn latent functions without direct measurements"
  - [section]: "Theorem 3.4. At initialization, if the input x ∈ Rd is distributed as N(0, Id), then each entry of the output ActLayer(x) has mean 0 and variance 1"
- Break condition: If input distribution deviates significantly from normal or network exceeds CLT regime

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: ActNet's architecture is better suited for PINNs than KANs due to derivative properties
- Mechanism: Derivative of ActNet is another ActNet, meaning higher-order derivatives do not vanish, crucial for PDE residual minimization
- Core assumption: Basis functions used have non-vanishing derivatives
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "ActNet shows significant improvements in solving challenging problems like the advection and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations"
  - [section]: "As detailed in Appendix C, the derivative of an ActNet is another ActNet, which tells us the higher order derivatives of the network will not vanish"
- Break condition: If basis functions' derivatives deteriorate or architecture introduces non-differentiable components

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem (KST) and its variants
  - Why needed here: ActNet is directly inspired by Laczkovich's formulation of KST, and design choices are motivated by KST's function representation capabilities
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between Kolmogorov's original KST formulation and Laczkovich's variant that ActNet is based on?

- Concept: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and their challenges
  - Why needed here: ActNet is evaluated in PINN context, which presents unique challenges like learning latent functions without direct measurements
  - Quick check question: What are the main challenges in training PINNs that make them a suitable testbed for ActNet?

- Concept: Universal approximation properties of neural networks
  - Why needed here: ActNet's ability to approximate any continuous function is a key theoretical property that justifies its use in function approximation tasks
  - Quick check question: How does ActNet's universal approximation proof differ from traditional proofs for MLPs or KANs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input → Linear projection → ActLayer → Linear projection → Output
  - ActLayer: S(Λ ⊙ βB(x)) where B(x) is basis expansion matrix

- Critical path:
  1. Initialize parameters according to scheme in Table 6
  2. Compute basis expansion matrix B(x)
  3. Compute ActLayer output: S(Λ ⊙ βB(x))
  4. Apply linear projections before/after ActLayers
  5. Train using Adam with adaptive gradient clipping for basis functions

- Design tradeoffs:
  - N vs. computational cost: Higher N allows better function approximation but increases computational cost
  - Fixed vs. trainable ω0: Fixed ω0 is more stable, trainable ω0 allows better adaptation to problem frequency content
  - Trainable vs. fixed basis functions: Trainable basis functions allow better adaptation but are more sensitive during training

- Failure signatures:
  - Unstable training: Likely due to basis function optimization issues
  - Poor convergence: Could indicate insufficient N or inappropriate ω0
  - Vanishing gradients: Should not occur with ActNet, but might indicate implementation errors

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a single ActLayer and verify its output distribution matches the theoretical prediction
  2. Compare ActNet's performance on a simple PDE (e.g., Poisson with low frequency) against MLP and KAN
  3. Test ActNet's derivative computation by comparing numerical and analytical derivatives on a known function

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Which specific formulation of the Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem provides the best balance between theoretical expressiveness and practical trainability for neural networks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses multiple KST formulations and argues Laczkovich's is currently most suitable, but acknowledges this is "just a first step"
- Why unresolved: Paper demonstrates ActNet's success with Laczkovich's formulation but doesn't systematically compare it against other formulations
- What evidence would resolve it: Direct empirical comparison of ActNet-like architectures built on each KST formulation

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does ActNet's performance scale with increasing input dimensionality compared to KANs and MLPs?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Paper mentions KST's theoretical strength in low-dimensional domains and ActNet's O(d) scaling with dimension
- Why unresolved: While paper shows ActNet outperforms KANs in 2D problems tested, it doesn't explore whether this advantage persists in higher dimensions
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive benchmarking across problems with varying input dimensions

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the theoretical explanation for ActNet's superior performance on highly oscillatory functions compared to KANs and MLPs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper shows ActNet significantly outperforms competitors on high-frequency Poisson and Helmholtz problems
- Why unresolved: Paper demonstrates empirical superiority but doesn't provide theoretical analysis of why ActNet's parameterization makes it particularly suited to capturing high-frequency content
- What evidence would resolve it: Mathematical analysis of ActNet's frequency response characteristics

## Limitations
- Evaluation methodology may have implementation disparities between ActNet and KAN comparisons
- Limited benchmark diversity with only five PDE problems tested
- No runtime or computational efficiency comparisons provided
- "Optimal" KANs are selected through hyperparameter tuning without full methodology disclosure

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Mathematical foundations of ActNet are well-established, including theoretical derivation from Laczkovich's KST formulation
- **Medium Confidence**: Experimental results showing performance advantages are internally consistent but rely on limited benchmark diversity
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about superiority for high-frequency PDEs and computational efficiency lack comprehensive empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Implementation Validation**: Implement both ActNet and KAN using the same framework to eliminate potential implementation disparities, then re-run PDE benchmarks
2. **Computational Efficiency Analysis**: Measure and compare training time, inference time, and memory usage across ActNet, KAN, and MLP architectures on same hardware
3. **Broader Benchmark Suite**: Test ActNet on additional PDE problems including higher-dimensional problems and problems with discontinuous solutions to assess generalizability
