## Executive Summary
This survey introduces CrowdTransfer, a new knowledge transfer paradigm for AIoT that addresses challenges like constrained resources, dynamic environments, and incremental tasks by leveraging collective intelligence from a crowd of AIoT agents. Building on traditional transfer learning, CrowdTransfer introduces four modes—derivation, sharing, evolution, and fusion—to enable efficient, decentralized, and context-aware knowledge sharing across heterogeneous AIoT agents. The framework supports intra-agent, centralized, and decentralized inter-agent knowledge transfer, and is validated across diverse AIoT applications including human activity recognition, urban computing, connected vehicles, multi-robot systems, and smart factories. The survey also discusses open challenges such as cognitive foundations, transferability measurement, resource constraints, security, continuous evolution, and hybrid human-machine intelligence, outlining future research directions to enhance robustness and scalability in real-world AIoT deployments.

## Method Summary
CrowdTransfer extends traditional transfer learning to AIoT environments by introducing four knowledge transfer modes: derivation (learning from multiple sources), sharing (collaborative model training), evolution (incremental learning), and fusion (combining knowledge from diverse sources). The framework leverages federated learning, knowledge distillation, and meta-learning to enable privacy-preserving, decentralized knowledge sharing while addressing resource constraints and dynamic environments. The approach is designed to handle heterogeneous AIoT agents with varying capabilities, data distributions, and task requirements, enabling both intra-agent adaptation and inter-agent collaboration.

## Key Results
- Introduces four distinct CrowdTransfer modes (derivation, sharing, evolution, fusion) for different AIoT scenarios
- Demonstrates applicability across diverse AIoT domains including HAR, urban computing, connected vehicles, multi-robot systems, and smart factories
- Identifies key challenges including cognitive foundations, transferability measurement, resource constraints, security, and hybrid human-machine intelligence

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: CrowdTransfer leverages collective intelligence by transferring knowledge from multiple agents to overcome individual resource and data limitations in AIoT environments.
- Mechanism: Multiple agents collaboratively train models on heterogeneous data and share distilled knowledge (via federated transfer learning, knowledge distillation, or meta-learning) to improve target agent performance without exposing raw data.
- Core assumption: Agents have related but distinct data distributions and tasks that allow meaningful knowledge transfer.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "CrowdTransfer... transfers prior knowledge learned from a crowd of agents to reduce the training cost and as well as improve the model performance"
  - [section] "FTL emphasizes collaborative modeling and learning on diverse data distributions, offering a promising research direction in achieving the fusion of data among multiple agents"
- Break condition: If agent tasks/data are too dissimilar, transfer becomes ineffective or harmful (negative transfer).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Intra-agent knowledge transfer enables agents to adapt to incremental tasks without catastrophic forgetting.
- Mechanism: Agents maintain and evolve their own knowledge base through continual learning methods (replay, regularization, dynamic architecture) to learn new tasks while preserving old knowledge.
- Core assumption: AIoT environments involve sequential tasks where knowledge from prior tasks is useful for new ones.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "AIoT agents should have the ability to continually learn models for these tasks"
  - [section] "Continual learning methods maintain the knowledge of old tasks during the learning process and avoid forgetting that knowledge when learning new tasks"
- Break condition: If storage/memory constraints are too severe, the agent cannot retain sufficient historical knowledge.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Test-time adaptation allows AIoT agents to adapt pre-trained models to specific deployment conditions without requiring labeled data.
- Mechanism: Agents dynamically fine-tune or adjust model parameters during inference using self-supervised objectives (entropy minimization, consistency regularization) to handle distribution shifts.
- Core assumption: Real-world deployment conditions differ from training conditions, requiring runtime adaptation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "dynamic environments... model performance tends to suffer from sharp degradation in deployment environments"
  - [section] "Test-time Adaption... aims to adapt the source model during the testing phase to accommodate specific test data and enhance the model's performance"
- Break condition: If the domain shift is too large or the adaptation signal is weak, performance gains may be minimal.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Transfer learning fundamentals (domain adaptation, multi-task learning, knowledge distillation)
  - Why needed here: CrowdTransfer builds upon these core transfer learning paradigms to enable knowledge sharing among AIoT agents
  - Quick check question: What are the three main categories of transfer learning methods and how do they differ in their approach to knowledge transfer?

- Concept: Federated learning and privacy-preserving techniques
  - Why needed here: CrowdTransfer must enable knowledge sharing while protecting data privacy, requiring understanding of federated learning and secure aggregation
  - Quick check question: How does federated learning enable model training across multiple agents without sharing raw data?

- Concept: Continual learning and catastrophic forgetting
  - Why needed here: AIoT agents face incremental tasks and must retain prior knowledge, making continual learning essential for CrowdTransfer
  - Quick check question: What are the three main approaches to mitigating catastrophic forgetting in continual learning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: AIoT Agents -> Knowledge Transfer Modules (derivation, sharing, evolution, fusion) -> Context Awareness System -> Security & Privacy Layer

- Critical path: Data collection → Context assessment → Knowledge transfer mode selection → Model adaptation → Performance evaluation → Context update

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Centralized vs. decentralized knowledge transfer (communication cost vs. privacy)
  - Model compression vs. model accuracy (resource constraints vs. performance)
  - Privacy protection vs. transfer effectiveness (security vs. utility)

- Failure signatures:
  - Negative transfer (performance degradation after knowledge transfer)
  - Communication bottlenecks (slow or failed model updates)
  - Privacy breaches (unintended data exposure during transfer)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple federated averaging experiment with two agents on a classification task to verify basic knowledge sharing works
  2. Test continual learning with replay buffer on a sequence of related tasks to measure forgetting
  3. Deploy test-time adaptation on a pre-trained model with synthetic domain shift to evaluate runtime adaptation effectiveness
