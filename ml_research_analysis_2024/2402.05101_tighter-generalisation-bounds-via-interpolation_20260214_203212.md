# Tighter Generalisation Bounds via Interpolation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.05101
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05101
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Presents a framework for deriving PAC-Bayes generalisation bounds through interpolation between probability divergences, yielding tighter bounds than existing methods

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel framework for deriving PAC-Bayes generalisation bounds by interpolating between different probability divergences, including f-divergences and integral probability metrics. The authors propose two generic recipes using (f,Γ)-divergences that act as templates for obtaining tighter generalisation bounds. These bounds interpolate between KL divergence and Wasserstein distance, as well as bounds involving reverse KL and squared Hellinger divergences, achieving better performance than considering these divergences separately.

The work connects PAC-Bayes to Rademacher complexity and provides generalisation bounds for heavy-tailed stochastic differential equations. Through experiments on linear classifiers and neural networks, the authors demonstrate that interpolating divergences yields practical benefits, with the proposed method outperforming traditional approaches that use only KL or Wasserstein divergences in many cases. This interpolation approach offers a principled way to balance different complexity measures in PAC-Bayes bounds.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a framework for deriving PAC-Bayes generalisation bounds through interpolation between probability divergences. They introduce (f,Γ)-divergences as a unifying concept that encompasses both f-divergences and integral probability metrics. The paper proposes two generic recipes: one that interpolates between KL divergence and Wasserstein distance, and another that combines reverse KL and squared Hellinger divergences. These recipes serve as templates for constructing tighter bounds by balancing the trade-off between different complexity measures. The method leverages the flexibility of choosing appropriate divergence families and allows for more nuanced control over the bound's behavior, particularly in settings where traditional PAC-Bes bounds may be too loose.

## Key Results
- Derives novel PAC-Bayes bounds that interpolate between KL divergence and Wasserstein distance, achieving tighter generalisation guarantees
- Introduces bounds combining reverse KL and squared Hellinger divergences, offering improved performance over using these divergences separately
- Demonstrates practical benefits through experiments on linear classifiers and neural networks, where interpolated bounds outperform traditional KL or Wasserstein-based approaches
- Establishes connections between PAC-Bayes and Rademacher complexity, providing new insights into the relationship between these generalisation frameworks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging the flexibility of (f,Γ)-divergences to interpolate between different complexity measures. By combining the strengths of both f-divergences (which capture distributional differences through likelihood ratios) and integral probability metrics (which measure differences in expectations of function classes), the interpolated bounds can adapt to different data distributions and model complexities. This interpolation allows the bound to be more responsive to specific characteristics of the learning problem, avoiding the limitations of using a single divergence measure.

## Foundational Learning

- **PAC-Bayes bounds**: Generalization bounds for Bayesian learning methods that connect prior and posterior distributions
  - Why needed: Provides the theoretical foundation for deriving generalization guarantees in Bayesian settings
  - Quick check: Understand the basic KL-divergence based PAC-Bayes bound

- **f-divergences**: A family of divergences including KL, reverse KL, and Hellinger distance
  - Why needed: Forms one component of the interpolation framework, capturing distributional differences
  - Quick check: Verify understanding of how different f-divergences behave

- **Integral Probability Metrics (IPMs)**: Measures of distance between probability distributions based on function class expectations
  - Why needed: Provides the other component of the interpolation framework, offering geometric insights
  - Quick check: Understand Wasserstein distance as an example of IPM

- **Rademacher complexity**: A measure of the richness of a function class based on its ability to fit random noise
  - Why needed: Connected to PAC-Bayes bounds, providing alternative perspective on generalization
  - Quick check: Compare Rademacher complexity to VC dimension

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: (Prior/Posterior) -> (f-divergence + IPM interpolation) -> (Generalisation bound)
- **Critical path**: Data distribution → Choice of divergence family → Interpolation parameter → Final bound
- **Design tradeoffs**: Balancing tightness of bound vs computational complexity of divergence calculation
- **Failure signatures**: Poor interpolation choices leading to bounds that are too loose or too conservative
- **First experiments**: 1) Verify interpolated bounds on simple synthetic data with known properties, 2) Compare performance across different interpolation parameters on standard UCI datasets, 3) Test scalability on moderately-sized neural network architectures

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions beyond suggesting potential extensions of the framework to other divergence families and applications.

## Limitations
- Experimental validation primarily focuses on relatively simple models (linear classifiers) and standard architectures, with limited testing on modern deep learning models
- The practical benefits of divergence interpolation, while demonstrated, show variable magnitude of improvement across different datasets and architectures
- Theoretical claims about benefits for heavy-tailed stochastic differential equations remain largely unproven empirically, lacking extensive validation

## Confidence
- Theoretical soundness of interpolation framework: High
- Practical benefits demonstrated in experiments: Medium
- Scalability to modern deep learning architectures: Low
- Computational efficiency compared to standard methods: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test the interpolated bounds on a wider range of modern deep learning architectures, including convolutional and transformer-based models, to assess practical scalability
2. Conduct systematic ablation studies varying the interpolation parameter across different data regimes and model complexities
3. Compare wall-clock time and computational overhead of computing interpolated bounds versus standard PAC-Bayes bounds in practical training scenarios
