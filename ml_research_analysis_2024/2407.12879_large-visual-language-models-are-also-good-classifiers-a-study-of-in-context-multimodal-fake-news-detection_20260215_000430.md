# Large Visual-Language Models Are Also Good Classifiers: A Study of In-Context Multimodal Fake News Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.12879
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12879
- Authors: Ye Jiang; Yimin Wang
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: IMFND framework integrating CLIP predictions into LVLMs' prompts significantly outperforms standard ICL and smaller models in multimodal fake news detection, with GPT-4V-IMFND achieving up to 81.3% accuracy in few-shot settings.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates the effectiveness of large visual-language models (LVLMs) in multimodal fake news detection using in-context learning. The authors introduce the IMFND framework, which integrates predictions and probabilities from a smaller, well-trained multimodal model (CLIP) into prompts for LVLMs like CogVLM and GPT-4V. This approach enhances detection accuracy by directing LVLMs to focus on critical news segments. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that IMFND significantly outperforms traditional ICL and smaller models, with GPT-4V-IMFND achieving up to 81.3% accuracy in few-shot settings.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates LVLMs' effectiveness in multimodal fake news detection through in-context learning. The IMFND framework integrates predictions and probabilities from a smaller multimodal model (CLIP) into prompts for LVLMs (CogVLM, GPT-4V). The method involves training CLIP on three datasets (PolitiFact, GossipCop, Weibo), generating predictions and probabilities, enriching in-context examples with this information, and using LVLMs to make final predictions. The approach is evaluated using few-shot learning with 1, 3, and 5 samples per class, measuring accuracy and macro-F1 score.

## Key Results
- GPT-4V-IMFND achieves up to 81.3% accuracy in few-shot settings, significantly outperforming standard ICL and smaller models.
- IMFND framework demonstrates robustness and adaptability across diverse LVLMs (CogVLM, GPT-4V).
- LVLMs with IMFND show superior performance compared to smaller models like CLIP in multimodal fake news detection tasks.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LVLMs improve FND performance by integrating predictions and probabilities from a well-trained smaller model (CLIP) into their context.
- Mechanism: The IMFND framework enriches in-context examples and test inputs with predictions and corresponding probabilities from a smaller multimodal model. This directs LVLMs' focus towards news segments associated with higher probabilities, thereby improving their analytical accuracy.
- Core assumption: LVLMs can effectively utilize the predictions and probabilities from a smaller model to enhance their FND capabilities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "This paper initially assesses the FND capabilities of two notable LVLMs, CogVLM and GPT4V, in comparison to a smaller yet adeptly trained CLIP model in a zero-shot context. The findings demonstrate that LVLMs can attain performance competitive with that of the smaller model."
  - [section]: "The IMFND framework facilitates collaboration between LVLMs (i.e., GPT-4 [20] and CogVLM [21]) and a locally well-trained, smaller multimodal model (i.g., CLIP [22])."
  - [corpus]: "Found 25 related papers (using 8). Average neighbor FMR=0.446, average citations=0.0." (Weak corpus evidence, as average citations are 0.0)
- Break condition: If the smaller model's predictions and probabilities are inaccurate or misleading, LVLMs may generate incorrect predictions based on this information.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: In-context learning (ICL) enhances LVLMs' FND performance by utilizing their intrinsic knowledge and capabilities.
- Mechanism: Standard ICL integrates ground-truth labels with text input, encouraging LVLMs to focus on task-specific data. IMFND further improves this by incorporating predictions and probabilities from a smaller model, providing additional guidance for LVLMs.
- Core assumption: LVLMs can leverage their inherent global knowledge and multimodal capabilities to improve task-specific performance when provided with appropriate in-context information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Subsequently, we implement an in-context strategy, as shown in Figure 1(b), by concatenating the input text with ground-truth labels in the few-shot samples, thereby enriching the contextual framework for LVLMs. We find the in-context approach can stimulate the rationales reasoning abilities of LVLMs, and thereby enhance the FND performance, but is limited in scope and consistency."
  - [section]: "The constructed in-context examples serve to augment the LVLMs' comprehension of the interplay between the inputs, ground-truth labels, and the expert knowledge of the smaller model, allowing the LVLMs to confidently produce the final predictions."
  - [corpus]: "Found 25 related papers (using 8). Average neighbor FMR=0.446, average citations=0.0." (Weak corpus evidence, as average citations are 0.0)
- Break condition: If the in-context examples are not well-crafted or do not provide sufficient guidance, LVLMs may not effectively leverage their intrinsic knowledge and capabilities.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: LVLMs' multimodal capabilities and ability to process longer sequences enhance their FND performance compared to traditional LLMs and smaller models.
- Mechanism: LVLMs can process multimodal inputs (text and images) and handle longer sequences, allowing them to analyze more textual data and consider visual information in FND tasks.
- Core assumption: The multimodal aspects of fake news and longer sequence lengths provide more informative features for LVLMs compared to unimodal approaches.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Recent developments in large visual-language models (LVLMs), trained on extensive collections of text-image pairs covering a broad spectrum of global knowledge [11, 12], have shown a profound comprehension of cross-modal reasoning and demonstrated proficiency in identifying commonplace occurrences [13]."
  - [section]: "Additionally, LVLMs demonstrate the ability to process inputs with longer sequence lengths than SLMs, such as BERT, which is limited to 512 tokens. This capability, derived from leveraging the strengths of LLMs, results in superior performance in scenarios that involve datasets with lengthy documents."
  - [corpus]: "Found 25 related papers (using 8). Average neighbor FMR=0.446, average citations=0.0." (Weak corpus evidence, as average citations are 0.0)
- Break condition: If the multimodal inputs are not relevant or the longer sequences do not provide additional useful information, LVLMs may not demonstrate superior performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multimodal fusion
  - Why needed here: Multimodal fusion is crucial for combining text and image features to construct semantic representations for FND tasks.
  - Quick check question: How does the IMFND framework integrate text and image features from the smaller model to enhance LVLMs' FND performance?

- Concept: In-context learning (ICL)
  - Why needed here: ICL enables LVLMs to acquire the capability to perform downstream tasks through conditioning on prompts composed of input-output samples, without requiring explicit gradient updates.
  - Quick check question: How does the IMFND framework use ICL to enhance LVLMs' FND performance compared to standard ICL approaches?

- Concept: Zero-shot learning
  - Why needed here: Zero-shot learning is essential for evaluating the initial FND capabilities of LVLMs without any prior training on FND data.
  - Quick check question: How do the zero-shot performances of LVLMs compare to those of the smaller CLIP model in the IMFND framework?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  1. Smaller multimodal model (e.g., CLIP) - trained on FND data to generate predictions and probabilities.
  2. LVLMs (e.g., CogVLM, GPT-4V) - receive enriched in-context examples and test inputs from the smaller model.
  3. IMFND framework - integrates the smaller model's predictions and probabilities into LVLMs' context.

- Critical path:
  1. Train smaller multimodal model on FND data.
  2. Generate predictions and probabilities for in-context examples and test inputs using the smaller model.
  3. Enrich in-context examples and test inputs with the smaller model's predictions and probabilities.
  4. Prompt LVLMs with the enriched in-context examples and test inputs.
  5. Obtain final predictions from LVLMs.

- Design tradeoffs:
  1. Using a smaller, well-trained multimodal model vs. fine-tuning LVLMs directly.
  2. Incorporating predictions and probabilities vs. relying solely on ground-truth labels in in-context examples.
  3. Balancing the amount of information from the smaller model to avoid overwhelming LVLMs.

- Failure signatures:
  1. Inaccurate or misleading predictions and probabilities from the smaller model.
  2. LVLMs failing to effectively utilize the enriched in-context information.
  3. Overfitting to the smaller model's predictions, leading to poor generalization.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the zero-shot performances of LVLMs and the smaller CLIP model on FND tasks.
  2. Compare the standard ICL approach with the IMFND framework using different numbers of in-context examples.
  3. Assess the robustness and stability of the IMFND framework across multiple random seeds and few-shot settings.
