## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The survey clarifies terminology between model explainability, explanations, and explainable interfaces to reduce interdisciplinary confusion.
- Mechanism: By explicitly defining each concept's scope and stakeholders, the paper creates a shared mental model for researchers from AI, HCI, psychology, and domain-specific fields.
- Core assumption: Terminology confusion is a significant barrier to effective collaboration in XAI research.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "clarify the distinctions between these concepts: EI, explanations and model explainability, aiming to provide researchers and practitioners with a structured understanding."
  - [section 2.1] "we define the concept of an 'Explainable Interface' within the context of AI-enhanced HAT systems, distinguishing it from conventional software systems where explanations primarily serve as user guidance."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus focuses on related applications rather than terminology clarification.
- Break condition: If stakeholders from different disciplines continue to use inconsistent terminology despite the clarification.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The proposed evaluation framework ensures both technical efficiency and user-centric effectiveness in HAT systems.
- Mechanism: By dividing evaluation metrics into model performance-centered, human-centered, and teaming goal-oriented categories, the framework addresses the multifaceted nature of HAT success.
- Core assumption: Evaluating only one aspect (model performance or human satisfaction) is insufficient for HAT system assessment.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "our summarized evaluation framework for ongoing EI offers a holistic perspective, encompassing model performance, human-centered factors, and group task objectives."
  - [section 5] "Building on existing research, as shown in Figure 7, we propose dividing evaluation metrics into three categories: model performance-centered, human-centered, and those aligned with HAT goals."
  - [corpus] Moderate evidence - related surveys focus on individual aspects but not the integrated approach proposed here.
- Break condition: If one category consistently dominates or undermines the others in practical applications.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multi-modality in EIs enhances user understanding and interaction by leveraging natural human communication processes.
- Mechanism: Incorporating visual, auditory, tactile, and even olfactory modalities creates richer, more intuitive explanations that align with how humans naturally process information.
- Core assumption: Human sensory systems are underutilized in current EI designs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2.1] "Currently, explanations are primarily conveyed through visual and auditory means... Although touch, smell, and even taste are important components of the human sensory system, they have received less exploration."
  - [section 4.2.1] "research on information olfaction plays a key role in human responses, despite not being a primary information channel... These channels are especially beneficial in enhancing memory, emotion, and immersion."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus does not specifically address multi-modality in HAT contexts.
- Break condition: If additional modalities increase cognitive load without proportional gains in understanding.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Clear differentiation between model explainability, explanations, and explainable interfaces
  - Why needed here: These concepts are often conflated, leading to confusion about what aspects of XAI to focus on in different contexts.
  - Quick check question: What is the primary concern of model explainability versus explainable interfaces?

- Concept: Human-centered evaluation metrics in HAT
  - Why needed here: Traditional XAI evaluation focuses on technical metrics, but HAT success depends on human factors like trust and understanding.
  - Quick check question: Why is measuring human trust in an EI more complex than measuring model accuracy?

- Concept: Variable autonomy levels and their implications for EI design
  - Why needed here: Different autonomy levels require different types of explanations and interface designs.
  - Quick check question: How does the role of an EI differ between Level 3 and Level 5 autonomous vehicles?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  User Interface Layer: Functional components + Explainable Interface components
  Functional Module: Perception, localization, prediction, decision, action
  Support Systems: Situation awareness, behavior recognition, mental/cognitive behavior inference, multimodal sensors
  Human-Autonomy Loop: Continuous feedback for mutual understanding and trust

- Critical path:
  1. User behavior/intention recognition
  2. Explanation generation based on recognized context
  3. Explanation presentation through appropriate modality
  4. User feedback collection and system adaptation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Real-time explanation generation vs. explanation depth and accuracy
  - Customization/personalization vs. development complexity
  - Multimodal presentation vs. cognitive load

- Failure signatures:
  - High cognitive load indicated by user disengagement or errors
  - Low trust despite high system accuracy
  - Poor task performance despite good model metrics

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare explanation effectiveness between different autonomy levels (Level 2 vs. Level 4 surgical robots)
  2. Test multimodal explanation presentation (visual + auditory vs. visual only) in autonomous vehicle takeover scenarios
  3. Evaluate personalized vs. generic explanations in CDSS for different user expertise levels (doctors vs. patients)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the optimal real-time mechanisms for generating and delivering explanations in high-stakes HAT scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the challenge of "timely explanation generation" in high-stakes, real-time HAT settings, noting the need for explanations that foster appropriate trust and assist in decision-making.
- Why unresolved: Real-time explanation generation is complex due to the need to balance speed, accuracy, and comprehensibility, especially in dynamic and unpredictable environments. The paper identifies this as a challenge but does not provide specific solutions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing different real-time explanation generation methods in HAT systems, focusing on their effectiveness in fostering trust and aiding decision-making under time constraints.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can personalized and adaptive EI designs be effectively implemented to accommodate individual differences in cognitive abilities and expertise levels?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the challenge of "personalized and adaptive design" in EI, emphasizing the need to tailor interfaces to users' varying cognitive abilities and expertise levels.
- Why unresolved: While the paper recognizes the importance of personalization, it does not delve into specific methodologies for modeling human behavior dynamics or adjusting EIs accordingly. This remains an open area for research.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of adaptive EI frameworks that dynamically adjust based on real-time user feedback and performance metrics, demonstrating improved understanding and trust.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the most effective evaluation methods for assessing the impact of EIs on HAT system performance and user experience?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the challenge of "hybrid dynamic evaluation," emphasizing the need for a balanced approach that assesses model performance, human-centered evaluation, and overall HAT system performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the need for comprehensive evaluation but does not provide a definitive framework or methodology for integrating various evaluation methods. This remains a critical area for future research.
- What evidence would resolve it: A validated evaluation framework that combines quantitative metrics (e.g., model accuracy, task completion time) with qualitative methods (e.g., user feedback, surveys) and affective computing techniques, demonstrating its effectiveness in assessing EI impact on HAT.

## Limitations

- Terminology clarification efforts may not overcome entrenched disciplinary silos
- Proposed evaluation framework lacks empirical validation across diverse HAT contexts
- Multi-modality implementation faces substantial challenges with limited exploration of non-visual/auditory channels
- Real-time explanation generation remains largely theoretical with few validated approaches

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- The fundamental need for EI in HAT systems to support trust and mutual understanding
- The distinction between model explainability, explanations, and explainable interfaces as a useful conceptual framework
- The identification of real-time explanation generation and personalization as key technical challenges

**Medium Confidence:**
- The proposed three-category evaluation framework (model performance, human-centered, teaming goals)
- The assertion that multimodal explanations enhance user understanding
- The framework's applicability across different autonomy levels and domains

**Low Confidence:**

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical Validation of the Three-Category Evaluation Framework**: Conduct a systematic review of existing HAT evaluations to assess whether the proposed framework captures the full spectrum of evaluation needs, and test its applicability across at least three different HAT domains (e.g., autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, military operations).

2. **Multi-Modal Explanation Effectiveness Study**: Design and execute a controlled experiment comparing explanation effectiveness across different modality combinations (visual-only, visual+auditory, visual+auditory+tactile) in a realistic HAT scenario, measuring both comprehension accuracy and cognitive load.

3. **Real-Time Explanation Generation Benchmark**: Develop a standardized benchmark for evaluating real-time explanation generation algorithms, including metrics for explanation latency, accuracy, and user comprehension, then test multiple approaches across different HAT system types and autonomy levels.
