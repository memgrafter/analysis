# Exploring Accuracy-Fairness Trade-off in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.14500
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14500
- Reference count: 17
- Authors address balancing accuracy and fairness in LLMs through evolutionary learning

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of balancing accuracy and fairness in large language models by proposing FaPareto, a multi-objective evolutionary learning framework. The framework evolves populations of LLMs to optimize both accuracy and fairness simultaneously, producing a diverse set of Pareto-optimal trade-offs. Experiments on the BiasBios dataset demonstrate that FaPareto effectively mitigates bias while maintaining or improving accuracy, outperforming six state-of-the-art methods.

## Method Summary
FaPareto employs a multi-objective evolutionary learning framework that fine-tunes populations of pre-trained LLMs through iterative cycles. The process involves fine-tuning models, evaluating them on both accuracy and fairness metrics, and using Pareto selection to maintain a diverse set of models that balance these conflicting objectives. The framework uses fairness-guided diversity generation with LLM merge methods for crossover and Gaussian noise for mutation, creating offspring that inherit parent strengths while exploring new possibilities. This approach produces a Pareto-optimal set of models representing different accuracy-fairness trade-offs.

## Key Results
- FaPareto outperforms six state-of-the-art methods on the BiasBios dataset for occupation classification
- The framework achieves a strong negative correlation (-0.81) between error and fairness metric ∆TPR across the Pareto front
- Experiments demonstrate lower error rates while maintaining or improving fairness compared to baseline approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The framework achieves Pareto-optimal trade-offs between accuracy and fairness by simultaneously evolving a population of models using multi-objective evolutionary learning.
- Mechanism: The MOEL framework iteratively fine-tunes LLMs, evaluates them on both accuracy and fairness metrics, and uses a Pareto selection process to maintain a diverse set of models that balance these conflicting objectives.
- Core assumption: Accuracy and fairness are inherently conflicting objectives that cannot be optimized simultaneously without trade-offs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our MOEL framework enables the simultaneous optimisation of both accuracy and fairness metrics, resulting in a Pareto-optimal set of LLMs."
  - [section 3.1] "min F(θ) = {f1(θ), . . . , fn(θ)}T , (1) where θ ∈ ΘLLM represents the parameters of the model, and ΘLLM is the parameter space."
- Break condition: If the correlation between accuracy and fairness becomes non-negative, the fundamental assumption of conflicting objectives fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The fairness-guided diversity generation strategy improves the transfer of parent model strengths to offspring models in the LLM context.
- Mechanism: The framework uses LLM merge methods as crossover and Gaussian noise as mutation to create diverse offspring that inherit valuable traits while exploring new possibilities.
- Core assumption: Standard crossover and mutation operators designed for simple MLPs do not effectively transfer knowledge when applied to complex LLMs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3] "We propose FGDG, a framework designed to leverage the characteristics of LLMs and incorporate advanced techniques, ensuring that offspring models not only inherit valuable traits from their parent models but also explore new and improved possibilities."
  - [section 3.3] "LLM merge methods (Wortsman et al., 2022; Ilharco et al., 2023; Yadav et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024) are used as the crossover strategy in FGDG."
- Break condition: If offspring models consistently underperform both parents, the crossover/mutation strategy needs revision.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The framework provides decision-makers with a diverse set of trade-offs that can adapt to changing requirements without manual parameter tuning.
- Mechanism: By maintaining a Pareto front throughout the evolutionary process, the framework automatically discovers multiple optimal solutions representing different accuracy-fairness balances.
- Core assumption: Real-world applications require different trade-offs between accuracy and fairness based on context, regulations, or user demographics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our MOEL framework enables the simultaneous optimisation of both accuracy and fairness metrics, resulting in a Pareto-optimal set of LLMs."
  - [section 4.2] "This flexibility allows stakeholders to choose models that best fit their specific needs and contexts, promoting more equitable and effective deployment of LLMs across various applications."
- Break condition: If stakeholders consistently select only one point from the Pareto front regardless of context, the diversity may be unnecessary.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multi-objective optimization and Pareto optimality
  - Why needed here: The core problem involves optimizing two conflicting objectives (accuracy and fairness) simultaneously, requiring understanding of Pareto fronts and trade-off analysis.
  - Quick check question: What is the mathematical definition of a Pareto-optimal solution in the context of this paper?

- Concept: Evolutionary algorithms and their application to neural network optimization
  - Why needed here: The framework uses evolutionary strategies to evolve populations of LLMs, requiring understanding of selection, crossover, mutation, and fitness evaluation in this context.
  - Quick check question: How does the mating pool selection process in Algorithm 1 ensure that only promising models contribute to the next generation?

- Concept: Fairness metrics in machine learning, particularly statistical parity and equal opportunity
  - Why needed here: The framework evaluates fairness using metrics like ∆TPR, requiring understanding of how different fairness definitions impact model evaluation and selection.
  - Quick check question: How is ∆TPR calculated and what does it measure in the context of occupation classification?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Pre-trained LLMs → Fine-tuning → Objective Evaluation → Fitness Evaluation → Pareto Selection → Archive
- Critical path: Pre-trained LLMs → Fine-tuning → Objective Evaluation → Fitness Evaluation → Pareto Selection → Archive
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Population size vs. computational cost: Larger populations provide more diversity but increase training time
  - Generation limit vs. convergence quality: More generations typically improve results but with diminishing returns
  - Crossover method selection: Different merge strategies may yield different performance characteristics
- Failure signatures:
  - All models converge to similar points on the Pareto front (lack of diversity)
  - Fitness values plateau early in evolution (local optima or insufficient exploration)
  - Correlation between objectives becomes positive (fundamental assumption violated)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run the framework with default parameters on the BiasBios dataset and verify that the HV metric increases over generations
  2. Plot the final Pareto front and verify that the correlation between error and ∆TPR is negative
  3. Compare the framework's performance against one baseline method (e.g., vanilla training) to verify improvement

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the FaPareto framework be adapted to handle a broader range of LLMs beyond BERT-Base-Uncased, such as GPT or T5 models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the framework was tested using BERT-Base-Uncased and suggests future work to test it on a broader range of LLMs.
- Why unresolved: The current framework is tailored to BERT-Base-Uncased, and its applicability to other LLM architectures is not explored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the framework on different LLM architectures and comparing performance metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the computational costs and scalability challenges of applying the FaPareto framework to large-scale datasets or more complex tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the need for balancing accuracy and fairness but does not address the computational demands or scalability issues.
- Why unresolved: The framework's performance on large-scale datasets or complex tasks is not evaluated, leaving questions about its practical deployment.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking the framework on large datasets and complex tasks to assess computational efficiency and scalability.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of fairness metrics impact the trade-offs between accuracy and fairness in the FaPareto framework?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses ∆TPR as a fairness metric and mentions that different metrics could be used, but does not explore the impact of metric choice.
- Why unresolved: The influence of different fairness metrics on the trade-offs is not studied, which could affect the framework's adaptability to various fairness concerns.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimenting with different fairness metrics and analyzing their impact on the accuracy-fairness trade-off.

## Limitations

- The framework's effectiveness relies on the assumption that accuracy and fairness are fundamentally conflicting objectives, which may not hold across all tasks or fairness definitions
- The evaluation on a single binary classification task (BiasBios teacher/surgeon) limits generalizability to more complex multi-class or multi-label scenarios
- The computational cost of evolving populations of large language models remains a practical barrier to widespread adoption

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The fundamental premise that multi-objective evolutionary learning can produce Pareto-optimal trade-offs between accuracy and fairness is well-established in the literature. The negative correlation (-0.81) between error and ∆TPR across the Pareto front provides strong empirical support for the framework's core mechanism.

**Medium Confidence**: The specific implementation details of the fairness-guided diversity generation strategy, particularly the choice of LLM merge methods for crossover, are described conceptually but lack full implementation specifics that would enable perfect reproducibility.

**Low Confidence**: The claim that this approach significantly outperforms six state-of-the-art methods would require careful examination of the baseline implementations and experimental conditions to verify, as performance differences in this domain can be sensitive to hyperparameter choices and evaluation protocols.

## Next Checks

1. **Baseline Comparison Verification**: Re-implement and run the six state-of-the-art methods mentioned in the paper under identical experimental conditions (same dataset splits, preprocessing, and evaluation metrics) to independently verify the claimed performance improvements of FaPareto.

2. **Generalization Testing**: Apply the framework to a different bias mitigation task (e.g., sentiment analysis with demographic attributes) to test whether the negative correlation between accuracy and fairness, and the Pareto-optimal trade-offs, generalize beyond the BiasBios occupation classification task.

3. **Ablation Study**: Conduct systematic ablation studies removing key components (FGDG, specific crossover methods, or the Pareto selection mechanism) to quantify their individual contributions to the framework's performance and validate the claimed importance of each mechanism.
