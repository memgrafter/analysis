# Application of NotebookLM, a Large Language Model with Retrieval-Augmented Generation, for Lung Cancer Staging

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.10869
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10869
- Reference count: 19
- NotebookLM achieved 86% diagnostic accuracy for TNM classifications, significantly outperforming GPT-4o (39% with REK, 25% without)

## Executive Summary
This study evaluated the performance of NotebookLM, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) large language model, for lung cancer staging compared to GPT-4o. Using 100 fictional lung cancer cases based on CT findings, NotebookLM achieved 86% diagnostic accuracy for TNM classifications, significantly outperforming GPT-4o (39% with REK, 25% without). NotebookLM also demonstrated 95% accuracy in searching reference locations within the provided lung cancer staging guideline. The RAG capability allowed NotebookLM to generate responses based solely on reliable external knowledge, with explicit citation of source locations, enabling radiologists to efficiently evaluate response reliability and detect potential hallucinations. These results highlight NotebookLM's potential as a reliable tool for assisting radiologists in image diagnosis.

## Method Summary
The study compared NotebookLM (a RAG-LLM) against GPT-4o for lung cancer staging using 100 fictional lung cancer cases with CT findings. The Japan lung cancer staging guideline was provided as a reference external knowledge (REK) document to both models. For each case, models were tasked with determining TNM classifications. NotebookLM's performance was measured against ground truth classifications, with additional evaluation of its ability to correctly identify reference locations in the REK document. GPT-4o was tested both with and without access to the REK to isolate the impact of retrieval-augmented generation.

## Key Results
- NotebookLM achieved 86% diagnostic accuracy for TNM classifications, significantly outperforming GPT-4o (39% with REK, 25% without)
- NotebookLM demonstrated 95% accuracy in searching reference locations within the provided lung cancer staging guideline
- The RAG capability enabled NotebookLM to generate responses based solely on reliable external knowledge with explicit citation of source locations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
NotebookLM leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to combine the language understanding capabilities of large language models with access to authoritative external knowledge sources. When presented with a lung cancer case, the RAG system first retrieves relevant information from the staging guideline, then generates responses grounded in that retrieved content. This approach reduces hallucinations and improves accuracy by ensuring responses are based on verified medical guidelines rather than the model's internal knowledge alone.

## Foundational Learning
- **RAG-LLM**: Retrieval-augmented generation in large language models combines information retrieval with text generation, allowing models to access and cite external knowledge sources. Why needed: Essential for medical applications where accuracy and source attribution are critical. Quick check: Verify model responses include cited references to source documents.
- **TNM Classification**: The tumor-node-metastasis system for classifying cancer stages based on tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis. Why needed: Standard framework for cancer staging that LLMs must correctly interpret. Quick check: Confirm TNM classifications match established medical guidelines.
- **External Knowledge Integration**: Process of incorporating authoritative reference documents into LLM workflows. Why needed: Ensures responses are based on current medical guidelines rather than potentially outdated training data. Quick check: Test model's ability to correctly retrieve and apply information from reference documents.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
User Input -> RAG System -> Retrieval Engine -> Reference Document -> Response Generator -> Output with Citations

### Critical Path
The critical path for accurate lung cancer staging is: Case Description → Retrieval of Relevant Staging Rules → Application of Rules to Case → Generation of TNM Classification with Citations.

### Design Tradeoffs
The RAG approach trades computational overhead (retrieval step) for improved accuracy and reduced hallucinations. While this adds latency compared to direct generation, the benefit of verifiable, guideline-based responses outweighs the performance cost in medical applications where accuracy is paramount.

### Failure Signatures
- Incorrect numerical comparisons in T factor classification (e.g., confusing tumor size thresholds)
- Failure to retrieve relevant sections from the staging guideline
- Citation errors where sources don't match the content being cited
- Over-reliance on internal knowledge when guideline information exists

### 3 First Experiments
1. Test NotebookLM's ability to correctly retrieve specific staging rules from the guideline using targeted queries
2. Evaluate how model performance changes when guideline sections are removed or modified
3. Measure the impact of different prompt formulations on retrieval accuracy and response quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
**Open Question 1:** How would NotebookLM perform on real clinical lung cancer CT data compared to its performance on fictional cases? The study only used fictional cases, which may not capture the complexity and variability of real clinical data.

**Open Question 2:** Can the numerical reasoning errors observed in NotebookLM (and GPT-4o) be mitigated through architectural improvements or post-processing techniques? The study identifies numerical comparison mistakes as a common LLM issue but doesn't explore solutions.

**Open Question 3:** How generalizable are the results to other RAG-equipped LLMs beyond NotebookLM, and what specific features of NotebookLM contribute to its superior performance? The authors state that results may not generalize to all RAG-LLMs and recommend further validation.

## Limitations
- Use of fictional rather than real patient cases, which may not fully capture actual clinical complexity
- Ground truth TNM classifications generated by two radiologists without reported inter-rater reliability metrics
- Comparison between NotebookLM and GPT-4o constrained by using GPT-4o with REK as experimental condition
- Evaluation limited to one specific task (lung cancer staging) and one imaging modality (CT)

## Confidence
- High confidence in NotebookLM's superior performance compared to GPT-4o with REK (86% vs 39%)
- Medium confidence in NotebookLM's search accuracy (95%) due to potential ambiguity in what constitutes "accurate" reference location identification
- Low confidence in generalizability to real-world clinical settings given use of fictional cases

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the study using real patient cases with confirmed TNM classifications from multiple independent radiologists to assess inter-rater reliability
2. Test NotebookLM's performance on other cancer types and imaging modalities (e.g., breast cancer mammography, colorectal cancer colonoscopy) to evaluate generalizability
3. Conduct a head-to-head comparison of NotebookLM versus GPT-4o without any REK to establish baseline performance differences between the two models
