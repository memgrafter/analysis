# Injecting Undetectable Backdoors in Obfuscated Neural Networks and Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.05660
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05660
- Reference count: 18
- The paper develops a strategy to plant undetectable backdoors in obfuscated neural networks using cryptographic techniques.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the threat of undetectable backdoors in machine learning models, particularly those developed by external expert firms. The authors develop a general strategy to plant backdoors in obfuscated neural networks, ensuring that even with access to the model's weights and architecture, the backdoor remains undetectable. The approach leverages cryptographic techniques such as pseudorandom generators, digital signatures, and indistinguishability obfuscation. The results demonstrate the existence of a backdoor attack for artificial neural networks that is both undetectable and non-replicable under standard cryptographic assumptions. Additionally, the paper extends these findings to language models by introducing the notion of undetectable backdoors and utilizing steganographic functions.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a general strategy to plant backdoors in obfuscated neural networks by leveraging cryptographic techniques. The approach uses pseudorandom generators (PRGs) to generate a public key from a secret key, digital signatures to authenticate the trigger, and indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) to hide the backdoor implementation. The backdoor is designed to be undetectable by embedding the trigger authentication within the obfuscated model, making it impossible to distinguish between benign and malicious inputs without the secret key. The authors prove that their backdoor attack is both undetectable and non-replicable under standard cryptographic assumptions, and they extend this notion to language models using steganographic functions.

## Key Results
- The paper demonstrates the existence of undetectable backdoor attacks in obfuscated neural networks using cryptographic techniques.
- The backdoor attack is proven to be non-replicable under standard cryptographic assumptions, ensuring that the attack cannot be easily copied or replicated.
- The authors extend the notion of undetectable backdoors to language models, introducing the use of steganographic functions for trigger activation.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by leveraging cryptographic techniques to embed the backdoor within the model's architecture in a way that is computationally indistinguishable from the original model. The use of PRGs, digital signatures, and iO ensures that the backdoor remains hidden and that the trigger is authenticated without revealing the secret key. This approach makes it impossible to detect the backdoor by simply examining the model's weights or architecture, as the malicious behavior is only activated when the correct trigger is presented.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Indistinguishability Obfuscation (iO)** - Why needed: To hide the implementation of the backdoor within the model. Quick check: Verify that the obfuscated circuit is computationally indistinguishable from the original circuit.
2. **Pseudorandom Generators (PRGs)** - Why needed: To generate a public key from a secret key for trigger authentication. Quick check: Confirm that the output of the PRG is computationally indistinguishable from a truly random string.
3. **Digital Signatures** - Why needed: To authenticate the trigger without revealing the secret key. Quick check: Ensure that the signature verification process is secure and cannot be forged without the secret key.
4. **Steganography** - Why needed: To embed the trigger in language models without altering the output distribution. Quick check: Verify that the steganographic encoding is undetectable and does not affect the model's performance on benign inputs.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Secret Key -> PRG -> Public Key -> iO -> Obfuscated Model -> Backdoor Activation

**Critical Path:**
The critical path involves generating the public key from the secret key using a PRG, obfuscating the model using iO, and embedding the trigger authentication within the obfuscated model. The backdoor is activated only when the correct trigger is presented, which is authenticated using the public key.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Security vs. Performance: The use of iO and other cryptographic techniques may introduce computational overhead, potentially impacting the model's performance.
- Robustness vs. Covertness: Ensuring that the backdoor is undetectable may require additional complexity, which could affect the model's robustness to adversarial attacks.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Detection of the backdoor through model inspection or analysis of the model's behavior on specific inputs.
- Inability to activate the backdoor due to incorrect trigger generation or authentication failure.
- Performance degradation of the model due to the computational overhead of the obfuscation and backdoor implementation.

**First Experiments:**
1. Implement the backdoor injection method on a small-scale neural network and evaluate its undetectability using existing backdoor detection techniques.
2. Test the non-replicability of the backdoor by attempting to replicate the attack without access to the secret key.
3. Evaluate the performance impact of the obfuscation and backdoor implementation on the model's accuracy and inference time.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Can backdoor attacks be made robust against proposed defenses such as input noise addition or typo correction?
- Basis in paper: The paper discusses potential defenses and states that while fixes exist for specific attacks, modified attacks could bypass those fixes, indicating an ongoing arms race.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on theoretical vulnerabilities rather than practical implementation details of attacks and defenses, leaving the effectiveness of countermeasures untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies demonstrating the success of backdoor attacks against various defense mechanisms, or conversely, showing the effectiveness of specific defenses in mitigating such attacks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we extend the notion of non-replicability to language models in a way that ensures the hidden message remains covert?
- Basis in paper: The paper notes that the definition of non-replicability does not immediately apply to language models and raises the question of how to generalize it.
- Why unresolved: The discrete nature of language models and the use of steganography for trigger activation introduce complexities not present in neural network backdoors, making it challenging to define and enforce non-replicability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and analysis of formal definitions of non-replicability for language models, along with empirical studies demonstrating the covertness of hidden messages under various conditions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the practical implications of undetectable backdoors in real-world applications of machine learning models, particularly in high-stakes domains like healthcare and finance?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions the potential risks of undetectable backdoors in domains such as finance and healthcare, where they could lead to data breaches, response manipulation, or privacy violations.
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides a theoretical framework for undetectable backdoors, it does not explore the specific consequences and ethical considerations of such attacks in real-world scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies or simulations of backdoor attacks in high-stakes applications, along with analyses of their potential impact on individuals and society, would help assess the practical implications and inform policy decisions.

## Limitations
- The paper is primarily theoretical and does not provide empirical validation or implementation details of the backdoor attacks.
- The security guarantees rely on the assumption of perfect indistinguishability obfuscation, which remains an aspirational goal in cryptography.
- The paper does not explore the practical implications and ethical considerations of undetectable backdoors in real-world applications.

## Confidence
- Theoretical claims: High
- Practical applicability: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Implement the proposed backdoor injection method on a small-scale neural network to test the practical feasibility of the approach.
2. Evaluate the effectiveness of existing backdoor detection methods against these theoretically undetectable backdoors.
3. Assess the computational overhead and performance impact of the obfuscation and backdoor injection process in practice.
