# Scalable Online Exploration via Coverability

## Quick Facts

- One-line primary result: Introduces L1-Coverage objective for efficient exploration in high-dimensional RL domains

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a new exploration objective called L1-Coverage that enables efficient exploration in high-dimensional reinforcement learning domains. The authors develop this objective as part of a framework for exploration objectives, showing it generalizes previous approaches while enabling computationally efficient planning and exploration. L1-Coverage is associated with a structural parameter called L1-Coverability, which bounds the intrinsic difficulty of exploration and enables sample-efficient learning.

The paper provides theoretical guarantees showing that L1-Coverability is bounded for various MDP classes including Block and Low-Rank MDPs, making it a powerful tool for efficient exploration. The authors propose both model-based and model-free algorithms for online exploration, which are the first computationally efficient methods for reward-free exploration in MDPs with low coverability. Empirical results on the MountainCar environment demonstrate that L1-Coverage effectively drives policy optimization algorithms to explore the state space widely.

## Method Summary
The method introduces L1-Coverage as an exploration objective that encourages a policy ensemble to explore the state space by focusing on the relative probability of visiting states. The objective is optimized through relaxations that reduce to standard policy optimization problems, allowing flexible integration with existing methods like policy gradient and Q-learning. For online exploration, the paper proposes both model-based and model-free algorithms that efficiently construct policy covers without reward information. The algorithms achieve sample-efficient exploration with polynomial complexity in the L1-Coverability parameter, enabling downstream learning tasks.

## Key Results
- L1-Coverage objective enables efficient exploration by focusing on relative state occupancy rather than exhaustive coverage
- L1-Coverability parameter is bounded for standard MDP classes, enabling sample-efficient exploration
- First computationally efficient methods for reward-free exploration in MDPs with low coverability
- Empirical results show L1-Coverage drives wide exploration in MountainCar environment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: L1-Coverage provides efficient exploration by encouraging a policy ensemble to explore the state space in an average-case sense, discounting hard-to-reach states.
- Mechanism: The L1-Coverage objective is defined using the ratio of occupancy measures between any individual policy and the policy ensemble. This focuses exploration on states that are relatively underrepresented by the ensemble compared to individual policies, avoiding exhaustive coverage of rarely visited states.
- Core assumption: The ratio-based measure effectively captures the relative coverage of the policy ensemble without requiring explicit reachability assumptions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "L1-Coverage objective encourages a policy ensemble to explore the state space effectively... only considers the relative probability of visiting states... is fundamentally different from 'tabular' objectives..."
  - [section]: "L1-Coverage only considers the relative probability of visiting states (that is, the ratio of occupancies)... essential to drive exploration in large state spaces."
  - [corpus]: Weak. No direct mention of L1-Coverage in related papers.
- Break condition: If the MDP has regions with extremely low reachability for all policies, the relative coverage measure may fail to incentivize exploration of those regions.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: L1-Coverage is associated with L1-Coverability, a structural parameter that bounds the intrinsic difficulty of exploration and enables sample-efficient reinforcement learning.
- Mechanism: L1-Coverability is the optimal value of the L1-Coverage objective. It is bounded by L∞-Coverability, which is a known structural parameter for MDP classes like Block and Low-Rank MDPs. This boundedness ensures that the sample complexity of downstream learning scales with problem-dependent constants rather than state space size.
- Core assumption: The relationship between L1-Coverability and L∞-Coverability holds, allowing L1-Coverability to inherit the boundedness properties of L∞-Coverability.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "L1-Coverage is associated with a structural parameter, L1-Coverability, which reflects the intrinsic statistical difficulty of the underlying MDP, subsuming Block and Low-Rank MDPs."
  - [section]: "L1-Coverability... is bounded for standard MDP classes of interest... we show that L1-Coverability is indeed bounded by C_M^∞."
  - [corpus]: Weak. No direct mention of coverability parameters in related papers.
- Break condition: If the MDP does not belong to a class with bounded L∞-Coverability, L1-Coverability may not be bounded, leading to high sample complexity.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: L1-Coverage enables efficient planning and exploration through relaxations that reduce to standard policy optimization.
- Mechanism: The paper provides relaxations of the L1-Coverage objective (L∞-Coverability relaxation and Pushforward Coverability relaxation) that are directly amenable to optimization via standard reward-driven policy optimization methods. This allows flexible integration with existing pipelines.
- Core assumption: The relaxations provide a good approximation to the true L1-Coverage objective while being computationally tractable.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "For a known MDP, optimizing L1-Coverage efficiently reduces to standard policy optimization, allowing flexible integration with off-the-shelf methods such as policy gradient and Q-learning approaches."
  - [section]: "To address this issue, this section provides two relaxations... that are directly amenable to optimization (via reduction to standard reward-driven policy optimization)..."
  - [corpus]: Weak. No direct mention of relaxation techniques in related papers.
- Break condition: If the relaxation approximation factor is too large, the resulting policy cover may not provide sufficient coverage for efficient downstream learning.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: L1-Coverage objective -> L1-Coverability parameter -> Relaxations (L∞-Coverability, Pushforward Coverability) -> Policy optimization algorithms -> Policy covers -> Downstream learning

- Critical path:
  1. Define the L1-Coverage objective for a given MDP and policy class
  2. Compute or bound the L1-Coverability parameter for the MDP
  3. Choose an appropriate relaxation of L1-Coverage based on available information
  4. Optimize the relaxation using standard policy optimization methods
  5. Use the resulting policy cover for downstream learning tasks

- Design tradeoffs:
  - L1-Coverage vs. other exploration objectives: L1-Coverage provides intrinsic complexity control and enables efficient planning and exploration, but may be more complex to implement than simpler objectives like entropy maximization
  - L∞-Coverability vs. Pushforward Coverability relaxation: L∞-Coverability relaxation provides tighter bounds but requires access to a covering distribution, while Pushforward Coverability relaxation is more general but may lead to looser bounds
  - Planning vs. exploration: Efficient planning requires knowledge of the MDP, while efficient exploration must discover the MDP online

- Failure signatures:
  - High L1-Coverability value: Indicates that the MDP is intrinsically difficult to explore, leading to high sample complexity for downstream learning
  - Poor approximation of L1-Coverage relaxations: Results in policy covers that do not provide sufficient coverage for efficient downstream learning
  - Infeasibility of optimization problems: Indicates that the chosen relaxation is too restrictive or the policy class is too small

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement the L1-Coverage objective and compare its performance to entropy maximization on a simple tabular MDP
  2. Evaluate the sample complexity of downstream learning using policy covers computed with L1-Coverage on a Block MDP
  3. Compare the efficiency of the L∞-Coverability and Pushforward Coverability relaxations for a given MDP

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the L1-Coverage objective be further generalized while still allowing for computationally efficient optimization?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that it is natural to consider notions of coverage that reflect the structure of a value function class for reward-driven RL.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the L1-Coverage objective and its applications, but does not explore other potential generalizations of the objective.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and analyzing new exploration objectives that generalize L1-Coverage while maintaining computational efficiency would provide evidence.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the weakest representation conditions under which coverability leads to computationally efficient online reinforcement learning guarantees?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses weight function realizability as a sufficient condition for sample-efficient exploration, but suggests that it may be possible to relax this assumption further.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a complete characterization of the representation conditions necessary for efficient exploration under coverability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Identifying and proving sufficient representation conditions that are weaker than weight function realizability would provide evidence.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the L1-Coverage objective be effectively integrated with existing deep reinforcement learning methods?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the subroutine PolicyOptimization can be implemented using off-the-shelf deep RL methods (e.g., PPO or SAC).
- Why unresolved: The paper only provides preliminary experimental results using policy gradient methods and does not explore the integration of L1-Coverage with other deep RL methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting large-scale empirical evaluations of L1-Coverage integrated with various deep RL methods would provide evidence.

## Limitations
- The effectiveness of L1-Coverage in high-dimensional, continuous state spaces remains to be demonstrated beyond the MountainCar environment
- The boundedness of L1-Coverability is proven only for specific MDP classes (Block and Low-Rank MDPs), with conditions for other classes not fully characterized
- The approximation quality of the proposed relaxations may be loose in practice, potentially limiting the quality of resulting policy covers

## Confidence
- High confidence: The general framework of exploration objectives and the relationship between L1-Coverage and L1-Coverability
- Medium confidence: The boundedness of L1-Coverability for Block and Low-Rank MDPs, and the efficiency of the proposed algorithms
- Low confidence: The effectiveness of L1-Coverage in high-dimensional, continuous state spaces and the quality of the relaxation approximations

## Next Checks
1. Characterize the conditions under which L1-Coverability is bounded for different MDP classes, beyond Block and Low-Rank MDPs
2. Evaluate the performance of L1-Coverage in high-dimensional, continuous state spaces using environments with more complex dynamics and larger state spaces
3. Analyze the approximation quality of the L∞-Coverability and Pushforward Coverability relaxations for a range of MDPs, and develop methods to tighten the approximations when necessary
