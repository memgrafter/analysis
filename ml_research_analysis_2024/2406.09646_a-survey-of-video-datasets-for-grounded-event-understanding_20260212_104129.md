# A Survey of Video Datasets for Grounded Event Understanding

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.09646
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09646
- Authors: Kate Sanders; Benjamin Van Durme
- Reference count: 40
- This paper surveys 105 video datasets for grounded event understanding, identifying critical gaps in current benchmarks that focus on specialized tasks rather than general event comprehension.

## Executive Summary
This comprehensive survey analyzes 105 video datasets through three lenses - content, presentation, and structure - to understand the state of video event understanding research. The authors find that most datasets focus on specialized downstream tasks like retrieval or question-answering rather than general event understanding, with events that are typically simpler than those in text-based benchmarks. They propose a taxonomy of video event structures and assess three emerging video event extraction tasks (MMEE, VidSRL, MEHE), identifying their respective strengths and limitations. The survey reveals that while substantial video event understanding resources exist, they lack the diversity and complexity needed for robust, generalizable models.

## Method Summary
The authors systematically analyze 105 video datasets from the past decade that require event understanding capability. They construct a framework examining datasets across three dimensions: (1) event content - what events are presented, their domain, quantity, multiplicity, and instantiation; (2) event presentation - how events are filmed, edited, and presented across different modalities; and (3) event structure - how events are interpreted, including their semantic organization, temporal aspects, and hierarchical relationships. The survey identifies task types, analyzes event structures using formal semantic annotations, and evaluates three emerging video event extraction tasks against the surveyed datasets to identify gaps and opportunities for future research.

## Key Results
- Video event understanding benchmarks predominantly focus on specialized downstream tasks rather than general event comprehension, creating a fundamental research gap.
- Most surveyed datasets contain semantically simpler events than text-based event extraction benchmarks, with limited diversity in event types and filming methods.
- Current video event extraction tasks (MMEE, VidSRL, MEHE) each have distinct limitations that could be addressed through a unified approach combining their strengths.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The survey's framework of analyzing video datasets through content, presentation, and structure lenses reveals critical gaps in current event understanding benchmarks.
- Mechanism: By systematically categorizing 105 video datasets across three orthogonal dimensions (event content, presentation format, and semantic structure), the survey exposes systematic weaknesses in how video event understanding resources are currently organized and utilized.
- Core assumption: That analyzing datasets through these three distinct lenses provides meaningful insights into the state of video event understanding research.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The authors construct a framework to analyze video datasets with a focus on (1) what events are presented, (2) how they are presented, and (3) how they are interpreted.
  - [section] We establish three primary dataset considerations: What events are presented (content), how they are presented (presentation), and how they are interpreted (structure).
- Break condition: If the three-dimensional analysis framework fails to reveal meaningful patterns or if the dataset categorization proves arbitrary rather than insightful.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The temporal and hierarchical nature of video events necessitates different structural approaches than text-based event extraction.
- Mechanism: Video's inherent temporality and the visibility of sub-events within full events create structural requirements that differ fundamentally from text-based event modeling, as demonstrated by the survey's analysis of temporal and compositional event structures.
- Core assumption: That video's temporal nature creates unique event modeling challenges not present in text-based event extraction.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] while there is a rich domain of event-centric video research spanning the past 10+ years, it is unclear how video event understanding should be framed
  - [section] Building on the ideas introduced by compositional structures, hierarchical structures also consider multiple "sub-events" within a single video.
- Break condition: If temporal and hierarchical event structures prove irrelevant to video understanding or if text-based approaches adequately capture video event semantics.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The survey identifies that most video datasets focus on specialized downstream tasks rather than general event understanding, creating a fundamental research gap.
- Mechanism: By cataloging the intended tasks of 105 datasets, the survey reveals that video event understanding as a standalone task remains underexplored compared to task-specific applications like retrieval or question-answering.
- Core assumption: That specialized downstream tasks dominate the video dataset landscape and that this dominance obscures the need for general event understanding research.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] While existing video benchmarks largely consider specialized downstream tasks like retrieval or question-answering (QA), contemporary multimodal AI systems must be capable of well-rounded common-sense reasoning
  - [section] The large majority of surveyed datasets consider semantically simpler events than those typically found in text-based event extraction datasets.
- Break condition: If future dataset surveys show that general event understanding tasks have become prevalent, or if specialized tasks prove sufficient for robust video understanding.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Event semantics and formal event structures (Davidsonian, Neo-Davidsonian)
  - Why needed here: Understanding how events are formally represented in linguistics provides the theoretical foundation for analyzing how video datasets structure event information.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between Davidsonian and Neo-Davidsonian event structures?

- Concept: Multimodal learning and video-language integration
  - Why needed here: The survey addresses video event understanding which inherently involves integrating visual and linguistic information, requiring understanding of multimodal learning approaches.
  - Quick check question: How do multimodal learning approaches differ from single-modality approaches in handling temporal information?

- Concept: Dataset curation and benchmark construction methodology
  - Why needed here: The survey's recommendations for future dataset construction require understanding the trade-offs and considerations in creating effective video benchmarks.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between curating datasets for action recognition versus event understanding tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Dataset collection -> Categorization by task type -> Content/present/structure analysis -> Event structure taxonomy development -> Task assessment -> Recommendations generation

- Critical path: Dataset collection → Categorization by task type → Content/present/structure analysis → Event structure taxonomy development → Task assessment → Recommendations generation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Breadth vs. depth: Including more datasets provides broader coverage but may sacrifice detailed analysis of individual datasets
  - Formal vs. natural language structures: Balancing structured event representations with human-readable descriptions
  - Task specificity vs. generality: Choosing between specialized downstream tasks and general event understanding capabilities

- Failure signatures:
  - Inconsistent categorization across datasets with similar characteristics
  - Event structure analysis that cannot account for dataset diversity
  - Recommendations that don't align with practical dataset construction constraints

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Apply the three-dimensional analysis framework to a small subset of datasets (10-15) to validate categorization consistency and identify potential refinements
  2. Implement event structure classification on a sample dataset to test the practical applicability of the Davidsonian/Neo-Davidsonian framework
  3. Compare the survey's recommended event extraction task formulation against existing benchmarks to assess practical feasibility and coverage gaps

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we develop a universal video event extraction task that combines the strengths of MMEE, VidSRL, and MEHE while addressing their individual limitations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors discuss three emerging video event extraction tasks (MMEE, VidSRL, and MEHE) and their respective strengths and limitations in Section 6, suggesting that "a combination of these definitions may serve as a more universal task."
- Why unresolved: Each task has distinct advantages and drawbacks - MMEE requires text input and doesn't consider compositional events, VidSRL is limited to simple events in short clips, and MEHE requires text documents and only considers single predicates. Creating a unified task that addresses all these limitations while maintaining practical feasibility remains an open challenge.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of a new unified video event extraction task that successfully incorporates low-level event modeling, hierarchical event structures, natural language mapping, text independence, and handles compositional events while demonstrating improved performance across diverse video datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal approach for structuring temporal relationships in video events, given that traditional text-based event modeling often treats timing as secondary but video inherently emphasizes it?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors identify temporal structure as one of two primary axes for classifying event structures and note in Section 5.5 that "it is difficult to avoid including temporal relationships in video" and argue that "optimal methods for structuring the temporal aspect of events and formalizing them should be explored further."
- Why unresolved: While most video datasets include temporal annotations, there's no established framework for consistently representing and formalizing temporal relationships between events, especially for complex hierarchical and compositional events across different video genres and presentation formats.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive evaluation framework that tests different temporal structuring approaches (time-agnostic, temporal, compositional, hierarchical) across diverse video datasets, demonstrating which methods best capture event relationships while maintaining computational efficiency and generalizability.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can video event understanding models incorporate uncertainty to better reflect human visual reasoning capabilities, particularly for high-level inference tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors argue in Section 6.4 that "difficult benchmarks can require probabilistic inference" and propose that "video event understanding models should be constructed to possess an understanding of event uncertainty for robust reasoning that better reflects human visual reasoning ability."
- Why unresolved: Current video event extraction tasks typically output deterministic event structures, but real-world video understanding often requires probabilistic reasoning about multiple likely interpretations, comparisons between competing hypotheses, and social reasoning capabilities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of video event understanding models that explicitly model uncertainty through probabilistic frameworks, demonstrating improved performance on complex reasoning tasks compared to deterministic approaches while maintaining interpretability and alignment with human judgment.

## Limitations
- The survey's categorization framework may introduce subjective bias in how datasets are classified across the three dimensions.
- The analysis assumes the nine task categories fully capture video event understanding research, potentially missing emerging task types.
- Recommendations for dual annotation approaches (formal and natural language) lack empirical validation for practical implementation.

## Confidence

- High confidence in identifying the gap between specialized tasks and general event understanding, supported by quantitative analysis of 105 datasets.
- Medium confidence in the proposed taxonomy of video event structures, as theoretical framework needs practical validation across diverse datasets.
- Medium confidence in the assessment of MMEE, VidSRL, and MEHE tasks, as future task formulations may address identified limitations.

## Next Checks

1. Apply the three-dimensional analysis framework to a new, independent set of 20-30 video datasets not included in the original survey to test the framework's generalizability and identify potential refinements needed for emerging dataset types.

2. Conduct a small-scale annotation study comparing event structure classification using only formal semantic annotations versus combined formal and natural language descriptions to empirically validate the recommendation for dual annotation approaches.

3. Implement a prototype video event extraction system using the survey's recommended best practices (incorporating both formal and natural language event structures, emphasizing temporal and hierarchical aspects) and evaluate its performance against existing task-specific approaches on a subset of the surveyed datasets.
