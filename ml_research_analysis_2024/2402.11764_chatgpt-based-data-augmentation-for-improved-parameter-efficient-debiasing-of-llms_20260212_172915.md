# ChatGPT Based Data Augmentation for Improved Parameter-Efficient Debiasing of LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.11764
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11764
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: ChatGPT-generated synthetic data outperforms existing debiasing datasets while preserving LLM capabilities

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a ChatGPT-based approach to generate synthetic training data for parameter-efficient debiasing of large language models. The authors propose two prompting strategies—Targeted Prompting for known biases and General Prompting for broader categories—to create anti-stereotypical sentences that counter social biases across multiple dimensions. Using adapter tuning, the synthetic data reduces bias while maintaining the pre-trained knowledge of LLMs. The approach demonstrates superior debiasing performance compared to existing datasets and shows strong generalizability across different bias categories, including intersectional biases.

## Method Summary
The method leverages ChatGPT to generate synthetic training data for debiasing LLMs through two prompting strategies: Targeted Prompting (for specific known bias categories) and General Prompting (for broader bias categories). The generated anti-stereotypical sentences are used to fine-tune LLMs via adapter tuning, which freezes all original model parameters and trains only additional adapter layers. A third technique, Loss-Guided Prompting, improves data quality by generating more in-distribution sentences that better preserve pre-trained knowledge. The approach is evaluated across multiple models (BERT, GPT-2, LLaMA-3B, OPT-350m, GPT-Neo-125m) using stereotype score (SS) and language modeling score (LMS) metrics.

## Key Results
- ChatGPT efficiently produces high-quality training data that surpasses existing debiasing datasets in performance
- Synthetic data achieves superior debiasing results while preserving LLM capabilities and general language understanding
- The generated data shows strong generalizability across bias categories, including intersectional biases
- Adapter tuning enables parameter-efficient debiasing with minimal retraining cost

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
ChatGPT's knowledge of social bias can be systematically prompted to generate high-quality synthetic training data that outperforms existing debiasing datasets. Targeted and general prompting strategies instruct ChatGPT to create anti-stereotypical sentences that counter biases across specific or multiple categories. These synthetic sentences are then used to fine-tune LLMs via adapter tuning, reducing bias while preserving general language capabilities. This mechanism assumes ChatGPT's training corpus includes sufficient social bias knowledge to generate effective anti-stereotypical data when properly prompted.

### Mechanism 2
Adapter tuning allows for parameter-efficient debiasing that preserves LLM capabilities while mitigating social bias. By freezing all original LLM parameters and training only additional adapter layers on synthetic debiasing data, this targeted adjustment reduces bias without significant degradation of general language abilities. The mechanism assumes fine-tuning only adapter layers is sufficient to alter bias-related behavior without affecting broader language understanding.

### Mechanism 3
Loss-guided prompting improves synthetic data quality by generating more in-distribution sentences that reduce catastrophic forgetting. By selecting high and low loss examples from generated data and providing them back to ChatGPT with instructions, the model generates more in-distribution anti-stereotypical sentences that better preserve the pre-trained knowledge of models like BERT. This mechanism assumes providing loss feedback to ChatGPT helps it generate sentences that align better with the target LLM's distribution.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Adapter tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how to modify LLMs with minimal parameter changes is crucial for implementing the debiasing approach
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between adapter tuning and full fine-tuning?

- **Concept: Prompt engineering and systematic prompting strategies**
  - Why needed here: Creating effective targeted and general prompts determines the quality of synthetic debiasing data
  - Quick check question: How do targeted prompts differ from general prompts in this approach?

- **Concept: Bias measurement and evaluation metrics**
  - Why needed here: Assessing debiasing effectiveness requires understanding metrics like stereotype score (SS) and language modeling score (LMS)
  - Quick check question: What does a stereotype score of 50 indicate about a model's bias level?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: ChatGPT (data generator) → Synthetic dataset → Adapter layers → Debiased LLM
- **Critical path**: Prompt design → Data generation → Adapter training → Bias evaluation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Targeted prompts vs. general prompts (specificity vs. breadth), data quantity vs. quality, debiasing vs. capability preservation
- **Failure signatures**: No bias reduction despite training, significant LMS degradation, overfitting to synthetic data
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Generate 100 synthetic sentences using targeted prompts for one bias category and evaluate their anti-stereotypical quality
  2. Fine-tune a small LLM with adapter tuning on the synthetic data and measure bias reduction
  3. Compare bias reduction and LMS preservation between targeted and general prompting approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How do the two prompting strategies (targeted vs. general) compare in terms of their effectiveness and efficiency for debiasing across different categories of bias, such as gender, race, and religion? The paper explicitly compares these strategies but doesn't provide a definitive answer on which is more effective overall. A comprehensive statistical analysis would help determine their relative effectiveness across bias categories.

### Open Question 2
How does the trade-off between debiasing performance and language capability preservation manifest in different language models, and what are the underlying factors contributing to this trade-off? While the paper discusses this trade-off, particularly in BERT, it lacks detailed analysis of contributing factors or variation across different models. Further experiments comparing multiple models would help understand underlying factors.

### Open Question 3
How generalizable is the proposed debiasing approach to other domains beyond language, such as vision or multimodal models, and what are the potential challenges and limitations in extending the approach? The paper suggests future research in other domains but provides no empirical evidence or analysis of cross-domain applicability. Experiments applying the approach to vision or multimodal models would help determine generalizability.

## Limitations
- Weak direct evidence for loss-guided prompting mechanism, showing only "promising initial results on BERT" without broader validation
- Synthetic data generation relies heavily on ChatGPT's ability to produce anti-stereotypical content, which may vary across implementations
- Evaluation framework focuses primarily on CrowS-Pairs and StereoSet, potentially missing biases in other domains

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core claim that adapter tuning can efficiently debias LLMs while preserving capabilities is well-supported by established parameter-efficient fine-tuning literature and empirical results.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that ChatGPT-generated synthetic data outperforms existing debiasing datasets is supported by results but limited to specific datasets tested.

**Low Confidence**: The loss-guided prompting mechanism shows only initial promising results on BERT, with no validation on other models or comprehensive evaluation across bias categories.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Model Validation**: Test the loss-guided prompting mechanism on GPT-2 and LLaMA-3B models to verify if the initial BERT results generalize across different LLM architectures.

2. **Benchmark Expansion**: Evaluate the synthetic data approach against additional established debiasing datasets (e.g., WinoBias, Bias in Bios) to strengthen claims about superior performance.

3. **Bias Category Generalization**: Systematically test the debiasing effectiveness on newly identified bias categories not included in the original prompting to verify the claimed generalizability across intersectional and emerging bias types.
