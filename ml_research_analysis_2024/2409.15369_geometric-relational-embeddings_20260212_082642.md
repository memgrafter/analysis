- Introduces geometric relational embeddings that map relational objects as geometric elements rather than plain vectors

## Executive Summary
This dissertation introduces geometric relational embeddings as a novel paradigm that maps relational objects to geometric elements instead of plain vectors, addressing the limitations of vector embeddings in capturing discrete and symbolic properties inherent in relational data. The work develops various geometric embedding models capable of capturing complex structured patterns (hierarchies, cycles), relational and logical patterns, logical structures in ontologies, and high-order relationships between entities and relations. Experimental results on benchmark and real-world datasets demonstrate that geometric relational embeddings effectively capture these properties, leading to performance improvements over various relational reasoning tasks including knowledge graph completion, ontology reasoning, and multi-label classification.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes geometric relational embeddings that map relational objects to geometric elements (boxes, points in hyperbolic/spherical/pseudo-Riemannian spaces) rather than plain vectors. The method involves selecting an appropriate geometric space based on the intrinsic topology of the relational data, defining geometric objects for each relational entity, encoding spatial relationships to represent symbolic semantics, designing loss functions to enforce these relationships, and optimizing using gradient descent. The approach is validated through empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets including knowledge graphs (Freebase, DBpedia) and biomedical ontologies, using metrics such as MRR, Hit@k, mAP, and AUC.

## Key Results
- Geometric embeddings effectively capture discrete symbolic properties in relational data through spatial relationships
- Performance improvements over traditional vector embeddings on knowledge graph completion and ontology reasoning tasks
- Different geometric spaces (hyperbolic, spherical, pseudo-Riemannian) provide inductive biases suited to different relational patterns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Geometric embeddings replace plain vectors with geometric elements (e.g., boxes, hyperbolic points) to capture discrete symbolic properties. Each relational object is mapped to a geometric structure whose spatial relationships encode symbolic semantics (e.g., containment for implication, disjointness for mutual exclusion). The core assumption is that discrete symbolic relationships can be faithfully represented as spatial relationships in a chosen geometric space.

### Mechanism 2
Different geometric spaces provide inductive biases suited to different relational patterns. Hierarchical data is embedded in hyperbolic space (exponential volume growth), cyclic data in spherical space, and mixed topologies in pseudo-Riemannian manifolds combining both. The core assumption is that the intrinsic geometry of relational data matches the geometric properties of the chosen embedding space.

### Mechanism 3
Geometric embeddings enable modeling of logical structures and constraints in machine learning outputs. Labels are embedded as geometric regions such that logical relationships are represented by spatial relationships. The core assumption is that logical constraints over labels can be transformed into geometric constraints over their embeddings without loss of semantics.

## Foundational Learning

- **Knowledge graph embeddings**: Needed to understand the baseline approaches being extended; quick check: What is the difference between TransE and RotatE in terms of how they model relations?

- **Description Logic (DL) and EL++**: Needed to understand BoxEL's target domain; quick check: What are the four normal forms of axioms in normalized EL++?

- **Pseudo-Riemannian manifolds**: Needed to understand the mathematical foundation of UltraE and Pseudo-Riemannian GCNs; quick check: What is the key difference between Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian manifolds?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Geometric embedding → geometric space selection → geometric object definition → spatial relationship encoding → loss function design → optimization
- **Critical path**: Define the geometric space → Map relational objects to geometric objects → Define spatial relationships for symbolic semantics → Design loss function to enforce these relationships → Optimize using gradient descent
- **Design tradeoffs**: Expressiveness vs. computational complexity, choice of geometric space vs. ability to capture all relational patterns, explicit modeling of logical structures vs. simplicity
- **Failure signatures**: Poor performance on tasks requiring symbolic reasoning, inability to capture certain relational patterns, unstable training due to undefined geodesic operations, overfitting due to high model complexity
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Implement BoxEL on a small EL++ ontology and verify that subsumption relations are preserved in the embedding space.
  2. Implement UltraE on a knowledge graph with mixed hierarchical and cyclic structures and compare performance against hyperbolic and Euclidean baselines.
  3. Implement HMI on a structured multi-label dataset and evaluate whether the learned embeddings respect the given logical constraints.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the choice of geometric space (e.g., hyperbolic, spherical, pseudo-Riemannian) impact the performance of geometric relational embeddings across different types of relational data? The paper presents a survey of different geometric embeddings but does not provide a comprehensive empirical comparison across diverse relational data types.

### Open Question 2
How can geometric relational embeddings be extended to handle multi-modal relational data, such as data containing both text and images? The paper mentions that many geometric embedding methods learn embeddings in a shallow manner, which becomes problematic when the input data contains rich multi-modal features.

### Open Question 3
What are the most effective strategies for incorporating relational constraints into large language models (LLMs) using geometric embeddings? The paper mentions the potential of injecting relational constraints into LLMs to address their lack of factual knowledge and prevent hallucination.

## Limitations
- Spatial relationships may not fully represent discrete semantics without loss
- Choice of geometric space requires prior knowledge of data's intrinsic topology
- Computational complexity of geometric operations could limit scalability
- Assumption that logical constraints can be faithfully transformed into geometric constraints may not hold for all logical systems

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: General framework of geometric relational embeddings and its distinction from traditional vector embeddings
- **Medium confidence**: Specific claims about box embeddings capturing EL++ axioms and UltraE handling mixed topologies
- **Low confidence**: Claims about pseudo-Riemannian manifolds being optimal for all mixed-topology cases

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation study on geometric space choice**: Systematically test the same relational data across multiple geometric spaces to quantify the impact of space selection on performance.
2. **Symbolic property preservation test**: Design a controlled experiment measuring symbolic relationships in the embedding space using spatial metrics to verify geometric relationships correspond to intended semantics.
3. **Scalability benchmark**: Evaluate computational complexity and training time of geometric embeddings versus traditional embeddings on progressively larger knowledge graphs.
