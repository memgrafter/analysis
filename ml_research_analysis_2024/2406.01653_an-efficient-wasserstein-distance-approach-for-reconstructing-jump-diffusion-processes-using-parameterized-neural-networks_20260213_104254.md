# An efficient Wasserstein-distance approach for reconstructing jump-diffusion processes using parameterized neural networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.01653
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01653
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: W2-distance method achieves relative errors below 0.25 for drift, diffusion, and jump functions in 1D and 2D cases

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel method for reconstructing multidimensional jump-diffusion processes from observed data using parameterized neural networks. The approach minimizes a temporally decoupled squared Wasserstein-2 (W2) distance between probability distributions associated with the ground truth and reconstructed processes. The method demonstrates superior performance compared to other common reconstruction techniques (MSE, MMD, WGAN) and can be enhanced by incorporating prior information on the drift function. The temporally decoupled squared W2-distance provides theoretical error bounds for the reconstructed functions and enables more efficient evaluation than the standard W2-distance.

## Method Summary
The method reconstructs jump-diffusion processes by parameterizing the drift, diffusion, and jump amplitude functions using three separate feed-forward neural networks. The temporally decoupled squared W2-distance is computed between empirical distributions of the ground truth and reconstructed processes at discrete time points. The networks are trained using the AdamW optimizer to minimize this loss function, with trajectories generated using the Euler-Maruyama scheme. The approach can incorporate prior information on the drift function to improve reconstruction accuracy of the diffusion and jump functions.

## Key Results
- W2-distance based method outperforms MSE, MMD, and WGAN in numerical examples
- Relative errors below 0.25 achieved for drift, diffusion, and jump functions in 1D and 2D cases
- Incorporating prior information on drift function significantly improves reconstruction accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: The temporally decoupled squared W2-distance provides both upper and lower error bounds for discrepancies in drift, diffusion, and jump amplitude functions.
- **Mechanism**: The method defines a loss function that integrates W2 distances between probability distributions at each time point, which bounds the expected squared errors in the functional parameters through martingale convergence and Gronwall's inequality.
- **Core assumption**: The jump-diffusion processes satisfy Lipschitz continuity conditions and the compensated Poisson processes are orthogonal martingales.
- **Evidence anchors**: Theorem 2.1 and Corollary 2.1 provide upper error bounds using stochastic Gronwall lemma.
- **Break condition**: If the drift, diffusion, or jump functions violate Lipschitz continuity or if the orthogonality of compensated Poisson processes fails.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: The temporally decoupled squared W2-distance can be more efficiently evaluated using finite-sample empirical distributions.
- **Mechanism**: The method decouples the temporal dimension, allowing evaluation at discrete time points with empirical distributions, reducing computational complexity while maintaining convergence guarantees.
- **Core assumption**: The jump-diffusion processes have finite moments up to order 6 and the mesh grid satisfies certain regularity conditions.
- **Evidence anchors**: Theorem 3.2 provides finite-sample empirical distribution error bounds.
- **Break condition**: If the number of training samples is too small or the time mesh is too coarse.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Incorporating prior information on the drift function significantly improves the accuracy of reconstructed diffusion and jump functions.
- **Mechanism**: The prior information constrains the optimization landscape, allowing the neural networks to focus on learning the residual terms more accurately, reducing the search space for diffusion and jump functions.
- **Core assumption**: The drift function is known or can be accurately measured from macroscopic observations.
- **Evidence anchors**: Example 4.2 demonstrates significant error reduction when drift function is provided as prior.
- **Break condition**: If the prior information on drift function is incorrect or noisy.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Jump-diffusion processes**
  - Why needed here: The paper deals with reconstructing processes that combine continuous diffusion with discontinuous jumps, requiring understanding of both components.
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes a jump-diffusion process from a pure diffusion process in terms of sample path properties?

- **Concept: Wasserstein distance**
  - Why needed here: The method uses Wasserstein distance as the primary metric for comparing probability distributions of stochastic processes.
  - Quick check question: How does the W2-distance differ from other probability metrics like KL-divergence when comparing distributions?

- **Concept: Parameterized neural networks for function approximation**
  - Why needed here: The reconstruction method uses neural networks to parameterize the drift, diffusion, and jump functions of the approximate process.
  - Quick check question: What are the key considerations when choosing neural network architecture for approximating stochastic process parameters?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data preprocessing → Trajectory generation and discretization → Three neural networks (drift, diffusion, jump) → Temporally decoupled squared W2-distance loss → AdamW optimization → Parameter update → Evaluation

- **Critical path**: Data → Trajectory generation → Loss computation → Gradient update → Parameter update → Evaluation

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Temporal decoupling vs. computational efficiency
  - Prior information incorporation vs. model flexibility
  - Network architecture complexity vs. training stability

- **Failure signatures**:
  - High W2-distance indicates poor function reconstruction
  - Oscillating training loss suggests learning rate issues
  - Large discrepancies between training and validation errors indicate overfitting

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Reconstruct a simple 1D jump-diffusion with known parameters to verify basic functionality
  2. Test different loss functions (MSE, MMD, WGAN) on the same problem to compare performance
  3. Vary the amount of prior information on drift function to quantify improvement in reconstruction accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed temporally decoupled squared W2-distance method perform when reconstructing high-dimensional jump-diffusion processes (e.g., d > 2) with complex noise correlation structures?
- Basis in paper: The paper demonstrates the method's effectiveness for 1D and 2D jump-diffusion processes, but acknowledges the need to explore higher dimensions.
- Why unresolved: The method's scalability and performance in high-dimensional settings with more complex noise correlations remain untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Numerical experiments applying the method to jump-diffusion processes with d > 2, varying the noise correlation matrix structure, and comparing performance to other reconstruction methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the proposed method be extended to reconstruct other types of stochastic processes, such as L\'evy processes or jump-diffusion processes with state-dependent jump intensities?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions the potential for extending the method to other stochastic processes, including L\'evy walks, but does not explore this direction.
- Why unresolved: The theoretical analysis and numerical experiments are limited to the specific jump-diffusion process defined in Eq. (1).
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing the mathematical framework for the extended method, implementing numerical experiments on the target stochastic processes, and comparing performance to existing methods.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How sensitive is the method to the choice of prior information on the drift function? Can the method handle misspecified or noisy prior information?
- Basis in paper: The paper demonstrates the benefits of providing prior information on the drift function but does not explore the method's robustness to misspecified or noisy priors.
- Why unresolved: The numerical experiments use accurate prior information on the drift function, and the impact of prior misspecification is not investigated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Numerical experiments systematically varying the accuracy and noise level of the prior information on the drift function, and analyzing the method's reconstruction performance under these conditions.

## Limitations

- The theoretical framework relies heavily on Lipschitz continuity assumptions that may not hold for many practical jump-diffusion processes with discontinuities.
- Computational efficiency claims for the temporally decoupled approach are stated but not empirically validated through timing comparisons.
- The method's performance in high-dimensional settings (d > 2) with complex noise correlation structures remains untested.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The empirical performance comparison showing W2-distance based method outperforms MSE, MMD, and WGAN across all test cases. The relative errors below 0.25 are consistently achieved and directly measurable.
- **Medium confidence**: The theoretical error bounds provided by the temporally decoupled squared W2-distance. While the mathematical derivations appear sound, the practical tightness of these bounds across different problem regimes is not thoroughly examined.
- **Low confidence**: The computational efficiency claims for the temporally decoupled approach. The paper asserts improved evaluation efficiency but provides no concrete timing data or computational complexity analysis.

## Next Checks

1. **Sensitivity analysis of Lipschitz assumptions**: Systematically test the reconstruction performance when drift, diffusion, or jump functions violate Lipschitz continuity. Measure how quickly reconstruction quality degrades and compare this to the theoretical error bounds.

2. **Computational benchmarking**: Implement both standard and temporally decoupled W2-distance calculations and measure wall-clock time for equivalent reconstruction tasks. Include memory usage comparisons and analyze scaling behavior with increasing dimension and sample size.

3. **Prior information robustness testing**: Evaluate the method's performance when the provided drift function prior contains varying levels of noise or systematic bias. Quantify the trade-off between prior accuracy and reconstruction quality of diffusion and jump functions.
