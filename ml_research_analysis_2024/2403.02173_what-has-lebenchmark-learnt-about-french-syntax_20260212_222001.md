# What has LeBenchmark Learnt about French Syntax?

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2403.02173
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02173
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: LeBenchmark wav2vec2-style model encodes syntactic information in middle layers (14-15), with POS tagging accuracy peaking at 65.5% and dependency parsing UAS at 52%.

## Executive Summary
This study probes LeBenchmark, a French wav2vec2-style acoustic model trained on raw speech, for syntactic information using part-of-speech tagging and unlabeled dependency parsing on the Orféo treebank of spontaneous French speech. The authors extract representations from each of 24 model layers and feed them into linear classifiers. Results show that syntactic information is most extractable from middle layers (14-15), with a sharp accuracy drop in later layers. Random initialization baselines perform far worse, confirming the model encodes real syntactic information. This work is the first to investigate syntactic probing in spontaneous speech using wav2vec2-style models.

## Method Summary
The study uses LeBenchmark, a wav2vec2-FR-7K-large model pretrained on 7,000 hours of French speech, to extract token-level representations from each of its 24 transformer layers. These representations are pooled using mean pooling and fed into linear softmax classifiers for POS tagging (20 classes) and unlabeled dependency parsing (using relative position encoding). The Orféo treebank provides 9 hours of speech with gold syntactic annotations. Performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics, with results compared against random initialization baselines to confirm the pretrained model encodes meaningful syntactic information.

## Key Results
- POS tagging accuracy peaks at 65.5% in layer 15 of LeBenchmark
- Unlabeled dependency parsing (UAS) peaks at 52% in layer 14
- Both tasks show sharp accuracy decrease in later layers after middle layers
- Random initialization baselines perform significantly worse than pretrained model

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The wav2vec2-style pretraining on raw speech captures hierarchical acoustic-phonetic patterns that correlate with syntactic structures.
- Mechanism: The contrastive loss during pretraining forces the model to distinguish true speech segments from distractors, implicitly learning temporal patterns that align with syntactic units like phrases and clauses.
- Core assumption: Speech signal patterns contain sufficient implicit cues for syntax without explicit lexical supervision.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "LeBenchmark is trained on the raw speech signal, i.e. very low level information. As a result, probing it for high-level information such as syntax is of important significance."
  - [section] "LeBenchmark is a Wav2vec2.0-style pretrained acoustic model, trained on the raw speech signal, i.e. very low level information."
- Break condition: If acoustic patterns and syntactic boundaries are completely decoupled in spontaneous speech, this mechanism fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Middle layers of the network contain the optimal abstraction level for extracting syntax from acoustic representations.
- Mechanism: Early layers retain too much raw acoustic detail while late layers abstract away to semantic-level features, leaving middle layers with a "sweet spot" of acoustic-phonetic features that correlate with syntactic structure.
- Core assumption: There exists an intermediate abstraction level where acoustic-phonetic patterns best align with syntactic boundaries.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our results show that syntactic information is more easily extractable from the middle layers of the network, after which a very sharp decrease is observed."
  - [section] "We found that syntactic information is most present in the middle layers of the model, and is much less accessible in the last layers where it seems to almost disappear."
- Break condition: If syntax is uniformly distributed across layers or follows a different pattern (e.g., monotonic increase then plateau), this mechanism fails.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Relative position encoding allows dependency parsing to be framed as sequence labeling, enabling linear probes to extract syntactic structure.
- Mechanism: By converting tree structures into token-level labels representing head positions, complex dependency parsing becomes a simpler classification task that linear classifiers can handle.
- Core assumption: Linear classifiers can extract meaningful syntactic relationships from acoustic representations when the task is appropriately simplified.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We cast both tasks as word-level prediction tasks... addressing both tasks as word-level prediction tasks has the advantages of keeping the probes and the decoding algorithms fairly simple."
  - [section] "In order to cast dependency parsing as a token classification task, we use a simple way of encoding a dependency tree into token labels: relative position encoding."
- Break condition: If the linear probe cannot capture the necessary non-linear relationships between acoustic features and syntactic structure, this mechanism fails.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Probing methodology
  - Why needed here: The study relies on probing techniques to assess whether pretrained representations contain syntactic information without additional training.
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes probing from fine-tuning in terms of parameter updates and what the technique reveals about model representations?

- Concept: Relative position encoding for dependency parsing
  - Why needed here: This encoding scheme transforms the structured dependency parsing task into a simpler sequence labeling problem suitable for linear classifiers.
  - Quick check question: How does the relative position encoding handle tokens with multiple possible heads or non-projective dependencies?

- Concept: Wav2vec2-style pretraining objectives
  - Why needed here: Understanding the contrastive learning objective is crucial for interpreting why acoustic models might capture syntactic information.
  - Quick check question: What specific information does the wav2vec2 contrastive loss optimize for, and how might this relate to syntactic structure?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Wav2vec2 encoder (24 transformer layers) → Frame-level representations → Token-level pooling → Linear classifier → POS tag or head position prediction
- Critical path: Speech signal → wav2vec2 encoder → Middle layers (14-15) → Linear classifier → Best syntactic predictions
- Design tradeoffs: Simple linear probes vs. more complex classifiers; token-level vs. utterance-level approaches; pooling strategies for token representation
- Failure signatures: Random baseline matching pretrained performance; monotonic accuracy patterns across layers; poor performance despite syntactic annotations
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify that random initialization baseline performs significantly worse than pretrained model across all layers
  2. Test different pooling strategies (mean, max, attention) for converting frame-level to token-level representations
  3. Experiment with varying classifier architectures (linear, MLP with one hidden layer) to establish if linear probes are sufficient

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do syntactic representations in middle layers of LeBenchmark differ from those in BERT-style models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that while both models encode most syntactic information in middle layers, LeBenchmark shows a sharper decrease in later layers compared to BERT.
- Why unresolved: The study only compares final-layer performance, not the detailed differences in representation quality or type between the models' middle layers.
- What evidence would resolve it: A direct comparison of syntactic probing results for BERT and LeBenchmark across all layers, analyzing the nature of encoded information.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Would using alternative probing methods (beyond linear classifiers) yield different conclusions about syntactic information extraction?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors acknowledge that their linear probes might not capture all present syntactic information.
- Why unresolved: The study only uses linear classifiers as probes, leaving open whether more complex models could extract additional syntactic information.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments using non-linear probes or more complex probing architectures on the same data.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the spontaneous speech nature of Orféo affect syntactic information encoding compared to read speech corpora?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The study is the first to probe syntactic information in spontaneous speech, whereas previous work focused on read speech.
- Why unresolved: The study doesn't compare results with read speech treebanks to quantify the impact of spontaneity on syntactic encoding.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study using both spontaneous and read speech treebanks with identical probing methodology.

## Limitations
- The Orféo treebank contains only 9 hours of speech with gold syntactic annotations out of 196 total hours, creating significant data constraints.
- The study relies entirely on linear probes, which cannot capture complex non-linear relationships that might exist between acoustic representations and syntax.
- The wav2vec2-style pretraining objective focuses on acoustic discrimination rather than explicit syntactic learning, making it unclear whether the model truly understands syntax or merely captures correlated acoustic patterns.

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The finding that middle layers (14-15) contain the most extractable syntactic information is well-supported by empirical results showing clear peaks in both POS tagging and dependency parsing accuracy at these layers, with sharp decreases in later layers. The random initialization baseline comparison provides strong validation that the pretrained model encodes real syntactic information rather than noise.

**Medium confidence**: The claim that acoustic-phonetic patterns in spontaneous speech contain sufficient implicit cues for syntax extraction is plausible given the contrastive pretraining mechanism, but the weak corpus evidence connecting acoustic patterns to syntactic boundaries introduces uncertainty.

**Low confidence**: The assertion that relative position encoding successfully transforms dependency parsing into a sequence labeling task suitable for linear probes lacks strong validation. The corpus evidence only confirms availability of annotations, not the effectiveness of this specific encoding approach.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-linguistic validation**: Apply the same probing methodology to wav2vec2 models trained on languages with different syntactic structures (e.g., German, Japanese, Arabic) to test whether the middle-layer syntax extraction pattern holds across typologically diverse languages.

2. **Non-linear probe comparison**: Replace linear classifiers with small MLPs (1-2 hidden layers) and compare performance across all layers to determine whether the linear probe limitation is artificially constraining syntactic information extraction.

3. **Controlled acoustic manipulation**: Systematically degrade acoustic quality (adding noise, reverberation, compression) and measure the impact on syntactic extraction accuracy across layers to test whether middle layers' syntactic information comes from robust acoustic-phonetic patterns.
