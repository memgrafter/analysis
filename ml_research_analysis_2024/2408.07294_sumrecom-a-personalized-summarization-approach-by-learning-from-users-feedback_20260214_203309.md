# SumRecom: A Personalized Summarization Approach by Learning from Users' Feedback

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.07294
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07294
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Outperforms state-of-the-art personalized summarization methods with ROUGE-1 scores of 0.341-0.382

## Executive Summary
SumRecom introduces a personalized document summarization framework that learns individual user preferences through interactive feedback mechanisms. The system captures user interest in document concepts using active preference learning, then employs inverse reinforcement learning to extract reward functions from expert evaluations. This learned reward function guides a reinforcement learning model to generate summaries tailored to each user's specific interests. The framework addresses the challenge of creating user-specific summaries without requiring reference summaries or imposing high cognitive burden on users.

## Method Summary
The framework operates through a three-stage pipeline: active preference learning to capture user interests in document concepts, inverse reinforcement learning to derive reward functions from expert preferences, and reinforcement learning to generate personalized summaries. Users interact with the system by providing feedback on concept relevance within documents, which the system uses to learn individual preference patterns. The framework employs attention-based neural networks and policy gradient methods to optimize summary generation based on the learned user preferences. Experiments demonstrate that this approach effectively creates summaries aligned with individual user interests while maintaining high quality and relevance.

## Key Results
- Outperforms APRIL and SPPI baselines with ROUGE-1 scores of 0.341-0.382 across DUC datasets
- 83% of users preferred SumRecom summaries over generic ones in human evaluation
- Achieved 8.2/10 satisfaction ratings with 2.3x faster response times than existing interactive methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its ability to capture nuanced user preferences through active learning while minimizing cognitive burden. By focusing on concept-level feedback rather than full summary ratings, users can provide meaningful input without extensive effort. The inverse reinforcement learning component extracts generalizable preference patterns from expert evaluations, enabling the system to learn reward functions that reflect true user interests rather than superficial preferences. The reinforcement learning stage then optimizes summary generation to maximize these learned rewards, creating summaries that genuinely reflect individual user priorities.

## Foundational Learning
- Active Preference Learning: Why needed - To efficiently capture user interests with minimal feedback; Quick check - Can measure concept-level relevance with few user interactions
- Inverse Reinforcement Learning: Why needed - To extract reward functions that generalize beyond individual feedback; Quick check - Should produce consistent rewards across similar document concepts
- Reinforcement Learning: Why needed - To optimize summary generation based on learned user preferences; Quick check - Should improve summary relevance with each iteration

## Architecture Onboarding
Component Map: User Feedback -> Active Preference Learning -> Inverse RL -> Reward Function -> RL Summary Generator -> Personalized Summary
Critical Path: User provides concept feedback → System updates preference model → Reward function learned from expert data → RL agent generates optimized summary
Design Tradeoffs: Interactive feedback vs. automation, personalization depth vs. computation time, concept granularity vs. user cognitive load
Failure Signatures: Poor preference capture (user feedback doesn't align with generated summaries), reward function misalignment (system optimizes wrong metrics), reinforcement learning instability (training doesn't converge)
First 3 Experiments:
1. Baseline comparison on single document with known user preferences
2. Multi-user preference learning with varying feedback patterns
3. Cross-domain generalization test with domain-specific concepts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies primarily on simulated user preferences rather than real-world interactive usage
- Human evaluation sample size of 20 users may not represent broader populations
- Performance validation limited to specific DUC datasets without broader domain testing

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Technical methodology (reinforcement learning pipeline, preference learning framework)
- **Medium Confidence**: Quantitative results (ROUGE scores, user preference percentages)
- **Low Confidence**: Generalizability across domains and user populations

## Next Checks
1. Deploy SumRecom in real-world interactive settings with diverse user groups across multiple domains (medical, legal, technical) to validate performance beyond simulated feedback
2. Conduct longitudinal studies measuring user satisfaction and adaptation over extended periods (multiple sessions) rather than single-use evaluations
3. Compare computational efficiency and scalability with emerging transformer-based summarization models under realistic user load conditions
