# Large Language Models as Interpolated and Extrapolated Event Predictors

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.10492
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10492
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: Proposes LEAP framework for event prediction in knowledge graphs using LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on ICEWS datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper presents LEAP, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for event prediction tasks in knowledge graphs. The authors address the challenge of using LLMs for both interpolated object prediction and extrapolated multi-event forecasting tasks. For object prediction, they develop two approaches: LEAPOP1 uses a fine-tuned RoBERTa encoder with a structural decoder to rank candidate objects, while LEAPOP2 frames the task as question-answering and uses a fine-tuned FLAN-T5 encoder-decoder for direct generation. For multi-event forecasting, they design a prompt template for each event and use a pre-trained RoBERTa encoder with a self-attention mechanism to predict future relation occurrences. Experiments on real-world ICEWS datasets demonstrate that LEAP achieves state-of-the-art performance, with LEAPOP1 achieving Hits@1 scores of 0.3691, 0.3675, and 0.3751 on Afghanistan, India, and Russia datasets respectively, and LEAPMEF achieving F1 scores of 0.6363, 0.7099, and 0.6280 on the same datasets.

## Method Summary
The LEAP framework addresses event prediction in knowledge graphs through two main tasks: interpolated object prediction and extrapolated multi-event forecasting. For object prediction, LEAPOP1 uses a fine-tuned RoBERTa encoder with a structural decoder to rank candidate objects, while LEAPOP2 frames the task as question-answering and employs a fine-tuned FLAN-T5 encoder-decoder for direct generation. For multi-event forecasting, LEAPMEF uses a prompt-based approach with a pre-trained RoBERTa encoder and self-attention mechanism to predict future relation occurrences. The framework is evaluated on ICEWS datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both tasks.

## Key Results
- LEAPOP1 achieves Hits@1 scores of 0.3691, 0.3675, and 0.3751 on Afghanistan, India, and Russia datasets respectively for object prediction
- LEAPMEF achieves F1 scores of 0.6363, 0.7099, and 0.6280 on Afghanistan, India, and Russia datasets respectively for multi-event forecasting
- LEAP framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on ICEWS datasets for both interpolated object prediction and extrapolated multi-event forecasting tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The LEAP framework leverages the powerful language understanding and generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to address event prediction tasks in knowledge graphs. By fine-tuning LLMs like RoBERTa and FLAN-T5 on specific tasks, the framework can effectively capture complex relationships between entities and events. The use of prompt-based approaches for multi-event forecasting allows the model to generate contextually relevant predictions by leveraging the LLM's ability to understand and generate natural language. The combination of fine-tuning and prompt engineering enables the model to effectively handle both interpolated object prediction and extrapolated multi-event forecasting tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- Fine-tuning LLMs: The process of adapting pre-trained language models to specific downstream tasks by further training on task-specific data. Why needed: To leverage the general language understanding capabilities of LLMs for domain-specific event prediction tasks. Quick check: Compare performance of fine-tuned vs. non-fine-tuned models on a validation set.
- Prompt engineering: The design of input prompts to guide LLM behavior and elicit desired outputs. Why needed: To effectively utilize LLMs for multi-event forecasting by providing contextual information and task-specific instructions. Quick check: Evaluate the impact of different prompt templates on model performance.
- Self-attention mechanism: A neural network component that allows the model to weigh the importance of different input elements when making predictions. Why needed: To capture complex relationships between entities and events in knowledge graphs. Quick check: Compare performance with and without self-attention in the forecasting task.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: LEAPOP1: KG data -> RoBERTa encoder -> Structural decoder -> Ranked objects; LEAPOP2: KG data -> FLAN-T5 encoder-decoder -> Generated objects; LEAPMEF: KG data -> Prompt templates -> RoBERTa encoder -> Self-attention -> Predicted events

Critical path: For object prediction, the critical path is the encoding of KG data and subsequent ranking/generation of objects. For multi-event forecasting, the critical path is the creation of prompt templates and the subsequent encoding and self-attention mechanism to predict future events.

Design tradeoffs: The choice between LEAPOP1 and LEAPOP2 involves a tradeoff between ranking-based and generation-based approaches for object prediction. LEAPOP1 may be more suitable for tasks requiring precise object selection, while LEAPOP2 may be more flexible for generating novel object descriptions. For multi-event forecasting, the use of prompt templates allows for contextual information but may limit the model's ability to generate entirely novel event sequences.

Failure signatures: Poor performance in object prediction may indicate issues with the KG data encoding or the ranking/generation process. In multi-event forecasting, failures may stem from inadequate prompt templates or insufficient training data to capture complex temporal dependencies.

First experiments:
1. Evaluate the performance of LEAPOP1 and LEAPOP2 on a small subset of the KG data to compare ranking vs. generation approaches for object prediction.
2. Test the impact of different prompt template designs on the performance of LEAPMEF for multi-event forecasting.
3. Conduct ablation studies to assess the contribution of the self-attention mechanism in LEAPMEF's performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The paper focuses on ICEWS datasets, which may limit generalizability to other knowledge graph domains or event types.
- The comparison is primarily with existing methods on the same datasets, but lacks broader benchmarking against other state-of-the-art approaches in the field.
- The computational efficiency and scalability of the proposed methods for larger knowledge graphs are not explicitly discussed.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The experimental methodology and results are well-documented, with clear performance metrics reported for both object prediction and multi-event forecasting tasks.
- **Medium Confidence:** The effectiveness of the proposed fine-tuning strategies for RoBERTa and FLAN-T5 models in the context of event prediction tasks is supported by the results, but further validation on diverse datasets would strengthen this claim.
- **Low Confidence:** The generalizability of the proposed framework to other knowledge graph domains or event types beyond ICEWS remains uncertain without additional experiments.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct experiments on diverse knowledge graph datasets to evaluate the generalizability of the LEAP framework beyond ICEWS.
2. Perform a comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art event prediction methods, including those not specifically designed for knowledge graphs.
3. Investigate the scalability and computational efficiency of the proposed methods when applied to larger knowledge graphs with millions of entities and events.
