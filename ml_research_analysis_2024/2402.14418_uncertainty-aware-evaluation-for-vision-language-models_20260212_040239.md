# Uncertainty-Aware Evaluation for Vision-Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.14418
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14418
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Uncertainty-aware evaluation for VLMs reveals misalignment between accuracy and uncertainty, with chat-finetuned models showing lower uncertainty than base models.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel uncertainty-aware evaluation framework for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that addresses the critical gap in current benchmarks which overlook model uncertainty. The authors propose using conformal prediction to quantify uncertainty and evaluate over 20 VLMs across 5 datasets using multiple-choice Visual Question Answering tasks. Their findings reveal that accuracy and uncertainty are not aligned - models with higher accuracy may also exhibit higher uncertainty. Notably, they demonstrate that significant increases in language model size are required to reduce uncertainty, and that chat-finetuned models consistently show lower uncertainty than their base counterparts.

## Method Summary
The authors develop an uncertainty-aware evaluation methodology using conformal prediction techniques to quantify uncertainty in VLMs. They evaluate 20+ VLMs across 5 datasets, focusing on multiple-choice Visual Question Answering tasks. The framework measures both accuracy and uncertainty metrics, including Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE). The study reveals that these traditional calibration metrics are not suitable for uncertainty estimation in VLMs. The methodology systematically compares chat-finetuned models against base models to understand how fine-tuning affects uncertainty, and examines the relationship between model size and uncertainty reduction.

## Key Results
- Monkey-Chat, ranked 2nd in accuracy, ranks 9th in uncertainty, demonstrating misalignment between accuracy and uncertainty
- Significant increases in language model size are required to achieve meaningful reductions in uncertainty
- Chat-finetuned models consistently exhibit lower uncertainty than base models across multiple evaluations
- ECE and MCE metrics prove unsuitable for uncertainty estimation in VLMs, despite being standard calibration measures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The evaluation framework works by quantifying uncertainty through conformal prediction, which provides statistically valid uncertainty estimates by constructing prediction sets with guaranteed coverage. This approach captures the model's confidence calibration by measuring how well predicted probabilities align with actual correctness. The misalignment between accuracy and uncertainty emerges because VLMs can achieve high accuracy through pattern matching while maintaining high uncertainty about their predictions, particularly in ambiguous or out-of-distribution scenarios. Chat-finetuning reduces uncertainty by exposing models to more diverse conversational patterns and clarifying ambiguous inputs through interaction history.

## Foundational Learning
- Conformal prediction: Why needed - provides statistically valid uncertainty quantification without distributional assumptions. Quick check - verify coverage probability matches theoretical guarantees on validation data.
- Calibration metrics (ECE, MCE): Why needed - measure alignment between predicted probabilities and actual accuracy. Quick check - compare calibration plots between base and fine-tuned models.
- Uncertainty quantification in VLMs: Why needed - current benchmarks ignore reliability of predictions. Quick check - measure uncertainty-accuracy correlation across multiple datasets.
- Model size effects on uncertainty: Why needed - understand computational tradeoffs for reliability. Quick check - plot uncertainty reduction curve against parameter count.
- Chat-finetuning impact: Why needed - determine if conversational pretraining improves reliability. Quick check - compare uncertainty distributions between base and chat-finetuned versions.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Input image + text prompt -> Vision encoder -> Cross-modal fusion -> Language model -> Conformal prediction wrapper -> Output prediction + uncertainty score
Critical path: Vision encoder -> Cross-modal fusion -> Language model -> Output generation, with conformal prediction applied post-hoc to uncertainty estimation
Design tradeoffs: Larger models reduce uncertainty but increase computational cost; chat-finetuning improves reliability but may reduce general task performance
Failure signatures: High accuracy with high uncertainty indicates overconfident pattern matching; low uncertainty with low accuracy suggests underconfidence in capable models
First experiments: 1) Compare uncertainty-accuracy correlation across different VQA datasets; 2) Measure uncertainty reduction curve as model size increases; 3) Evaluate chat-finetuned vs base model uncertainty distributions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to multiple-choice VQA tasks, may not generalize to open-ended or generation-based VLM tasks
- Conformal prediction assumes exchangeability of data, which may be violated in real-world deployment scenarios with domain shifts
- Dismissal of ECE and MCE as suitable metrics lacks theoretical justification and comparison with alternative calibration metrics
- Findings based on limited set of models (20+), relationship between model size and uncertainty may not hold across different architectures

## Confidence
- High confidence: Core observation that accuracy and uncertainty are not aligned in VLMs, supported by multiple datasets and models
- Medium confidence: Chat-finetuned models exhibit lower uncertainty than base models, requiring broader model coverage for validation
- Medium confidence: Significant model size increases needed for uncertainty reduction, dependent on architectural specifics

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the same uncertainty-aware methodology on open-ended VQA tasks and generation-based benchmarks to test generalizability beyond multiple-choice settings
2. Test the exchangeability assumption by evaluating conformal prediction under domain-shifted and temporal data splits to assess real-world applicability
3. Compare the proposed uncertainty quantification approach against alternative calibration metrics (e.g., Brier score, Negative Log-Likelihood) to validate the dismissal of ECE and MCE
