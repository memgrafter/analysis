# Entity Insertion in Multilingual Linked Corpora: The Case of Wikipedia

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2410.04254
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04254
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: XLOCEI achieves 0.726 Hits@1 and 0.789 MRR across 20 Wikipedia languages, with minimal performance drop in zero-shot learning on unseen languages

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the novel task of entity insertion, where the goal is to identify the most suitable text span in a source article to insert a link to a target entity. The authors develop XLOCEI (Localized Entity Insertion), a multilingual model that outperforms all baseline models, including prompt-based ranking with large language models like GPT-4. The model achieves strong performance across 20 Wikipedia languages and can be applied in zero-shot manner on languages not seen during training with minimal performance drop. This work addresses a critical gap in entity linking research by focusing on adding new links rather than just disambiguating existing ones.

## Method Summary
The method uses a transformer encoder (XLM-RoBERTa) with an MLP ranking layer to jointly encode target entities and candidate text spans. A two-stage training pipeline is employed: Stage 1 uses existing Wikipedia links with dynamic context removal strategies (removing mentions, sentences, or spans) to simulate missing entity insertion scenarios, while Stage 2 refines the model using real added links from Wikipedia's edit history. The model incorporates knowledge injection of section titles and previously used mentions for target entities. A listwise ranking loss function is used to optimize the ranking of candidate spans based on their relevance to the target entity.

## Key Results
- XLOCEI achieves 0.726 Hits@1 and 0.789 MRR on average across 20 Wikipedia languages
- Outperforms all baseline models including prompt-based ranking with GPT-4
- Zero-shot performance on unseen languages drops by less than 5% compared to fine-tuned models
- Two-stage training with real added links significantly improves performance over single-stage training
- Dynamic context removal and knowledge injection of section titles and mentions enhance model performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Multilingual Knowledge Transfer
By jointly training on entity insertion examples in multiple languages, XLOCEI learns shared patterns and representations that can be applied to languages not seen during training. This enables effective zero-shot learning across languages, which is crucial for supporting the more than 300 language versions of Wikipedia.

### Mechanism 2: Two-Stage Training with Dynamic Context Removal
The first stage uses existing links with dynamic context removal to simulate missing mentions, sentences, or spans, while the second stage uses real added links to refine the model with actual entity insertion examples. This approach effectively simulates real-world scenarios and improves performance.

### Mechanism 3: Knowledge Injection of Section Titles and Mentions
Incorporating section titles and previously used mentions for target entities provides additional context and signals that help the model better understand the relevance of candidate text spans. Section titles offer summarized conceptualization while previously used mentions indicate typical entity references in text.

## Foundational Learning

- **Transformer-based models and their pre-training/fine-tuning paradigm**: The entity insertion model is based on a transformer encoder, which requires understanding of how these models work and how they can be fine-tuned for specific tasks. *Quick check: What is the difference between a transformer encoder and a transformer decoder, and why is an encoder suitable for the entity insertion task?*

- **Entity linking and named entity recognition (NER)**: Entity insertion is related to entity linking and NER, as it involves identifying relevant entities and their mentions in text. Understanding these concepts is crucial for grasping the differences and challenges of entity insertion. *Quick check: How does entity insertion differ from entity linking, and what are the key challenges in entity insertion that are not present in entity linking?*

- **Ranking tasks and loss functions**: Entity insertion is framed as a ranking task, where the model needs to rank candidate text spans based on their relevance to a target entity. Understanding ranking tasks and appropriate loss functions is essential for implementing the model. *Quick check: What is the difference between pointwise and listwise ranking loss functions, and why is a listwise ranking loss suitable for the entity insertion task?*

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Transformer encoder (XLM-RoBERTa) -> MLP ranking layer -> Relevance score -> Ranked candidate spans
- **Critical path**: Target entity and candidate text spans -> Transformer encoder produces contextualized embeddings -> MLP produces relevance scores -> Candidate spans ranked by scores -> Highest-ranked span selected for insertion
- **Design tradeoffs**: Single encoder simplifies architecture but may lose information compared to triple encoder approach; listwise ranking loss directly optimizes ranking task versus pointwise loss treating candidates independently
- **Failure signatures**: Poor performance on missing entity insertion scenarios indicates inadequate context simulation; degradation in zero-shot performance suggests multilingual transfer issues; overfitting manifests as high training performance but low test performance
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Ablation study removing each component to measure performance impact; 2) Zero-shot evaluation on languages not seen during training; 3) Error analysis examining model predictions to identify common failure modes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How would increasing model size (beyond RoBERTa base and large) impact entity insertion performance in low-resource languages?
- **Basis in paper**: The paper notes that larger models could be especially beneficial in the multilingual setting to improve support for low-resource languages, but this was not tested.
- **Why unresolved**: The authors only tested RoBERTa base and large models, finding no significant difference in performance. The potential benefits of even larger models in multilingual settings were not explored.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Empirical comparison of entity insertion performance using different sized transformer models (XL, XXL) across a range of low-resource languages would clarify if larger models provide meaningful improvements.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: What is the optimal balance between first-stage (existing links) and second-stage (added links) training data for maximum entity insertion performance?
- **Basis in paper**: The paper found that performance improved drastically with more second-stage data but showed no visible improvement with varying first-stage data sizes, suggesting the optimal training schedule involves minimal first-stage data and maximal second-stage data.
- **Why unresolved**: While the paper provides evidence that second-stage data is more valuable, it doesn't specify the optimal ratio or amount of data needed in each stage for different language scenarios.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Systematic experiments varying both first and second stage data amounts across multiple languages, measuring the point of diminishing returns for each stage, would establish optimal training data balances.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: How does the inclusion of multilingual knowledge graphs or cross-lingual entity embeddings impact entity insertion performance compared to using only text-based features?
- **Basis in paper**: The paper uses text-based features and shows multilingual transfer learning improves performance, but doesn't explore structured knowledge sources like knowledge graphs or cross-lingual entity embeddings.
- **Why unresolved**: The authors suggest future improvements could come from integrating additional information from local Wikipedia graph structure or candidate context, but don't test these approaches.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Direct comparison of entity insertion models using only text features versus models augmented with multilingual knowledge graph embeddings or cross-lingual entity representations would demonstrate the value of structured knowledge sources.

## Limitations

- The dataset accessibility details are limited, potentially creating barriers for reproduction despite mention of Zenodo availability
- Evaluation focuses on Wikipedia's link structure, which may not generalize to other knowledge bases or domains
- Zero-shot transfer assumptions may not hold for all language pairs due to varying structural similarities in entity referencing

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The experimental methodology and baseline comparisons are rigorous, with clear implementation details for the XLOCEI architecture and training procedure
- **Medium confidence**: The multilingual transfer claims are supported by empirical results but lack deeper analysis of what specific linguistic features enable cross-language knowledge transfer
- **Medium confidence**: The two-stage training pipeline's effectiveness is demonstrated through performance improvements, though the ablation study could provide stronger evidence for each component's contribution

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study verification**: Systematically remove each component (dynamic context removal strategies, knowledge injection of section titles and mentions, two-stage training) and measure performance impact to identify which elements contribute most to the observed improvements.

2. **Cross-lingual pattern analysis**: Analyze model predictions across language pairs to identify which linguistic features (syntax, entity naming conventions, discourse structure) enable successful zero-shot transfer, and test on language pairs with varying degrees of typological similarity.

3. **Generalization test**: Evaluate the model on a non-Wikipedia corpus (e.g., news articles or scientific papers) to assess whether the learned entity insertion patterns transfer beyond Wikipedia's specific editing conventions and link structures.
