core_contribution: The paper proposes SimPro, a simple probabilistic framework for
  realistic long-tailed semi-supervised learning (ReaLTSSL) where the class distribution
  of unlabeled data is unknown and potentially mismatched with labeled data. The core
  idea is to explicitly decouple the modeling of conditional and marginal class distributions
  within the EM algorithm, leading to a closed-form solution for marginal distribution
  estimation and the formulation of a Bayes classifier.
