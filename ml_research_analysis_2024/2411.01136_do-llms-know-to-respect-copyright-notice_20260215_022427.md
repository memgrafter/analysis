# Do LLMs Know to Respect Copyright Notice?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.01136
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01136
- Reference count: 18
- LLMs frequently reproduce copyrighted content despite copyright notices

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether large language models respect copyright notices in user-provided input. Using a benchmark dataset of 43,200 queries across books, news articles, movie scripts, and code documentation, experiments with multiple popular LLMs reveal that most models generate content that violates copyright by reproducing, extracting, paraphrasing, or translating copyrighted text despite copyright notices. GPT-4 Turbo demonstrated significantly higher refusal rates and lower infringement scores. Simple mitigation strategies—adding copyright keywords or repeated warning messages—significantly reduced copyright violations, with the strongest effect when both methods were combined.

## Method Summary
The researchers created a benchmark dataset of 43,200 queries using copyrighted materials from various sources with different copyright notice types. They tested multiple LLMs (LLaMA-3, Mistral, Mixtral, Gemma-2, GPT-4 Turbo) using diverse query formulations and measured copyright compliance through ROUGE, LCS, BERTScore, and cosine similarity metrics, along with refusal rates judged by GPT-4.

## Key Results
- Most LLMs generate high-content reproduction (50-86% ROUGE scores) when prompted to repeat or extract copyrighted content, regardless of copyright notices
- GPT-4 Turbo showed significantly higher refusal rates and lower infringement scores compared to other models
- Simple prompt modifications (adding copyright keywords or repeated warnings) significantly reduced copyright violations, with maximum effect when combined

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs reproduce copyrighted text when instructed to "repeat" or "extract" content, regardless of copyright notices
- Mechanism: LLMs rely on pattern matching and language generation rather than copyright detection when given direct extraction or repetition instructions
- Core assumption: The model treats user instructions as primary drivers, ignoring legal constraints unless explicitly aligned
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "most models generate content that violates copyright by reproducing, extracting, paraphrasing, or translating copyrighted text despite copyright notices."
  - [section] "All LLMs generate responses with high ROUGE scores (50% to 86%) and LCS ratios (14% to 67%) when prompted to repeat or to extract a part of copyrighted content, even when explicitly told the content is copyrighted."
  - [corpus] Weak. Corpus neighbors discuss copyright detection but not model instruction-following behaviors
- Break condition: If models are explicitly aligned to detect and refuse copyright-violating instructions, this mechanism weakens

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: GPT-4 Turbo shows higher refusal rates and lower infringement scores due to alignment training
- Mechanism: Post-training alignment reduces direct reproduction of copyrighted material when explicit copyright information is present
- Core assumption: Alignment training modifies model behavior to prioritize legal/ethical compliance over strict instruction-following
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "GPT-4 Turbo showed significantly higher refusal rates and lower infringement scores."
  - [section] "GPT-4 Turbo is the only exception, when we use a simple 'All Rights Reserved' copyright notice, the generation of GPT-4 Turbo shifts in the direction that results in a lower ROUGE score."
  - [corpus] Weak. No direct corpus evidence about alignment effects on copyright behavior
- Break condition: If alignment training is removed or overridden by strong user instructions, this mechanism breaks

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Simple prompt modifications (adding copyright keywords or warnings) reduce copyright violations
- Mechanism: Explicit reminders in prompts trigger the model's existing ethical/legal constraints
- Core assumption: LLMs retain some alignment to copyright rules when prompted explicitly, even if not consistently applied
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Simple mitigation strategies—adding copyright keywords or repeated warning messages—significantly reduced copyright violations."
  - [section] "Both methods have a positive effect on mitigating GPT-4 Turbo's violation of copyright, and the benefit is accumulative when both methods are combined."
  - [corpus] Weak. No corpus evidence about prompt modification effects
- Break condition: If prompt modifications are removed or if the model is explicitly instructed to ignore warnings, this mechanism fails

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: ROUGE score and LCS ratio as metrics for content reproduction
  - Why needed here: To quantify how closely model outputs match original copyrighted text
  - Quick check question: What does a high ROUGE score indicate about model behavior toward copyrighted content?

- Concept: Refusal rate as an alignment metric
  - Why needed here: To measure whether models detect and refuse copyright-violating requests
  - Quick check question: How does refusal rate differ from content similarity metrics in evaluating copyright compliance?

- Concept: Prompt rewriting as importance sampling
  - Why needed here: To estimate model behavior across diverse query formulations
  - Quick check question: Why does rewriting prompts with another LLM help assess copyright awareness more robustly?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: User prompt → Context prompt (copyrighted material + notice) → LLM → Response evaluation (ROUGE/LCS/BERTScore/CosSim) → GPT Judge refusal assessment
- Critical path: Query formulation → Model inference → Output evaluation → Compliance determination
- Design tradeoffs: Balance between strict copyright protection and useful content extraction; alignment training vs. model capability
- Failure signatures: High ROUGE scores with low refusal rates indicate copyright violation; inconsistent behavior across similar prompts suggests weak alignment
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test model response to "repeat" vs. "extract" instructions on identical copyrighted content
  2. Compare refusal rates with and without explicit copyright warnings in prompts
  3. Measure performance differences across varying copyright notice types (original, all rights reserved, no notice)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do large language models' behaviors change when handling copyrighted material with varying levels of copyright notice complexity?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses that different notice types (Original, All Rights Reserved, No Notices) are used to evaluate LLM responses, but notes that most models behaved almost indifferently to the specific notice types, with GPT-4 Turbo being the only exception showing moderate compliance improvements
- Why unresolved: The study found that most models did not significantly change their behavior based on copyright notice types, suggesting that current models may not effectively parse or respond to different copyright notice complexities
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of model responses to increasingly detailed copyright notices (from simple "All Rights Reserved" to complex legal disclaimers) to identify if and how notice complexity affects compliance rates

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does model size correlate with improved copyright compliance in language models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that while larger models generally showed moderate improvements over smaller ones, GPT-4 Turbo (proprietary, larger) demonstrated significantly better compliance than open-source models of various sizes
- Why unresolved: The study observed that larger models didn't show significant dominance over smaller models in copyright awareness, except for GPT-4 Turbo, suggesting that size alone may not be the determining factor for copyright compliance
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic testing of models across a wider range of sizes (including models exceeding 300 billion parameters) to determine if there's a threshold size where copyright compliance becomes significantly better

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the most effective combination of prompt modification strategies for reducing copyright violations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper tested two simple prompt modifications (adding copyright keywords and repeating warning messages) and found that their combination significantly improved compliance, though didn't completely solve the issue
- Why unresolved: While the study showed that combining both methods was more effective than either alone, it didn't explore the optimal number of warnings or the most effective keyword placement strategies
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive grid search testing different combinations of warning frequencies and keyword variations to identify the optimal prompt modification strategy for maximum copyright compliance

## Limitations
- Dataset composition bias with uneven representation across content types, particularly underrepresenting code documentation
- Evaluation methodology using GPT-4 as judge introduces potential circular validation problems
- Prompt rewriting approach using GPT-4 may introduce semantic inconsistencies in query formulations

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Most LLMs reproduce copyrighted content when instructed to "repeat" or "extract" regardless of copyright notices
- **Medium confidence**: GPT-4 Turbo shows higher refusal rates and lower infringement scores, though evaluation methodology may introduce bias
- **Low confidence**: Effectiveness of simple mitigation strategies lacks external validation and may not generalize to all contexts

## Next Checks
1. Cross-validation with human judges to assess copyright violations and quantify potential bias in GPT-4 judge assessments
2. Code documentation-specific testing with balanced dataset representation to test domain-specific copyright notice effectiveness
3. Real-world prompt testing using actual user queries from forums and documentation to assess ecological validity of copyright compliance findings
