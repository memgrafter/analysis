# Higher-Order Topological Directionality and Directed Simplicial Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.08389
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08389
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Dir-SNNs achieve 100% accuracy distinguishing non-isomorphic digraphs, outperforming Dir-GNNs at 50% accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel notion of higher-order directionality in topological deep learning by defining directed simplicial complexes and introducing Directed Simplicial Neural Networks (Dir-SNNs). Unlike most existing models that ignore directional information, Dir-SNNs leverage higher-order directional relationships through message-passing mechanisms on directed flag complexes. The method is shown to be more expressive than directed graph neural networks (Dir-GNNs) in distinguishing isomorphic directed graphs, with experiments demonstrating 100% accuracy on synthetic source localization tasks.

## Method Summary
Dir-SNNs operate on directed simplicial complexes constructed from directed graphs using the directed flag complex lifting. The model uses message-passing along directed adjacencies (down and up adjacencies between simplices) defined through face maps and simplicial paths. A specific instance of Dir-SNN was employed using four directed adjacency relations (A0,0↓,1, A0,1↓,1, A1,0↓,1, A1,1↓,1) without boundary and coboundary information. The model was trained on synthetic graphs generated via Stochastic Block Model with edge signals diffused from source spikes, using convolutional architectures for message functions and aggregators.

## Key Results
- Dir-SNNs achieve 100% accuracy in distinguishing non-isomorphic directed graphs, while Dir-GNNs achieve only 50% accuracy
- Dir-SNNs outperform undirected SNNs and Dir-GNNs on directed flag complexes in source localization tasks
- Dir-SNNs maintain comparable performance to undirected models on undirected structures
- Theoretical proof establishes that Dir-SNNs are more expressive than Dir-GNNs, supported by a counterexample

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Dir-SNNs can distinguish non-isomorphic directed graphs better than Dir-GNNs by leveraging higher-order directional relationships through directed simplicial complexes.
- Mechanism: By lifting directed graphs into directed simplicial complexes and using message-passing on directed adjacencies (down and up adjacencies between simplices), Dir-SNNs capture structural information inaccessible to Dir-GNNs that only operate on pairwise node relationships.
- Core assumption: The directed flag complex lifting preserves distinguishability of non-isomorphic digraphs, and the additional higher-order directional information provides discriminative power.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Experiments on a synthetic source localization task demonstrate that Dir-SNNs outperform undirected SNNs and Dir-GNNs on directed flag complexes"
  - [section III]: "We theoretically and empirically prove that directed simplicial neural networks can distinguish isomorphic directed graphs better than directed graph neural networks"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus neighbors focus on general TDL but don't specifically address directionality improvements

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The specific definition of higher-order directionality through face maps and simplicial paths provides a consistent and meaningful way to capture directed relationships in topological structures.
- Mechanism: By defining directed adjacencies between simplices using face maps (removing vertices systematically) and simplicial paths (sequences of adjacent simplices), Dir-SNNs can leverage these relationships for message-passing, capturing directed flows that undirected models cannot.
- Core assumption: The simplicial path theory provides a sound mathematical foundation for defining higher-order directionality in directed simplicial complexes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section III]: "We define directed relations among simplices in a directed simplicial complex K using face maps" and "Higher-order directionality reveals novel, discriminative structural properties"
  - [section II]: "A (k, i, j)-simplicial path between an ordered pair of simplices (σ, τ) in K is a sequence of simplices... such that each consecutive pair (αk, αk+1) is (k, i, j)-adjacent"
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence in corpus neighbors about face map-based directionality

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Dir-SNNs generalize Dir-GNNs while maintaining computational efficiency through selective use of boundary and coboundary adjacencies.
- Mechanism: By operating on directed simplicial complexes but using only specific directed adjacencies (like the four directed edge adjacencies mentioned in the experiments), Dir-SNNs can leverage higher-order structure without the full computational overhead of all possible adjacencies.
- Core assumption: The selected subset of directed adjacencies provides sufficient discriminative power while being computationally tractable.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section III]: "Remark. In (8) and (10), single message functions ψB and ψC are used for computational efficiency"
  - [section IV-A]: "we decided to employ a specific instance of Dir-SNN that operates on the four directed adjacency relations described by A0,0↓,1, A0,1↓,1, A1,0↓,1, A1,1↓,1, without considering boundary and coboundary"
  - [corpus]: No corpus evidence about computational efficiency tradeoffs

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Directed simplicial complexes and face maps
  - Why needed here: Understanding how directed simplices are constructed and how face maps systematically remove vertices is fundamental to grasping the higher-order directional relationships that Dir-SNNs leverage
  - Quick check question: Given a directed 2-simplex (triangle) (0,1,2), what are the resulting directed 1-simplices (edges) when applying face maps d0, d1, and d2?

- Concept: Simplicial paths and directed adjacencies
  - Why needed here: The notion of simplicial paths through directed adjacencies is the core mechanism by which Dir-SNNs capture directional information in higher-order structures
  - Quick check question: If simplices σ = (0,1,2) and τ = (1,2,3) share the edge (1,2), are they down (1,0,2)-adjacent? Why or why not?

- Concept: Graph lifting and isomorphism preservation
  - Why needed here: Understanding how directed flag complex lifting maps digraphs to directed simplicial complexes while preserving isomorphism classes is crucial for understanding why Dir-SNNs can distinguish non-isomorphic digraphs
  - Quick check question: If two directed graphs are isomorphic, what can we say about their corresponding directed flag complexes?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input directed simplicial complex -> Initialize features on simplices -> For each layer: compute messages via ψ functions along directed adjacencies -> Aggregate messages -> Update simplex features via ϕ -> Repeat for L layers -> Output final simplex features -> Classification/regression head

- Critical path: Input directed simplicial complex -> Initialize features on simplices -> For each layer: compute messages via ψ functions along directed adjacencies -> Aggregate messages -> Update simplex features via ϕ -> Repeat for L layers -> Output final simplex features -> Classification/regression head

- Design tradeoffs: Using all possible directed adjacencies provides maximum expressiveness but high computational cost; using selective adjacencies reduces computation but may lose discriminative power; including boundary and coboundary information adds expressiveness but increases complexity; omitting them improves efficiency but may miss important structural information.

- Failure signatures: Poor performance on directed tasks but good performance on undirected tasks suggests the directed adjacencies aren't being effectively utilized; performance similar to Dir-GNNs indicates the higher-order structure isn't adding value; failure to distinguish clearly non-isomorphic digraphs suggests issues with the lifting or message-passing mechanism.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify that Dir-SNN can distinguish the two non-isomorphic digraphs from Figure 8 that Dir-GNN cannot, using the same experimental setup as described
  2. Test Dir-SNN performance on the source localization task with varying levels of noise to understand robustness and compare with Dir-GNN and GCN baselines
  3. Evaluate the computational cost of Dir-SNN versus Dir-GNN and SNN on synthetic datasets of varying size to understand the efficiency tradeoff

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the theoretical expressiveness gap between Dir-SNNs and Dir-GNNs be quantified beyond the specific counterexample shown in Fig. 8?
- Basis in paper: The paper proves Theorem 1 showing Dir-SNNs are more expressive than Dir-GNNs, but only demonstrates this with a specific counterexample.
- Why unresolved: The proof relies on showing a specific pair of non-isomorphic graphs that Dir-SNNs can distinguish but Dir-GNNs cannot. A general quantification of the expressiveness gap remains open.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal analysis showing bounds on the number or fraction of non-isomorphic graph pairs that Dir-SNNs can distinguish but Dir-GNNs cannot, possibly using probabilistic methods or combinatorial arguments.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do different choices of face map-dependent message functions (as mentioned in the Remark section) affect the expressiveness and performance of Dir-SNNs?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions in a Remark that using face map-dependent message functions could leverage more fine-grained directed information, but does not explore this.
- Why unresolved: The current Dir-SNN formulation uses single message functions for boundary and coboundary, but the potential benefits of more granular message functions are not investigated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing Dir-SNNs with and without face map-dependent message functions on various directed graph datasets, measuring both expressiveness and performance metrics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the computational complexity of Dir-SNNs compared to Dir-GNNs, particularly for higher-dimensional simplicial complexes?
- Basis in paper: The paper introduces Dir-SNNs but does not analyze their computational complexity relative to Dir-GNNs or undirected SNNs.
- Why unresolved: While the paper proves theoretical expressiveness advantages, it does not address the practical computational costs, which could limit real-world applicability.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed complexity analysis comparing the time and space requirements of Dir-SNNs and Dir-GNNs as a function of graph size, dimension, and number of simplices, along with empirical runtime comparisons.

## Limitations

- Limited empirical validation: Experiments only use synthetic data with a single source localization task, leaving real-world applicability uncertain
- Unproven isomorphism preservation: The critical assumption that directed flag complex lifting preserves isomorphism classes is not rigorously proven
- Selective adjacencies tradeoff: Using only four directed adjacencies improves efficiency but may sacrifice important structural information without proper justification

## Confidence

- High: The theoretical framework for higher-order directionality using face maps and simplicial paths is mathematically sound and well-established in simplicial topology
- Medium: The claim that Dir-SNNs achieve 100% accuracy on distinguishing non-isomorphic digraphs is supported by experimental results, but the generality to other graph structures and tasks remains unproven
- Low: The assertion that Dir-SNNs generalize Dir-GNNs while maintaining computational efficiency lacks rigorous proof and empirical validation across diverse datasets

## Next Checks

1. **Rigorous Isomorphism Preservation Analysis**: Formally prove or disprove whether the directed flag complex lifting preserves isomorphism classes for all digraphs, not just those in the synthetic dataset

2. **Scalability and Efficiency Benchmarking**: Conduct experiments on larger, real-world directed graphs to measure computational cost and compare against Dir-GNNs, including ablation studies on the impact of using all vs. selective directed adjacencies

3. **Cross-Task Generalization Study**: Test Dir-SNNs on diverse downstream tasks (e.g., node classification, link prediction) in both directed and undirected settings to assess robustness and generalizability beyond source localization
