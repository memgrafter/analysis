# Enhancing Q&A with Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning and Iterative Reasoning: A Comparative Study

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.11792
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11792
- Reference count: 34
- Combining fine-tuned embedding models with fine-tuned LLMs improves accuracy, with greatest gains from embedding model fine-tuning

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how domain-specific fine-tuning and iterative reasoning mechanisms can improve question-answering systems using large language models and retrieval-augmented generation. The study focuses on financial analysis using SEC filings from the FinanceBench dataset, comparing generic RAG systems with configurations that include fine-tuned embedding models, fine-tuned LLMs, and iterative reasoning through the OODA loop. Results show that while both fine-tuning approaches improve accuracy, the greatest gains come from fine-tuning embedding models. Incorporating iterative reasoning delivers the largest performance boost, achieving accuracy levels close to human-expert quality.

## Method Summary
The research employs a structured technical design space for Q&A AI systems, evaluating four main configurations: generic RAG, RAG with fine-tuned embedding models, RAG with fine-tuned LLMs, and fully fine-tuned RAG. The study uses the FinanceBench SEC financial filings dataset with 141 question-answer pairs, fine-tuning bge-large-en embedding models and gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 LLMs on a random subset of 100 training pairs. The OODA reasoning mechanism is integrated as an iterative reasoning approach. Evaluation combines automated metrics with human assessment to measure accuracy improvements across different configurations.

## Key Results
- Combining fine-tuned embedding models with fine-tuned LLMs achieves better accuracy than generic models
- Fine-tuned embedding models provide relatively greater accuracy gains compared to fine-tuned generative models
- Iterative reasoning (OODA) delivers the largest performance boost, enabling Q&A systems to approach human-expert quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Fine-tuning embedding models improves retrieval relevance more than fine-tuning generative models in RAG systems by adjusting semantic mappings for domain-specific terminology. Domain-specific jargon and concepts have different semantic representations in generic versus fine-tuned embedding spaces, leading to more accurate document retrieval when fine-tuned.

### Mechanism 2
Iterative reasoning mechanisms like OODA significantly improve answer accuracy by enabling multi-step decomposition and verification. The OODA loop allows systems to observe information, orient to context, decide on reasoning steps, and act iteratively, breaking complex questions into simpler sub-questions and verifying internal consistency.

### Mechanism 3
Fine-tuning on domain-specific data improves model performance by capturing domain-specific patterns and formatting requirements. Training on domain examples allows models to learn specific terminology, logical structures, and presentation formats expected in specialized domains like financial analysis.

## Foundational Learning

- **Vector space representations and semantic similarity**: Understanding how embedding models map text to vectors and how similarity metrics work is crucial for grasping why fine-tuning embeddings improves retrieval. *Quick check: If two financial terms are semantically similar in the domain but different in general usage, how would their vector representations change after fine-tuning?*

- **Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline**: The paper builds on RAG as the foundational architecture, so understanding how retrieval and generation components interact is essential. *Quick check: In a RAG system, what happens to the quality of generated answers if the retrieved documents are irrelevant to the query?*

- **Iterative reasoning and task decomposition**: The OODA mechanism relies on breaking down complex problems into manageable sub-tasks, which is key to understanding why it improves performance. *Quick check: How does iterative reasoning differ from a single-pass approach when answering multi-hop questions?*

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Query → Embedding Model → Document Retrieval → Context Augmentation → Generative Model → Answer. When OODA is added, the critical path becomes iterative with multiple cycles through this path.

- **Critical path**: The critical path for answer generation flows through embedding model, retrieval, context augmentation, and generative model components, with iterative reasoning adding multiple cycles.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Fine-tuning embedding models offers better performance gains per resource than fine-tuning generative models but requires domain-specific training data. OODA significantly improves accuracy but adds computational overhead and latency. Generic models are faster to deploy but may underperform on domain-specific tasks.

- **Failure signatures**: Poor retrieval quality manifests as irrelevant or missing documents in context. Poor generation quality appears as factually incorrect answers or answers that don't follow domain-specific formats. OODA failures show up as infinite loops or increasingly irrelevant sub-questions.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Compare generic RAG vs. fine-tuned embedding model RAG on a small subset of FinanceBench to measure retrieval improvement
  2. Add OODA reasoning to generic RAG and measure accuracy improvement on complex questions
  3. Fine-tune both embedding and generative models and compare against single-component fine-tuning to quantify combined benefits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What is the optimal size and composition of the training dataset for fine-tuning embedding models in domain-specific RAG systems? The paper notes that performance either did not improve or decreased when using synthetic training data generated by GPT-3.5, but does not provide systematic analysis of optimal training data approaches.

### Open Question 2
How does the performance of OODA reasoning in RAG systems vary across different domains and question types? The paper demonstrates effectiveness in financial analysis but does not explore generalizability across diverse domains and question types.

### Open Question 3
What is the optimal balance between fine-tuning embedding models and language models for domain-specific RAG systems? While the paper shows embedding model fine-tuning provides higher accuracy gains, it does not explore the trade-offs and potential synergies between the two approaches.

## Limitations
- Results are based on a single domain (financial analysis) using one dataset, limiting generalizability
- Evaluation relies on automated metrics and human assessment of a limited set of 141 question-answer pairs
- The study does not provide systematic analysis of optimal training data composition and size

## Confidence

- **High**: The core finding that iterative reasoning (OODA) significantly improves accuracy across all configurations is well-supported by structured comparison and consistent results
- **Medium**: The claim that fine-tuned embedding models provide greater accuracy gains than fine-tuned generative models is supported but could benefit from more extensive ablation studies
- **Medium**: The assertion that the proposed technical design space comprehensively captures key Q&A system choices is conceptually sound but not empirically validated across diverse domains

## Next Checks
1. Test the fine-tuning and reasoning mechanisms across at least three additional specialized domains (e.g., legal, medical, technical support) to assess domain transfer capability
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the marginal benefit of combining fine-tuned embeddings with fine-tuned generators versus either alone
3. Implement long-term monitoring to detect model drift and performance degradation in production environments using the proposed framework
