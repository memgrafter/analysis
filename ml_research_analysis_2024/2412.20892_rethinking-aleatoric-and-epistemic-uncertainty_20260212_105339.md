# Rethinking Aleatoric and Epistemic Uncertainty

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2412.20892
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20892
- **Reference count:** 19
- **Primary result:** Challenges the aleatoric-epistemic uncertainty framework, proposing a decision-theoretic alternative that unifies predictive uncertainty, performance, and data dispersion concepts

## Executive Summary
This paper argues that the widely-used aleatoric-epistemic uncertainty framework in machine learning conflates distinct concepts and leads to confusion. The authors propose a decision-theoretic perspective that unifies key ideas: predictive uncertainty is defined as the expected loss of acting Bayes-optimally under a model's beliefs, and expected uncertainty reduction can be rigorously defined by accounting for the data-generating process. The framework shows that popular information-theoretic quantities like BALD are often poor estimators of long-run predictive uncertainty but may better estimate short-run parameter uncertainty. Through experiments, the paper demonstrates that BALD's practical utility stems from its ability to estimate short-run parameter uncertainty reduction rather than long-run predictive uncertainty reduction.

## Method Summary
The paper compares two active learning approaches (BALD and predictive entropy) on the MNIST dataset using Bayesian neural networks with MC dropout. The experimental setup uses 10,000 training images, 1000 validation images, and 10,000 test images. The neural networks are trained for 100 epochs with batch size 64 and dropout probability of 0.1. The comparison focuses on test negative log likelihood as the primary metric, with the goal of understanding how different uncertainty quantification approaches affect active learning performance.

## Key Results
- The aleatoric-epistemic uncertainty framework conflates distinct concepts and leads to confusion in uncertainty quantification
- BALD's practical utility in active learning stems from estimating short-run parameter uncertainty reduction rather than long-run predictive uncertainty reduction
- Expected uncertainty reduction can be rigorously defined by accounting for the data-generating process, decomposing uncertainty into irreducible and reducible components
- Predictive performance and data dispersion are distinct from model-based uncertainty and should be treated separately

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** The decision-theoretic perspective provides a unified framework for measuring predictive uncertainty, predictive performance, and data dispersion.
- **Mechanism:** By defining uncertainty as the expected loss of acting Bayes-optimally under a model's beliefs, the framework grounds all three quantities in the same decision-theoretic foundation, allowing them to be related through a common loss function.
- **Core assumption:** The decision-maker has a well-defined loss function that reflects their preferences about model behavior.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "present a decision-theoretic perspective that relates rigorous notions of uncertainty, predictive performance and statistical dispersion in data."
  - [section] "uncertainty in predictive beliefs can be formalised as the subjective expected loss of acting Bayes-optimally under those beliefs"
  - [corpus] Weak - the corpus contains related work on aleatoric/epistemic uncertainty but doesn't directly address this unification mechanism

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Expected uncertainty reduction can be rigorously defined by accounting for the data-generating process.
- **Mechanism:** By explicitly modeling how training data is generated (ptrain(y1:n|π)) and how it updates beliefs, the framework can calculate the expected reduction in uncertainty from future data, decomposing it into irreducible and reducible components.
- **Core assumption:** The data-generating process can be modeled or approximated, even if imperfectly.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "expected uncertainty reduction can be rigorously defined by accounting for the data-generating process"
  - [section] "we define the distribution overy + 1:m to depend on decisions made by the data-acquisition policy,π, and on the previous data"
  - [corpus] Missing - corpus papers discuss data acquisition but don't show this specific mechanism for defining expected uncertainty reduction

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** BALD should be understood as an estimator of short-run parameter uncertainty reduction rather than long-run predictive uncertainty reduction.
- **Mechanism:** BALD (EIGθ) measures expected information gain in model parameters, which more closely tracks immediate parameter updates than asymptotic predictive changes, explaining its practical utility in active learning.
- **Core assumption:** The model's parameters are meaningful intermediate quantities that capture uncertainty relevant to short-term learning.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "BALD's practical utility stems from its ability to estimate short-run parameter uncertainty reduction rather than long-run predictive uncertainty reduction"
  - [section] "BALD more closely tracks short-run changes in parameter uncertainty than it does long-run changes in predictive uncertainty"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus contains related work on BALD but doesn't specifically address this short-run vs long-run distinction

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Decision-theoretic foundations**
  - Why needed here: The entire framework is built on decision theory principles, so understanding loss functions, Bayes optimality, and proper scoring rules is essential
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a proper scoring rule and a regular loss function in this context?

- **Concept: Information theory and entropy**
  - Why needed here: The paper heavily uses information-theoretic quantities like Shannon entropy, KL divergence, and information gain to formalize uncertainty
  - Quick check question: How does Shannon entropy relate to variance in the context of predictive uncertainty?

- **Concept: Bayesian inference and parameter estimation**
  - Why needed here: The framework assumes some form of Bayesian updating, whether exact or approximate, to reason about how uncertainty evolves with data
  - Quick check question: Why does the paper emphasize that the true update might not match the assumed update in practice?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Loss function specification -> Machine learning model -> Uncertainty quantification -> Data generation modeling -> Evaluation with proper scoring rules
- **Critical path:** Model → Uncertainty quantification → Expected uncertainty reduction → Data acquisition decisions
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Exact Bayesian inference vs computational efficiency (approximate methods)
  - Model complexity vs ability to accurately simulate future data
  - Short-term vs long-term uncertainty reduction objectives
  - Parameter uncertainty vs predictive uncertainty focus
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Poor performance when loss function poorly reflects actual preferences
  - Inaccurate uncertainty estimates when data-generating process is mis-specified
  - BALD performing poorly when short-run parameter uncertainty doesn't correlate with prediction improvement
  - Evaluation failures when external reference distributions are unreliable
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Implement the decision-theoretic uncertainty quantification on a simple regression problem with known ground truth
  2. Compare BALD vs predictive entropy acquisition on a synthetic active learning task where the true data-generating process is known
  3. Test the irreducible/reducible uncertainty decomposition on a conjugate Bayesian model where exact updates are possible

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** Under what specific conditions does BALD accurately estimate long-run predictive uncertainty reduction, and when does it fail?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper shows that BALD's approximation to infinite-step predictive information gain (IGz(y+1:∞)) can be coarse, and that the estimation error is due to the model's failure to accurately simulate future data when n is finite.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper demonstrates that BALD can be a poor estimator of long-run predictive uncertainty but provides limited characterization of when and why this occurs across different model classes and data distributions.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Empirical studies comparing BALD's accuracy across various model architectures (deep neural networks, Gaussian processes, ensemble methods), data distributions (discrete vs continuous, high-dimensional vs low-dimensional), and training set sizes would clarify the conditions under which BALD succeeds or fails as an estimator of long-run predictive uncertainty.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How does the decision-theoretic framework for uncertainty quantification perform in high-dimensional, real-world applications compared to traditional aleatoric-epistemic approaches?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper proposes a decision-theoretic perspective as an alternative to the aleatoric-epistemic view, but the experimental validation focuses on simple conjugate models in low-dimensional settings.
- **Why unresolved:** The framework's practical advantages and limitations in complex, high-dimensional domains (computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning) remain unexplored, particularly regarding computational scalability and robustness to model misspecification.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Comparative studies applying both frameworks to benchmark datasets in computer vision (e.g., ImageNet classification with uncertainty calibration), NLP (language model uncertainty quantification), and reinforcement learning (exploration strategies) would reveal the decision-theoretic approach's practical benefits and limitations.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** What are the implications of the decision-theoretic framework for model selection criteria that currently rely on information-theoretic uncertainty decompositions?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper shows that popular information-theoretic quantities like BALD can be poor estimators of long-run predictive uncertainty, suggesting that model selection criteria based on these quantities may be fundamentally flawed.
- **Why unresolved:** While the paper critiques existing approaches, it does not provide concrete alternatives for model selection that would replace criteria like Bayesian model averaging or information criteria that rely on epistemic uncertainty estimates.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Development and empirical validation of model selection criteria based on the decision-theoretic framework (e.g., using expected uncertainty reduction under realistic data acquisition policies) applied to real-world model comparison problems would demonstrate whether this represents a practical improvement over existing methods.

## Limitations
- The framework's reliance on well-defined loss functions is a significant limitation in many real-world applications where loss functions are poorly specified or context-dependent
- The ability to rigorously define expected uncertainty reduction depends on accurately modeling the data-generating process, which is a substantial challenge in complex domains
- The boundary between short and long-run uncertainty reduction is not rigorously defined, potentially leading to confusion about when BALD is appropriate

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The core critique of the aleatoric-epistemic framework and the decision-theoretic redefinition of predictive uncertainty
- **Medium confidence:** The interpretation of BALD as short-run parameter uncertainty reduction and its practical implications
- **Low confidence:** The general applicability of the framework across diverse domains and the ease of implementing the data-generating process modeling

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Domain Validation:** Test the framework on a non-image domain (e.g., time series forecasting or medical diagnosis) where loss functions are more complex and data-generating processes are less understood
2. **Robustness to Loss Function Misspecification:** Systematically vary the loss function in controlled experiments to quantify how sensitive the framework's outputs are to misspecification, particularly in active learning scenarios
3. **Data-Generating Process Approximation Quality:** Develop quantitative metrics to evaluate the quality of data-generating process approximations and measure how this quality impacts the accuracy of expected uncertainty reduction estimates
