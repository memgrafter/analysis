# Reducing Barriers to the Use of Marginalised Music Genres in AI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.13439
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13439
- Authors: Nick Bryan-Kinns; Zijin Li
- Reference count: 9
- Key outcome: Identifies challenges and opportunities for reducing barriers to using marginalised music genres with AI, focusing on lack of large datasets and difficulties in encoding non-notated musical traditions

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenges of using marginalised music genres in AI systems, particularly the lack of large datasets and difficulties encoding non-notated musical traditions. Through interviews with seven international experts and a hybrid workshop with 37 participants in the UK and China, the authors identify key barriers and opportunities for using Explainable AI (XAI) to make these genres more accessible. The research emphasizes that while working with marginalised music presents challenges, it strengthens cultural representation and addresses AI bias. The authors propose creating an online repository linking musical genres, AI models, and XAI explanations to support this work.

## Method Summary
The research employed Thematic Analysis on interview and workshop transcriptions from seven international experts and 37 workshop participants. The methodology involved conducting expert interviews, organizing a hybrid workshop with brainstorming and case study sharing, and analyzing the collected data to identify themes related to XAI challenges and opportunities in marginalised music genres.

## Key Results
- Small datasets of marginalised music can be effectively used in AI generation through targeted fine-tuning of large pre-trained models
- An online repository connecting musical genres, AI models, and XAI explanations lowers barriers to using marginalised music in AI
- Interdisciplinary collaboration and stakeholder engagement are critical for developing AI tools that respect and represent marginalised music traditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Small datasets of marginalised music can be effectively used in AI generation through targeted fine-tuning of large pre-trained models.
- Mechanism: The approach leverages existing knowledge from large models and adapts it to specific, culturally rich but data-sparse genres by fine-tuning with small datasets.
- Core assumption: Pre-trained models contain transferable musical features that remain relevant when adapted to new genres.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "fine tuning large models with small datasets to reduce bias"
  - [section 3] "fine-tuning large models with small datasets to reduce bias, augmenting small datasets using synthesised data"
- Break condition: If the pre-trained model's learned features are too genre-specific or culturally biased, transfer learning will fail to capture the essence of marginalised genres.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: An online repository connecting musical genres, AI models, and XAI explanations lowers barriers to using marginalised music in AI.
- Mechanism: The repository acts as a knowledge bridge, providing structured explanations of how different AI architectures relate to specific musical traditions and their encoding requirements.
- Core assumption: Musicians and researchers can navigate AI systems more effectively when provided with clear, genre-specific XAI explanations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "creating an online repository linking musical genres, AI models, and XAI explanations"
  - [section 4] "explanations of AI fine-tuning and style transfer opportunities between pre-trained deep AI models and the AI models and genres in the repository"
- Break condition: If the explanations are too technical or fail to address cultural nuances, the repository will not reduce barriers effectively.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Interdisciplinary collaboration and stakeholder engagement are critical for developing AI tools that respect and represent marginalised music traditions.
- Mechanism: Bringing together musicians, technologists, and cultural experts ensures that AI systems are designed with both technical feasibility and cultural sensitivity in mind.
- Core assumption: Effective AI tools for marginalised music require input from both technical experts and cultural practitioners.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3] "The need for an in-depth set of multidisciplinary skills and knowledge to balance music domain knowledge with AI skills"
  - [section 4] "Interdisciplinary collaborations; Community and stakeholder engagement"
- Break condition: If collaboration is superficial or dominated by technical perspectives, the resulting tools may perpetuate cultural misrepresentation.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Explainable AI (XAI)
  - Why needed here: XAI helps users understand how AI models make decisions, which is essential when working with culturally sensitive and underrepresented music genres.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why transparency in AI model training is particularly important when using small datasets of marginalised music?

- Concept: Transfer learning
  - Why needed here: Transfer learning allows knowledge from large, general-purpose models to be adapted to small, specific datasets, reducing the need for massive amounts of training data.
  - Quick check question: How does transfer learning help overcome the challenge of limited data in marginalised music genres?

- Concept: Cultural representation in AI
  - Why needed here: Ensuring that AI systems fairly represent diverse musical traditions prevents the marginalisation of already underrepresented cultures.
  - Quick check question: Why is it important to consider cultural context when developing AI models for music generation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Dataset repository -> AI model fine-tuning pipeline -> XAI explanation engine -> Musician interface
- Critical path: Dataset acquisition -> AI model fine-tuning -> XAI explanation generation -> Musician interaction
- Design tradeoffs: Prioritising cultural fidelity may require sacrificing some technical performance metrics
- Failure signatures: If marginalised genres are still underrepresented after deployment, the fine-tuning process or dataset curation may be flawed
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Fine-tune a pre-trained music generation model on a small dataset of Qin music and evaluate style preservation
  2. Build a prototype repository entry for a marginalised genre and test its usability with musicians
  3. Conduct a user study to assess whether XAI explanations improve understanding and control of AI models for music generation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific techniques are most effective for building datasets of marginalised music genres that lack conventional notation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies "new techniques for dataset building" as a key opportunity but doesn't specify which methods work best for oral traditions or non-notated music.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges this is a major barrier but doesn't provide concrete examples of successful dataset-building approaches for non-notated traditions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies comparing different dataset-building methods (audio transcription, metadata annotation, community collaboration) applied to specific marginalised genres, with metrics on dataset quality and usability for AI training.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we quantify and measure the reduction in AI bias when using small datasets of marginalised music genres?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that working with marginalised music "contributes to addressing issues of bias of deep learning models" but doesn't specify how to measure this impact.
- Why unresolved: While the paper claims benefits for cultural representation and bias reduction, it lacks concrete metrics or evaluation frameworks for measuring these outcomes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of bias metrics specific to musical AI, with longitudinal studies comparing model outputs before and after incorporating marginalised genre datasets.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal balance between model complexity and dataset size for generating high-quality music from marginalised genres?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses "fine-tuning large models with small datasets" and suggests "more experimentation with AI model selection" but doesn't provide guidance on optimal model-dataset combinations.
- Why unresolved: The paper recognizes that one AI model won't work for all genres but doesn't explore the relationship between model architecture complexity and dataset requirements for different musical traditions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments testing various model architectures (from simple to complex) with different dataset sizes across multiple marginalised genres, measuring output quality and computational efficiency.

## Limitations

- The evidence base is primarily qualitative, drawing from expert interviews and workshop discussions rather than quantitative validation of proposed approaches
- The effectiveness of transfer learning for culturally specific musical features remains unproven
- The technical feasibility and adoption potential of the proposed repository system is unknown

## Confidence

- **Medium**: The mechanism of fine-tuning large models with small datasets is theoretically sound but lacks empirical validation for the specific context of marginalised music genres
- **Medium**: The proposed online repository concept is well-reasoned but untested in practice
- **High**: The identification of interdisciplinary collaboration as crucial is strongly supported by the qualitative evidence and aligns with established best practices

## Next Checks

1. Conduct controlled experiments testing fine-tuning effectiveness on small datasets from 3-5 marginalised music genres
2. Develop and user-test a prototype repository interface with musicians from target communities
3. Implement and evaluate XAI explanations with musicians to assess comprehension and utility in real-world composition contexts
