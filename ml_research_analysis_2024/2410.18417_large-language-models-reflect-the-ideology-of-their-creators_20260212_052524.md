# Large Language Models Reflect the Ideology of their Creators

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2410.18417
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18417
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: Large language models reflect the ideologies of their creators, with significant normative differences between models from different geopolitical regions and even within the same region when prompted in different languages.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) reflect the ideologies of their creators by analyzing moral assessments of prominent political figures across multiple languages and models. Using a two-stage prompting strategy to elicit natural responses, the authors found significant ideological differences between LLMs from different geopolitical regions and even within the same region when prompted in different languages. Notably, among U.S. models, disparities in progressive values were observed, while Chinese models showed a division between internationally- and domestically-focused approaches. The results demonstrate that an LLM's ideological stance appears to reflect its creators' worldview, raising concerns about potential political instrumentalization and challenges to achieving ideological neutrality in AI systems.

## Method Summary
The study analyzed 19 LLMs from various geopolitical regions using a two-stage prompting strategy in six UN official languages. The first stage elicited natural descriptive responses about 3,991 political figures from the Pantheon dataset, while the second stage extracted moral assessments using Likert-scale questions. Responses were validated for quality and then annotated with 61 ideological categories from the Manifesto Project. The data was analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality, with results visualized through biplots, radar charts, and forest plots to compare ideological stances across models, languages, and regions.

## Key Results
- Significant normative differences exist between LLMs from different geopolitical regions when prompted in the same language
- The same LLM responds differently when prompted in different languages, reflecting language-specific training corpora
- Among U.S. models, disparities in progressive values were observed, while Chinese models showed a division between internationally- and domestically-focused approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Large language models reflect ideological biases of their creators through design choices in training and alignment.
- Mechanism: The training data selection, model architecture, and post-training interventions (like reinforcement learning from human feedback) encode the worldview of the creators into the model's behavior.
- Core assumption: Design choices are not ideologically neutral and reflect the creators' values and perspectives.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our results show that the ideological stance of an LLM appears to reflect the worldview of its creators."
  - [section] "Indeed, creating an LLM involves many human design choices [32] which may, intentionally or inadvertently, en-grain particular ideological views into its behavior."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence supporting this specific mechanism.
- Break condition: If models were trained on completely neutral, diverse data with no creator influence on selection or alignment.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The ideological stance of LLMs varies based on the language in which they are prompted.
- Mechanism: Different languages have different available training corpora, which reflect different cultural and ideological perspectives, causing the model to respond differently when prompted in different languages.
- Core assumption: Training data availability and content varies significantly across languages, encoding different ideological perspectives.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the responses of the same LLM when prompted in different languages" show normative differences.
  - [section] "We found normative differences between LLMs from different geopolitical regions, as well as between the responses of the same LLM when prompted in different languages."
  - [corpus] Moderate - related papers on multilingual LLMs show political ideology evaluation and steering vary across languages.
- Break condition: If models were truly multilingual with identical ideological training across all languages.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Ideological diversity exists within geopolitical blocs, not just between them.
- Mechanism: Different companies within the same region make different design choices based on their specific target markets and organizational values, leading to ideological variation even among models from the same country.
- Core assumption: Companies within a region can have meaningfully different target markets and organizational values.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Among only models in the United States, we find that popularly hypothesized disparities in political views are reflected in significant normative differences related to progressive values."
  - [section] "Among Chinese models, we characterize a division between internationally- and domestically-focused models."
  - [corpus] Moderate - related work on persona-based prompting shows LLMs can reflect different viewpoints even within the same system.
- Break condition: If all companies in a region made identical design choices or had identical target markets.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - Why needed here: Used to reduce the 61-dimensional ideological tag space to 2 dimensions for visualization and to identify the main axes of ideological variation.
  - Quick check question: If you have 61 ideology tags and apply PCA, what do the first two principal components represent?

- Concept: Two-stage prompting strategy
  - Why needed here: Stage 1 elicits natural descriptive responses about political figures, while Stage 2 extracts moral assessments from those responses, providing more ecologically valid results than direct questioning.
  - Quick check question: Why might asking "What do you think about X?" directly yield less reliable ideological information than the two-stage approach used here?

- Concept: Zero-centering and normalization
  - Why needed here: Necessary to compare scores across different languages and models that may use different scales or have different baseline positivity levels.
  - Quick check question: If one language group averages 0.8 on all tags and another averages 0.4, what must you do before comparing their relative preferences between tags?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data collection (prompting models in 6 UN languages about 3,991 political figures) → Validation (checking responses match Wikipedia and follow Likert scale) → Analysis (PCA, radar plots, forest plots) → Visualization (biplot, radar charts, forest plots)
- Critical path: Prompt generation → Model response collection → Response validation → Ideological tag assignment → Statistical analysis → Visualization
- Design tradeoffs: Natural prompting vs. forced single-label responses; comprehensive political figure selection vs. manageable dataset size; open-ended ideology exploration vs. structured analysis using Manifesto Project tags
- Failure signatures: High refusal rates in Stage 2; poor correlation between Stage 1 descriptions and Wikipedia; inconsistent Likert scale responses; models failing to support required languages
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run the two-stage prompting on a small subset (50 political figures) with one model in one language to verify the pipeline works
  2. Test the validation procedures on known good and bad responses to ensure they correctly identify issues
  3. Perform PCA on a small dataset to verify the dimensionality reduction produces interpretable results before scaling up

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can LLMs be systematically tuned to adopt specific ideological positions, and if so, what methods would be most effective?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper suggests that "our results and methodology may provide new tools to increase transparency about the ideological positions of their models, and possibly to fine-tune such positions" and mentions "incentivize LLM creators to develop robustly tunable LLMs."
- Why unresolved: The study demonstrates that ideological differences exist between LLMs but does not explore whether these positions can be deliberately modified through techniques like fine-tuning or prompt engineering.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments comparing LLM outputs before and after targeted training interventions designed to shift specific ideological markers, measuring changes in responses to political figures.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do informal language uses (dialects, romanized text) affect the ideological positions reflected by LLMs compared to formal language representations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that "most speakers of Arabic use dialects and many speakers write in romanized alphabets online" and acknowledges that "the ideological bias of informal Arabic use may be poorly represented in our results."
- Why unresolved: The study only used formal language representations (Modern Standard Arabic, Simplified Chinese) and did not investigate how ideological positions might shift when using regional dialects or informal writing systems.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of LLM responses to the same political figures using formal versus informal language variants across multiple languages.

### Open Question 3
- Question: To what extent do design choices (training data selection, alignment methods) versus training corpus ideological composition drive observed LLM ideological differences?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper states that "ideological stances are not merely the result of different ideological stances in the training corpora that are available in different languages, but also of different design choices" but does not quantify the relative contribution of each factor.
- Why unresolved: While the study identifies correlations between LLM origin and ideology, it cannot separate the effects of training data curation from other design decisions like alignment techniques.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of LLMs trained on identical corpora but with different design choices, or analysis of how modifying training data composition affects ideological outputs while holding other factors constant.

## Limitations

- The analysis relies on indirect inference from political figure assessments rather than direct measurement of model training data or design processes
- The zero-centering approach limits interpretation of absolute ideological positions, focusing only on relative differences
- The study cannot definitively establish whether observed differences reflect creators' intentional design choices or emergent properties from training data

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: That significant ideological differences exist between LLMs from different geopolitical regions when prompted in the same language
- **Medium Confidence**: That the same LLM responds differently when prompted in different languages, reflecting language-specific training corpora
- **Medium Confidence**: That disparities in progressive values exist among U.S. models and that Chinese models show domestic/international divisions
- **Lower Confidence**: That these differences definitively reflect creators' intentional design choices versus emergent properties

## Next Checks

1. **Training Data Audit**: Examine the actual training corpora used for each model to verify whether ideological differences correlate with systematic differences in training data composition across languages and regions.

2. **Cross-Model Prompt Sensitivity**: Test whether the observed ideological differences persist when using alternative prompting strategies (e.g., direct questioning, persona-based prompting) to rule out artifacts from the two-stage approach.

3. **Temporal Stability Analysis**: Evaluate whether ideological stances remain stable over time by re-testing a subset of models after 3-6 months to determine if positions shift with additional training or fine-tuning.
