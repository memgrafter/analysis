# Minimally Supervised Learning using Topological Projections in Self-Organizing Maps

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.06923
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06923
- Authors: Zimeng Lyu; Alexander Ororbia; Rui Li; Travis Desell
- Reference count: 6
- Key outcome: Proposed method significantly outperforms traditional regression techniques, deep neural networks, and Gaussian process regression for few-shot learning on high-dimensional data with limited labels.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel few-shot learning method using topological projections on self-organizing maps (SOMs) for parameter prediction with limited labeled data. The approach leverages the ability of SOMs to learn topological relationships from large unlabeled datasets, then uses these learned structures to make accurate predictions for unlabeled data by weighted averaging of nearby labeled samples. Experiments on coal power plant spectra data and appliance energy consumption data demonstrate that the method outperforms traditional regression techniques and deep learning models, even when those methods are given more labeled training data.

## Method Summary
The proposed method first trains SOMs on large unlabeled datasets to learn topological relationships between data points. Labeled data points are then mapped to the trained SOM's Best Matching Units (BMUs). For parameter prediction, the method computes pairwise distances between SOM nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm on the U-Matrix, which represents the distance relationships between neighboring nodes. Unlabeled data points are assigned parameter values based on weighted averages of the N nearest labeled neighbors, where weights are inversely proportional to the topological distance between nodes. This approach allows the method to leverage the intrinsic structure learned from unlabeled data to make accurate predictions with minimal labeled examples.

## Key Results
- The method significantly outperforms traditional regression techniques (linear, polynomial, Gaussian process, K-nearest neighbors) and deep neural networks on both coal power plant spectra data and appliance energy consumption data.
- Weighted averaging based on topological distance in SOM space provides more accurate parameter estimates than simple averaging or Euclidean distance-based approaches.
- The method achieves superior performance even when traditional methods are given more labeled training data, demonstrating its effectiveness for few-shot learning scenarios.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Topological preservation of SOM enables effective few-shot learning by capturing intrinsic data structure from unlabeled samples.
- Mechanism: SOM is trained on large unlabeled dataset, learning topological relationships between data points. Labeled data points are mapped to SOM nodes, and parameter predictions are made using weighted averages of nearest labeled neighbors in the SOM space.
- Core assumption: The topology learned by SOM from unlabeled data preserves meaningful relationships between data points that are useful for parameter prediction.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our proposed method first trains SOMs on unlabeled data and then a minimal number of available labeled data points are assigned to key best matching units (BMU)."
  - [section] "SOMs can transform high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional map (usually 2D) which can be easily represented visually through a U-Matrix, while preserving the topological and metric relationships of the original data."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence found for this specific mechanism, but related work on SOMs for clustering suggests topological preservation is a known property.
- Break condition: If the unlabeled data does not represent the true data distribution, the SOM topology will not capture meaningful relationships, leading to poor predictions.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Weighted averaging of nearest labeled neighbors in SOM space provides more accurate parameter estimates than simple averaging.
- Mechanism: Parameter estimates are computed as weighted averages where weights are inversely proportional to the topological distance between the unlabeled point's BMU and labeled neighbors' BMUs.
- Core assumption: Points closer in SOM space (shorter topological paths) are more likely to have similar parameter values.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The values estimated for newly-encountered data points are computed utilizing the average of the n closest labeled data points in the SOM's U-matrix in tandem with a topological shortest path distance calculation scheme."
  - [section] "This work utilizes the map topology to be able to project values for unlabeled data given a small number of labeled data points assigned to the map."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus shows related work on SOMs with KNN but not specifically on weighted averaging in SOM space.
- Break condition: If the labeled data points are too sparse or not well-distributed across the SOM, weighted averaging may not capture the true parameter landscape.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Topological distance calculations using Dijkstra's algorithm on the U-Matrix provide more accurate distance measurements than Euclidean distance alone.
- Mechanism: U-Matrix values represent distances between neighboring SOM nodes. Dijkstra's algorithm computes shortest paths through this graph, accounting for the actual topology learned by the SOM.
- Core assumption: The U-Matrix accurately represents the distance relationships between SOM nodes in the original high-dimensional space.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Following this, an example new unlabeled data point A is matched to its best matching unit (the green cell). The algorithm then uses Dijkstra's algorithm to graph calculate the pairwise distance between the green node with all the nodes that contain labeled data."
  - [section] "The proposed method first trains SOMs on unlabeled data for clustering, then the labeled data points are mapped to the trained SOM."
  - [corpus] Missing - no corpus evidence found for using Dijkstra's algorithm on U-Matrix for distance calculations.
- Break condition: If the U-Matrix does not accurately represent the original data topology, Dijkstra's algorithm will compute incorrect distances.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) and their training process
  - Why needed here: Understanding how SOMs learn topology from unlabeled data is crucial for understanding why this method works for few-shot learning.
  - Quick check question: What happens to neighboring SOM units during training when a data point is assigned to a BMU?

- Concept: Topological distance and U-Matrix representation
  - Why needed here: The method relies on calculating distances between SOM nodes using the U-Matrix, which requires understanding how these distances relate to the original data space.
  - Quick check question: How does the U-Matrix represent the distance between neighboring SOM nodes?

- Concept: Weighted averaging and regression techniques
  - Why needed here: The method uses weighted averaging of nearest labeled neighbors for parameter prediction, which requires understanding how weights affect the final estimate.
  - Quick check question: Why might weighted averaging be more effective than simple averaging for parameter prediction?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Unlabeled data → SOM training → U-Matrix generation → Dijkstra graph construction → Labeled data mapping → Parameter prediction (weighted averaging or regression)
- Critical path: SOM training with unlabeled data → Mapping labeled data to SOM → Calculating topological distances → Weighted averaging of nearest neighbors
- Design tradeoffs: Larger SOM grid size provides better topological representation but increases computational cost; more neighbors in weighted averaging provides more stable estimates but may include less relevant data points.
- Failure signatures: Poor performance when labeled data points are too sparse or clustered in SOM space; inaccurate predictions when unlabeled data does not represent true data distribution.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train SOM on unlabeled data and visualize U-Matrix to verify topological preservation
  2. Map labeled data to trained SOM and verify distribution across nodes
  3. Test parameter prediction with synthetic data where ground truth is known to validate weighted averaging approach

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal SOM grid size and number of neighbors for different types of high-dimensional data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "Table 1 shows the average prediction root mean squared error (RMSE) using different SOM sizes and number of nearest neighbors over 10 repeated runs using different data normalization methods for the coal dataset. The best RMSE for each of the different data normalization methods are marked in bold."
- Why unresolved: The paper only tested a limited range of SOM grid sizes (10x10 to 30x30) and number of neighbors (3 to 15) on the coal dataset. It is unclear if these are optimal settings for other types of high-dimensional data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing a wider range of SOM grid sizes and number of neighbors on diverse high-dimensional datasets would determine the optimal settings.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of the proposed method compare to other semi-supervised and few-shot learning algorithms on high-dimensional data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "Our results indicate that the proposed semi-supervised model significantly outperforms traditional regression techniques, including linear and polynomial regression, Gaussian process regression, K-nearest neighbors, as well as various deep neural network models." However, it does not compare to other semi-supervised or few-shot learning algorithms.
- Why unresolved: The paper only compares the proposed method to supervised regression techniques. It is unclear how it would perform against other semi-supervised or few-shot learning algorithms designed for high-dimensional data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the proposed method to other state-of-the-art semi-supervised and few-shot learning algorithms on high-dimensional datasets would determine its relative performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed method scale to even larger datasets with millions of high-dimensional data points?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "The energy dataset was recorded every 10 minutes and also has approximately 20k data points." and "This work utilizes two real-world datasets from the energy domain." The largest dataset used has only 20k data points.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tested the proposed method on datasets with up to 20k data points. It is unclear how well the method would scale to much larger datasets with millions of high-dimensional data points.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing the proposed method on synthetic and real-world datasets with millions of high-dimensional data points would determine its scalability.

## Limitations
- The method's performance critically depends on the quality of the SOM's topological preservation, which is sensitive to hyperparameter choices not fully specified in the paper.
- The approach assumes the unlabeled data represents the true data distribution, which may not hold in practice.
- The weighted averaging approach may be less effective when labeled data points are sparse or clustered in certain regions of the SOM space.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The general approach of using SOMs for clustering unlabeled data and leveraging topological relationships for few-shot learning is well-established in the literature.
- **Medium Confidence**: The specific weighted averaging method using topological distances and the experimental results showing superiority over traditional regression techniques and deep neural networks.
- **Low Confidence**: The effectiveness of Dijkstra's algorithm on the U-Matrix for distance calculations and the specific hyperparameter choices made in the experiments.

## Next Checks
1. **SOM Topology Validation**: Train SOMs on unlabeled data for both datasets and visualize U-Matrices to verify that topological relationships are preserved. Check that labeled data points are well-distributed across the SOM nodes.
2. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary SOM grid sizes, learning rates, and training epochs to assess impact on prediction accuracy and identify optimal settings.
3. **Synthetic Data Testing**: Generate synthetic datasets with known parameter relationships to validate the weighted averaging approach and assess how well the method captures ground truth parameters.
