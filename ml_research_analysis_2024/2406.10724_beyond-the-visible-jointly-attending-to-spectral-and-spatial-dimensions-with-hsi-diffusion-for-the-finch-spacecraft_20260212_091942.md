# Beyond the Visible: Jointly Attending to Spectral and Spatial Dimensions with HSI-Diffusion for the FINCH Spacecraft

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.10724
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10724
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: 3D diffusion model for hyperspectral image denoising achieves PSNR > 36 on synthetic satellite data

## Executive Summary
This paper presents HSI-Diffusion, a 3D diffusion model for hyperspectral image denoising specifically designed for the FINCH spacecraft mission. The approach addresses the critical challenge of striping and random noise in hyperspectral images through a novel three-stage training process that adapts U-Net architecture to 3D hyperspectral input, pre-trains on ICVL-HSI dataset, and fine-tunes on synthetic satellite hyperspectral data. The model leverages a 3D diffusion framework to jointly process spatial and spectral dimensions, creating realistic synthetic training data by adding Gaussian stripe noise to clean hyperspectral cubes. Evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on synthetic satellite datasets while maintaining image structure and spectral integrity, exceeding the FINCH mission's scientific requirement of SNR 30.

## Method Summary
HSI-Diffusion employs a three-stage training pipeline to denoise hyperspectral images. The method begins by adapting a U-Net architecture from a Pavia University dataset segmentation model to process 3D hyperspectral input by expanding 2D filters to 3D using an averaging approach. The model then pre-trains on the ICVL-HSI dataset for denoising capabilities before fine-tuning on synthetic satellite hyperspectral data created from seven remote sensing datasets. The 3D diffusion framework jointly processes spatial and spectral dimensions, with synthetic training data generated by adding Gaussian stripe noise to clean hyperspectral cubes. The approach uses comprehensive evaluation metrics including PSNR, SSIM, SAM, and LPIPS to assess denoising performance while preserving spectral information and removing stripe artifacts.

## Key Results
- Achieves PSNR values exceeding 36 on synthetic satellite data, surpassing FINCH mission requirement of SNR 30
- Successfully preserves spectral information while removing stripe artifacts in hyperspectral images
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on synthetic satellite datasets with realistic noise patterns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The 3D diffusion framework enables joint processing of spatial and spectral dimensions, allowing the model to capture correlations across both dimensions simultaneously rather than treating them separately. By adapting 2D U-Net filters to 3D through averaging, the architecture maintains the proven effectiveness of U-Net while extending it to hyperspectral data. The three-stage training process provides progressive learning, starting with general hyperspectral denoising capabilities before specializing to satellite-specific noise patterns. Synthetic data generation with realistic stripe noise patterns provides abundant training examples that match the expected noise characteristics of the FINCH mission, enabling robust denoising performance.

## Foundational Learning
- 3D convolutional neural networks - needed for processing hyperspectral data cubes that have spatial and spectral dimensions; quick check: verify filter dimensions match input cube structure
- Diffusion models for image restoration - needed for progressive noise removal through iterative denoising steps; quick check: confirm denoising converges through timesteps
- Hyperspectral image characteristics - needed to understand spectral-spatial relationships and noise patterns; quick check: validate that spectral signatures are preserved after denoising
- Synthetic data generation for training - needed to create realistic training examples with controlled noise; quick check: compare synthetic noise statistics to real satellite data
- Transfer learning from general to specialized datasets - needed to leverage pre-training before fine-tuning; quick check: measure performance improvement from pre-training to fine-tuning

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** ICVL-HSI dataset -> Stage I U-Net adaptation -> Stage II pre-training -> Stage III synthetic satellite data generation -> Stage IV fine-tuning -> Evaluation metrics

**Critical Path:** The three-stage training pipeline (Stage I adaptation → Stage II pre-training → Stage III fine-tuning) represents the critical path for achieving denoising performance, as each stage builds upon the previous one's learned representations.

**Design Tradeoffs:** 3D processing enables joint spatial-spectral denoising but increases computational complexity compared to 2D approaches. Synthetic data generation provides abundant training examples but may not fully capture real satellite noise patterns. The three-stage training process balances general capability with mission-specific adaptation but requires careful hyperparameter tuning at each stage.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor performance on ICVL-HSI dataset indicates issues with U-Net adaptation or pre-training configuration. Inability to generate realistic synthetic striped data suggests problems with noise generation parameters. Degradation in spectral information preservation indicates the diffusion process is removing too much detail along spectral dimensions.

**3 First Experiments:** 1) Test U-Net adaptation by evaluating denoising performance on ICVL-HSI dataset. 2) Validate synthetic data generation by comparing noise statistics to known stripe patterns. 3) Measure fine-tuning effectiveness by tracking performance improvement from pre-training to mission-specific datasets.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited validation on real satellite data, with evaluation primarily on synthetic datasets and only EnMAP real data tested
- Synthetic data generation may not fully capture the complexity of real satellite noise patterns, potentially limiting real-world performance
- Specific architectural details for 2D-to-3D U-Net adaptation are not fully specified, which could impact reproducibility

## Confidence
- **HSI-Diffusion denoising capability on synthetic data**: High - PSNR values exceeding 36 demonstrate strong performance well above mission requirements
- **Real-world deployment readiness**: Medium - Limited testing on actual FINCH mission data and reliance on synthetic datasets creates uncertainty
- **Architectural reproducibility**: Medium - While the overall approach is described, specific implementation details are missing

## Next Checks
1. Test the trained model on actual FINCH mission hyperspectral data once available to verify performance on real satellite noise patterns
2. Conduct ablation studies on the 3D U-Net architecture adaptation method to quantify the impact of different 2D-to-3D filter expansion approaches
3. Evaluate the model's generalization by testing on hyperspectral data from multiple satellite platforms beyond EnMAP to assess robustness across different sensor characteristics
