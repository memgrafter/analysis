# MonoPlane: Exploiting Monocular Geometric Cues for Generalizable 3D Plane Reconstruction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.01226
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01226
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: State-of-the-art zero-shot generalizable 3D plane reconstruction from single RGB images using monocular geometric cues

## Executive Summary
MonoPlane introduces a novel approach for generalizable 3D plane detection and reconstruction from single RGB images. The method leverages pre-trained monocular neural networks to predict depth and surface normals, then uses a proximity-guided RANSAC framework with graph modeling to handle noisy monocular depth predictions. The pipeline includes image-level multi-plane joint optimization via dense CRFs to improve consistency across detected planes. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across diverse indoor and outdoor datasets, with significant improvements over learning-based baselines.

## Method Summary
MonoPlane combines pre-trained monocular depth and normal estimation with a proximity-guided RANSAC framework to detect and reconstruct 3D planes from single RGB images. The method first uses pre-trained models (Omnidata, ZeroDepth) to predict depth and surface normals, then generates a 3D point cloud through unprojection. A graph-cut RANSAC algorithm incorporates point-to-point proximity modeling using spatial, color, and normal similarities to improve robustness to noisy monocular depths. After sequential plane detection, dense CRFs are applied for joint multi-plane optimization. The approach extends to sparse-view reconstruction by combining SfM for camera poses with plane matching and fusion across views.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot generalizability across indoor/outdoor datasets
- Demonstrates significant improvements over learning-based baselines in segmentation metrics (VOI, RI, SC)
- Shows superior robustness and scalability in sparse-view reconstruction scenarios
- Successfully handles noisy monocular depth through proximity-guided RANSAC

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Proximity modeling within RANSAC improves plane fitting robustness to noisy monocular depth by incorporating spatial coherence constraints through graph optimization. The method penalizes differently labeled neighboring points based on proximity, color similarity, and surface normal similarity, leveraging the local geometric coherence preserved in monocular depth predictions despite overall noise.

### Mechanism 2
Pre-trained monocular networks provide generalizable geometric cues that enable zero-shot transfer across diverse environments. Large-scale models trained on diverse datasets (stereo, RGB-D, 3D movies) capture generalizable depth and normal patterns applicable to unseen scenes, eliminating the need for dataset-specific fine-tuning.

### Mechanism 3
Image-level multi-plane joint optimization via dense CRFs improves plane mask consistency across multiple detected planes. After sequential RANSAC detection, dense CRFs jointly optimize all plane masks using color, depth, and normal similarities, reducing inconsistencies that arise from the sequential binary labeling approach.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Monocular network prediction -> Point cloud generation -> Proximity-based RANSAC -> Dense CRFs -> Plane parameters and masks
- Critical path: Monocular network prediction → Point cloud generation → Proximity-based RANSAC → Dense CRFs → Plane parameters and masks
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Pre-trained monocular networks enable zero-shot generalization but rely on prediction quality
  - Proximity modeling improves robustness to depth noise but adds computational complexity
  - Dense CRFs improve mask consistency but may over-smooth boundaries
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor depth/normal predictions → Fragmented or incorrect plane detection
  - Incorrect proximity term calibration → Over-smooth or under-smooth plane boundaries
  - Excessive dense CRF smoothing → Loss of fine-grained plane details
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare sequential RANSAC vs. proximity-based RANSAC on synthetic noisy depth data to verify robustness improvement
  2. Test plane reconstruction with different monocular network predictions (Omnidata vs. ZeroDepth) to evaluate sensitivity to input quality
  3. Evaluate the impact of dense CRFs on plane mask consistency using IoU metrics on adjacent plane boundaries

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but several critical areas remain unexplored based on the limitations discussed.

## Limitations
- Performance in extremely low-texture environments where monocular depth estimation is inherently unreliable
- Extension to non-planar geometric primitives like cylinders and spheres
- Impact of proximity modeling hyperparameters across different scene types

## Confidence
- High confidence: Core pipeline architecture (monocular depth → RANSAC → CRFs) is technically sound
- Medium confidence: Zero-shot generalizability claims are plausible but require more empirical validation
- Low confidence: Specific improvements from proximity modeling and dense CRF optimization are not well-supported

## Next Checks
1. Ablation study: Compare plane reconstruction quality using standard RANSAC vs. proximity-guided RANSAC on datasets with known depth noise characteristics
2. Input sensitivity analysis: Evaluate plane detection performance using different monocular depth/normal estimation models to quantify the impact of input quality
3. CRF optimization study: Measure the quantitative improvement in plane mask consistency metrics (e.g., boundary IoU) with and without dense CRF post-processing
