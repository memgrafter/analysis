# NLPre: a revised approach towards language-centric benchmarking of Natural Language Preprocessing systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.04507
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04507
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Introduces a language-centric benchmarking system for NLPre systems with automated evaluation and leaderboard updates

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical gap in comprehensive benchmarking for Natural Language Preprocessing (NLPre) systems by introducing a novel language-centric approach. The proposed system automatically assesses submitted NLPre predictions against an undisclosed reference dataset, updating a public leaderboard to ensure fair and credible performance tracking. Configured for Polish and integrated with the NLPre-PL benchmark, the system enables ongoing evaluation of multiple NLPre tools while preventing result manipulation. Extensive experiments compare rule-based, neural, and large language model approaches, demonstrating the system's effectiveness in ranking diverse NLPre systems. The open-source, tagset-agnostic benchmarking system facilitates easy setup for other languages, promoting linguistic diversity in NLP research.

## Method Summary
The NLPre benchmarking approach reformulates existing datasets (NKJP1M and PDB-UD) into multiple NLPre tasks including segmentation, POS tagging, lemmatization, and dependency parsing for both Morfeusz and UD tagsets. The system implements automatic evaluation through a web-based application using Django framework, comparing submissions against undisclosed reference datasets to prevent manipulation. Performance is tracked using F1 scores and AlignedAccuracy metrics across different task types. The benchmarking system is designed to be fully configurable through YAML files, allowing easy setup for other languages while maintaining tagset-agnostic evaluation capabilities.

## Key Results
- The system successfully ranks diverse NLPre approaches including rule-based, neural, and LLM-based systems across multiple Polish preprocessing tasks
- Transformer-based models like COMBO and Trankit demonstrate superior performance in POS tagging and lemmatization tasks compared to traditional approaches
- The undisclosed reference dataset approach effectively prevents result manipulation while maintaining fair evaluation across different submission types

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The language-centric benchmarking system provides fair and credible evaluation by automatically assessing submitted NLPre predictions and updating a public leaderboard.
- Mechanism: The system compares submitted predictions against a publicly undisclosed reference dataset, preventing result manipulation and ensuring fairness in assessment.
- Core assumption: Keeping the reference dataset undisclosed is sufficient to prevent result manipulation and ensure fairness.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The proposed system automatically assesses submitted NLPre predictions and updates a public leaderboard, ensuring fair and credible performance tracking."
  - [section 2.2]: "This method effectively prevents result manipulation and ensures fairness of the final assessment."
  - [corpus]: Weak. No specific corpus examples provided for this mechanism.
- Break condition: If someone gains unauthorized access to the undisclosed reference dataset, the fairness guarantee is compromised.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The benchmarking system enables comprehensive ongoing evaluation of multiple NLPre tools, providing up-to-date and complete ranking.
- Mechanism: The system allows continuous submission of new or upgraded NLPre systems, automatically evaluating them and updating the leaderboard.
- Core assumption: Continuous submission and automatic evaluation are sufficient to keep the ranking up-to-date and complete.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The proposed language-centric benchmarking system enables comprehensive ongoing evaluation of multiple NLPre tools, while credibly tracking their performance."
  - [section 2.1]: "The second important methodological assumption is to enable the ongoing evaluation of new or upgraded NLPre systems to guarantee up-to-date and complete ranking."
  - [corpus]: Weak. No specific corpus examples provided for this mechanism.
- Break condition: If the submission process becomes too cumbersome or if the evaluation system fails to keep pace with new submissions, the ranking may become outdated.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The benchmarking system is fully configurable and easy to set up, allowing users to establish an evaluation environment for any language.
- Mechanism: The system provides a .yaml file for easy management of datasets, tagsets, and metrics, and allows customization of subpages using a WYSIWYG editor.
- Core assumption: Providing a .yaml file and WYSIWYG editor is sufficient for easy configuration and setup of the system for any language.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.3]: "To facilitate the construction of benchmarking environments for other languages, e.g. NLPre-GA for Irish or NLPre-ZH for Chinese, we ensure full customization of the publicly released source code of the benchmarking system."
  - [section 2.2]: "The benchmarking system is implemented as a web-based application in Python using Django framework. This framework allows quite an easy implementation of MVC design pattern."
  - [corpus]: Weak. No specific corpus examples provided for this mechanism.
- Break condition: If the configuration process becomes too complex for non-technical users, or if the system is not compatible with certain languages, the claim of easy setup may not hold.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Understanding of Natural Language Preprocessing (NLPre) tasks
  - Why needed here: The benchmarking system is designed to evaluate NLPre systems, so understanding these tasks is crucial for configuring and using the system effectively.
  - Quick check question: Can you list and briefly describe the main NLPre tasks mentioned in the paper?

- Concept: Familiarity with Universal Dependencies (UD) and other tagsets
  - Why needed here: The system is tagset-agnostic, but understanding different tagsets is important for configuring the benchmark for specific languages.
  - Quick check question: What are the main differences between the Morfeusz and UD tagsets used in the Polish benchmark?

- Concept: Knowledge of transformer-based architectures and their impact on NLPre
  - Why needed here: The paper discusses the rise of transformer-based NLPre tools, so understanding these architectures is important for evaluating and comparing different systems.
  - Quick check question: How do transformer-based architectures differ from traditional rule-based or statistical approaches in NLPre tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Data Repository -> Submission and Evaluation System -> Leaderboard -> Configuration System -> API

- Critical path:
  1. User submits NLPre system predictions for test sets
  2. System automatically evaluates predictions against reference dataset
  3. Results are stored in SQLite database
  4. Leaderboard is updated with new results
  5. User confirms publication of results

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Undisclosed reference dataset ensures fairness but limits transparency
  - Continuous evaluation provides up-to-date rankings but requires significant computational resources
  - Tagset-agnostic design allows flexibility but may complicate direct comparisons between systems

- Failure signatures:
  - Stale leaderboard results indicate issues with submission or evaluation process
  - Inconsistent results across different tagsets suggest problems with system configuration
  - High variance in inference times may indicate inefficient model implementations

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Set up a local instance of the benchmarking system using the provided .yaml configuration
  2. Submit predictions from an existing NLPre system to test the evaluation pipeline
  3. Configure the system for a new language using a different dataset and tagset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed NLPre benchmarking approach perform on morphologically rich languages beyond Polish, Chinese, and Irish?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates the system's configuration for three languages but does not provide extensive performance comparisons across a broader range of morphologically rich languages.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on demonstrating the system's capabilities for Polish, Chinese, and Irish but does not conduct extensive experiments across a wider range of morphologically rich languages.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting and reporting benchmarking experiments on a diverse set of morphologically rich languages would provide insights into the system's performance across different linguistic structures and complexities.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the system handle languages with significantly different writing systems or tokenization challenges, such as Arabic or Japanese?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions the system's language-agnostic nature but does not provide specific details on its performance with languages using non-Latin scripts or those with complex tokenization rules.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on demonstrating the system's capabilities for Polish, Chinese, and Irish, which have relatively straightforward tokenization compared to languages like Arabic or Japanese.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting and reporting benchmarking experiments on languages with significantly different writing systems or complex tokenization challenges would provide insights into the system's adaptability and performance in these scenarios.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed NLPre benchmarking approach compare to existing evaluation methods in terms of comprehensiveness and reliability?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the shortcomings of existing NLPre evaluation approaches, such as shared tasks, performance tables, and progress repositories, and proposes the benchmarking approach as a more comprehensive and reliable alternative.
- Why unresolved: While the paper argues for the advantages of the proposed benchmarking approach, it does not provide a direct comparison with existing methods in terms of comprehensiveness and reliability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting a systematic comparison of the proposed benchmarking approach with existing evaluation methods, considering factors such as coverage, fairness, and up-to-dateness, would provide empirical evidence for its advantages and limitations.

## Limitations

- The undisclosed reference dataset approach, while preventing manipulation, limits transparency and independent verification of results
- The system's effectiveness heavily depends on continuous user submissions, which may create evaluation gaps if submissions become infrequent
- Performance evaluation is currently limited to Polish and requires significant configuration effort to adapt to other languages

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The system's core functionality for automatic evaluation and leaderboard maintenance is well-established and reproducible
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim of easy setup for other languages, while supported by documentation, lacks extensive real-world validation across multiple language implementations
- **Medium Confidence**: The fairness guarantee through undisclosed reference datasets is theoretically sound but has not been stress-tested against sophisticated manipulation attempts

## Next Checks

1. **Security Validation**: Conduct a controlled test where participants attempt to reverse-engineer or predict the undisclosed reference dataset through repeated submissions, measuring the system's resilience against potential manipulation attempts

2. **Cross-Language Implementation**: Deploy the benchmarking system for at least two additional languages (preferably from different language families) to validate the claimed ease of configuration and identify any language-specific challenges not apparent in the Polish implementation

3. **Performance Consistency Analysis**: Implement a standardized testing protocol where the same NLPre systems are evaluated across different hardware configurations and embedding sets to quantify the variance in performance scores and establish reliability thresholds
