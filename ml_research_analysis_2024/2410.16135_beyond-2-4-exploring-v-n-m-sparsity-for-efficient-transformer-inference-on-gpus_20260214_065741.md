# Beyond 2:4: exploring V:N:M sparsity for efficient transformer inference on GPUs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.16135
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16135
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: V:N:M sparsity achieves nearly lossless accuracy at 75% sparsity (64:2:8) for DeiT-base, outperforming 2:4 sparsity in both accuracy and speed, and extends to LLMs like Llama2-7B with competitive downstream task performance

## Executive Summary
This work introduces V:N:M sparsity as an alternative to the standard 2:4 sparsity pattern for accelerating Transformer inference on GPUs. The authors propose a comprehensive framework including heuristic V and M selection, V:N:M-specific channel permutation, and three-staged LoRA training to improve both accuracy and efficiency of sparse Transformers. Experiments demonstrate that V:N:M sparsity can achieve higher practical speedups than 2:4 sparsity, particularly at sparsity ratios above 50%, while maintaining competitive accuracy across various Transformer architectures including vision models and LLMs.

## Method Summary
The method involves generating V:N:M-sparse Transformers through a three-step process: calculating importance scores using RIA or ABS criteria, pruning columns to meet V:N:M constraints, and applying 2:4 sparsity to remaining columns. V and M values are selected heuristically based on mask diversity and speedup thresholds. For low-training-budget scenarios, V:N:M-specific channel permutation maximizes the norm of importance scores of retained weights. The approach extends to LLMs through three-staged LoRA training that alternates between dense and sparse phases with dynamic mask updates, followed by fixed-mask fine-tuning to balance exploration and stability.

## Key Results
- DeiT-base achieves nearly lossless accuracy at 75% sparsity (64:2:8) compared to dense model
- V:N:M sparsity provides higher practical speedups than 2:4 sparsity on RTX 3090 GPUs
- Llama2-7B with V:N:M sparsity achieves competitive performance on 5-shot downstream tasks
- V:N:M sparsity enables sparsity ratios above 50% while maintaining accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: V:N:M sparsity provides higher practical speedups than 2:4 sparsity on GPUs.
- **Mechanism**: V:N:M sparsity divides weight matrices into V×M blocks, prunes (M-4) columns, and applies 2:4 sparsity to the remaining columns. This enables sparsity ratios greater than 50%, leading to fewer computations than 2:4 sparse matrix multiplications.
- **Core assumption**: GPUs with sparse tensor cores can efficiently execute V:N:M sparse matrix multiplications.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "V:N:M sparsity enables practical speedups for sparsity above 50% on GPUs."
  - [section]: "Due to the effective utilization of higher sparsity greater than 50%, V:N:M-sparse MMs possess fewer computations than 2:4-sparse MMs."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence. Only 5 related papers found, none directly addressing V:N:M sparsity.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Heuristic V and M selection maximizes accuracy-speedup trade-offs.
- **Mechanism**: The selection process involves defining an optimization problem to maximize accuracy subject to speedup constraints, followed by sifting to exclude combinations with suboptimal M values and using mask diversity (MD) to compare remaining combinations.
- **Core assumption**: Higher MD indicates greater sparse weight configuration flexibility, leading to better Transformer accuracy.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section]: "We propose a heuristic method for selecting V and M values that yield optimal accuracy-speedup trade-offs for V:N:M sparse Transformers."
  - [section]: "MD of V:N:M sparsity quantifies the number of unique masks permissible under the V:N:M sparse pattern constraint."
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence. Corpus lacks papers on V:N:M sparsity selection methods.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Three-staged LoRA training adapts V:N:M sparsity for LLMs.
- **Mechanism**: The three stages are: 1) Dense LoRA with all-one masks, 2) Sparse LoRA with dynamic masks updated at regular intervals, and 3) Sparse LoRA with fixed masks inherited from the last update in stage 2.
- **Core assumption**: Frequent mask updates introduce training instability, and the third stage with fixed masks balances exploration and exploitation of masks.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section]: "We propose a three-stage LoRA training technique to enable dynamic mask training with LoRA and enhance the accuracy of V:N:M-sparse Transformers."
  - [section]: "While dynamic mask updates facilitate the exploration of appropriate V:N:M-sparse masks, they can also introduce instability in the training process."
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence. Corpus lacks papers on three-staged LoRA training for V:N:M sparsity.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Sparse matrix multiplication on GPUs
  - **Why needed here**: V:N:M sparsity relies on efficient execution of sparse matrix multiplications on GPUs with sparse tensor cores.
  - **Quick check question**: Can you explain how sparse tensor cores accelerate matrix multiplications compared to dense operations?

- **Concept**: Channel permutation for model sparsity
  - **Why needed here**: V:N:M-specific channel permutation improves the accuracy of V:N:M-sparse Transformers by maximizing the norm of importance scores of retained weights.
  - **Quick check question**: How does channel permutation affect the pruning process and the resulting sparse model's accuracy?

- **Concept**: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for LLMs
  - **Why needed here**: Three-staged LoRA training extends V:N:M sparsity to LLMs by adapting the training process to handle dynamic masks and maintain stability.
  - **Quick check question**: What are the key differences between standard LoRA training and the three-staged approach proposed for V:N:M-sparse Transformers?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Dense Transformer -> V and M selection -> Channel permutation (optional) -> Pruning -> Training (fixed/dynamic masks) -> V:N:M-sparse Transformer
- **Critical path**: The critical path for generating a V:N:M-sparse Transformer is: V and M selection → channel permutation (if training budget is limited) → pruning → training (fixed mask for low budget, dynamic mask for high budget)
- **Design tradeoffs**: The main tradeoff is between accuracy and speedup. Higher sparsity ratios (larger M values) provide greater speedups but may lead to accuracy loss. The V and M selection heuristic aims to find the optimal balance.
- **Failure signatures**: If the generated V:N:M-sparse Transformer has significantly lower accuracy than expected, it may indicate issues with the V and M selection, channel permutation, or training process. If the speedup is lower than expected, it may indicate problems with the GPU's sparse tensor core implementation or the V:N:M sparse matrix multiplication kernel.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Verify the V and M selection heuristic by comparing the accuracy and speedup of V:N:M-sparse Transformers with different (V, M) combinations.
  2. Test the effectiveness of V:N:M-specific channel permutation by comparing the accuracy of V:N:M-sparse Transformers with and without permutation under limited training budgets.
  3. Evaluate the three-staged LoRA training technique by comparing the accuracy of V:N:M-sparse LLMs trained with and without this approach.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does V:N:M sparsity performance scale for extremely large language models beyond Llama2-7B and Llama2-13B, particularly regarding accuracy retention and speedup efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper tests V:N:M sparsity on Llama2-7B and Llama2-13B but notes that larger models "tend to exhibit greater redundancy" without empirical validation for very large models.
- Why unresolved: The authors did not experiment with models significantly larger than 13B parameters, leaving uncertainty about whether the observed accuracy-speedup trade-offs hold at extreme scales.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments applying V:N:M sparsity to models like Llama3-70B, GPT-3, or beyond, measuring both accuracy retention and practical speedups across different sparsity configurations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal update frequency for dynamic masks in the three-staged LoRA training, and how does it vary with model size and sparsity level?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors set dynamic mask updates every 20 iterations based on empirical observation but acknowledge this may not be optimal for all scenarios.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides limited ablation on update frequencies and does not explore how optimal intervals depend on model architecture or sparsity ratios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive ablation studies testing multiple update frequencies across different model sizes, sparsity levels, and training durations to identify optimal intervals for each configuration.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do V:N:M sparse Transformers perform on specialized hardware accelerators beyond GPUs, such as NPUs or TPUs, and what architectural modifications would optimize for these platforms?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper focuses exclusively on GPU acceleration using sparse tensor cores, with no exploration of alternative hardware.
- Why unresolved: The V:N:M sparsity format was designed for GPU sparse tensor cores, but its efficiency on other accelerators remains unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance benchmarking of V:N:M sparse Transformers on NPUs, TPUs, and custom accelerators, along with architectural modifications to better exploit their specific capabilities.

## Limitations
- Experimental evaluation relies heavily on synthetic benchmarks and focused datasets rather than diverse real-world deployment scenarios
- The heuristic for V and M selection lacks theoretical guarantees for optimality across diverse architectures
- Channel permutation method shows benefits only under constrained budgets, limiting practical utility

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core claim that V:N:M sparsity can achieve higher sparsity ratios than 2:4 while maintaining accuracy is supported by experimental results on multiple models.
- **Medium Confidence**: The speed improvement claims are reasonable given the reduced computation, but GPU-specific performance depends heavily on implementation details not fully disclosed.
- **Low Confidence**: The assertion that mask diversity directly correlates with accuracy lacks strong empirical validation, and the three-staged LoRA training approach needs more rigorous testing across different LLM architectures.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Architecture Generalization Test**: Evaluate V:N:M sparsity on diverse Transformer architectures (Vision Transformers, GPT-style models, and specialized architectures) to verify the heuristic V and M selection works broadly.

2. **Real-World Deployment Benchmark**: Test the proposed approach on actual inference workloads with batching and streaming scenarios, measuring end-to-end latency and throughput rather than just theoretical speedup.

3. **Mask Diversity Correlation Study**: Conduct controlled experiments varying mask diversity while holding other factors constant to establish whether MD truly predicts accuracy gains in V:N:M sparse Transformers.
