core_contribution: This paper proposes a self-supervised learning framework for learning
  singer identity representations from singing voice recordings. The key idea is to
  train encoders using different self-supervised techniques (SimCLR, Uniformity-Alignment,

# Singer Identity Representation Learning using Self-Supervised Techniques

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.05064
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05064
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Self-supervised learning framework achieves state-of-the-art singer identity representations with 44.1 kHz sampling rate, outperforming speaker verification and wav2vec 2.0 baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a self-supervised learning framework for learning singer identity representations from singing voice recordings without requiring speaker labels. The key innovation is training encoders using different self-supervised techniques (SimCLR, Uniformity-Alignment, VICReg, BYOL) on a large corpus of isolated vocal tracks, with data augmentations to ensure representations are invariant to pitch and content variations. The proposed framework produces high-quality embeddings that outperform both speaker verification and wav2vec 2.0 pre-trained baselines on singing voice tasks, while operating at 44.1 kHz sampling rate to capture high-frequency vocal characteristics traditionally ignored in speech processing.

## Method Summary
The method trains self-supervised models on a large private corpus of isolated vocal tracks using multiple SSL frameworks. The models learn to create embeddings that are invariant to pitch and content variations through data augmentations including noise, gain, time masking, and pitch shifting. The encoders use EfficientNet-B0 backbone with projection layers, operating at 44.1 kHz sampling rate with log-compressed mel-spectrograms. Embeddings are evaluated on singer similarity and identification tasks across multiple datasets, with emphasis on out-of-domain generalization. The approach demonstrates that self-supervised learning can capture singer identity without speaker labels while benefiting from high-frequency vocal information.

## Key Results
- BYOL achieved best generalization on singer similarity tasks, performing best on out-of-domain data despite worse in-domain scores
- 44.1 kHz inputs consistently improved similarity results on singing voice datasets compared to 16 kHz
- Self-supervised models outperformed wav2vec 2.0 and speaker verification baselines on singing voice tasks
- CONT and VICReg models showed similar trends with 44.1 kHz improving performance on singing datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Self-supervised learning can capture singer identity without requiring speaker labels
- Mechanism: SSL frameworks learn representations by aligning augmented views of the same audio segment while ensuring invariance to pitch and content variations
- Core assumption: Singer identity is consistent across different pitches and linguistic content, allowing augmentation-based alignment to preserve identity features
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "explore different self-supervised learning techniques on a large collection of isolated vocal tracks and apply data augmentations during training to ensure that the representations are invariant to pitch and content variations."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Higher sampling rate (44.1 kHz) improves singing voice representation quality by capturing high-frequency vocal characteristics
- Mechanism: Standard speech models operate at 16 kHz, discarding frequencies above 8 kHz. Singing voice contains energy above 5 kHz that carries timbral information critical for identity
- Core assumption: High-frequency vocal components contain singer-specific timbre information not present in lower frequencies
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "we explore high-frequency regions that are traditionally ignored in speech [7, 8] but might be present in singing voice by working in 44.1 kHz sampling rate."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: BYOL achieves better out-of-domain generalization than contrastive methods for singer representation learning
- Mechanism: BYOL uses a target network updated via exponential moving average and minimizes MSE between online predictions and target projections, avoiding explicit negative pairs that may push similar singers apart
- Core assumption: Avoiding explicit negative sampling preserves semantic structure in embedding space, improving generalization to unseen singers and styles
- Evidence anchors: [section 3.3] "BYOL is included in the study for comparison as it has shown promising results in several audio downstream tasks, claiming state-of-the-art [41]."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Data augmentation invariance
  - Why needed here: Singer identity must be preserved across pitch shifts and content variations while training SSL models
  - Quick check question: What happens to embedding similarity when you apply pitch-shifting augmentation to segments from the same singer?

- Concept: Temporal aggregation for speaker verification
  - Why needed here: Raw audio contains temporal information that must be aggregated to create fixed-size embeddings for similarity/verification tasks
  - Quick check question: How does adaptive average pooling affect the temporal resolution of speaker embeddings?

- Concept: Self-supervised learning frameworks comparison
  - Why needed here: Different SSL methods have different inductive biases that affect singer identity representation quality
  - Quick check question: What is the key architectural difference between BYOL and SimCLR that might explain their different generalization behaviors?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw audio → Mel-spectrogram extraction (80 bins, 2048 window, 512 hop) → Encoder (EfficientNet-B0) → Latent representation → Projection layer (SiLU + FC) → Lower-dimensional embedding → Temporal aggregation (adaptive average pooling) → Fixed-size singer embedding → Similarity computation

- Critical path: Mel-spectrogram extraction → Encoder → Projection → Temporal aggregation → Similarity computation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - 44.1 kHz vs 16 kHz: Better high-frequency information vs computational cost and generalization to speech
  - Encoder architecture: EfficientNet-B0 vs specialized speaker verification architectures
  - Projection dimensionality: 1000 vs smaller dimensions for memory efficiency
  - Data augmentation strength: Stronger augmentations may improve invariance but risk destroying identity information

- Failure signatures:
  - High EER on test set: Model fails to capture singer identity consistently
  - Large gap between in-domain and out-of-domain performance: Overfitting to training domain
  - Degradation when downsampling to 16 kHz: Model relies heavily on high-frequency information
  - Low classification accuracy: Embeddings lack linear separability for singer classes

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train CONT model with standard augmentations (noise, gain, time masking) and evaluate on test set
  2. Add pitch-shifting augmentation to CONT and compare EER/MNR
  3. Train BYOL model and compare out-of-domain generalization vs CONT

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal sampling frequency for achieving good generalization performance across both singing and speech tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the impact of using 44.1 kHz vs 16 kHz sampling rates, noting that 44.1 kHz improved results for singing voice tasks, but the models struggled with speech at higher frequencies
- Why unresolved: The paper shows that higher sampling rates benefit singing voice tasks but may hinder speech performance, suggesting a trade-off. However, it does not explore a range of sampling frequencies or provide a definitive optimal frequency for balancing both domains
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments testing a range of sampling frequencies (e.g., 16 kHz, 24 kHz, 32 kHz, 44.1 kHz, 48 kHz) on both singing and speech tasks, comparing generalization performance and identifying the frequency that best balances both

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do the learned singer representations perform on singing voices with unique or uncommon vocal techniques, such as those found in the VocalSet dataset?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that the models' representations do not fully capture a singer's identity when confronted with unique singing techniques, such as those found in the VocalSet dataset
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the limitation but does not provide a solution or explore the specific challenges posed by unique vocal techniques
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments evaluating the trained models on datasets containing a wide variety of vocal techniques, such as VocalSet, and analyzing the performance degradation or success in handling these techniques

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can fine-tuning the embeddings on verification tasks further improve the performance of the self-supervised models on singer similarity tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that previous work on Wav2Vec 2.0 has demonstrated the effectiveness of fine-tuning embeddings on verification tasks and suggests that similar improvements could be made for the trained models
- Why unresolved: The paper does not conduct fine-tuning experiments on the trained models, leaving the potential benefits of this approach unexplored
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments fine-tuning the embeddings of the trained models on singer verification tasks, such as the VoxCeleb dataset, and evaluating the impact on singer similarity performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets

## Limitations
- Relies on a private corpus for training, preventing full reproducibility
- Limited ablation studies on the specific contribution of high-frequency information versus other factors
- Comparison with wav2vec 2.0 uses a general-purpose speech model rather than specialized speaker verification systems
- Claims about 44.1 kHz superiority lack direct frequency-specific ablation studies

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core finding that self-supervised learning produces effective singer representations, and that BYOL shows better out-of-domain generalization than contrastive methods
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that 44.1 kHz specifically improves performance due to high-frequency vocal characteristics
- **Low confidence**: The absolute superiority over all speaker verification systems, as the comparison is limited to specific baselines

## Next Checks
1. Conduct frequency-specific ablation studies by training models on filtered audio (e.g., 0-8 kHz vs 8-22 kHz) to isolate which frequency bands contribute most to singer identity representation quality

2. Perform controlled experiments comparing the same SSL framework at different sampling rates (16 kHz vs 44.1 kHz) while holding all other variables constant, to isolate the impact of high-frequency information

3. Evaluate the generalization capability of the learned embeddings to real-world scenarios by testing on mixed music tracks containing singing voices with instrumental accompaniment, rather than isolated vocal tracks
