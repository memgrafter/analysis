# Malacopula: adversarial automatic speaker verification attacks using a neural-based generalised Hammerstein model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.09300
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09300
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Malacopula increases ASV vulnerability to spoofing attacks but is detectable by countermeasures

## Executive Summary
Malacopula is a neural-based adversarial attack system designed to enhance the effectiveness of spoofing attacks against automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems. It uses a generalized Hammerstein model with parallel branches of polynomial functions and linear filters to generate adversarial perturbations that minimize the cosine distance between speaker embeddings of spoofed and genuine utterances. Experiments show significant increases in ASV vulnerability while maintaining detectability by spoofing countermeasure systems like AASIST under controlled conditions.

## Method Summary
Malacopula applies adversarial perturbations to spoofed speech using a neural-based generalized Hammerstein model. The model consists of parallel branches containing polynomial functions followed by linear time-invariant filters. These branches process the input signal, with outputs summed and normalized using L∞ norm. The system is optimized to minimize the cosine distance between speaker embeddings extracted from the modified spoofed speech and target genuine speech. The approach was evaluated using the ASVspoof 2019 dataset with three ASV systems (CAM++, ECAPA, ERes2Net) and the AASIST countermeasure.

## Key Results
- Malacopula significantly increases ASV vulnerabilities with pooled spf-EERs rising from baseline levels
- Speech quality is reduced, with MOS scores decreasing when attacks are applied
- Attacks are effectively detected by spoofing countermeasure systems like AASIST under controlled conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Malacopula improves spoofing effectiveness by minimizing the cosine distance between speaker embeddings of spoofed and bona fide utterances. The model applies adversarial perturbations using a neural-based generalized Hammerstein architecture to modify speech signals non-linearly. This manipulation increases the likelihood that ASV systems misclassify spoofed speech as genuine by aligning the speaker embeddings more closely.

### Mechanism 2
Malacopula's parallel branch architecture enables more effective manipulation of amplitude, phase, and frequency components than simpler linear models. Each parallel branch processes the input signal with a non-linear polynomial function followed by a linear time-invariant filter. This allows for complex, non-linear transformations that can more precisely align spoofed speech characteristics with target speakers.

### Mechanism 3
Malacopula attacks can be detected by spoofing countermeasure systems under controlled conditions despite increasing ASV vulnerability. The adversarial perturbations introduced by Malacopula, while effective at deceiving ASV systems, create detectable artifacts that spoofing countermeasure systems like AASIST can identify.

## Foundational Learning

- **Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV) systems**: Understanding how ASV systems work is essential to comprehend how Malacopula attacks exploit their vulnerabilities and why the attacks are effective against certain systems.
  - *Quick check*: What is the primary function of an ASV system, and how do they typically verify speaker identity?

- **Spoofing attacks and countermeasures**: Knowledge of different spoofing attack types (e.g., synthetic speech, voice conversion) and countermeasure approaches is crucial for understanding the context in which Malacopula operates and why it targets spoofing vulnerabilities.
  - *Quick check*: What are the main types of spoofing attacks against ASV systems, and how do spoofing countermeasure systems detect them?

- **Neural networks and optimization procedures**: Malacopula uses a neural-based approach with an adversarial optimization procedure. Understanding these concepts is necessary to grasp how the model is trained and how it generates effective adversarial perturbations.
  - *Quick check*: How does the adversarial optimization procedure in Malacopula work, and what is its goal in terms of speaker embeddings?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input Spoofed utterance -> Malacopula filter (parallel branches of polynomial functions + linear filters) -> Normalization layer (L∞ norm) -> Output Modified utterance -> ASV system (speaker embedding extraction and verification) -> Countermeasure system (detection)

- **Critical path**: 
  1. Spoofed utterance input to Malacopula filter
  2. Parallel branch processing (non-linear transformation + linear filtering)
  3. Summation and normalization of branch outputs
  4. Modified utterance output to ASV system
  5. ASV system extracts speaker embeddings and compares with target
  6. Verification decision made based on embedding similarity

- **Design tradeoffs**: 
  - Filter length (L) vs. attack effectiveness and speech quality: Longer filters may provide more effective attacks but reduce speech quality
  - Filter depth (K) vs. computational complexity and generalization: Deeper filters may capture more complex patterns but increase computational cost and risk of overfitting
  - Non-linear vs. linear transformations: Non-linear transformations provide more flexibility but may be more easily detected by countermeasure systems

- **Failure signatures**: 
  - ASV system remains robust despite Malacopula attack (high spf-EER)
  - Countermeasure system fails to detect Malacopula attacks under controlled conditions
  - Malacopula attack significantly degrades speech quality (low MOS)
  - Attack effectiveness does not generalize across different ASV architectures

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Test Malacopula attack effectiveness on a single ASV system (e.g., CAM++) using different filter configurations (varying L and K) and measure spf-EER and MOS.
  2. Evaluate the transferability of Malacopula attacks by testing the same attacks on different ASV systems (e.g., ECAPA and ERes2Net) and compare spf-EERs.
  3. Assess countermeasure system performance by testing AASIST's ability to detect Malacopula attacks under controlled conditions and measure the impact on spf-EERs.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How do Malacopula-generated perturbations perform against ASV systems under realistic, noisy, and uncontrolled acoustic conditions?
- *Basis in paper*: [explicit] The paper acknowledges that controlled ASVspoof 2019 conditions do not reflect real-world noise and channel effects, and perturbations resemble background noise, suggesting the need for further investigations under realistic scenarios.
- *Why unresolved*: The study's experiments are limited to controlled conditions, lacking validation in uncontrolled, noisy environments typical of real-world use.
- *What evidence would resolve it*: Experiments conducted in real-world environments with varying noise levels and channel conditions, demonstrating ASV vulnerability and detection performance.

### Open Question 2
How effective are Malacopula attacks against ASV systems when combined with adaptive countermeasures that evolve alongside adversarial techniques?
- *Basis in paper*: [inferred] The paper shows Malacopula increases ASV vulnerabilities but also that spoofing detection systems like AASIST can detect attacks under controlled conditions, implying a need for adaptive defenses.
- *Why unresolved*: The study does not explore adaptive countermeasures or their effectiveness against evolving adversarial techniques.
- *What evidence would resolve it*: Implementation and testing of adaptive countermeasures that evolve with adversarial techniques, assessing their effectiveness against Malacopula attacks.

### Open Question 3
How do different combinations of filter lengths and depths in Malacopula affect both ASV vulnerability and speech quality in real-world scenarios?
- *Basis in paper*: [explicit] The paper explores various filter lengths and depths, showing trade-offs between attack success and speech quality degradation, but lacks real-world scenario validation.
- *Why unresolved*: The study evaluates filter configurations in controlled settings without assessing their impact in real-world conditions.
- *What evidence would resolve it*: Testing of various Malacopula filter configurations in real-world scenarios, evaluating both ASV vulnerability and perceived speech quality.

## Limitations

- Confidence in spf-EER improvements is limited by controlled evaluation conditions that don't reflect real-world noise and channel variations
- Malacopula attacks significantly degrade speech quality (MOS reduction), potentially limiting practical deployment
- Attacks are detectable by existing spoofing countermeasure systems like AASIST under controlled conditions

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The architectural description of Malacopula and its mechanism for minimizing cosine distance between speaker embeddings is well-specified and technically sound.
- **Medium Confidence**: The reported spf-EER improvements and MOS degradation are based on controlled experiments with known ASV systems.
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability of Malacopula attacks to unknown ASV architectures and real-world conditions is uncertain.

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate Malacopula attacks against ASV systems not included in the training data (e.g., x-vector based systems) to assess attack generalizability beyond the three tested architectures.

2. Test Malacopula attacks under varying channel conditions and background noise levels to determine performance degradation compared to controlled laboratory conditions.

3. Implement an adaptive spoofing countermeasure that learns from Malacopula attack patterns and evaluate whether it can maintain detection capability even as attack parameters evolve.
