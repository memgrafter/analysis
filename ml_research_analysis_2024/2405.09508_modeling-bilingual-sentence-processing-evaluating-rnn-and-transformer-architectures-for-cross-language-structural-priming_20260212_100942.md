# Modeling Bilingual Sentence Processing: Evaluating RNN and Transformer Architectures for Cross-Language Structural Priming

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.09508
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09508
- Reference count: 9
- Primary result: Transformers outperform RNNs in generating cross-language structural priming with accuracy rates exceeding 25.84% to 33.33%

## Executive Summary
This study investigates the performance of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformer models in replicating cross-language structural priming, a phenomenon where exposure to a sentence structure increases the likelihood of selecting a similar structure subsequently. Focusing on Chinese-English priming across typologically distinct languages, the authors evaluate how these computational models handle structural priming, a key indicator of abstract grammatical representations in human language processing. The findings demonstrate that transformers significantly outperform RNNs in generating primed sentence structures, challenging conventional beliefs about sequential sentence processing and suggesting a role for cue-based retrieval mechanisms in both human and computational language processing.

## Method Summary
The study uses a Chinese-English parallel corpus of 5.2 million sentence pairs, training both GRU-based RNN and Transformer encoder-decoder models on this bilingual data. A test set of 120 sentences (30 for each of four structures: Active, Passive, Prepositional Object, Double Object) was created using ChatGPT 3.5 with bilingual annotation. Models were evaluated using BLEU scores comparing generated English sentences to reference sentences with matching or different structures. The analysis compared 1-gram to 4-gram BLEU scores across priming scenarios to assess how well each model captured structural priming effects in cross-language translation.

## Key Results
- Transformers achieved higher accuracy rates in generating primed sentence structures compared to RNNs
- Accuracy rates for transformers exceeded 25.84% to 33.33% in cross-language structural priming tasks
- The performance difference suggests transformers are better equipped to handle structural priming across typologically distinct languages

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Transformers capture cross-language structural priming more effectively than RNNs due to their ability to directly access past input information through self-attention.
- Mechanism: The self-attention mechanism in transformers allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence regardless of their position, enabling better preservation and transfer of syntactic structures across languages.
- Core assumption: Self-attention provides a more flexible and comprehensive way to capture syntactic dependencies compared to the sequential processing of RNNs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our findings indicate that transformers outperform RNNs in generating primed sentence structures, with accuracy rates that exceed 25.84% to 33.33%."
  - [section] "The transformer's ability to directly access past input information, regardless of temporal distance, offers a fundamentally different approach from RNNs."
- Break condition: If the self-attention mechanism fails to capture long-range dependencies or if the computational cost outweighs the benefits in specific priming scenarios.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Learnable positional embeddings in transformers provide an advantage in modeling structural priming by emphasizing relevant positional information.
- Mechanism: Unlike fixed positional encodings, learnable embeddings can adapt to the specific requirements of structural priming, allowing the model to better understand and encode the relative positions of words within a sentence.
- Core assumption: The flexibility of learnable positional embeddings allows for more effective encoding of syntactic structures relevant to priming.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We believe this approach offers more advantages for learning structural priming, as it helps our model better understand and encode the relative positions of words within a sentence."
- Break condition: If learnable positional embeddings lead to overfitting or fail to generalize across different priming scenarios.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The multi-head attention in transformers allows for capturing different levels of sentence features, leading to a more comprehensive representation of sentence structure.
- Mechanism: Multiple attention heads can specialize in capturing specific semantic relationships, such as word dependencies and distance relationships, enhancing the model's ability to comprehend the intricacies of sentence structure.
- Core assumption: Different attention heads can effectively capture various aspects of syntactic structure that contribute to priming.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "In the decoder part of the transformer model, multiple attention heads capture different levels of sentence features, leading to a more comprehensive representation of sentence structure."
- Break condition: If the multi-head attention mechanism introduces too much complexity without significant gains in priming accuracy.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cross-language structural priming
  - Why needed here: Understanding how exposure to a particular sentence structure in one language influences the use of similar structures in another language is crucial for evaluating the models' performance.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between monolingual and cross-language structural priming?

- Concept: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their limitations
  - Why needed here: RNNs are one of the models being compared, and understanding their sequential processing and potential limitations is important for interpreting the results.
  - Quick check question: What are the main challenges RNNs face in capturing long-range dependencies and preserving sentence structure?

- Concept: Transformer architecture and self-attention mechanism
  - Why needed here: The transformer model's ability to directly access past input information through self-attention is a key factor in its superior performance in structural priming.
  - Quick check question: How does the self-attention mechanism in transformers differ from the sequential processing of RNNs, and why might this be advantageous for structural priming?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preparation -> Model implementation -> Training -> Evaluation
- Critical path: 1. Prepare and preprocess the bilingual corpus 2. Implement and train both RNN and transformer models 3. Design and create the test dataset 4. Evaluate model performance using BLEU scores and priming effect analysis
- Design tradeoffs:
  - RNN vs. transformer: Sequential processing vs. direct access to past information
  - Fixed vs. learnable positional embeddings: Simplicity vs. flexibility in encoding positional information
  - Number of attention heads: Model complexity vs. ability to capture diverse syntactic features
- Failure signatures:
  - Low BLEU scores: Models may not be effectively capturing the target language structures
  - Inconsistent priming effects: Models may struggle with certain sentence structures or language pairs
  - Overfitting: Models may perform well on the training set but fail to generalize to the test set
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train and evaluate both models on a smaller subset of the corpus to establish baseline performance
  2. Compare the effects of fixed vs. learnable positional embeddings on priming accuracy
  3. Analyze the impact of varying the number of attention heads in the transformer model on priming performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the transformer model's superior performance in cross-language structural priming reflect a fundamental difference in how it processes syntactic information compared to RNNs, or is it due to other factors such as differences in training data or model architecture?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper compares RNN and transformer models and finds that transformers outperform RNNs in cross-language structural priming. However, the authors do not definitively explain why this is the case.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the underlying mechanisms that lead to the transformer's superior performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Further research comparing the internal representations and processing mechanisms of RNNs and transformers in the context of structural priming could shed light on this question.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the frequency of linguistic constructions affect structural priming effects in computational models, and how does this compare to human language processing?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that prior research suggests an inverse relationship between the frequency of linguistic constructions and the magnitude of priming effects observed with those constructions in human language processing. The authors suggest exploring this further in computational models.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate the relationship between construction frequency and priming effects in the models it studies.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training models on corpora with different construction frequencies and comparing the resulting priming effects could provide insights into this question.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the "lexical boost" effect, where the structural priming effect is intensified when the same lexical head is repeated in both the prime and target sentences, impact the results of cross-language structural priming experiments in computational models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors acknowledge that their study design is susceptible to the "lexical boost" effect, which could artificially strengthen the observed priming effect.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate the extent to which the lexical boost effect influences the results of the cross-language priming experiments.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments that manipulate the lexical overlap between prime and target sentences and comparing the resulting priming effects could help quantify the impact of the lexical boost effect.

## Limitations

- The study relies on a test set generated by ChatGPT 3.5, which may introduce variability and lacks the validation that human-generated stimuli would provide
- The analysis focuses on BLEU scores without examining the specific mechanisms by which transformers capture priming effects at the structural level
- The comparison is limited to one language pair (Chinese-English) from a single corpus, limiting generalizability to other typologically distinct language pairs

## Confidence

- Transformers outperform RNNs in cross-language structural priming: High
- Self-attention mechanism is the primary driver of transformer superiority: Medium
- Learnable positional embeddings provide significant advantage: Low

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies comparing transformers with fixed vs. learnable positional embeddings to empirically validate the claimed advantage of learnable embeddings in structural priming scenarios

2. Generate a human-validated test set for structural priming across multiple typologically distinct language pairs to verify whether the transformer advantage generalizes beyond Chinese-English

3. Perform detailed error analysis on model outputs to identify specific structural features that transformers capture more effectively than RNNs, moving beyond aggregate BLEU scores to understand the mechanism of priming transfer
