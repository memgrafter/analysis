# Interpretable Measures of Conceptual Similarity by Complexity-Constrained Descriptive Auto-Encoding

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.08919
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08919
- Authors: Alessandro Achille; Greg Ver Steeg; Tian Yu Liu; Matthew Trager; Carson Klingenberg; Stefano Soatto

- Key outcome: Proposes CC:DAE method for quantifying conceptual similarity using complexity-constrained descriptive auto-encoding, showing better correlation with human judgments than existing baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Complexity-Constrained Descriptive Autoencoding (CC:DAE), a method for quantifying conceptual similarity between images by generating textual descriptions at increasing levels of complexity and measuring when these descriptions diverge. The core insight is that similar images can share descriptions longer than dissimilar ones, and the area under the curve of this divergence function provides a principled similarity measure. The method leverages pre-trained multi-modal models to generate captions and compute likelihoods, avoiding the pitfalls of contrastive learning by focusing on description quality rather than discrimination. CC:DAE correlates well with human similarity assessments and provides interpretability by showing at which level of granularity descriptions differentiate between samples.

## Method Summary
CC:DAE generates textual descriptions of images using a multi-modal model, then measures similarity by the area under the curve of a distance function that tracks how quickly descriptions diverge as complexity increases. The method uses importance sampling to approximate expectations over an infinite hypothesis space, finding a distribution of descriptions that minimize reconstruction loss under complexity constraints. Unlike contrastive methods that focus on distinguishing features, CC:DAE seeks optimal descriptions that capture structural information. The conceptual distance is computed by comparing the likelihood of each sample given shared descriptions, normalized by their individual coding lengths, across multiple complexity levels up to a maximum Cmax.

## Key Results
- Outperforms existing baselines on image-to-image and text-to-text similarity benchmarks
- Shows strong correlation with human similarity judgments on established datasets
- Provides interpretability by identifying specific levels of granularity where descriptions diverge
- Successfully handles cross-modal tasks by adapting the coding length computation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: The method works by generating increasingly complex natural language descriptions of images and measuring when these descriptions diverge between two samples.
- **Mechanism**: As complexity increases, dissimilar images require fundamentally different descriptions while similar images can share descriptions longer. The conceptual distance is measured by the area under the curve of how quickly these descriptions diverge.
- **Core assumption**: Natural language descriptions generated by large language models capture the same conceptual features that humans use to judge similarity.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "The idea is to use a base multi-modal model to generate 'explanations' (captions) of visual data at increasing levels of complexity. Then, similarity can be measured by the length of the caption needed to discriminate between the two images"
  - [section]: "Rather than focusing on finding the features that best distinguish the two images, we focus on finding the ones that best describe them"
- **Break condition**: If the language model's descriptions don't align with human conceptual understanding, or if the generative model cannot accurately evaluate description quality.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: The method avoids the pitfall of contrastive learning by focusing on description quality rather than discrimination.
- **Mechanism**: Instead of optimizing for features that distinguish samples (which can pick random irrelevant features), the method finds optimal descriptions under complexity constraints, ensuring focus on structural rather than random information.
- **Core assumption**: Descriptive features that minimize reconstruction loss under complexity constraints capture structural information rather than random noise.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "Rather than focusing on finding the features that best distinguish the two images, we focus on finding the ones that best describe them"
  - [section]: "Since these representations are not trained to align with human conceptual representations, they are a poor fit to measure conceptual similarity as noted in recent works"
- **Break condition**: If the complexity constraint is too loose, allowing random features to dominate the descriptions.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: The stochastic relaxation of the description optimization problem makes the method computationally feasible while preserving conceptual alignment.
- **Mechanism**: Instead of finding a single optimal description, the method finds a distribution of descriptions that on average have good reconstruction loss under complexity constraints, solved via importance sampling.
- **Core assumption**: The optimal distribution over descriptions can be approximated by sampling from a proposal distribution that combines both samples' individual description distributions.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section]: "To simplify the problem, rather than considering the best single hypothesis, we can search for a distribution of hypotheses q(h) describing the image"
  - [section]: "Having q∗x(h|C) we can compute the various quantities in the definition of the distance. However, given that q∗x(h|C) is a distribution over an infinite hypothesis space H, we cannot represent it explicitly. Fortunately, all the quantities involved are in the form Eq[f(h)] for some function f(h) and can be estimated through importance sampling"
- **Break condition**: If the proposal distribution is poorly aligned with the target distributions, importance sampling becomes too noisy to estimate the distance accurately.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Kolmogorov Complexity and Structure Function**
  - Why needed here: The method builds on Kolmogorov's insight that structured information should be easier to describe than randomness, using this to separate semantic information from noise
  - Quick check question: Why does focusing on early parts of the complexity curve (small C values) better capture conceptual similarity than asymptotic behavior?

- **Concept: Variational Autoencoders and Constrained Optimization**
  - Why needed here: The method uses a capacity-constrained optimization framework similar to VAEs to find optimal descriptions under complexity limits
  - Quick check question: How does the KL divergence constraint in the optimization problem relate to the description length limit?

- **Concept: Importance Sampling and Monte Carlo Estimation**
  - Why needed here: The method estimates expectations over infinite hypothesis spaces using importance sampling, requiring understanding of proposal distributions and variance reduction
  - Quick check question: Why is the proposal distribution chosen as a mixture of both samples' individual description distributions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input -> LLaVA/LLaMA Encoder -> Description Generator -> Likelihood Evaluator -> Distance Calculator -> Output
- **Critical path**: 
  1. Sample descriptions from proposal distribution π(h) = ½p(h|x₁) + ½p(h|x₂)
  2. Compute importance weights using coding length and likelihood terms
  3. Estimate distance function dx₁,x₂(C) across complexity values
  4. Calculate AUC up to Cmax as final similarity score
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Using only encoder vs having both encoder and decoder models
  - Choice of coding distribution pcode(h) (LLM likelihood vs proposal distribution)
  - Complexity constraint Cmax selection affecting interpretability vs accuracy
  - Single description vs distribution over descriptions for optimization
- **Failure signatures**:
  - High variance in distance estimates → poor alignment between proposal and target distributions
  - Distance curves that never diverge → descriptions not capturing sufficient detail
  - Poor correlation with human judgments → encoder/decoder not aligned with human conceptual understanding
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Unit test description sampling**: Verify that descriptions generated for similar images have higher overlap than for dissimilar images
  2. **Distance curve visualization**: Plot dx₁,x₂(C) for pairs of known similar/dissimilar images to confirm expected behavior
  3. **Ablation on pcode(h)**: Compare results using LLM likelihood vs proposal distribution for coding length to assess impact on interpretability vs benchmark performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the choice of description space H affect the conceptual distance, and are there better alternatives to natural language sentences?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the limitations of using natural language as the description space and mentions that other types of explanations, including visual features, could be incorporated.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore alternative description spaces or compare their effectiveness against natural language.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing the performance of CC:DAE using different description spaces (e.g., visual features, formal languages) on various datasets and tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How sensitive is the conceptual distance to the choice of decoder p(x|h) and encoder p(h|x), and what are the implications for different modalities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges that the conceptual distance depends on the choice of encoder and decoder, and mentions that different prompts can bias the distance to focus on different aspects.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not systematically investigate the impact of different encoders and decoders on the conceptual distance, especially for cross-modal tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the performance of CC:DAE using different encoders and decoders on various datasets and tasks, and analyzing the resulting conceptual distances.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the conceptual distance be extended to handle more complex relationships between samples, such as hierarchical or compositional structures?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the method can flexibly incorporate other types of explanations, but does not explore more complex relationships.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate how the conceptual distance can be adapted to capture hierarchical or compositional structures in the data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extensions of CC:DAE that can handle hierarchical or compositional structures, along with experiments demonstrating their effectiveness on datasets with such structures.

## Limitations

- The method's performance heavily depends on the quality of pre-trained multi-modal models, which may not align perfectly with human conceptual understanding
- The complexity constraint Cmax must be carefully chosen to balance interpretability with accuracy, and optimal values may vary across domains
- The importance sampling approach can suffer from high variance when the proposal distribution poorly aligns with target distributions

## Confidence

**High confidence** in the core theoretical framework: The application of Kolmogorov complexity principles and structure functions to measure conceptual similarity is well-founded and mathematically sound. The relationship between description complexity and conceptual divergence follows logically from information theory principles.

**Medium confidence** in empirical validation: While the method shows good correlation with human judgments on established benchmarks, the comparison is primarily against other automated methods rather than extensive human studies. The paper demonstrates superiority over existing baselines but doesn't fully explore edge cases where the method might fail.

**Low confidence** in reproducibility: The lack of detailed implementation specifications for key components (beam search parameters, specific prompts, model configurations) makes faithful reproduction challenging. The stochastic nature of the importance sampling approach also means results may vary significantly based on implementation details.

## Next Checks

1. **Description quality validation**: Generate descriptions for pairs of known similar and dissimilar images using the proposed method, then conduct a human evaluation study to verify that the descriptions capture the intended conceptual differences at the predicted complexity levels.

2. **Robustness across domains**: Test the method on diverse image domains beyond those used in the benchmarks (e.g., medical imaging, abstract art, scientific diagrams) to evaluate whether the complexity-distance relationship holds across different types of conceptual content.

3. **Ablation on coding distribution**: Systematically compare the performance and interpretability trade-offs when using LLM likelihood versus proposal distribution for pcode(h), measuring both correlation with human judgments and the quality of interpretability provided by the method.
