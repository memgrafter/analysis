# Automating Intervention Discovery from Scientific Literature: A Progressive Ontology Prompting and Dual-LLM Framework

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.00054
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00054
- Reference count: 15
- Primary result: Automated discovery of 2,421 interventions from 64,177 speech-language therapy articles using a dual-LLM framework with progressive ontology prompting

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an LLM-based framework for automating knowledge discovery from scientific literature, combining a progressive ontology prompting (POP) algorithm with a dual-agent system (LLM-Duo). The POP algorithm uses prioritized breadth-first search on a predefined ontology to generate structured prompts and action orders for LLMs. The LLM-Duo system features two specialized agents—an explorer (chatbot using RAG) and an evaluator—that work collaboratively and adversarially to refine annotation quality. Applied to speech-language intervention discovery, the framework identified 2,421 interventions from 64,177 articles, creating a publicly accessible knowledge base. Experiments showed that this approach outperformed advanced baselines, achieving higher accuracy and completeness in automatic knowledge extraction.

## Method Summary
The framework combines progressive ontology prompting with a dual-LLM architecture to automate knowledge discovery from scientific literature. The POP algorithm conducts prioritized breadth-first search across a predefined ontology, generating structured prompt templates and action sequences for LLMs. The LLM-Duo system consists of two specialized agents: an explorer that generates initial annotations using RAG-based retrieval, and an evaluator that critiques responses based on rationality and completeness. These agents work collaboratively and adversarially, with the evaluator providing feedback to the explorer for iterative refinement until consistent annotations are achieved. The approach was applied to speech-language intervention discovery, processing 64,177 research articles to identify 2,421 interventions.

## Key Results
- Identified 2,421 interventions from 64,177 speech-language therapy articles
- Outperformed advanced baselines in accuracy and completeness of annotations
- Demonstrated effectiveness of combining POP algorithm with dual-LLM adversarial collaboration
- Created publicly accessible intervention knowledge base

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Progressive Ontology Prompting (POP) improves annotation quality by providing context-aware prompts based on local ontology structure
- Mechanism: POP uses outdegree-prioritized BFS to traverse ontology graph, creating prompts that incorporate knowledge discoveries within k-hop neighborhoods as prefix to guide LLM annotation
- Core assumption: LLMs perform better when given structured prompts that provide relevant context from related concepts
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "POP algorithm conducts a prioritized breadth-first search (BFS) across a predefined ontology, generating structured prompt templates and action sequences to guide the automatic annotation process." [section]: "We frame the problem of automated knowledge discovery via LLMs as one of prompt design and scheduling... f is a function that translates KG ontology into a set of prompt and action orders for the LLMs."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: LLM-Duo's adversarial collaboration between explorer and evaluator agents improves annotation accuracy through iterative refinement
- Mechanism: Explorer generates initial annotations using RAG, evaluator critiques responses based on rationality and completeness, explorer refines based on feedback, process repeats until consistency achieved
- Core assumption: Having two specialized LLM agents work collaboratively and adversarially can identify and correct errors better than a single LLM working alone
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "LLM-Duo system features two specialized LLM agents: an explorer and an evaluator. These two agents work collaboratively and adversarially to enhance the reliability of the discovery and annotation processes." [section]: "The interaction between explorer and evaluator is collaborative and adversarial... evaluator scrutinizes the answer's rationality and gives feedback to the explorer."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The combination of POP and LLM-Duo achieves superior performance over baselines by addressing context window limitations and leveraging structured ontology guidance
- Mechanism: POP provides structured prompts based on ontology traversal while LLM-Duo provides iterative refinement through dual-agent collaboration, overcoming individual LLM limitations
- Core assumption: Structured ontology guidance combined with iterative refinement through adversarial collaboration can outperform simpler prompting methods and long-context LLMs
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "Experiments show that our method outperforms advanced baselines, enabling more accurate and complete annotations." [section]: "We separately equip the chatbot based on RAG with these two prompting methods for annotation and denote them as CoT-RAG and SelfRefine-RAG... Additionally, in LLM-Duo, a potential substitution of explorer is long-context LLM... We denote LLM-Duo respectively using explorers built on RAG and long-context LLM as LLM-Duo-RAG and LLM-Duo-LongContext."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal algorithm
  - Why needed here: POP algorithm relies on BFS to traverse ontology graph in a systematic manner
  - Quick check question: How does BFS ensure all nodes at a given depth are visited before moving to the next depth level?

- Concept: Knowledge Graph (KG) structure and ontology
  - Why needed here: Framework operates on predefined ontology represented as directed acyclic graph with concepts and relationships
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes a knowledge graph from a simple graph in terms of semantic relationships?

- Concept: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technique
  - Why needed here: Explorer agent uses RAG to ground LLM generations within literature context
  - Quick check question: How does RAG help mitigate LLM hallucination compared to standard generation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: POP algorithm → prompt generation → LLM-Duo framework (explorer + evaluator) → annotation refinement → knowledge base
- Critical path: Ontology → POP traversal → prompt templates → RAG-based explorer → evaluator feedback → refined annotations
- Design tradeoffs: Dual-agent system adds complexity but improves accuracy; larger context sizes improve quality but increase computational cost
- Failure signatures: Inconsistent annotations across runs, evaluator feedback not improving explorer responses, RAG retrieval failing to find relevant passages
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test POP with varying k values on a small ontology subset to find optimal context size
  2. Run LLM-Duo with mock explorer/evaluator to verify feedback loop functionality
  3. Compare single LLM annotation vs LLM-Duo on sample documents to measure improvement

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal context size k for the POP algorithm across different domains and ontology structures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper reports that k=2 yielded better results than k=1, and that GPT-4 consistently outperformed GPT-3.5 across all k values, but did not determine the optimal k value
- Why unresolved: The paper only tested k values of 1, 2, and 3, and only in the speech-language pathology domain. The optimal k may vary based on ontology complexity, document length, and domain characteristics
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments testing a wider range of k values (e.g., 1-5) across multiple domains with different ontology structures and document characteristics

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the LLM-Duo framework perform when scaling to much larger literature corpora beyond 64,177 papers?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates effectiveness on 64,177 papers but does not address scalability to much larger corpora or potential performance degradation
- Why unresolved: The paper does not test the framework's performance, computational requirements, or accuracy maintenance when processing significantly larger literature bases (e.g., 1 million+ papers)
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying LLM-Duo to corpora of increasing size (10x, 100x) while measuring accuracy, processing time, and resource utilization

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the LLM-Duo framework be adapted to handle dynamic ontologies that evolve over time as new knowledge emerges?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses a predefined static ontology and does not address how the framework would handle ontology updates or evolution
- Why unresolved: The current framework requires manual ontology creation by domain experts and does not incorporate mechanisms for ontology learning, updating, or adaptation to new concepts
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation of a version that can incorporate new ontology elements discovered during literature analysis and validate whether this maintains or improves knowledge extraction accuracy

## Limitations
- Reliance on predefined ontology without addressing construction, validation, or maintenance challenges
- Unclear generalizability to other scientific domains beyond speech-language interventions
- Limited evaluation metrics and ground truth validation for the 2,421 identified interventions

## Confidence
- High Confidence (90-100%): Technical feasibility of combining progressive ontology prompting with dual-LLM framework; general approach of BFS traversal on ontology graphs; conceptual validity of adversarial collaboration
- Medium Confidence (60-89%): Specific performance improvements over baselines; effectiveness of chosen k-hop context window sizes; scalability to full corpus
- Low Confidence (0-59%): Reproducibility without specific ontology and prompt templates; generalizability to other domains; long-term ontology maintenance requirements

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a reproducibility study by implementing the framework on a smaller, well-defined ontology with clearly specified ground truth. Compare results against established knowledge bases to validate accuracy claims.
2. Perform ablation studies to isolate contributions of individual components - test POP algorithm alone, LLM-Duo alone, and their combination on the same corpus to quantify marginal value of each component.
3. Apply the framework to a different scientific domain with a pre-existing ontology to assess generalizability. Compare performance metrics and identify domain-specific adaptations required for successful knowledge discovery.
