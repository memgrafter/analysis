# HyperCausalLP: Causal Link Prediction using Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graph

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.14679
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14679
- Authors: Utkarshani Jaimini; Cory Henson; Amit Sheth
- Reference count: 4
- Key outcome: Hyper-relational knowledge graph embeddings with mediators improve causal link prediction by 5.94% MRR compared to baseline approaches

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of missing causal links in causal networks by introducing HyperCausalLP, a method that formulates causal link prediction as a hyper-relational knowledge graph completion task. The approach leverages mediators as hyper-relations in a causal knowledge graph to capture contextual information between cause and effect entities. By incorporating this mediator information, the method improves causal link prediction performance by 5.94% in mean reciprocal rank compared to baseline approaches. The evaluation on the CLEVRER-Humans dataset demonstrates that hyper-relational knowledge graph embeddings with mediators significantly outperform traditional knowledge graph embedding methods that ignore such contextual relationships.

## Method Summary
HyperCausalLP transforms causal networks into hyper-relational knowledge graphs by encoding mediators as hyper-relations using RDF-star format. The method consists of four phases: (1) encoding causal associations into a causal network, (2) translating the network into a hyper-relational causal knowledge graph (CausalKG), (3) learning KG embeddings using the StarE algorithm, and (4) predicting new causal links. Two types of embeddings are learned: CausalKGE-Base (without mediators) and CausalKGE-M (with mediators as hyper-relations). The approach handles two-hop link prediction through reified relations and uses graph neural networks to learn rich representations that incorporate multiple qualifier pairs per causal link.

## Key Results
- HyperCausalLP achieves 5.94% improvement in MRR over baseline methods by incorporating mediator information
- The approach demonstrates effectiveness on CLEVRER-Humans dataset with 764 causal event graphs containing >48K links
- StarE algorithm with hyper-relational embeddings outperforms traditional KG embedding methods (TransE, DistMult, HolE, ComplEx) for causal link prediction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Mediators in causal links capture contextual information that improves link prediction accuracy
- Mechanism: By representing mediators as hyper-relations in a hyper-relational knowledge graph, the model can learn richer representations that include the pathway between cause and effect entities
- Core assumption: The presence and nature of mediators significantly influences the causal relationship between cause and effect entities
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "In the causal link A causes B causes C, the influence of A to C is influenced by B which is known as a mediator"
  - [section] "The mediator helps in explaining the relationship between cause (independent node) and its effect (dependent node). It provides insights into the pathway linking cause and effect, capturing the contextual information"
- Break condition: If mediators do not actually influence the causal relationship or if the hyper-relational representation fails to capture this influence effectively

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Hyper-relational knowledge graph embeddings outperform traditional triple-based embeddings for causal link prediction
- Mechanism: The StarE algorithm can handle an arbitrary number of qualifier pairs (mediators) per causal link, allowing the model to incorporate multiple contextual factors simultaneously
- Core assumption: The ability to handle multiple mediators as hyper-relations provides a more complete representation of causal relationships than binary triples
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "StarE is a graph neural network-based approach. It allows a varied number of qualifier pairs to be associated with the causal link"
  - [section] "It combines the causal relation embedding with a fixed-length vector representing the associated qualifier pair"
- Break condition: If the additional complexity of hyper-relational embeddings does not translate to improved predictive performance

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Reification of causal relations enables two-hop link prediction in causal knowledge graphs
- Mechanism: By creating reified relations like causesType and causedByType, the model can predict the type of causal entities even when they are not directly connected in the graph
- Core assumption: Two-hop relationships in causal networks can be effectively modeled through reified relations without losing important information
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "To overcome the issue of two-hop link prediction, CausalKG uses reified relation... for causal prediction: causeType (rcausesType ∈ Rc) to add a link connecting a cause-entity with the type of an effect-entity"
  - [section] "The embedding models make predictions about directly linked entities"
- Break condition: If reification introduces too much abstraction or loses important semantic distinctions between entities

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Hyper-relational knowledge graphs
  - Why needed here: To represent causal relationships that involve mediators between cause and effect entities
  - Quick check question: How does a hyper-relational triple differ from a standard RDF triple?

- Concept: Graph neural networks and message passing
  - Why needed here: To learn embeddings from hyper-relational causal knowledge graphs that can incorporate information from multiple qualifiers
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between message passing in standard GNNs and in hyper-relational GNNs?

- Concept: Knowledge graph embedding algorithms
  - Why needed here: To convert the causal knowledge graph structure into continuous vector representations suitable for machine learning tasks
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between translation-based and semantic matching embedding approaches?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Causal network → Hyper-relational CausalKG → StarE embeddings → Link prediction
- Critical path: The transformation from causal network to hyper-relational knowledge graph is the most critical step, as it determines the quality of the input to the embedding model
- Design tradeoffs: Hyper-relational representations provide richer context but increase model complexity and computational requirements
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on link prediction tasks despite high embedding quality may indicate issues with the causal network structure or mediator identification
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare MRR and Hits@K metrics between HyperCausalLP and baseline methods on a small subset of CLEVRER-Humans
  2. Test different numbers of qualifier pairs per causal link to find the optimal balance between expressiveness and model complexity
  3. Evaluate the impact of different graph structures (C vs CT) on prediction performance for both causal explanation and prediction tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of HyperCausalLP scale with increasingly complex causal networks that contain multiple mediators between cause and effect nodes?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates effectiveness on CLEVRER-Humans but does not explore performance on networks with multiple sequential mediators or more complex causal structures beyond the simple A→B→C serial case.
- Why unresolved: The evaluation focuses on relatively simple causal structures with single mediators, leaving uncertainty about performance in more complex real-world scenarios with multiple mediating factors.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical evaluation on benchmark datasets containing multi-step causal chains with multiple mediators, or synthetic datasets systematically varying the number of mediators between cause and effect nodes.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of noisy or incomplete mediator information on the causal link prediction performance of HyperCausalLP?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that causal networks are often incomplete due to missing observation data, but does not explicitly evaluate how missing or noisy mediator information affects prediction accuracy.
- Why unresolved: The current evaluation assumes complete mediator information is available, which may not reflect real-world conditions where mediator data could be uncertain or missing.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments introducing varying degrees of noise or missing data in mediator entities and measuring degradation in causal link prediction performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does HyperCausalLP compare to other causal inference methods that explicitly model causal mechanisms rather than relying on statistical patterns in knowledge graphs?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper frames causal link prediction as a knowledge graph completion task but does not compare against traditional causal inference approaches like structural equation modeling or do-calculus-based methods.
- Why unresolved: The work focuses on knowledge graph embedding approaches without benchmarking against established causal inference methodologies that might capture mechanistic relationships differently.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative evaluation between HyperCausalLP and traditional causal inference methods on datasets where ground truth causal mechanisms are known, measuring both predictive accuracy and ability to capture true causal relationships.

## Limitations

- Evaluation relies on a single dataset (CLEVRER-Humans), limiting generalizability to other causal domains
- Paper does not provide statistical significance testing between HyperCausalLP and baseline methods
- Computational overhead of hyper-relational embeddings versus traditional approaches is not quantified

## Confidence

- High confidence in the core hypothesis that mediators provide contextual information for causal relationships
- Medium confidence in the quantitative performance claims due to lack of statistical significance testing and reliance on a single dataset
- Medium confidence in the scalability claims, as computational complexity analysis is absent

## Next Checks

1. Conduct statistical significance testing (e.g., paired t-tests) comparing HyperCausalLP against baseline methods across multiple random seeds to verify robustness of the 5.94% MRR improvement
2. Evaluate the approach on additional causal datasets beyond CLEVRER-Humans to assess generalizability to different domains and relationship types
3. Benchmark computational runtime and memory requirements for hyper-relational versus traditional KG embeddings to quantify the cost of improved performance
