# HackAtari: Atari Learning Environments for Robust and Continual Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2406.03997
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03997
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** HackAtari tests RL robustness through controlled Atari variations, revealing agent misalignment and generalization gaps

## Executive Summary
HackAtari is a framework that introduces controlled variations to Atari Learning Environments (ALE) to systematically test reinforcement learning (RL) agent robustness and alignment. By modifying game dynamics through RAM alterations, the framework enables color swaps, gameplay shifts, skill simplifications, and reward signal changes. The key insight is that even minor modifications to familiar Atari games can dramatically reduce agent performance, while humans adapt more easily. This highlights fundamental gaps in how RL agents learn and generalize compared to human players.

## Method Summary
HackAtari modifies Atari games at the RAM level, applying targeted alterations that change visual elements, game mechanics, difficulty, or reward structures while keeping the overall game structure intact. The framework focuses on making the "least-possible modification" to each game, altering specific RAM addresses that control colors, positions, velocities, or reward signals. This approach allows systematic testing of agent robustness across four variation types: color swapping, gameplay changes, skill simplification, and reward modifications. The framework also supports curriculum learning by enabling task simplification and can use LLMs to generate new reward functions for behavior alignment.

## Key Results
- RL agents trained on original Atari games fail dramatically when tested on even simple variations (e.g., Breakout scores drop from ~400 to ~8)
- Human players adapt more easily to variations than RL agents, highlighting a fundamental generalization gap
- Agents often learn sub-goals or exploit unintended game mechanics rather than pursuing true objectives
- LLM-designed reward functions can redirect agent behavior toward intended goals when properly aligned

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
HackAtari works by creating controlled perturbations in familiar environments, allowing researchers to isolate and measure specific aspects of agent robustness and alignment. By modifying RAM addresses that control game dynamics, the framework creates variations that test whether agents truly understand game objectives or merely memorize specific state-action patterns. The "least-possible modification" principle ensures that variations are meaningful but not trivially different, providing a sensitive probe of agent generalization capabilities.

## Foundational Learning

**Reinforcement Learning Basics**: Understanding states, actions, rewards, and policies is essential for grasping how agents learn in Atari environments. Quick check: Can you explain the difference between value-based and policy-based RL methods?

**Atari Learning Environment (ALE)**: Familiarity with ALE's observation space, action space, and reward structure is crucial for understanding how HackAtari modifies games. Quick check: What are the 18 possible actions in most Atari games?

**RAM-based Game Modification**: Knowledge of how Atari games store game state in RAM is necessary to understand how HackAtari creates variations. Quick check: Why does modifying RAM addresses provide more precise control than modifying pixel observations?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: HackAtari -> RAM Modifier -> ALE Wrapper -> RL Agent

**Critical Path**: RAM addresses are identified for each variation type → Modification functions are applied to ALE environments → RL agents are trained/tested on original and modified games → Performance metrics are collected and analyzed

**Design Tradeoffs**: HackAtari prioritizes minimal modifications over dramatic changes to better isolate robustness issues. This approach may miss some generalization problems but provides clearer signals about specific failure modes.

**Failure Signatures**: Agents may fail by (1) ignoring the variation entirely, (2) learning to exploit the modification rather than adapt to it, or (3) catastrophically forgetting original game mechanics when trained on variations.

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Test a trained agent on a color-swapped version of its original game
2. Apply a gameplay modification that changes a core game mechanic (e.g., paddle speed)
3. Create a simplified version of a game by removing obstacles and compare learning speed

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses on only 4 Atari games and 8 variation types, limiting generalizability
- No systematic comparison with other robustness benchmarks beyond anecdotal Atari 2600 examples
- LLM reward design experiments are preliminary, testing only one game with limited prompt variations

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The core observation that standard RL agents struggle with even simple game variations
**Medium confidence**: The framework's utility for testing continual learning and alignment, based on limited experimental scope
**Medium confidence**: Human adaptability claims, though supported by qualitative observations

## Next Checks

1. Test agent performance across a broader set of Atari games and variation combinations to establish generalization patterns
2. Implement ablation studies comparing different RAM addresses for each variation type to validate the "least-possible modification" principle
3. Conduct systematic comparisons between human players and agents across multiple skill levels to quantify the adaptation gap more precisely
