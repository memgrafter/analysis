# Music to Dance as Language Translation using Sequence Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.15569
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15569
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: MDLT achieves low Average Joint Error (AJE) and FID scores on AIST++ and PhantomDance datasets, demonstrating effective music-to-dance translation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MDLT, a novel approach that frames music-to-dance generation as a translation problem between audio and pose sequences. The authors propose two variants: MDLT-T using a Transformer architecture and MDLT-M using the Mamba architecture. Both models are trained to predict dance poses from audio features extracted using Librosa. The models are evaluated on the AIST++ and PhantomDance datasets, showing low Average Joint Error (AJE) and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) scores, demonstrating their ability to generate coherent and realistic dance choreographies across various music genres.

## Method Summary
MDLT treats music-to-dance generation as a translation task, where audio features serve as the "source language" and dance poses as the "target language." The method uses sequence models trained on language translation to learn temporal correlations between music and dance. Two variants are proposed: MDLT-T using a Transformer architecture and MDLT-M using the Mamba architecture. Both models are trained to predict dance poses from audio features extracted using Librosa. The models are evaluated on the AIST++ and PhantomDance datasets, showing low Average Joint Error (AJE) and FID scores, demonstrating their ability to generate coherent and realistic dance choreographies across various music genres.

## Key Results
- MDLT-T achieves an average AJE of 0.44 radians and FID of 0.51% across all experiments on AIST++
- MDLT-M achieves an average AJE of 0.73 radians and FID of 0.82% on PhantomDance
- The models demonstrate effective music-to-dance translation across various genres, validating the translation framing approach

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Framing music-to-dance as a translation task enables the model to learn a direct mapping between audio and pose sequences, improving generalization to unseen music.
- Mechanism: By treating music features as "source language" and dance poses as "target language," the model can use sequence models trained on language translation to learn temporal correlations and mapping functions between modalities.
- Core assumption: The temporal and stylistic relationship between music and dance is consistent and learnable, allowing a direct translation-like mapping.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We introduce MDLT, a novel approach that frames the choreography generation problem as a translation task."
  - [section] "we propose to expand from this sequence modelling view a propose to model the music to dance generation problem as a direct translation task."
  - [corpus] Weak - related works focus on sequence modeling but not explicit translation framing.
- Break condition: If music and dance relationships are highly genre-specific or non-stationary, the translation mapping may not generalize well.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Conditioning the encoder on short audio sequences (K=20 for Transformer, K=120 for Mamba) balances computational efficiency with context richness.
- Mechanism: Instead of encoding entire songs, the model conditions on K-step windows, preventing quadratic scaling and allowing iterative pose prediction over time.
- Core assumption: Short-term audio context is sufficient to predict the next pose step without losing long-term rhythmic coherence.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "we face a constraint. Due to the extensive length of music pieces, ranging up to 8000 audio features, conditioning the encoder on the entire music piece is impractical. Consequently, we condition the encoder on a sequence of size K of preceding audio feature vectors s."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence; this is a novel design choice.
- Break condition: If choreography requires longer-range audio dependencies (e.g., verse-chorus structure), short conditioning may fail.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using Mamba's selective state spaces improves scalability and potentially context handling compared to Transformers.
- Mechanism: Mamba processes sequences linearly with selective state updates, allowing longer conditioning windows (K=120) without the quadratic cost of self-attention.
- Core assumption: Mamba's linear complexity enables better long-range modeling for music-dance translation compared to Transformers.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Mamba has surpassed Transformers in many sequence processing tasks. Because of this, we propose the variant MDLT-M using the Mamba architecture."
  - [corpus] No direct comparison evidence in this paper; relies on general claims about Mamba.
- Break condition: If Mamba's selective mechanism underperforms in capturing fine-grained musical cues, translation quality may degrade.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Audio feature extraction using Librosa (MFCC, chroma, tempogram, onset strength).
  - Why needed here: Converts raw music into structured, normalized vectors the model can condition on.
  - Quick check question: What is the dimensionality of the concatenated audio feature vector used by MDLT?

- Concept: Joint angle mapping from human keypoints to robotic arm DOFs.
  - Why needed here: Translates human dance poses into feasible robotic motions for the UR3 arm.
  - Quick check question: How many DOFs does the UR3 have, and how many joint angles are used from human poses?

- Concept: Sequence modeling with positional encoding vs. state space selection.
  - Why needed here: Enables the model to understand order and timing in both music and dance sequences.
  - Quick check question: Why does the Transformer variant use positional embeddings but Mamba does not?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Audio embedding -> Encoder (Transformer/Mamba) -> Decoder (Transformer) -> Pose projection -> Tanh scaling -> Joint angles
- Critical path: Extract audio -> Embed -> Encode/Process -> Decode (if Transformer) -> Project to pose space -> Scale to joint limits
- Design tradeoffs: Transformer allows richer attention but scales poorly; Mamba scales better but may lose fine-grained attention. Sequence length K trades context richness vs. compute.
- Failure signatures: High AJE/FID -> poor translation mapping; mode collapse -> poor diversity; training instability -> hyperparam issues
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train MDLT-T on single-genre AIST++ data; measure AJE/FID per genre
  2. Train MDLT-M on full AIST++; compare AJE/FID to MDLT-T
  3. Train MDLT-T on PhantomDance; evaluate generalization to longer, more diverse dances

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does MDLT perform on dance styles beyond those present in the training data, particularly highly improvisational or culturally specific genres?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates on AIST++ and PhantomDance datasets but does not explore generalization to entirely new dance styles or cultural contexts.
- Why unresolved: The experiments focus on known genres within the datasets, leaving the model's ability to generalize to unseen styles untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing MDLT on a dataset containing dance styles not present in the training data, measuring performance via AJE and FID metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of incorporating hand rotation and full-body joint angles (beyond the arm) on the quality of generated dance choreographies?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly mentions simplifying the problem by reducing 6 joints to 4 and avoiding hand rotation due to detection challenges.
- Why unresolved: The authors prioritized avoiding potential errors that could affect convergence, but this simplification may limit the expressiveness of the generated dances.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extending MDLT to include full-body joint angles and hand rotation, then comparing performance metrics (AJE, FID) with the current simplified model.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does MDLT's performance compare to state-of-the-art music-to-dance generation methods that use different architectures or training strategies?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper compares MDLT-T and MDLT-M but does not directly compare them to other leading methods in the field.
- Why unresolved: The evaluation focuses on internal comparisons and does not benchmark against other recent approaches like DanceFormer or methods using adversarial training.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting a comparative study between MDLT and other state-of-the-art music-to-dance generation methods, evaluating on the same datasets and metrics.

## Limitations

- The translation framing lacks empirical validation against standard sequence modeling approaches, with no direct comparison to RNN/LSTM baselines
- The architectural comparison between Transformer and Mamba is confounded by different conditioning lengths (K=20 vs K=120), making it unclear if performance differences are due to architecture or context window size
- The FID evaluation methodology is underspecified, not clarifying whether poses, videos, or skeletal representations are compared, limiting interpretation of realism claims

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The AJE metric results showing low joint angle errors (0.44-0.73 radians) across both models and datasets are well-supported by the experimental setup and provide reliable evidence of accurate pose prediction.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that MDLT frames music-to-dance as an effective translation task is supported by quantitative metrics but lacks comparative validation against non-translation sequence models. Performance differences between Transformer and Mamba variants could be attributed to conditioning length differences rather than architectural superiority.

**Low Confidence**: Claims about Mamba's superiority for this task based on its "selective state spaces" improving scalability and context handling are not substantiated by direct comparisons in this paper. These assertions rely on general literature about Mamba rather than task-specific evidence.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation on Conditioning Length**: Train MDLT-T with K=120 (matching MDLT-M's conditioning length) to isolate whether the Mamba architecture or longer context drives performance differences. Compare AJE/FID scores to determine if architectural advantages exist beyond window size.

2. **Direct Sequence Model Baseline**: Implement a standard sequence-to-sequence model (e.g., LSTM encoder-decoder) on the same AIST++ and PhantomDance datasets using identical audio features and pose representations. Compare AJE and FID scores to MDLT variants to validate whether the translation framing provides measurable benefits over conventional temporal modeling.

3. **FID Evaluation Protocol Clarification**: Document the exact FID computation methodology, including whether poses, rendered videos, or skeletal representations are used, the number of samples compared, and preprocessing steps. Reproduce FID calculations on a subset of data to verify reported values and ensure consistent interpretation across studies.
