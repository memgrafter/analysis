# Disentangling, Amplifying, and Debiasing: Learning Disentangled Representations for Fair Graph Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.12875
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12875
- Reference count: 17
- Key outcome: Novel framework DAB-GNN disentangles attribute, structure, and potential biases in GNNs, achieving superior accuracy and fairness on five real-world datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses fairness challenges in Graph Neural Networks caused by attribute, structure, and potential biases in node data. The authors propose DAB-GNN, a framework that isolates and amplifies each bias type through specialized disentanglers before applying debiasing regularizers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAB-GNN significantly outperforms ten state-of-the-art competitors on both accuracy and fairness metrics across five real-world datasets. The method successfully isolates different biases in the embedding space and shows robustness across diverse graph structures.

## Method Summary
DAB-GNN employs a disentanglement and amplification module that isolates and amplifies each type of bias through specialized disentanglers. The framework uses three disentanglers: AbDisen for attribute bias, SbDisen for structure bias, and PbDisen for potential bias. These create separate embeddings for each bias type before joint processing. The debiasing module employs two regularizers: BCO maximizes Frobenius distance between different bias embeddings, while FH minimizes Wasserstein distance between subgroup distributions within each bias type. The model is trained with a combined loss function incorporating primary task performance and both regularizers.

## Key Results
- DAB-GNN achieves superior accuracy and fairness metrics compared to ten state-of-the-art competitors
- Successfully isolates attribute, structure, and potential biases in the embedding space
- Demonstrates robustness across five diverse real-world datasets
- Shows significant improvements in both SP and EO fairness metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Disentangling different bias types prevents their mutual interference during downstream debiasing
- Mechanism: Three specialized disentanglers (AbDisen, SbDisen, PbDisen) create separate embeddings for attribute, structure, and potential biases before any joint processing
- Core assumption: Each bias type can be uniquely identified and extracted using distinct graph representations
- Break condition: If the three bias types cannot be cleanly separated, the disentanglement will fail and cross-bias effects will persist

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Amplifying each bias before debiasing makes its characteristics more distinct and easier to neutralize
- Mechanism: Message-passing in each disentangler is deliberately tuned to emphasize its target bias type
- Core assumption: Stronger signal of each bias leads to better identification and removal
- Break condition: If amplification causes numerical instability, the model may diverge or become untrainable

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Dual regularizers (BCO and FH) enforce both separation between bias types and fairness within each type
- Mechanism: BCO maximizes Frobenius distance between different bias embeddings; FH minimizes Wasserstein distance between subgroup distributions within each bias type
- Core assumption: Clear separation between bias embeddings plus subgroup alignment within each type yields fair representations
- Break condition: If hyperparameters α and β are poorly chosen, one regularizer may dominate, undermining either separation or subgroup fairness

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph Neural Networks and message-passing
  - Why needed here: DAB-GNN builds on GNN message-passing to disentangle and amplify biases
  - Quick check question: How does a 2-layer GCN aggregate information from 2-hop neighbors, and how would you modify the adjacency matrix to focus only on attribute similarity?

- Concept: Bias definitions in graph data
  - Why needed here: DAB-GNN distinguishes attribute, structure, and potential biases
  - Quick check question: Given a graph where nodes of the same gender are more likely to connect, which bias type does this exemplify?

- Concept: Wasserstein and Frobenius distances
  - Why needed here: FH uses Wasserstein-1 distance; BCO uses Frobenius norm
  - Quick check question: If two subgroup distributions have the same mean but different variances, will Wasserstein distance detect this difference?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input → Attribute k-NN adjacency → AbDisen (attribute bias) + Random feature adjacency → SbDisen (structure bias) + Concat → PbDisen (potential bias) → Concatenate all three → BCO regularizer (between types) + FH regularizer (within types) → Final embeddings for downstream task
- Critical path: Disentanglers → Bias amplification → Regularizers → Concatenation → Downstream loss
- Design tradeoffs: Three separate disentanglers increase parameter count but improve bias isolation; Wasserstein distance is more robust but slower than alternatives
- Failure signatures:
  - Attribute and structure embeddings still cluster together → BCO too weak or disentanglers poorly initialized
  - Subgroup distributions remain separated after FH → α too low or Wasserstein approximation inaccurate
  - Training diverges → β too high or amplification too aggressive
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train with only AbDisen and SbDisen (skip PbDisen) to confirm attribute and structure biases are separable
  2. Remove BCO and check if bias embeddings collapse into one cluster
  3. Set α=0 and observe whether subgroup fairness degrades despite good separation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the DAB-GNN framework handle scenarios where the sensitive attribute is not binary?
- Basis in paper: The paper discusses binary sensitive attributes but does not explicitly address multi-category scenarios
- Why unresolved: The current framework and evaluation metrics are designed for binary sensitive attributes
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results on datasets with multi-category sensitive attributes

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of different types of graph structures on the performance of DAB-GNN?
- Basis in paper: The paper evaluates DAB-GNN on undirected homogeneous graphs but does not explore other graph types
- Why unresolved: The disentanglement and amplification strategies may need to be adapted for different graph structures
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies on various graph structures including directed and heterogeneous graphs

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does DAB-GNN perform in dynamic graph scenarios?
- Basis in paper: The paper focuses on static graphs and does not address dynamic scenarios
- Why unresolved: Dynamic graphs introduce additional complexities in maintaining fairness and accuracy
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results on dynamic graph datasets with adaptations for temporal changes

## Limitations
- Primary uncertainty lies in the novelty and effectiveness of the bias disentanglement approach
- Reliance on specific distance metrics introduces sensitivity to hyperparameters that could affect reproducibility
- Computational overhead of three separate disentanglers versus potential performance gains needs clearer quantification

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Mathematical formulation of disentanglement and debiasing modules, experimental superiority over ten baselines
- **Medium Confidence**: Mechanism of bias amplification and its necessity for effective debiasing
- **Low Confidence**: Claim that this is the first method to treat three biases separately, generalizability across different graph types

## Next Checks
1. Ablation on Bias Types: Remove one disentangler at a time to quantify each bias type's contribution to final performance
2. Hyperparameter Sensitivity: Systematically vary α and β to determine stability ranges and identify potential overfitting
3. Cross-Dataset Generalization: Test DAB-GNN on additional graph datasets to validate robustness beyond the five reported datasets
