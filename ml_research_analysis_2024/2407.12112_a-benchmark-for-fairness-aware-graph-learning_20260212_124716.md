# A Benchmark for Fairness-Aware Graph Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.12112
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12112
- Reference count: 40
- This paper presents the first comprehensive benchmark for fairness-aware graph learning methods

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the first comprehensive benchmark for fairness-aware graph learning methods, addressing a critical gap in the field where systematic evaluation has been lacking. The authors collect ten representative methods and evaluate them across seven real-world datasets using multiple perspectives including group fairness, individual fairness, balance between fairness criteria, and computational efficiency. The study reveals that different methods excel in different aspects—GNN-based methods generally achieve better utility-fairness trade-offs while shallow embedding methods perform better on fairness metrics. The benchmark provides crucial insights and practical guidance for practitioners to select appropriate methods based on their specific requirements.

## Method Summary
The benchmark evaluates ten fairness-aware graph learning methods on seven real-world attributed graph datasets for node classification tasks. Methods include FairWalk, CrossWalk, FairGNN, NIFTY, EDITS, FairEdit, FairVGNN, InFoRM, REDRESS, and GUIDE. The evaluation framework measures group fairness (∆SP, ∆EO, ∆Utility), individual fairness (BLipschitz, NDCG@k, GDIF), utility (AUC-ROC score), and computational efficiency (running time). Experiments use PyGDebias library version 1.1.1 with default hyperparameter settings, though specific hyperparameter ranges for optimization remain unspecified.

## Key Results
- GNN-based methods generally achieve better utility-fairness trade-offs than shallow embedding methods due to superior fitting ability
- Shallow embedding methods like FairWalk and CrossWalk achieve better fairness metrics by avoiding node attribute bias
- GUIDE achieves the most versatile individual fairness performance through its compositional design with multiple fairness objectives

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** GNN-based fairness-aware methods achieve better utility-fairness trade-offs than shallow embedding methods due to their superior fitting ability.
- **Mechanism:** GNNs leverage node attributes and graph structure to learn richer representations, allowing them to optimize both utility and fairness objectives simultaneously.
- **Core assumption:** The node attribute information contains bias that can be mitigated while preserving predictive power.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "GNN-based methods generally achieve better utility-fairness trade-offs"
  - [section] "This verifies the natural advantage of GNNs in achieving both accurate and fair predictions owing to their superior fitting ability."
- **Break condition:** If node attributes are completely unbiased or contain no useful signal for the prediction task, the advantage of GNNs may disappear.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Shallow embedding methods like FairWalk and CrossWalk achieve better fairness metrics (∆SP, ∆EO) by avoiding node attribute bias entirely.
- **Mechanism:** These methods perform random walks based only on graph topology, not node attributes, thus eliminating attribute-based bias.
- **Core assumption:** Node attributes are a primary source of bias in graph learning tasks.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "shallow embedding methods perform better on fairness metrics"
  - [section] "these shallow embedding methods do not take node attributes as input compared with those GNN-based ones, such an observation can be partially attributed to the absence of bias encoded in the node attributes."
- **Break condition:** If graph structure itself encodes bias (e.g., through homophily), shallow methods may still produce biased results.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** GUIDE achieves the most versatile individual fairness performance because its objective function is compositionally designed with multiple fairness objectives.
- **Mechanism:** GUIDE incorporates both Lipschitz-based and ratio-based fairness objectives, allowing it to improve multiple individual fairness metrics simultaneously rather than optimizing one at the expense of others.
- **Core assumption:** Combining multiple fairness objectives in a single optimization framework can yield balanced improvements across different fairness notions.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section] "GUIDE also delivers the second best BLipschitz and NDCG@k on four out of the seven datasets at the same time"
  - [section] "GUIDE contributes to a more general improvement in terms of the levels of individual fairness instead of only optimizing one objective and sacrificing others."
- **Break condition:** If the different fairness objectives conflict irreconcilably, the compositional design may lead to suboptimal performance on all metrics.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Group fairness vs. individual fairness distinction
  - **Why needed here:** The benchmark evaluates methods under both fairness notions, requiring understanding of their different metrics and optimization goals
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain the difference between ∆SP (group fairness) and BLipschitz (individual fairness) in one sentence each?

- **Concept:** Pareto optimal frontier in multi-objective optimization
  - **Why needed here:** The utility-fairness trade-off is characterized by Pareto frontiers, and understanding this concept is crucial for interpreting the results
  - **Quick check question:** If a method achieves higher AUC-ROC at the same ∆EO as another method, what does this tell you about their position relative to the Pareto frontier?

- **Concept:** Random walk based node embedding methods
  - **Why needed here:** FairWalk and CrossWalk are evaluated as baselines, and understanding their mechanism is essential for interpreting why they perform differently from GNNs
  - **Quick check question:** How does the transition probability modification in FairWalk differ from standard DeepWalk, and why would this affect fairness?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data collection and preprocessing → Ten fairness-aware graph learning method implementations → Evaluation metrics calculation (group and individual fairness) → Experimental protocol with hyperparameter tuning → Analysis and visualization
- **Critical path:** Data → Method execution → Metric computation → Result aggregation → Analysis
- **Design tradeoffs:** The benchmark prioritizes comprehensive evaluation over computational efficiency (OOM issues on some datasets), and focuses on node classification over other graph tasks
- **Failure signatures:** OOM errors on large datasets indicate memory bottlenecks; inconsistent results across runs suggest instability in certain methods; missing results for specific metrics indicate implementation gaps
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Run FairWalk on Pokec-z dataset and verify it produces reasonable fairness metrics without OOM
  2. Execute GUIDE on German Credit dataset and check individual fairness metrics (BLipschitz, NDCG@k, GDIF)
  3. Compare GNN baseline with FairGNN on Recidivism dataset to observe utility-fairness trade-off

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** Which fairness-aware graph learning method achieves the best overall trade-off between utility and fairness across all datasets?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper presents comprehensive benchmarking results comparing ten representative methods across seven datasets, revealing that different methods excel in different aspects.
  - **Why unresolved:** While the paper identifies that GNN-based methods generally achieve better utility-fairness trade-offs and shallow embedding methods perform better on fairness metrics, it does not definitively declare a single "best overall" method.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A definitive answer would require calculating a weighted composite score across all datasets and metrics, potentially with practitioner-defined weights for different application priorities.

- **Open Question 2:** How do fairness-aware graph learning methods perform on other graph learning tasks beyond node classification?
  - **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper focuses on node classification as the primary task, noting that "evaluations on other graph learning tasks remain a future direction to be explored."
  - **Why unresolved:** The authors explicitly acknowledge this as a limitation and future direction, but do not provide empirical results for tasks like link prediction or graph classification.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Systematic evaluation of the ten benchmarked methods on alternative graph learning tasks with consistent metrics would reveal whether the observed patterns generalize beyond node classification.

- **Open Question 3:** What is the relationship between individual fairness and group fairness in graph learning methods, and can they be optimized simultaneously?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper evaluates methods separately on group and individual fairness, noting that methods focusing on each type of fairness show different strengths, but does not explore their relationship.
  - **Why unresolved:** While the paper identifies that different methods excel at different types of fairness, it does not investigate whether optimizing for one type necessarily compromises the other, or whether methods can be designed to address both simultaneously.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Empirical studies examining the correlation between group and individual fairness metrics across methods and datasets, potentially including methods designed to optimize both simultaneously, would clarify their relationship.

## Limitations
- The benchmark focuses exclusively on node classification tasks, excluding link prediction and graph-level tasks
- Evaluation relies on seven real-world datasets that may not capture the full diversity of graph structures and bias patterns
- Computational efficiency analysis is limited by OOM issues on larger datasets, suggesting incomplete scalability assessment

## Confidence

**High confidence in:** The relative ranking of methods across different fairness metrics (GNN-based vs. shallow methods)

**Medium confidence in:** The generalizability of utility-fairness trade-off findings due to dataset limitations; computational efficiency comparisons due to incomplete scalability testing

## Next Checks

1. Test the benchmark framework on synthetic graphs with controlled bias patterns to validate method behavior under known conditions
2. Extend evaluation to link prediction tasks to assess whether GNN advantages persist in different prediction contexts
3. Implement memory-efficient variants of OOM-prone methods to enable complete scalability assessment
