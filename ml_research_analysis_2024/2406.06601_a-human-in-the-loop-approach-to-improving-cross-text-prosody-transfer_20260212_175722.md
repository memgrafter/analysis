# A Human-in-the-Loop Approach to Improving Cross-Text Prosody Transfer

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.06601
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06601
- Reference count: 0
- Human-adjusted cross-text prosody transfer samples rated more appropriate 57.8% of the time

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a Human-in-the-Loop (HitL) method for improving cross-text prosody transfer in text-to-speech synthesis. The authors address the problem that prosody transfer models struggle to transfer prosody to text that differs from the reference utterance, resulting in reduced naturalness. Their method involves human participants adjusting word- and utterance-level F0, energy, and duration features to make the prosody more appropriate for the target text while maintaining the overall reference prosodic effect. The results show that human-adjusted renditions were rated as more appropriate for the target text 57.8% of the time compared to the original prosody transfer samples.

## Method Summary
The authors use a pre-trained Daft-Exprt model and create a web-based HitL interface where participants can adjust word-level and utterance-level F0, energy, and duration features of cross-text prosody transfer samples. Participants listen to reference utterances and target texts, then modify the prosody to make it more appropriate while maintaining the reference prosodic effect. The study uses the 2013 Blizzard Challenge corpus and evaluates results through MOS, MUSHRA-like, and A/B preference surveys with 420 sample pairs rated by multiple participants.

## Key Results
- Human-adjusted samples rated more appropriate for target text 57.8% of the time
- Limited user effort suffices for improvements in prosody transfer quality
- Closeness in latent reference space is not a reliable prosodic similarity metric for cross-text condition
- Edited samples perceived as slightly less natural due to artifacts from HitL control procedure

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Human-in-the-Loop (HitL) participants can identify prosodic renditions that are more appropriate for the target text while preserving the overall reference prosody effect.
- Mechanism: Participants interact with the model through word-level and utterance-level control of F0, energy, and duration features. These adjustments are made to the phone-level predictions of the prosody predictor in the baseline Daft-Exprt model. The adjustments are designed to maintain the reference prosody while making the output more appropriate for the target text.
- Core assumption: Participants can perceptually identify the prosodic intent from the reference and modify the cross-text PT sample accordingly.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Human adjusted renditions maintain the reference prosody while being rated as more appropriate for the target text 57.8% of the time."
  - [section] "Our results indicate that HitL participants can discover prosodic renditions that are more appropriate for the given target text while maintaining most of the reference prosody effect."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - the corpus neighbors do not directly address the HitL approach or its effectiveness in improving cross-text prosody transfer.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Limited user effort suffices for improvements in cross-text prosody transfer.
- Mechanism: Participants make adjustments to F0, energy, and duration features through a web-based user interface. The interface allows for utterance-level and word-level control, reducing the complexity of interacting with phone-level predictions.
- Core assumption: The HitL interface and control scheme are effective in enabling participants to make meaningful adjustments with limited effort.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our analysis suggests that limited user effort suffices for these improvements."
  - [section] "Participants spent on average 123.5 ± 138.0 seconds modifying each sample, resulting in on average 7.0 ± 7.1 individual operations per utterance."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - the corpus neighbors do not directly address the effort required for HitL approaches in TTS.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Closeness in the latent reference space is not a reliable prosodic similarity metric for the cross-text condition.
- Mechanism: The reference embedding predicted by the PT model may yield perceptually different prosody depending on the target text. Edited cross-text PT samples that are rated as prosodically similar to the reference tend to be further away from the reference embedding in the latent space.
- Core assumption: The latent reference space does not accurately represent the perceived prosodic similarity between the reference and the edited cross-text PT samples.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our analysis suggests that... closeness in the latent reference space is not a reliable prosodic similarity metric for the cross-text condition."
  - [section] "Edited cross-text PT samples that are found to be prosodically similar to the reference tend to be further away from the reference embedding in the latent space."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - the corpus neighbors do not directly address the reliability of latent reference space as a prosodic similarity metric.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Prosody and its correlates (F0, energy, duration)
  - Why needed here: Understanding prosody and its acoustic correlates is crucial for designing the HitL interface and interpreting the results. Participants need to adjust F0, energy, and duration to improve prosody transfer.
  - Quick check question: What are the main acoustic correlates of prosody used in this study, and how are they controlled through the HitL interface?

- Concept: Cross-text prosody transfer and its challenges
  - Why needed here: The paper addresses the problem of reduced perceived naturalness when transferring prosody to text that differs from the reference utterance. Understanding this challenge is essential for evaluating the proposed HitL approach.
  - Quick check question: What is the main challenge in cross-text prosody transfer, and how does the proposed HitL method aim to address it?

- Concept: Human-in-the-Loop (HitL) methods in TTS
  - Why needed here: The paper proposes a HitL approach to improve cross-text prosody transfer. Understanding HitL methods and their applications in TTS is necessary for comprehending the design and evaluation of the proposed method.
  - Quick check question: How does the proposed HitL method differ from previous HitL approaches in TTS, and what are its key advantages?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Daft-Exprt model -> Reference encoder -> Low-level prosody predictor -> Frame decoder -> HiFi-GAN vocoder
  HitL interface -> Word-level control -> Utterance-level control

- Critical path:
  1. Generate initial cross-text PT sample using Daft-Exprt model
  2. Participant listens to reference utterance and initial sample
  3. Participant adjusts F0, energy, and duration through HitL interface
  4. Adjusted sample is generated using Daft-Exprt model with modified prosody predictions
  5. Participant indicates confidence in adjustments
  6. Samples are saved for evaluation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using word-level and utterance-level control instead of phone-level control to reduce complexity for participants
  - Limiting the range of F0 and energy modifications to prevent unintelligible output
  - Choosing a pre-trained Daft-Exprt model instead of training a new model from scratch

- Failure signatures:
  - Participants unable to make meaningful adjustments within the given time frame
  - Adjusted samples perceived as less natural or less appropriate for the target text
  - HitL interface not intuitive or difficult to use
  - Limited range of F0 and energy modifications preventing desired adjustments

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the effectiveness of the HitL approach in improving cross-text prosody transfer by comparing original and edited samples using subjective evaluations (MOS, MUSHRA-like, A/B preference).
  2. Analyze the relationship between HitL participant effort (time spent editing) and the quality of the output (perceived naturalness and prosody transfer).
  3. Investigate the reliability of the latent reference space as a prosodic similarity metric by comparing the reference embedding distance to subjective evaluations of prosody similarity.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does human-in-the-loop adjustment of prosody improve perceived naturalness in cross-text prosody transfer, or does the interaction itself introduce artifacts that degrade quality?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that edited samples were perceived as slightly less natural than original samples, and hypothesize this is due to artifacts introduced by the HitL control procedure.
- Why unresolved: The study did not isolate whether the degradation in naturalness was due to the interaction process itself or the specific limitations of the control interface (e.g., lack of pause duration control).
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled experiment comparing HitL-adjusted samples with samples generated by an improved interface that addresses current limitations (like pause control) would clarify if artifacts are the primary cause.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Is there an optimal level of human effort in the HitL approach that maximizes the balance between prosodic appropriateness and naturalness?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors found that more interaction time negatively correlated with perceived naturalness, suggesting that excessive effort might degrade output quality.
- Why unresolved: The study only measured the total time spent and number of edits, not the specific types or strategies of edits that lead to optimal outcomes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analyzing the types of edits made at different effort levels and correlating them with naturalness ratings could identify which adjustments improve prosody without harming naturalness.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the reference embedding in prosody transfer models be improved to better capture transferable prosodic representations across different texts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors found that closeness in the latent reference space is not a reliable metric for prosodic similarity in cross-text conditions, suggesting the current embeddings may not adequately represent transferable prosody.
- Why unresolved: The study used a pre-trained model and did not explore modifications to the reference encoder or training procedures to improve cross-text transferability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing different reference encoder architectures, training strategies (e.g., including cross-text samples), or post-processing techniques to enhance embedding transferability would determine if improved embeddings can be achieved.

## Limitations
- 57.8% preference rate indicates original model output was preferred nearly half the time, suggesting HitL approach doesn't provide universal improvement
- Study relies on relatively small corpus (52 hours from 55 different books) and limited evaluation samples (420 total)
- Focus on Daft-Exprt architecture limits generalizability to other prosody transfer models

## Confidence

- High confidence: The mechanism by which human participants can identify and adjust prosodic features to improve appropriateness for target text is well-supported by the results
- Medium confidence: The finding that limited user effort suffices for improvements, given the relatively high variance in participant editing times (average 123.5 ± 138.0 seconds)
- Medium confidence: The conclusion about latent reference space unreliability, as this analysis depends on the specific embedding space used and may vary with different model architectures

## Next Checks

1. Test the HitL approach across multiple prosody transfer architectures (beyond Daft-Exprt) to establish generalizability and identify which model components benefit most from human adjustment

2. Conduct a longitudinal study with the same participants to assess learning effects and whether repeated exposure improves adjustment quality and efficiency

3. Implement an automated baseline that applies statistical transformations to F0, energy, and duration features without human input to determine whether the 57.8% improvement stems from human judgment or simply from allowing feature modifications
