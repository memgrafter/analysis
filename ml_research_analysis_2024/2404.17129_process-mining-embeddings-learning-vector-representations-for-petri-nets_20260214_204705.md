# Process Mining Embeddings: Learning Vector Representations for Petri Nets

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2404.17129
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17129
- **Reference count**: 37
- **Primary result**: Achieved up to 0.73 silhouette scores for clustering and 92% classification accuracy on Petri net models

## Executive Summary
PetriNet2Vec introduces an unsupervised approach to convert complex Petri net models into embedding vectors using doc2Vec-inspired methodology. By treating transition sequences as sentences, it jointly learns model and task embeddings that capture structural dependencies. Tested on 96 Petri net models from the PDC dataset, the approach achieved silhouette scores up to 0.73 for clustering and enabled accurate process classification with up to 92% accuracy across different rule configurations. It also facilitated effective process retrieval through cosine similarity.

## Method Summary
PetriNet2Vec represents Petri nets as sequences of transitions and applies doc2Vec-inspired methodology to generate vector embeddings. The approach extracts transition sequences from process models, treating them as sentences in a document. Using Gensim's doc2Vec implementation, it learns both model-level and sequence-level embeddings that capture structural patterns. The system supports various embedding configurations including different vector dimensions, training algorithms, and window sizes. The learned embeddings can be used for clustering, classification, and similarity-based retrieval tasks in process mining.

## Key Results
- Achieved silhouette scores up to 0.73 for clustering Petri net models
- Enabled process classification with up to 92% accuracy across different rule configurations
- Facilitated effective process retrieval through cosine similarity of embeddings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging the distributional hypothesis from natural language processing, where structural patterns in process models are captured through transition sequences. By treating these sequences as sentences and models as documents, the method learns distributed representations that encode both local transition patterns and global model structures. The doc2Vec framework enables learning of vector spaces where similar processes are positioned closer together, allowing downstream tasks like clustering and classification to operate effectively on the continuous representations rather than discrete model structures.

## Foundational Learning
- **doc2Vec methodology**: Essential for understanding how document embeddings are learned from sequences of tokens. Quick check: Can you explain the difference between PV-DM and PV-DBOW architectures?
- **Petri net transition semantics**: Critical for interpreting how process executions translate to transition sequences. Quick check: What distinguishes visible from invisible transitions in Petri nets?
- **Cosine similarity**: Fundamental for measuring distances between embeddings in vector space. Quick check: Calculate cosine similarity between two simple vectors to verify understanding.
- **Silhouette score interpretation**: Necessary for evaluating clustering quality. Quick check: Can you interpret what a silhouette score of 0.73 means for cluster separation?
- **Vector space representation**: Core concept for understanding how discrete model structures map to continuous embeddings. Quick check: Explain how high-dimensional vectors can capture complex structural relationships.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
PDC Dataset -> Transition Sequence Extractor -> doc2Vec Trainer -> Embedding Vectors -> Downstream Tasks (Clustering, Classification, Retrieval)

### Critical Path
1. Extract transition sequences from Petri net models
2. Prepare sequence corpus for doc2Vec training
3. Train embeddings using Gensim's doc2Vec implementation
4. Apply embeddings to downstream tasks (clustering, classification, retrieval)

### Design Tradeoffs
The approach trades computational efficiency for representational power by using continuous vector embeddings rather than discrete feature sets. While doc2Vec provides rich semantic representations, it requires significant training time and careful hyperparameter tuning. The choice between PV-DM and PV-DBOW architectures affects both training speed and embedding quality. The fixed embedding dimension may limit expressiveness for extremely complex models but provides consistent computational requirements.

### Failure Signatures
- Poor clustering results indicate insufficient sequence diversity or inappropriate embedding dimensions
- Low classification accuracy suggests the embeddings fail to capture discriminative model features
- Inconsistent retrieval results may indicate inadequate training or suboptimal vector space configuration
- High variance in similarity scores across different model pairs suggests embedding instability

### First Experiments
1. Verify transition sequence extraction produces consistent results across multiple executions of the same model
2. Test doc2Vec training with different vector dimensions (50, 100, 200) to observe impact on downstream task performance
3. Compare clustering results using different distance metrics (cosine vs Euclidean) on the learned embeddings

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
The approach's effectiveness depends heavily on the quality and diversity of transition sequences extracted from Petri nets. Models with limited execution paths or highly repetitive structures may yield less informative embeddings. The current implementation focuses on acyclic models, potentially limiting applicability to more complex cyclic process structures. The evaluation was conducted on a specific dataset (PDC) with particular model characteristics, which may not generalize to all process mining domains.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The methodology's theoretical foundation and implementation are sound, with clear parallels to established doc2Vec approaches. The clustering and classification results are robust and reproducible.
- **Medium confidence**: The retrieval and similarity analysis capabilities show promise but require broader testing across diverse datasets and use cases.
- **Medium confidence**: The interpretation of embedding patterns as reflecting process model generation rules needs further validation with larger, more diverse model collections.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate PetriNet2Vec on datasets with different characteristics (e.g., models with cycles, varying complexity levels, different domains) to assess robustness.
2. Benchmark against alternative representation methods (e.g., graph neural networks, traditional feature-based approaches) on the same tasks to quantify relative performance.
3. Systematically test the impact of different components (sequence extraction method, embedding dimensions, training parameters) on downstream task performance.
