# Speaking Your Language: Spatial Relationships in Interpretable Emergent Communication

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2406.07277
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07277
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: First demonstration of spatial references emerging in agent communication with over 90% accuracy in interpreting positional messages

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether artificial agents can develop spatial references in emergent communication by introducing a referential game where agents must describe the relative position of a target integer within a sequence. The authors demonstrate that agents develop two distinct communication strategies: non-compositional messages for sparse positional observations (e.g., "begin" or "end") and compositional messages combining positional and integer references (e.g., "two right of 18"). Using an NPMI-based analysis method, they achieve over 90% accuracy in understanding non-compositional positional messages and over 75% for compositional messages. This work represents the first emergence of spatial references in emergent communication and provides a method for interpreting such languages, potentially paving the way for more human-like and efficient agent communication.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce a referential game where sender agents observe a window of 5 integers from a sequence and must communicate the relative position of a target integer to receiver agents who observe the full sequence. The agents are trained using the EGG framework with GRU-based architectures and Gumbel-Softmax sampling for discrete message generation. Messages consist of 3 integers from a vocabulary of 26. After training, the authors apply an NPMI-based analysis method to identify which message components encode spatial relationships by computing statistical associations between message n-grams and integer positions in observations. The method achieves high accuracy in translating emergent messages into interpretable spatial references.

## Key Results
- Agents develop non-compositional spatial messages for sparse positional observations with over 90% interpretability accuracy
- Compositional messages emerge containing both positional references and integer references, achieving over 75% interpretability accuracy
- NPMI-based analysis successfully identifies spatial references in emergent messages, demonstrating a method for interpreting agent communication
- This represents the first documented emergence of spatial references in emergent communication systems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Agents develop spatial references by mapping message n-grams to positional contexts in their observations.
- **Mechanism:** The PMIc algorithm computes NPMI between n-grams and integer positions, identifying which parts of a message encode spatial relationships.
- **Core assumption:** The statistical association measured by NPMI captures the agents' intended meaning rather than coincidental patterns.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "Using a collocation measure, Normalised Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI)...allows us to measure the strength of associations between message parts and their context"
  - [section 4]: "We use a collocation measure called Normalised Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI)...to determine which messages are used for which observations"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence provided for NPMI effectiveness
- **Break condition:** If the emergent language exhibits polysemy or non-trivial compositionality, NPMI associations may not reflect intended meaning.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Non-compositional messages emerge for sparse positional observations because they are more compressible.
- **Mechanism:** When certain positions (begin, begin+1, end, end-1) occur rarely, agents develop monolithic messages dedicated to these contexts rather than compositional references.
- **Core assumption:** Sparse observations benefit from specialized messages due to compression efficiency under linguistic parsimony pressure.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 5.1]: "We posit that the emergence of non-compositional spatial references tailored to specific observations...is due to observation sparsity"
  - [section 7]: "We hypothesise that the emergence of non-compositional references in these cases is advantageous, since these messages are easily compressible"
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence provided for sparsity-based message emergence
- **Break condition:** If the environment increases frequency of rare positions or introduces new sparse patterns, agents may need to develop additional non-compositional messages.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Compositional spatial references require syntactic structure where positional and integer components occupy specific message positions.
- **Mechanism:** Agents assign specific message positions to positional components (e.g., unigram 7 always in position 1) and integer components (e.g., bigram [0,2] always in position 2), creating a simple syntax.
- **Core assumption:** The referential game environment naturally incentivizes positional consistency for compositional messages to maintain interpretability.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 5.2]: "Such messages are composed of two parts, a positional reference and an integer reference...In the unigram 7 meaning that the target integer is 2 to the right of the given integer"
  - [section 6]: "We posit that the emergence of compositional spatial references points to a first emergence of a simple syntactic structure"
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence provided for positional consistency patterns
- **Break condition:** If agents develop flexible positional assignments or context-dependent syntax, the simple position-based interpretation may fail.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Referential games**
  - Why needed here: The entire spatial referencing mechanism depends on the sender-receiver setup where one agent must communicate about observations the other cannot see
  - Quick check question: In the referential game setup, what constraint forces the sender to communicate about spatial relationships rather than simply naming the target?

- **Concept: Collocation measures (NPMI)**
  - Why needed here: NPMI provides the mathematical framework for extracting meaning from emergent messages without requiring labeled datasets
  - Quick check question: What does NPMI measure in the context of emergent communication, and why is normalization important?

- **Concept: Compositionality in language**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how compositional vs non-compositional messages emerge helps explain the trade-offs agents make in their communication strategy
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between compositional and non-compositional messages in the context of spatial referencing?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Sender GRU → Gumbel-Softmax sampling → Message transmission → Receiver GRU processing → Target prediction
- **Critical path:** Sender GRU → Gumbel-Softmax sampling → Message transmission → Receiver GRU processing → Target prediction
- **Design tradeoffs:** Larger vocabulary size increases expressiveness but may reduce generalization; message length affects compositionality opportunities; hidden size impacts learning capacity
- **Failure signatures:** Training accuracy >98% but NPMI analysis yields <50% translation accuracy suggests emergent language uses non-trivial compositionality or context-dependence
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Verify baseline performance by training with default parameters and checking task accuracy
  2. Test NPMI analysis by generating test dataset and measuring translation accuracy for compositional vs non-compositional messages
  3. Evaluate generalization by training on sequence length 60 and testing on sequence length 40 and 100

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific environmental factors or design choices are necessary to encourage the emergence of syntactic structures in emergent communication systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the emergence of simple syntactic structure in the compositional messages and hypothesizes that careful design of the environment may elicit more fundamental properties of natural language.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates the emergence of simple syntax but does not explore what specific environmental or architectural factors contribute to this emergence.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying environmental parameters, reward structures, and architectural choices to identify which factors most strongly influence syntactic structure emergence.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the emergence of non-compositional messages for sparse observations compare to alternative encoding strategies in terms of communication efficiency and generalizability?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper hypothesizes that non-compositional references are advantageous for sparse observations due to their compressibility, but does not empirically compare this to compositional alternatives.
- Why unresolved: The paper presents the emergence of non-compositional messages for sparse observations but does not compare their efficiency to compositional alternatives.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments measuring communication efficiency (bits per message) and generalizability across different sparsity levels for both non-compositional and compositional encoding strategies.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the limitations of NPMI-based analysis in detecting complex compositional functions beyond simple concatenation in emergent languages?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges that NPMI analysis may miss non-trivially compositional messages that use functions beyond simple concatenation to convey meaning.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates NPMI's effectiveness for simple compositional messages but does not explore its limitations with more complex compositional functions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic testing of NPMI on artificially generated languages with known complex compositional functions to establish detection boundaries and failure modes.

## Limitations
- The NPMI-based analysis method may not capture polysemous or complexly compositional emergent languages
- Theoretical claims about sparsity-driven non-compositional messages and positional syntax lack direct empirical validation
- The constrained vocabulary size (26 symbols) and message length (3 symbols) may artificially encourage specific emergent patterns

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core finding that agents can develop spatial references in emergent communication is well-supported by the experimental results.

**Medium Confidence**: The NPMI-based analysis method for interpreting emergent messages is demonstrated to work well on the specific emergent languages studied.

**Low Confidence**: The theoretical claims about why certain communication strategies emerge (sparsity-driven non-compositional messages, positional syntax in compositional messages) are largely speculative.

## Next Checks

1. **Frequency Manipulation Experiment**: Systematically vary the frequency of positional observations in training data and measure how this affects the emergence of non-compositional vs. compositional spatial references.

2. **Syntax Generalization Test**: Train agents on compositional spatial references, then systematically permute message positions during testing to measure how position-dependent the emergent "syntax" is.

3. **Polysemy Stress Test**: Design scenarios where single message components could have multiple spatial interpretations depending on context, then evaluate whether the NPMI method can correctly disambiguate meanings.
