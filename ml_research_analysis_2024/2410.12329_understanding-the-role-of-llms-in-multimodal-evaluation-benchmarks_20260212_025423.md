# Understanding the Role of LLMs in Multimodal Evaluation Benchmarks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2410.12329
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12329
- **Authors**: Botian Jiang; Lei Li; Xiaonan Li; Zhaowei Li; Xiachong Feng; Lingpeng Kong; Qi Liu; Xipeng Qiu
- **Reference count**: 12
- **Primary result**: LLMs can achieve high scores on multimodal benchmarks without visual inputs, with RAG-based knowledge augmentation showing up to 60% improvement on certain datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) influence performance in Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) evaluation benchmarks. The study reveals that current benchmarks heavily depend on language capabilities, with LLMs often scoring highly without requiring visual inputs. Through systematic analysis, the authors demonstrate that up to 50% of errors in MLLM evaluations stem from insufficient world knowledge in the LLM backbone. To address this limitation, they propose a knowledge augmentation pipeline using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which significantly improves performance across multiple datasets.

## Method Summary
The researchers conducted a comprehensive analysis of LLM dependence in MLLM evaluation by systematically testing models with and without visual inputs. They developed a RAG-based knowledge augmentation pipeline that retrieves relevant information to supplement the LLM backbone's world knowledge. The study involved multiple benchmark datasets and evaluated both the baseline LLM performance and the augmented performance after knowledge integration. Through ablation studies and controlled experiments, they quantified the contribution of language understanding versus visual reasoning to overall performance.

## Key Results
- LLMs exploit shortcuts in question and options, making predictions without relying on visual inputs
- MLLM performance shows great dependence on the knowledge of LLM backbones
- Up to 50% of error rates can be attributed to insufficient world knowledge in the LLM backbone
- RAG-based knowledge augmentation achieves improvements of up to 60% on certain datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of the RAG augmentation approach stems from addressing the fundamental limitation that LLMs, despite their impressive capabilities, have incomplete or outdated world knowledge. By retrieving relevant information at inference time, the model can access current and comprehensive knowledge that supplements its training. The exploitation of shortcuts occurs because many multimodal benchmarks contain language patterns that correlate with correct answers, allowing LLMs to bypass visual reasoning entirely. This reveals that current benchmarks may not adequately test true multimodal reasoning capabilities but rather language understanding and pattern recognition.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)**: AI systems that integrate visual and language understanding for comprehensive reasoning - needed to understand the context of evaluation benchmarks
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: A framework that retrieves external knowledge to enhance language model responses - critical for understanding the augmentation approach
- **Knowledge grounding**: The process of connecting model outputs to real-world facts and information - essential for understanding why knowledge gaps matter
- **Evaluation benchmark design**: The construction of tests to measure model capabilities - important for understanding how shortcuts can be exploited
- **Ablation studies**: Controlled experiments that remove components to measure their contribution - necessary for understanding the methodology
- **Shortcut exploitation**: The tendency of models to use superficial patterns rather than deep reasoning - key to understanding the main findings

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
RAG Pipeline -> LLM Backbone -> Multimodal Input Processing -> Output Generation

### Critical Path
1. Input question and context retrieval
2. Knowledge augmentation through RAG
3. Multimodal processing (visual and language)
4. Final answer generation

### Design Tradeoffs
- **RAG vs. model size**: Larger models may require less external knowledge but are more computationally expensive
- **Retrieval quality vs. generation quality**: Better retrieval may compensate for weaker generation capabilities
- **Speed vs. accuracy**: Knowledge retrieval adds latency but improves accuracy
- **Generalization vs. specialization**: Broad knowledge retrieval vs. targeted domain-specific augmentation

### Failure Signatures
- Over-reliance on language patterns without visual reasoning
- Retrieval of irrelevant or outdated information
- Knowledge conflicts between retrieved information and model training
- Performance degradation on datasets with minimal knowledge requirements

### First Experiments
1. Test RAG performance across diverse benchmark types to measure generalizability
2. Compare retrieval quality metrics with downstream performance improvements
3. Evaluate the computational overhead of knowledge retrieval in real-time applications

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The generalizability of RAG augmentation across different MLLM architectures and dataset types remains uncertain
- The study focuses on specific benchmark types and may not capture all exploitation mechanisms
- Potential biases introduced by retrieval systems are not fully explored
- Computational overhead of the RAG approach in real-world applications is not addressed

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: LLMs can exploit shortcuts in multimodal questions without requiring visual inputs
- **Medium confidence**: MLLM performance strongly depends on LLM backbone knowledge, with approximately 50% of errors attributable to knowledge gaps
- **Medium confidence**: RAG-based knowledge augmentation provides significant performance improvements on tested benchmarks

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-dataset validation to measure RAG performance consistency across diverse multimodal evaluation benchmarks with varying knowledge requirements
2. Perform ablation studies isolating the contribution of retrieval quality versus generation quality in the proposed pipeline
3. Test the exploitation mechanisms across additional MLLM architectures to determine if shortcut behaviors generalize beyond the specific models studied
