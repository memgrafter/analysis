# A Review of 3D Reconstruction Techniques for Deformable Tissues in Robotic Surgery

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.04426
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04426
- Reference count: 33
- This paper reviews 4D reconstruction techniques for deformable tissues in robotic surgery, focusing on NeRF-based and Gaussian splatting-based methods.

## Executive Summary
This paper reviews four state-of-the-art 4D reconstruction techniques for deformable tissues in robotic surgery: EndoNeRF, EndoSurf, LerPlane, and 4D-GS. The authors evaluate these methods on three datasets: EndoNeRF, StereoMIS, and C3VD, assessing them based on training time, GPU usage, and performance metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS). The results show that LerPlane and 4D-GS offer faster training and inference times compared to EndoNeRF and EndoSurf, but LerPlane's performance varies across datasets. 4D-GS struggles with surgical scenes due to domain gaps, limited viewing directions, and the need for better tool occlusion handling. The study highlights the potential of these methods for real-time, high-quality surgical scene reconstruction while identifying challenges for future research.

## Method Summary
The paper reviews four 4D reconstruction techniques for deformable tissues in robotic surgery. EndoNeRF uses a canonical and deformation field with ray sampling and importance maps. EndoSurf employs SDF-based surface reconstruction with deformation, SDF, and radiance fields. LerPlane decomposes the 4D scene into static and dynamic fields, each divided into 2D planes for faster processing. 4D-GS uses explicit 3D Gaussian ellipsoids with deformation fields and multi-resolution neural voxels for real-time rendering. The methods are evaluated on three datasets with different characteristics: EndoNeRF (2 scenes, stereo video), StereoMIS (11 scenes, stereo video), and C3VD (22 sequences, colonoscopy videos).

## Key Results
- LerPlane and 4D-GS offer faster training and inference times compared to EndoNeRF and EndoSurf
- 4D-GS struggles with surgical scenes due to domain gaps, limited viewing directions, and tool occlusion handling
- LerPlane's performance varies across datasets, performing well on highly deformable scenes but suboptimally on less deformable ones

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
LerPlane's 2D plane decomposition reduces computational complexity from O(N⁴) to O(N²), enabling faster training. By projecting 4D points onto six orthogonal 2D planes (XY, YZ, XZ for static field; XT, YT, ZT for dynamic field) and using bilinear interpolation to extract features, LerPlane simplifies the neural network from a large MLP to a tiny one, drastically reducing the number of parameters and operations.

### Mechanism 2
4D-GS's explicit Gaussian representation enables real-time rendering but struggles with surgical scenes due to domain gaps. 4D-GS uses 3D Gaussian ellipsoids with explicit parameters (center, covariance, opacity, color) that are directly projected onto the 2D image plane using differentiable splatting, avoiding the complex volume rendering required by NeRF-based methods. This allows for fast rendering but requires good initialization of Gaussian parameters.

### Mechanism 3
EndoSurf's SDF-based surface reconstruction provides smoother surfaces compared to density field approaches. EndoSurf uses a signed distance function (SDF) field to represent the surface geometry, where the surface is defined as the zero level set of the SDF. This allows for more precise surface representation and smoother normals compared to the density field used in NeRF, which can lead to better surface reconstruction in deformable tissue scenes.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Volume rendering in NeRF
  - Why needed here: Understanding the volume rendering equation is crucial for grasping how EndoNeRF and EndoSurf estimate pixel colors and depths from 3D point distributions.
  - Quick check question: How does the volume rendering equation accumulate color and opacity along a ray in NeRF?

- Concept: Differentiable rendering
  - Why needed here: The ability to differentiate through the rendering process is essential for training all four methods using gradient descent on reconstruction losses.
  - Quick check question: What makes the rendering process in 3D Gaussian Splatting differentiable, and how does this differ from NeRF's approach?

- Concept: Signed distance functions (SDFs)
  - Why needed here: SDFs are used in EndoSurf to represent surface geometry, and understanding their properties is crucial for grasping the method's advantages and limitations.
  - Quick check question: How does an SDF represent a surface, and what are the advantages of using an SDF over a density field for surface reconstruction?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input: Stereo or monocular endoscopic video frames, depth maps, tool masks
  Processing: EndoNeRF (D-NeRF-based canonical and deformation fields), EndoSurf (deformation field, SDF field, radiance field), LerPlane (static and dynamic fields decomposed into 2D planes), 4D-GS (deformation field with multi-resolution neural voxels and tiny MLP)
  Output: 3D reconstruction of deformable tissues, tool masks, depth maps

- Critical path:
  1. Data preprocessing: Generate tool masks and depth maps
  2. Model training: Optimize neural fields or Gaussian parameters
  3. Rendering: Generate novel views from the trained model
  4. Evaluation: Compute PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Speed vs. quality: LerPlane and 4D-GS offer faster training and inference but may sacrifice some reconstruction quality compared to EndoNeRF and EndoSurf
  - Explicit vs. implicit representation: 4D-GS uses explicit Gaussians for real-time rendering but struggles with domain adaptation, while NeRF-based methods offer better quality but slower performance
  - Surface vs. volume representation: EndoSurf's SDF-based surface reconstruction provides smoother surfaces but may be less robust to large deformations compared to volume-based approaches

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor reconstruction quality: Indicated by low PSNR, SSIM, and high LPIPS values
  - Slow training or inference: Excessive training time or inference latency
  - GPU memory issues: Out-of-memory errors during training or rendering
  - Tool occlusion artifacts: Incorrect handling of surgical instruments in the reconstruction

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce the results on the EndoNeRF dataset using the provided implementations, comparing PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics across all four methods
  2. Test the methods on a small subset of the StereoMIS dataset to evaluate domain adaptation and identify potential issues with tool occlusion handling
  3. Implement a simple ablation study by removing the tool occlusion handling mechanism from each method and observing the impact on reconstruction quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D-GS) be effectively adapted to surgical scenes with limited viewing directions and large deformations? The paper explicitly states that 4D-GS performs worse on surgical scenes than natural scenes due to limited viewing directions, large deformations, and poor generalization. This remains unresolved as the paper does not propose solutions or test potential adaptations.

### Open Question 2
How can tool occlusion be better handled in Gaussian splatting-based methods for surgical scene reconstruction? The paper notes that 4D-GS lacks a sampling strategy for removing surgical tools, unlike NeRF-based methods such as EndoNeRF and LerPlane. This question is unresolved as the paper does not explore occlusion handling techniques for Gaussian splatting in surgical contexts.

### Open Question 3
What is the trade-off between reconstruction quality and real-time performance when using Gaussian splatting versus NeRF-based methods for surgical scenes? The paper highlights that LerPlane and 4D-GS offer faster training and inference times compared to EndoNeRF and EndoSurf, but LerPlane's performance varies across datasets, and 4D-GS struggles with surgical scenes. The paper does not provide a systematic analysis of the trade-offs or test hybrid approaches combining the strengths of both methods.

## Limitations

- Domain gap validation: The paper claims 4D-GS struggles with surgical scenes due to domain differences from natural scenes, but quantitative evidence of this gap and ablation studies comparing synthetic vs real surgical data are not provided.
- Hyperparameter sensitivity: The reported performance improvements are based on default hyperparameters, and the sensitivity of these methods to hyperparameter choices remains unclear.
- Tool occlusion handling: The paper mentions tool occlusion handling as a challenge for 4D-GS but doesn't provide detailed analysis of how different occlusion scenarios affect reconstruction quality.

## Confidence

- High confidence: Training time comparisons across methods are clearly specified with exact iteration counts and hardware specifications, providing reproducible evidence for speed improvements.
- Medium confidence: Performance metric comparisons (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) are reported, but without statistical significance testing or error bars, making it difficult to assess whether observed differences are meaningful.
- Low confidence: Claims about the superiority of SDF over density fields for surface smoothness and the O(N⁴) to O(N²) complexity reduction are based on method descriptions rather than direct experimental evidence.

## Next Checks

1. **Domain adaptation experiment**: Create a controlled experiment comparing 4D-GS performance on synthetic surgical scenes versus real surgical scenes to quantify the domain gap impact and test adaptation strategies.

2. **Ablation study on tool occlusion**: Implement a systematic ablation study where tool occlusion handling is progressively disabled in each method to measure its contribution to overall reconstruction quality.

3. **Statistical significance analysis**: Perform statistical significance testing (e.g., paired t-tests) on the reported PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics across all datasets to determine which performance differences are statistically meaningful.
