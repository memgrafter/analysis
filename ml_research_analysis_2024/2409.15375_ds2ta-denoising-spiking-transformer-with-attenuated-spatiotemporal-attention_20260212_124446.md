# DS2TA: Denoising Spiking Transformer with Attenuated Spatiotemporal Attention

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.15375
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15375
- Reference count: 13
- Top-1 accuracy: 94.92% on CIFAR10, 77.47% on CIFAR100, 79.1% on CIFAR10-DVS, 94.44% on DVS-Gesture

## Executive Summary
DS2TA introduces a novel Spiking Transformer architecture that extends Vision Transformers with temporally attenuated spatiotemporal attention and denoising mechanisms. Unlike existing spatial-only attention approaches, DS2TA captures correlations in input firing activities across both time and space, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both static and dynamic neuromorphic vision datasets. The model employs parameter-efficient computation through attenuated temporal weight replicas and enhances robustness with nonlinear hashmap-based spiking attention denoisers.

## Method Summary
DS2TA builds upon the Vision Transformer architecture by incorporating spiking neural network principles and spatiotemporal attention mechanisms. The core innovation is the Temporally Attenuated Spatiotemporal Attention (TASA) layer, which uses a learnable decay scheme to reduce the number of temporally-dependent weights while maintaining attention quality. Additionally, the Nonlinear Spiking Attention Denoiser (NSAD) applies learnable hashmap-based nonlinear transformations to denoise attention maps and improve model expressiveness. The architecture is trained using activation-based gradient surrogate training on both static image datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100) and dynamic neuromorphic datasets (CIFAR10-DVS, DVS-Gesture).

## Key Results

- Achieves 77.47% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR100 using 4 time steps
- Achieves 79.1% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR10-DVS using 10 time steps
- Achieves 94.44% top-1 accuracy on DVS-Gesture using 10 time steps

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Spatiotemporal attention improves accuracy by considering correlations in input firing activities across both time and space, whereas prior "spatial-only" attention ignores temporal dynamics.
- Core assumption: Temporal correlations in spiking inputs are meaningful and can be leveraged for improved model performance.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract and section discussing TASA's consideration of both spatial and temporal correlations.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Parameter-efficient computation through attenuated temporal weight replica reduces the number of temporally-dependent weights by a factor of TAW without introducing extra weights.
- Core assumption: Temporal decay factors can adequately capture the diminishing importance of older spikes without needing separate weights for each time step.
- Evidence anchors: Section explaining the learnable scheme to reduce temporally-dependent weights using decayed values.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Nonlinear Spiking Attention Denoiser (NSAD) improves performance by suppressing noise and introducing efficient element-wise nonlinear transformation to enhance expressive power.
- Core assumption: Attention maps contain noise that can be suppressed through learnable nonlinear transformations, and such transformations improve model expressiveness.
- Evidence anchors: Section describing the learnable hashmap-based NSAD for denoising attention maps.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) operate on binary spikes across multiple time steps, unlike traditional ANNs that use continuous values.
  - Why needed here: Understanding SNNs is essential because DS2TA is built on spiking neural network principles and leverages their temporal computing power.
  - Quick check question: How do spiking neurons differ from traditional artificial neurons in terms of information encoding?

- Concept: Vision Transformers (ViTs) use self-attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies among image patches.
  - Why needed here: DS2TA extends ViT architecture with spiking components and spatiotemporal attention, so understanding ViT fundamentals is crucial.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of self-attention in Vision Transformers, and how does it differ from convolutional approaches?

- Concept: Temporal Attention Window (TAW) limits the number of time steps considered for attention computation to manage computational complexity.
  - Why needed here: TAW is a key parameter in DS2TA's spatiotemporal attention mechanism that balances performance and efficiency.
  - Quick check question: What trade-off does adjusting the Temporal Attention Window involve in terms of performance and computational cost?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input image → spiking patchifier → encoder block 1 (TASA → NSAD) → ... → encoder block L (TASA → NSAD) → classification head
- Critical path: Input image → spiking patchifier → encoder block 1 (TASA → NSAD) → ... → encoder block L (TASA → NSAD) → classification head
- Design tradeoffs: TASA vs. spatial-only attention (accuracy vs. complexity), NSAD complexity vs. denoising benefit, TAW size vs. temporal information capture
- Failure signatures: Poor accuracy on temporal datasets (CIFAR10-DVS), high energy consumption despite sparsity claims, training instability due to LIF dynamics
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replace DS2TA's TASA with spatial-only attention (Zhou et al., 2023) and compare accuracy on CIFAR10
  2. Remove NSAD from DS2TA and measure impact on CIFAR100 accuracy and attention map sparsity
  3. Vary TAW from 1 to 5 and evaluate accuracy/energy trade-offs on CIFAR10

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of DS2TA scale with increasing temporal attention window (TAW) size, and what is the optimal TAW for different types of vision tasks?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions using a TAW of 3 but doesn't explore how performance varies with different window sizes across datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper only reports results using a fixed TAW of 3, leaving the impact of window size on performance and computational efficiency unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying TAW from small (1-2) to large (5-10) values on multiple datasets, measuring both accuracy and computational overhead, would reveal optimal window sizes for different task types.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the DS2TA architecture perform on more complex vision tasks like object detection and semantic segmentation compared to standard ANNs and existing spiking models?
- Basis in paper: The paper focuses on classification tasks but mentions transformers are used for various vision applications including object detection and segmentation.
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates DS2TA on classification benchmarks, leaving its capability for more complex vision tasks untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing DS2TA on object detection datasets (like COCO) and semantic segmentation datasets (like Cityscapes), comparing performance metrics like mAP and IoU with state-of-the-art models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the relationship between the learnable decay exponent τ and model performance, and how does it vary across different layers and tasks?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions using a learnable decay exponent τ initialized to 4 for all layers but doesn't analyze its impact or layer-wise variation.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't provide analysis of how τ affects spatiotemporal attention quality or whether different layers benefit from different decay rates.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies varying τ across layers and tasks, examining correlation between τ values and attention map quality/sparsity, would reveal optimal decay strategies.

## Limitations

- The specific implementation details of the hashmap-based nonlinear transformation in NSAD are not fully specified, which could impact reproducibility.
- Energy efficiency claims are not substantiated with concrete measurements, making it difficult to assess the true computational advantages.
- The paper only reports results using a fixed TAW of 3, leaving the impact of window size on performance and computational efficiency unexplored.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The mechanism of spatiotemporal attention improving accuracy by considering temporal correlations (Mechanism 1) is well-supported by the literature on spatiotemporal neural networks and the experimental results showing improved performance on temporal datasets.
- **Medium Confidence**: The parameter efficiency claims of the attenuated temporal weight replica (Mechanism 2) are plausible but would benefit from explicit computational complexity analysis and comparison with baseline implementations.
- **Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of NSAD in improving robustness and expressive power (Mechanism 3) is supported by the reported accuracy improvements, but the specific impact of denoising versus nonlinearity is not isolated in ablation studies.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study**: Conduct controlled experiments removing either the spatiotemporal attention component or the NSAD from DS2TA to quantify their individual contributions to the reported accuracy improvements on CIFAR10-DVS and DVS-Gesture datasets.

2. **Energy Efficiency Analysis**: Measure the actual energy consumption of DS2TA during inference on neuromorphic hardware or through simulation, comparing it against spatial-only attention baselines to validate the claimed efficiency benefits.

3. **Temporal Attention Window Sensitivity**: Systematically vary the Temporal Attention Window (TAW) parameter across a wider range (1-20) and evaluate the trade-offs between accuracy, computational cost, and information retention on both static and dynamic vision datasets.
