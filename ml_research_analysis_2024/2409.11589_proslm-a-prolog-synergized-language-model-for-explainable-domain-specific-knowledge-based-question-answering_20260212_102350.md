# ProSLM : A Prolog Synergized Language Model for explainable Domain Specific Knowledge Based Question Answering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.11589
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11589
- Reference count: 28
- ProSLM integrates Prolog knowledge bases with LLMs to improve explainability in domain-specific question answering

## Executive Summary
ProSLM is a neurosymbolic framework that combines a Prolog-based knowledge base with a large language model to enhance explainability in domain-specific question answering. The system uses Prolog's backward chaining to generate explainable context for queries and validate factual accuracy against the knowledge base. By providing traceable reasoning through goal trees, ProSLM aims to improve the trustworthiness of LLM responses while maintaining natural language interaction.

## Method Summary
The framework integrates a Prolog knowledge base with an LLM through a neural translator component. When a user query is received, the translator converts it to a Prolog goal, which the symbolic component processes using backward chaining to generate a goal tree. This context is then converted back to natural language and provided to the LLM for response generation. The system also validates LLM outputs by checking their factual accuracy against the Prolog knowledge base.

## Key Results
- Demonstrated context gathering capability using UCSC domain knowledge base for dining hall, study location, and class policy queries
- Validated factual accuracy of statements against Prolog knowledge base through backward chaining inference
- Generated explainable goal trees that record logical reasoning steps for user queries

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Prolog backward chaining enables traceable reasoning that explains why context is selected
- Mechanism: The symbolic component uses SWI-Prolog to run backward chaining with the query as the goal, creating a goal tree that records the logical steps taken to reach conclusions
- Core assumption: The knowledge base contains sufficient facts and rules to prove or disprove queries through logical inference
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The inference agent uses SWI-Prolog backward chaining to return the truth value conditioned on a Prolog query"
  - [section] "With Q(p) as the input, the Symbolic Component runs a backward chain, creating an implicit goal tree"
- Break condition: Knowledge base is incomplete or inconsistent, causing failure to prove valid queries or proving invalid ones

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Translator bridges natural language and Prolog to enable seamless communication between neural and symbolic components
- Mechanism: GPT 3.5 translates user queries to Prolog goals and Prolog results back to natural language, allowing the LLM to understand symbolic context
- Core assumption: GPT 3.5 can accurately map between natural language semantics and Prolog representations
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We use an LLM – GPT 3.5 – as our Neural Translator"
  - [section] "The Translator then converts C(p) to a natural language form C(n), a list of natural language contexts, by calling GPT 3.5"
- Break condition: Translation errors cause mismatch between user intent and Prolog query, or between Prolog results and natural language context

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Context gathering improves LLM response reliability by grounding generation in verified facts
- Mechanism: Symbolic component provides explainable context that the LLM uses as additional information, reducing hallucinations and improving trustworthiness
- Core assumption: LLM responses conditioned on accurate context will be more reliable than responses without context
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "ProSLM introduces a symbolic component for explainable context gathering prior to querying an LLM"
  - [section] "This framework has two capabilities (1) context gathering: generating explainable and relevant context for a given query"
- Break condition: Context provided is insufficient or irrelevant to the query, failing to improve response quality

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: First-Order Logic and Prolog syntax
  - Why needed here: Understanding how facts, rules, and queries are structured in Prolog is essential for creating and maintaining the knowledge base
  - Quick check question: How would you represent "UCSC has three dining halls" in Prolog?

- Concept: Backward chaining inference
  - Why needed here: The symbolic component relies on backward chaining to prove queries by working backwards from goals to known facts
  - Quick check question: What happens when backward chaining cannot find a rule to prove a goal?

- Concept: Neural-symbolic integration
  - Why needed here: Understanding how to effectively combine neural components (LLM, translator) with symbolic components (Prolog KB, inference engine) is crucial for system design
  - Quick check question: Why is a translator necessary between the LLM and Prolog components?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - User Input → Neural Translator (English→Prolog) → Symbolic Component (Backward Chaining) → Neural Translator (Prolog→English) → LLM (Response Generation) → User Output
  - Fact Validation path: LLM Output → Neural Translator (English→Prolog) → Symbolic Component (Validation) → Truth Values → User

- Critical path: User Query → Prolog Query → Backward Chaining → Context → LLM Response
  - This is the primary flow for explainable context gathering

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Prolog vs other symbolic systems: Prolog chosen for its backward chaining and rule-based inference capabilities
  - GPT 3.5 vs specialized translators: Using GPT 3.5 provides flexibility but may introduce translation errors
  - Knowledge base completeness vs maintainability: More complete KB improves accuracy but requires more effort to maintain

- Failure signatures:
  - False negatives in validation: Indicates incomplete knowledge base
  - Translation errors: Context doesn't match user query or Prolog results don't make sense in natural language
  - Slow response times: May indicate inefficient Prolog queries or LLM processing

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test basic Prolog query translation: Input simple queries and verify correct Prolog translation
  2. Validate backward chaining with known facts: Create test cases where outcomes are predetermined
  3. End-to-end context gathering: Run complete queries through all components and verify the LLM response is grounded in provided context

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can ProSLM handle incomplete or evolving knowledge bases while maintaining reliability in its responses?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies that an incomplete knowledge base is a clear limitation that can lead to inaccurate answers.
- Why unresolved: While the paper suggests user-interactive updates to the KB as a mitigation strategy, it does not provide details on how to implement this or evaluate its effectiveness.
- What evidence would resolve it: A working implementation and evaluation showing that user-interactive updates can effectively handle incomplete KBs while maintaining response accuracy and reliability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of ProSLM's explainable context gathering on user trust compared to standalone LLM systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper argues that ProSLM improves trustworthiness by providing explainable context, but does not empirically measure this impact on user trust.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates ProSLM's technical capabilities but does not include user studies to assess whether the explainable context actually increases user trust in the system.
- What evidence would resolve it: User studies comparing trust levels in ProSLM versus standalone LLM systems, measuring factors like perceived reliability, understanding of reasoning, and willingness to rely on the system's outputs.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does ProSLM's performance scale with the complexity and size of the knowledge base?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates ProSLM on a UCSC domain knowledge base but does not explore how the system performs with larger or more complex KBs.
- Why unresolved: The current evaluation is limited to a specific domain, and there is no analysis of how the system's explainability, accuracy, or computational efficiency changes with KB size or complexity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying the size and complexity of knowledge bases, measuring ProSLM's performance metrics (accuracy, response time, explainability) across different scales.

## Limitations
- Framework effectiveness constrained by completeness and accuracy of underlying Prolog knowledge base
- Reliance on GPT 3.5 translator may introduce errors between natural language and Prolog representations
- Current implementation lacks visualization tools for goal trees generated during backward chaining

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The core mechanism of using Prolog backward chaining for explainable context gathering is well-established and the integration approach with LLMs is technically sound
- Medium Confidence: The effectiveness of GPT 3.5 as a translator between natural language and Prolog, while reasonable, lacks systematic evaluation and may introduce errors
- Medium Confidence: The claim that context grounding improves LLM reliability is supported by the mechanism but would benefit from more extensive empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. **Translation Accuracy Test**: Create a benchmark set of natural language queries and their expected Prolog translations, then measure GPT 3.5's translation accuracy and identify common failure patterns
2. **Knowledge Base Completeness Analysis**: Systematically test the Prolog knowledge base against a comprehensive set of queries to identify gaps and measure the false negative rate in fact validation
3. **Explainability Validation**: Conduct user studies where participants evaluate the quality and usefulness of the goal tree explanations compared to LLM responses without context grounding
