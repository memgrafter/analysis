# Proactive Recommendation in Social Networks: Steering User Interest with Causal Inference

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.08934
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08934

- Primary result: Proposed Neighbor Interference Recommendation (NIRec) framework achieves significantly higher improvement in interaction probability (IoIP) than baselines while limiting damage to neighbors' experience (DtNE) on Ciao, Epinions, and Filmtrust datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Proactive Recommendation in Social Networks (PRSN), a new task that steers user interests indirectly by adjusting target item exposure to a user's neighbors rather than directly to the user. The key insight is that users' decisions are influenced by their neighbors' interactions, so optimizing neighbor exposure can effectively steer user behavior while avoiding the limitations of direct steering methods. The proposed Neighbor Interference Recommendation (NIRec) framework uses causal inference to model network interference and estimate how neighbor exposure affects a target user's potential feedback on a target item.

## Method Summary
The method involves training an MF model on observed ratings to predict and complete missing ratings, then aligning the distribution with random exposure data. The NIRec framework consists of two modules: an interference representation-based estimation module using masked graph convolution with attention to model potential feedback under neighbor interference, and a post-learning-based optimization module using greedy search to optimize neighbor treatment values while balancing steering performance against damage to neighbors' experience through a user experience cost function.

## Key Results
- NIRec achieves significantly higher improvement in interaction probability (IoIP) compared to baseline methods across three real-world datasets
- The framework successfully limits damage to neighbors' experience (DtNE) while improving steering performance
- Oracle results serve as an upper bound reference, demonstrating the theoretical potential of the approach
- Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of both the interference representation module and the optimization module

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The interference representation module uses masked graph convolution with attention to aggregate neighbor units' treatments and individual representations, creating an interference representation that captures spillover effects from neighbors on the target user's potential outcome. The core assumption is that the interference representation function φ(·) is sufficiently expressive to capture all relevant information from neighbors' treatment values and features that influence the target unit's outcome. Evidence comes from the abstract and section 3.1, though corpus papers provide weak direct evidence about masked graph convolution for neighbor interference modeling.

### Mechanism 2
The post-learning-based optimization module uses greedy search to iteratively optimize neighbor treatment values, maximizing a bi-objective function that balances positive potential outcomes for target users against damage to neighbors' experience as measured by a user experience cost function. The core assumption is that the cost function accurately measures damage to neighbors' experience from decreased ratings when target item exposure displaces other items in their recommendation list. Evidence includes the abstract and section 3.3.2, though corpus papers provide weak direct evidence about greedy search optimization for this specific balancing problem.

### Mechanism 3
The causal inference framework with relaxed no-interference assumption can identify and estimate interference-aware potential outcomes for recommendation. By modeling new causal paths from neighbor units' treatments and features to the target unit's outcome, the framework estimates the probability of positive potential outcomes under varying neighbor interference, enabling effective steering recommendations. The core assumption is that standard causal inference assumptions (consistency, ignorability, and positivity) hold even when network interference is present. Evidence comes from the abstract and section 3.1, with moderate support from related papers on causal approaches to social recommendation interference.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Causal inference and potential outcome framework
  - **Why needed here**: The paper fundamentally relies on estimating what would happen to a target user's feedback under different exposure scenarios to their neighbors, which is a counterfactual question that requires causal inference techniques.
  - **Quick check question**: Can you explain the difference between observed outcomes and potential outcomes in the context of this recommendation problem?

- **Concept**: Graph neural networks and masked graph convolution
  - **Why needed here**: The interference representation module needs to aggregate information from a target user's neighbors in the social network, requiring graph-based methods to capture the relational structure and neighbor influence patterns.
  - **Quick check question**: How does masked graph convolution differ from standard graph convolution, and why might masking be important for this application?

- **Concept**: Bi-objective optimization and greedy search algorithms
  - **Why needed here**: The optimization module must balance two competing objectives (improving steering performance vs. limiting damage to neighbors) and solve an NP-hard problem efficiently, making greedy search a practical approach.
  - **Quick check question**: What are the advantages and limitations of using greedy search for bi-objective optimization in this recommendation context?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input data -> Interference Representation-based Estimation Module -> Post-learning-based Optimization Module -> Output: Optimized exposure assignments and estimated interaction probabilities
- **Critical path**: The estimation module must be trained first using semi-synthetic data, then the optimization module uses the trained estimator to find optimal neighbor exposure configurations for each target user-item pair
- **Design tradeoffs**: Using existing recommender models as user experience models provides practical cost functions but may not perfectly capture actual user experience; semi-synthetic data generation allows controlled experiments but introduces simulation assumptions; greedy search provides computational efficiency but may miss global optima in the bi-objective space
- **Failure signatures**: Poor steering performance despite high neighbor exposure indicates the estimation module is not capturing interference effects accurately; high damage to neighbors' experience suggests the cost function or optimization is not properly balancing objectives; inconsistent performance across different social network densities indicates the model may not generalize well to varying network structures
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Verify the estimation module can recover known interference patterns in synthetic data where ground truth is available; 2) Test the optimization module on a simplified version with only one neighbor to ensure basic functionality; 3) Compare steering performance with and without the interference representation to validate its contribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How does the performance of NIRec scale when modeling interference from multi-hop neighbors instead of just direct neighbors?
- What is the optimal strategy for constructing target user groups to minimize negative impact while maximizing steering effectiveness?
- How does the interference strength coefficient β affect the trade-off between steering performance and damage to neighbors' experience across different types of social networks?

## Limitations
- Semi-synthetic data generation introduces simulation assumptions that may not fully capture real-world user behavior
- Greedy search optimization may get stuck in local optima when balancing the bi-objective function
- Performance evaluation relies on proxy metrics (IoIP and DtNE) that may not perfectly reflect actual user experience and recommendation quality

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core causal inference framework and potential outcome identification under relaxed no-interference assumptions
- **Medium confidence**: The interference representation module using masked graph convolution with attention
- **Medium confidence**: The optimization module's ability to balance steering performance and neighbor experience damage

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate NIRec performance on a dataset with significantly different social network structure (e.g., undirected networks or communities with different densities) to validate robustness beyond the three datasets used
2. Compare the full masked graph convolution with attention against versions without attention or with alternative attention mechanisms to quantify the specific contribution of the attention component
3. Conduct a small-scale user study or A/B test on a live platform to measure actual user engagement and satisfaction metrics, moving beyond the simulated evaluation framework
