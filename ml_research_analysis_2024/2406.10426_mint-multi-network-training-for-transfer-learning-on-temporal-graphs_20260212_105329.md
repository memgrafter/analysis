# MiNT: Multi-Network Training for Transfer Learning on Temporal Graphs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.10426
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10426
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Multi-network training enables TGNNs to generalize to unseen temporal graphs with zero-shot inference

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MiNT (Multi-Network Training), a novel approach for training temporal graph neural networks on multiple temporal networks to enable transfer learning to unseen networks. Using a dataset of 84 Ethereum-based transaction networks, the authors pre-train models on up to 64 networks and evaluate zero-shot inference performance on 20 unseen networks. MiNT consistently outperforms or matches individually trained models on 14 out of 20 unseen networks, with performance improving as the number of pre-training networks increases. This demonstrates that multi-network pre-training significantly enhances the transferability of temporal graph models, laying the groundwork for Temporal Graph Foundation Models.

## Method Summary
MiNT trains TGNNs on multiple temporal graphs by shuffling network order and resetting historical embeddings between networks. The algorithm processes each network's snapshots sequentially, updates the model, and evaluates on validation sets. During testing, pre-trained weights are applied to unseen networks with fresh historical embeddings for zero-shot inference. The approach uses HTGN or GCLSTM architectures for temporal graph processing and achieves competitive performance without fine-tuning on target networks.

## Key Results
- MiNT outperforms individually trained models on 14 out of 20 unseen networks
- Performance improves with more pre-training networks (tested up to 64)
- Zero-shot inference achieves state-of-the-art results without fine-tuning
- Only 2% average node overlap between training and test datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Multi-network training improves generalization by exposing the model to diverse temporal graph patterns, reducing overfitting to a single network's idiosyncrasies. The MiNT algorithm trains on multiple temporal graphs by shuffling the order of networks and resetting historical embeddings between them, forcing the model to learn general temporal patterns rather than memorizing specific sequences. This works because temporal graphs from the same domain share underlying structural and dynamic patterns that can be learned across networks.

### Mechanism 2
Order shuffling and context switching are essential for effective multi-network training. Shuffling the order of training networks at each epoch prevents the model from learning spurious correlations tied to network order, while context switching (resetting historical embeddings) prevents memory carryover between networks. This is crucial because temporal dependencies learned from one network don't generalize to another, so historical embeddings must be reset to avoid negative transfer.

### Mechanism 3
Zero-shot inference is possible because pre-training captures transferable representations that generalize to unseen networks. The model learns a generic temporal graph representation during pre-training that can be directly applied to new networks without fine-tuning, as evidenced by competitive performance on unseen test networks. This works because the representations learned during multi-network training capture domain-general features rather than network-specific ones.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Temporal graph learning fundamentals - Understanding how TGNNs process dynamic graphs is crucial for implementing and debugging the MiNT algorithm. Quick check: Can you explain the difference between discrete-time and continuous-time dynamic graphs and why MiNT focuses on discrete-time?

- Concept: Graph neural network architecture - MiNT builds upon existing TGNN architectures (HTGN, GCLSTM), so understanding their components is essential. Quick check: What are the key differences between HTGN and GCLSTM in terms of how they handle temporal dependencies?

- Concept: Transfer learning principles - The core contribution of MiNT is enabling transfer learning across temporal networks, which requires understanding transfer learning concepts. Quick check: How does zero-shot inference differ from traditional transfer learning approaches that require fine-tuning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Base TGNN (HTGN or GCLSTM) -> Multi-network training loop with shuffling and context switching -> Decoder for graph property prediction
- Critical path: Training loop processes each network's snapshots sequentially, updates the model, and evaluates on validation sets
- Design tradeoffs: Training on more networks improves generalization but increases computational cost and training time
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on test networks indicates insufficient diversity in training networks or issues with shuffling/context switching mechanisms
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify single-network training works as expected on one network before attempting multi-network training
  2. Test shuffling mechanism by training on two networks and checking if model can generalize to both
  3. Validate context switching by training on two networks with and without resetting historical embeddings

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Does the positive scaling behavior of MiNT (improvement with more training networks) extend beyond 64 networks? The paper shows performance improvement up to 64 networks but only tested up to this limit, leaving the scaling relationship beyond this point unknown.

### Open Question 2
How does MiNT's performance compare when applied to temporal graph domains outside of cryptocurrency transaction networks? The paper uses only Ethereum-based transaction networks, so generalization to other temporal graph types remains unproven.

### Open Question 3
What is the minimum dataset size required for MiNT to show meaningful transfer learning benefits? While the paper shows improvement from 2 to 64 networks, it doesn't identify the smallest effective training set size.

### Open Question 4
How does the node overlap between training and test networks affect MiNT's zero-shot inference performance? The paper reports node overlap statistics but doesn't correlate them with transfer learning performance.

## Limitations

- Primarily validated on Ethereum transaction networks, limiting generalizability to other temporal graph domains
- Binary growth/shrinkage prediction may not capture full complexity of temporal graph property prediction
- Zero-shot inference hasn't been compared with fine-tuning approaches that might yield better performance

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Multi-network training improves zero-shot transfer performance (14/20 networks showing improvement). Context switching and historical embedding reset mechanisms are well-validated.
- **Medium Confidence**: Scalability claim that more training networks lead to better performance follows expected trend but needs testing beyond 64 networks. "State-of-the-art" claim lacks comparison with recent temporal graph foundation models.
- **Low Confidence**: Generalizability to non-Ethereum domains and assertion about laying "groundwork for Temporal Graph Foundation Models" - these are aspirational rather than empirically demonstrated.

## Next Checks

1. Test MiNT on temporal graphs from non-financial domains (social networks, traffic networks) to validate cross-domain transferability
2. Implement and compare against fine-tuning approaches to determine if zero-shot inference is truly optimal
3. Conduct systematic study varying number of training networks beyond 64 to identify saturation points and diminishing returns
