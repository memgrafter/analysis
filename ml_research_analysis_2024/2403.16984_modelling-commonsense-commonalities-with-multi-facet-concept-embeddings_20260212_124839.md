# Modelling Commonsense Commonalities with Multi-Facet Concept Embeddings

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.16984
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16984
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Multi-facet concept embeddings outperform baselines in predicting commonsense properties and enable ultra-fine entity typing

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of capturing diverse commonsense properties in concept embeddings by proposing a multi-facet approach that learns separate embeddings for concepts and properties, with an additional facet encoder that acts as a mask on concept embeddings to capture different aspects. The authors collect training data using ChatGPT and ConceptNet to learn which properties belong to which facets, enabling the model to represent concepts in a more nuanced way than standard embeddings. Experiments demonstrate that this approach outperforms baselines in predicting commonsense properties, outlier detection, ontology completion, and ultra-fine entity typing tasks.

## Method Summary
The proposed method uses a multi-task learning approach with BERT-based encoders for concepts, properties, and facets. The model learns a single base embedding for each concept, then applies learned facet masks to selectively highlight relevant dimensions for each property. Training combines bi-encoder loss with InfoNCE loss to align properties within the same facets. The approach uses external training data from ChatGPT (generating property-facet pairs) and ConceptNet (providing structured commonsense knowledge) to learn facet-property relationships.

## Key Results
- Outperforms baselines in predicting commonsense properties with higher F1 scores
- Achieves state-of-the-art results in ultra-fine entity typing with 67.7% exact match
- Shows effectiveness in ontology completion by predicting missing relationships
- Captures a wider range of commonsense properties compared to standard concept embeddings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Using ChatGPT to generate property-facet pairs provides effective supervision for learning multi-facet concept embeddings
- Mechanism: ChatGPT is prompted to generate property examples along with their corresponding facets, creating labeled training data that explicitly connects properties to semantic facets
- Core assumption: ChatGPT can reliably identify which properties belong to which facets of meaning
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We rely on ChatGPT to collect a diverse set of (property, facet) pairs"
  - [section 3.1]: "We use the dataset of 109K concept-property judgments that were obtained from ChatGPT by Chatterjee et al. (2023)"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus only shows related papers but no direct evidence of ChatGPT's effectiveness for this task

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Masked embeddings using facet vectors capture facet-specific meaning better than learning separate embeddings per facet
- Mechanism: Rather than maintaining separate embeddings for each facet, the model applies a learned mask (facet vector) to the concept embedding, selectively highlighting relevant dimensions for each property
- Core assumption: Semantic facets can be represented as masks that select relevant dimensions of a base concept embedding
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2]: "we only learn a single embedding for each concept, treating facets instead as masks on the set of coordinates"
  - [section 3.2]: "The idea is that Facet(p) indicates which coordinates of the concept embeddings are most relevant when modelling the property p"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus lacks direct evidence supporting the effectiveness of masked embeddings vs separate embeddings

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Combining ChatGPT and ConceptNet training data provides more diverse and comprehensive facet supervision than either source alone
- Mechanism: ChatGPT provides human-like property-facet relationships while ConceptNet provides structured commonsense knowledge, together covering a broader semantic space
- Core assumption: Different knowledge sources capture complementary aspects of commonsense meaning
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1]: "the best results are obtained by augmenting this training data with examples from ConceptNet"
  - [section 4.1]: Results table shows combined training outperforms either source alone
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus shows related work but no direct comparison of combined vs individual sources

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Disentangled representation learning
  - Why needed here: The paper builds on ideas from disentangled representation learning to separate different semantic facets of concepts
  - Quick check question: What is the main difference between traditional concept embeddings and multi-facet embeddings?

- Concept: Graph Neural Networks for ontology completion
  - Why needed here: The ontology completion experiments use a GNN framework to predict missing relationships based on concept embeddings
  - Quick check question: How do pre-trained concept embeddings serve as input features for the GNN in ontology completion?

- Concept: Multi-label classification with large label spaces
  - Why needed here: Ultra-fine entity typing involves assigning one of ~10K possible labels to entity mentions, requiring effective label space organization
  - Quick check question: Why is clustering labels based on concept embeddings helpful for ultra-fine entity typing?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Concept encoder -> Property encoder -> Facet encoder -> Masked concept embedding -> Property embedding similarity scoring
- Critical path: Concept → Property → Facet mask → Masked concept embedding → Property embedding similarity scoring
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Single base embedding with masks vs. multiple separate embeddings per concept
  - Using external sources (ChatGPT, ConceptNet) vs. self-supervised learning
  - Fixed vs. dynamic number of facets (dynamic chosen)
- Failure signatures:
  - Facet masks becoming uniform across properties
  - Concept embeddings failing to capture basic taxonomic relationships
  - InfoNCE loss failing to align properties within same facets
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test concept-property prediction on held-out properties to verify basic embedding quality
  2. Evaluate outlier detection performance to assess facet-specific representations
  3. Run ontology completion with and without clustering to measure impact of facet-aware embeddings

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do the multi-facet concept embeddings compare to other state-of-the-art concept embedding methods like those based on large language models or graph neural networks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using BERT-based encoders and compares to some existing concept embedding models, but doesn't directly compare to the latest methods based on large language models or graph neural networks.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the specific contribution of the multi-facet approach rather than a comprehensive comparison to all existing methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the multi-facet embeddings to other state-of-the-art methods on the same downstream tasks would provide a clear answer.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the multi-facet concept embeddings be effectively used for zero-shot or few-shot learning tasks beyond ultra-fine entity typing?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the potential of the embeddings for various tasks like ontology completion and outlier detection, but doesn't explicitly test them on zero-shot or few-shot learning scenarios.
- Why unresolved: While the paper suggests the embeddings could be useful for such tasks, it doesn't provide empirical evidence to support this claim.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying the multi-facet embeddings to zero-shot or few-shot learning tasks in different domains would demonstrate their effectiveness.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How sensitive are the multi-facet concept embeddings to the choice of properties and facets used during training?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using properties and facets from ChatGPT and ConceptNet, but doesn't explore the impact of different choices on the quality of the embeddings.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't investigate how the selection of properties and facets affects the final embeddings and their performance on downstream tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments varying the set of properties and facets used for training and evaluating the resulting embeddings would reveal their sensitivity to these choices.

## Limitations

- Reliance on ChatGPT for generating training data introduces potential bias and inconsistency in learned facet-property relationships
- Effectiveness of masked embedding approach versus learning separate embeddings per facet is not conclusively demonstrated
- Dynamic facet approach may lead to inconsistent facet definitions across different training runs

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The general approach of using multi-facet embeddings for capturing diverse commonsense properties is sound and well-supported by experimental results
- **Medium Confidence**: The specific implementation choices (masked embeddings, combined training data) are reasonable but lack conclusive comparative evidence
- **Low Confidence**: The reliability of ChatGPT-generated training data for facet-property relationships is questionable without additional validation

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study on training data sources**: Systematically evaluate performance when using only ChatGPT data, only ConceptNet data, and various combinations to quantify the contribution of each source.

2. **Comparison with separate embedding baselines**: Implement and compare against a model that learns separate embeddings for each facet to directly test whether the masked embedding approach is superior.

3. **Facet consistency evaluation**: Measure the consistency of learned facets across multiple training runs and with human judgments to assess the reliability of the dynamic facet approach.
