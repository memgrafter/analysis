# Continual Novel Class Discovery via Feature Enhancement and Adaptation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.06389
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06389
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proposed FEA method achieves higher average accuracy, lower average forgetting rate, and higher average discovery accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses Continual Novel Class Discovery (CNCD), where the goal is to incrementally discover new classes without labels while maintaining performance on known classes. The proposed Feature Enhancement and Adaptation (FEA) method tackles two major challenges: feature-discrepancy and inter-session confusion. FEA introduces a guide-to-novel framework for robust self-supervision, a centroid-to-samples similarity constraint for enhancing feature distinctiveness, and a boundary-aware prototype constraint for preventing interference between known and novel classes. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate FEA's superiority, especially in challenging protocols with many incremental sessions.

## Method Summary
The FEA method consists of three main components: a guide-to-novel framework that aligns predicted class distributions with prior distributions for self-supervision; a centroid-to-samples similarity constraint that enforces sharp decision boundaries among novel classes by comparing cosine similarities between class centroids and samples; and a boundary-aware prototype constraint that keeps novel class features aware of known class prototype positions to reduce inter-session confusion. The method uses contrastive learning to obtain rich features, extends a unified cosine classifier per session, and maintains prototype statistics for known classes without storing exemplars. Training involves base session supervised learning followed by incremental discovery sessions with multiple loss components.

## Key Results
- FEA achieves higher average accuracy than state-of-the-art methods across all benchmark datasets
- FEA demonstrates lower average forgetting rates, particularly in challenging T=10 protocols
- FEA shows higher average discovery accuracy for novel classes in incremental sessions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The guide-to-novel framework resolves feature-discrepancy by using prior distribution as self-supervision instead of unreliable pseudo-labels.
- Mechanism: The method aligns predicted class distribution with a prior distribution that encodes only the current novel classes. This self-supervision signal guides the unified classifier to discover novel classes from rich features obtained via contrastive learning.
- Core assumption: The prior distribution is robust and correctly specifies which classes are novel in the current session.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the guide-to-novel framework is established to continually discover novel classes under the guidance of prior distribution"
  - [section] "the guide-to-novel term Dg provides a more robust distribution-level self-supervision signal"
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence; only indirect mention in related work on continual learning.
- Break condition: If the prior distribution is mis-specified or corrupted, the alignment will misguide discovery and degrade performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Centroid-to-samples similarity constraint (CSS) enforces sharp decision boundaries among novel classes.
- Mechanism: For each novel class, the method computes cosine similarity between the class centroid and all samples in a mini-batch. It then enforces similarity consistency between two augmented views of the same sample while pushing apart similarities from different classes.
- Core assumption: Class centroids computed from the current mini-batch are representative of true class distributions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the CSS is designed to constrain the relationship between centroid-to-samples similarities of different classes, thereby enhancing the distinctiveness of features among novel classes"
  - [section] "By constraining the relations of all novel class representations, sharp decision boundaries can be established among novel classes"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence; related concepts appear in contrastive learning papers.
- Break condition: If centroids are poorly estimated (e.g., due to small batch size), the similarity constraint may fail to enforce distinct boundaries.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Boundary-aware prototype constraint (BAP) prevents inter-session confusion by keeping novel class features aware of known class prototype positions.
- Mechanism: The method projects both known class prototypes and novel class features into a shared latent space and penalizes proximity between novel class centroids and known class prototypes while encouraging separation among novel class centroids.
- Core assumption: Known class prototypes stored from previous sessions remain valid representations of those classes in the evolving feature space.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the BAP is proposed to keep novel class features aware of the positions of other class prototypes during incremental sessions"
  - [section] "By keeping novel class features aware of the positions of other class prototypes during incremental sessions, this constraint can reduce the interference of novel class features on the decision boundaries of known classes"
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence; no direct support in neighbor papers.
- Break condition: If known class prototypes drift significantly due to catastrophic forgetting, the BAP may push novel classes away from correct decision boundaries.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contrastive learning
  - Why needed here: Provides richer and more diverse features suitable for novel class discovery compared to supervised features optimized only for known classes.
  - Quick check question: Why does contrastive learning help when supervised features are already class-discriminative for known classes?

- Concept: Prototype-based rehearsal
  - Why needed here: Avoids storing exemplars while still mitigating catastrophic forgetting by maintaining mean and variance statistics for known classes.
  - Quick check question: How does generating pseudo-features from stored prototypes help maintain old knowledge without exemplars?

- Concept: Class-incremental learning dynamics
  - Why needed here: Understanding how model performance degrades over multiple sessions is critical for evaluating and improving continual novel class discovery.
  - Quick check question: What metrics would best capture both forgetting of known classes and discovery accuracy of novel classes?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Feature extractor (ViT-B/16 pre-trained with DINO) -> Unified cosine classifier (extended per session) -> Contrastive learning module (augmentation + projection MLP) -> Prior distribution generator (based on current novel class set) -> Centroid calculator (per mini-batch novel class centroids) -> Prototype storage (mean/variance for known classes) -> Loss aggregator (Lframework + LCSS + α(τ)LBAP)

- Critical path:
  1. Base session supervised training (Lce)
  2. For each incremental session:
     - Extend classifier
     - Maintain old knowledge (Lpr + Lf d)
     - Discover novel knowledge (Lcl + Lguide)
     - Apply CSS (LCSS)
     - Apply BAP (LBAP)
     - Update prototypes

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Single-head vs multi-head: Simpler architecture but requires robust self-supervision signals
  - No exemplars vs exemplars: Better privacy and scalability but relies on prototype statistics
  - Contrastive learning vs supervised: More suitable for novel discovery but requires careful self-supervision design

- Failure signatures:
  - Performance plateau on known classes → potential catastrophic forgetting
  - Novel classes clustering incorrectly → CSS or BAP not working
  - Slow convergence on novel classes → guide-to-novel term not effective

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate guide-to-novel framework alone (Lframework only) on CIFAR-10 T=1 to check basic continual learning capability
  2. Add CSS to framework (Lframework + LCSS) to measure feature enhancement effect
  3. Add BAP to previous setup (Lframework + LCSS + LBAP) to evaluate inter-session confusion mitigation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the effectiveness of the guide-to-novel framework compare when using different types of prior distributions (e.g., uniform vs. class-specific)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The guide-to-novel framework aligns the model's predicted class distribution with the prior distribution.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the impact of different prior distribution types on the framework's performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments using different prior distributions (e.g., uniform, class-specific) and analyzing their impact on the model's performance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal number of incremental discovery sessions for the CNCD task, and how does it vary across different datasets and application scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that increasing the number of incremental sessions exacerbates the feature discrepancy and inter-session confusion problems.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a clear guideline on the optimal number of incremental sessions or how it varies across different datasets and scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments with varying numbers of incremental sessions on different datasets, analyzing the trade-off between performance and complexity.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the FEA method perform in cross-domain CNCD scenarios, where the base session is trained on one domain and novel class discovery is conducted on other domains?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests extending the CNCD method to cross-domain situations as a future research direction.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the performance of the FEA method in cross-domain CNCD scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying the FEA method to cross-domain CNCD tasks, comparing its performance with baseline methods.

## Limitations

- Implementation details for the Boundary-Aware Prototype constraint (BAP) and Centroid-to-Samples Similarity constraint (CSS) are underspecified
- Specific hyperparameter settings and data augmentation strategies are not provided
- Lack of ablation studies makes it difficult to isolate contributions of individual components

## Confidence

- Theoretical framework: High confidence
- Experimental results: Medium confidence
- Reproducibility: Low confidence

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate contributions of CSS and BAP by training models with Lframework only, Lframework + LCSS, and Lframework + LCSS + LBAP on CIFAR-10 T=1

2. Track evolution of known class prototypes across incremental sessions to verify catastrophic forgetting mitigation, especially in T=10 protocol

3. Test robustness of guide-to-novel framework by systematically corrupting prior distributions to validate "robust self-supervision" claims
