# Faces that Speak: Jointly Synthesising Talking Face and Speech from Text

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2405.10272
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10272
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Unified text-driven multimodal synthesis system generating synchronized talking face videos and natural speech from single portrait image and text input

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a unified text-driven multimodal synthesis system that generates synchronized talking face videos and natural speech from a single portrait image and text input. The method integrates talking face generation and text-to-speech systems, addressing two key challenges: generating diverse head poses representative of real-world scenarios and ensuring voice consistency despite variations in facial motion for the same identity. The proposed approach introduces a motion sampler based on conditional flow matching combined with an auto-encoder-based noise reducer for high-quality motion code generation, and a novel conditioning method for the TTS system that uses motion-removed features from the talking face generation model. The framework achieves state-of-the-art results on both video quality and voice consistency on benchmark datasets, outperforming cascade-based methods while demonstrating robust generalization to unseen identities.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework integrates talking face generation and text-to-speech systems into a unified architecture. The core innovation lies in addressing two main challenges: generating diverse, realistic head poses and maintaining voice consistency across varying facial motions. The approach uses a motion sampler based on conditional flow matching to generate high-quality motion codes, combined with an auto-encoder-based noise reducer to refine these codes. For the TTS system, the authors introduce a novel conditioning method that leverages motion-removed features extracted from the talking face generation model, ensuring that speech synthesis remains independent of facial motion variations. The unified architecture is trained end-to-end, allowing for synchronized generation of talking face videos and corresponding speech from text input.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art video quality with FID score of 18.348 and ID-SIM score of 0.864 on benchmark datasets
- Demonstrates superior voice consistency with WER score of 14.56 and C-SIM score of 0.593
- Outperforms cascade-based methods in both video and audio synthesis quality
- Shows robust generalization to unseen identities while maintaining synchronization between audio and visual components

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system works by disentangling facial motion from identity-specific features, allowing the TTS system to generate consistent speech regardless of head pose variations. The conditional flow matching-based motion sampler generates diverse, realistic motion codes that capture the temporal dynamics of natural speech production. The auto-encoder noise reducer then refines these motion codes to ensure high-quality generation. By conditioning the TTS system on motion-removed features from the talking face model, the framework maintains voice consistency even when facial motions vary significantly. This end-to-end training approach enables the system to learn synchronized audio-visual representations that generalize well to unseen identities.

## Foundational Learning

**Conditional Flow Matching**: A generative modeling technique that learns to sample from conditional distributions by estimating the reverse-time dynamics of a diffusion process. Why needed: To generate diverse, realistic motion codes that capture natural head pose variations. Quick check: Verify that generated motion codes exhibit smooth transitions and cover the full range of plausible head movements.

**Motion Code Generation**: The process of encoding temporal facial motion information into a compact latent representation. Why needed: To efficiently capture and reproduce the complex dynamics of talking face videos. Quick check: Ensure motion codes preserve temporal coherence and reproduce natural speech-related facial movements.

**Feature Disentanglement**: The separation of identity-specific features from motion-related features in the latent space. Why needed: To enable voice consistency by preventing facial motion variations from affecting speech synthesis. Quick check: Confirm that motion-removed features retain speaker identity while being independent of head pose variations.

**End-to-end Training**: Training all components of the system jointly rather than in separate stages. Why needed: To optimize for synchronized audio-visual generation and learn shared representations. Quick check: Monitor synchronization quality between generated audio and video during training.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Text Input -> Motion Sampler (CFM + Noise Reducer) -> Talking Face Generator -> Motion-Removed Features -> TTS System -> Synchronized Output

**Critical Path:** Text → Motion Sampler → Talking Face Generator → Motion-Removed Features → TTS → Final Output

**Design Tradeoffs:** The unified architecture trades computational complexity for end-to-end optimization and synchronization quality. The motion sampler adds latency but enables diverse head poses, while the noise reducer improves quality at the cost of additional parameters.

**Failure Signatures:** 
- Poor synchronization between audio and video indicates issues with the motion sampling or conditioning pipeline
- Inconsistent voice across different motions suggests inadequate feature disentanglement
- Blurry or unrealistic facial movements point to problems in the motion code generation or refinement

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Generate talking face videos with varying text inputs to test text-to-motion alignment
2. Evaluate voice consistency by synthesizing speech with identical text but different motion codes
3. Test generalization by applying the system to unseen identities and measuring synchronization quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance on highly diverse real-world scenarios with varying lighting, head poses, and speaking styles remains untested
- The motion sampling approach may not fully capture complex temporal dynamics of natural speech production, especially for languages with intricate prosody
- Voice consistency metrics are primarily evaluated on single-speaker datasets, leaving multi-speaker generalization uncertain

## Confidence
- **Video Quality Metrics (FID, ID-SIM):** High - Standardized evaluation protocols used
- **Voice Consistency Metrics (WER, C-SIM):** High - Established metrics applied consistently
- **Real-world Robustness:** Medium - Limited testing on diverse, unconstrained scenarios
- **Multi-speaker Generalization:** Medium - Single-speaker datasets dominate evaluation

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the system's performance on diverse, unconstrained video datasets with varying lighting conditions, camera angles, and background noise to assess real-world robustness
2. Test voice consistency across multiple speakers with the same system to verify the disentanglement approach maintains speaker identity across different facial motions
3. Conduct user studies comparing the synthesized outputs against real videos in terms of perceived naturalness and speaker authenticity across different cultural and linguistic contexts
