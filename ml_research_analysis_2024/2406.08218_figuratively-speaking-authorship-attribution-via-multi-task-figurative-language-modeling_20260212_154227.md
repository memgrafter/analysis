# Figuratively Speaking: Authorship Attribution via Multi-Task Figurative Language Modeling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.08218
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08218
- Reference count: 29
- Primary result: Multi-task Figurative Language Model (MFLM) outperforms or matches specialized binary models for FL detection and improves Authorship Attribution performance when combined with traditional features

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a multi-task model for detecting multiple Figurative Language (FL) features in text, outperforming specialized binary models. The proposed Multi-task Figurative Language Model (MFLM) jointly detects Metaphor, Simile, Idiom, Sarcasm, Hyperbole, and Irony, showing superior or comparable performance to binary classifiers across 13 test sets. When applied to Authorship Attribution (AA), MFLM embeddings consistently improve AA performance when combined with other features, supporting the hypothesis that FL features enhance authorship identification. This is the first computational study leveraging FL for AA, demonstrating the value of integrating multi-task FL modeling into NLP tasks.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a Multi-task Figurative Language Model (MFLM) using RoBERTa-Large to jointly detect six types of figurative language: Metaphor, Simile, Idiom, Sarcasm, Hyperbole, and Irony. The model is trained on an augmented dataset created from binary FL classifiers. For Authorship Attribution, MFLM generates document embeddings from sentence-level FL predictions, which are then combined with traditional stylometric and n-gram features and fed into MLP classifiers. The approach is evaluated on three AA datasets (IMDb-62, PAN-2006, PAN-2018) and compared against baseline models using only traditional features.

## Key Results
- MFLM outperforms or matches binary classifiers in 8 out of 13 FL detection test sets
- MFLM embeddings alone achieve competitive AA performance, matching or exceeding baseline models
- Combining MFLM embeddings with traditional features consistently improves AA performance across nearly all test cases
- The multi-task approach captures complementary information to traditional stylometric features for authorship identification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Joint multi-task learning of multiple FL features improves detection accuracy compared to single-task models.
- Mechanism: Training a single model to predict multiple related FL phenomena simultaneously captures shared linguistic patterns, leading to better generalization and feature interaction modeling.
- Core assumption: FL features are not independent; they share underlying linguistic structures and co-occur in natural language.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we demonstrate, through detailed evaluation across multiple test sets, that the our model tends to perform equally or outperform specialized binary models in FL detection"
  - [section] "In 5 out of 13 tests, the MFLM either matches or surpasses binary models. Furthermore, in 3 tests, the MFLM exhibits comparable or superior performance in specific tasks"
- Break condition: If FL features are truly independent with no shared linguistic patterns, the multi-task model would not gain any advantage and could suffer from interference.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: MFLM embeddings capture author-specific stylistic patterns that improve Authorship Attribution performance.
- Mechanism: Figurative language use reflects personal writing style and cognitive patterns. By encoding multiple FL features simultaneously, MFLM embeddings capture nuanced authorial signatures that traditional stylometric features miss.
- Core assumption: Authors have consistent, personal patterns in their use of figurative language that distinguish them from other writers.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we evaluate the predictive capability of joint FL features towards the AA task on three datasets, observing improved AA performance through the integration of MFLM embeddings"
  - [section] "The results showed the competitive performance achieved by MFLM embeddings alone, while their combination with other features yielded consistent performance improvements"
- Break condition: If figurative language use is random or highly context-dependent without personal consistency, MFLM embeddings would not provide discriminative authorship signals.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Combining MFLM embeddings with traditional stylometric and n-gram features provides complementary information for Authorship Attribution.
- Mechanism: MFLM captures semantic-pragmatic aspects of writing (through FL detection), while n-grams capture surface-level patterns (word choice, punctuation). Their combination provides a more complete representation of authorial style.
- Core assumption: Different feature types capture orthogonal aspects of writing style, and their combination provides better discrimination than any single feature type.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we conduct experiments to explore the impact of integrating Figurative Language (FL) features by combining our MFLM encoding with baseline document vectors and subsequently training new MLP classifiers. Our findings demonstrate a consistent boost in performance across nearly all cases"
  - [section] "The third and fourth baselines in our study are constructed using word and character n-grams... On the other hand, MFLM document vectors address both semantic and pragmatic aspects by encoding Figurative Language (FL) features"
- Break condition: If feature types are highly redundant or if one feature type dominates the others, combination would provide minimal benefit.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multi-task learning with shared representations
  - Why needed here: The paper demonstrates that training a single model to detect multiple FL features simultaneously outperforms separate models for each feature.
  - Quick check question: Why would training one model on multiple related tasks be better than training separate models for each task?

- Concept: Figurative language as stylistic fingerprint
  - Why needed here: The paper argues that FL usage patterns can help identify authors, forming the basis for the AA application.
  - Quick check question: How does the use of metaphors, similes, and other figurative devices reflect an author's unique writing style?

- Concept: Transformer-based sentence embeddings for document representation
  - Why needed here: The paper uses RoBERTa-based models to create document embeddings from sentence-level FL predictions, which are then used for Authorship Attribution.
  - Quick check question: How do you convert sentence-level predictions into meaningful document-level representations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing -> Binary FL models (6 RoBERTa models) -> Multi-label augmentation -> MFLM training (RoBERTa with multi-task head) -> MFLM embeddings generation -> MLP classifier for AA task
- Critical path: The key pipeline is: raw text -> FL feature detection -> document embeddings -> authorship classification. The quality of FL detection directly impacts AA performance.
- Design tradeoffs: Using a multi-task model trades off specialized accuracy for each feature against the benefit of capturing feature interactions. The paper chose RoBERTa-Large for sufficient capacity while maintaining computational efficiency.
- Failure signatures: If FL detection accuracy is poor, AA performance will suffer. If the multi-task model suffers from catastrophic forgetting of less frequent features, those features won't contribute to AA. If embeddings are too generic, they won't capture author-specific patterns.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train and evaluate binary FL models separately on each test set to establish baseline performance
  2. Train MFLM on augmented multi-label data and compare its FL detection performance against binary models on the same test sets
  3. Use MFLM embeddings alone (without other features) for AA on the IMDB-62 dataset to establish baseline AA performance before combining with other features

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions but implies several through its methodology and discussion:

## Limitations

- The study uses only English datasets, limiting generalizability to other languages
- The optimal balance between FL features and traditional features for different text lengths is not systematically explored
- The contribution of individual FL feature types to AA performance remains unclear without ablation studies

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The MFLM model outperforms or matches binary classifiers on 8 out of 13 test sets, demonstrating the viability of multi-task FL detection
- **Medium Confidence**: The consistent AA performance improvements when combining MFLM embeddings with traditional features suggest genuine complementarity, though the magnitude varies across datasets
- **Medium Confidence**: The core hypothesis that FL features capture authorial style is supported, but the paper doesn't definitively prove this mechanism versus other explanations

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies on the MFLM model to determine which individual FL features contribute most to AA performance, testing whether all six features are necessary or if subsets suffice
2. Perform cross-dataset validation by training MFLM on one FL corpus and evaluating on another to test generalization and isolate whether improvements are dataset-specific
3. Compare MFLM performance against a weighted ensemble of the six binary classifiers (rather than simple concatenation) to better understand the multi-task advantage mechanism
