# NeuroBOLT: Resting-state EEG-to-fMRI Synthesis with Multi-dimensional Feature Mapping

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.05341
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05341
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Multi-dimensional transformer-based framework achieving state-of-the-art EEG-to-fMRI translation with correlation coefficients of 0.587 (sensory), 0.566 (cognitive), and 0.564 (thalamus) across 64 ROIs

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces NeuroBOLT, a transformer-based framework that translates raw EEG signals into resting-state fMRI BOLD activity across the entire brain. The key innovation is multi-dimensional feature learning that captures temporal, spatial, and spectral information from EEG data through separate modules that are then fused for regression to fMRI predictions. Tested on 22 subjects with 29 fMRI scans, NeuroBOLT achieves superior performance compared to existing methods, particularly in deep subcortical regions like thalamus where traditional EEG analysis struggles. The framework demonstrates strong generalizability, successfully predicting fMRI activity for unseen subjects across entire 20-minute scans.

## Method Summary
NeuroBOLT employs a two-module architecture: a temporal-spatial representation module using LaBraM (a pre-trained EEG foundation model) for spatiotemporal embeddings, and a multi-scale spectral module that captures frequency information across different temporal resolutions using STFT with varying window sizes (0.5s, 1s, 2s, 4s). These complementary representations are fused and passed through a regression head to predict fMRI signals for 64 DiFuMo regions. The model is fine-tuned on simultaneous EEG-fMRI data with MSE loss, supporting both intra-subject and inter-subject prediction scenarios. For inter-subject prediction, the framework employs a leave-one-subject-out approach where data from all but one subject is used for training.

## Key Results
- Achieved average correlation of 0.473 across all 64 ROIs for inter-subject prediction of resting-state fMRI
- Superior performance in primary sensory regions (r=0.587), high-level cognitive areas (r=0.566), and deep subcortical regions like thalamus (r=0.564)
- Successfully predicted resting-state fMRI across entire 20-minute scans in unseen subjects
- Demonstrated generalizability to task-based fMRI data from 16 scans of 10 subjects
- Multi-scale spectral analysis showed significant performance improvements over single-scale approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multi-dimensional feature learning across temporal, spatial, and spectral domains enables effective EEG-to-fMRI translation
- Mechanism: The model captures complementary representations of EEG signals through separate temporal-spatial and multi-scale spectral modules, then fuses these embeddings before regression. This allows the network to learn complex relationships between neural activity and hemodynamic responses that single-domain approaches miss.
- Core assumption: EEG signals contain sufficient information in their temporal, spatial, and spectral characteristics to predict fMRI activity when properly extracted and combined
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "multi-dimensional representation learning from temporal, spatial, and spectral domains"
  - [section 3.2] "These two modules learn complementary attributes of EEG data"
- Break condition: If one domain (temporal, spatial, or spectral) provides negligible information for fMRI prediction, the fusion approach would add computational complexity without benefit

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-scale spectral analysis improves fMRI reconstruction by capturing both coarse and fine spectral features
- Mechanism: Using multiple window sizes for STFT analysis (0.5s, 1s, 2s, 4s) allows the model to capture both high temporal resolution for rapid changes and high frequency resolution for detailed spectral content, which are combined to provide comprehensive spectral representations
- Core assumption: Different brain regions and frequencies exhibit distinct temporal-spectral dynamics that benefit from multi-scale analysis
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "we design a multi-scale spectral approach that captures both coarse and fine representations in the temporal and frequency domains"
  - [section 4.4] "Increasing the number of scales led to significant performance improvements in most of the ROIs"
- Break condition: If the optimal window size for fMRI prediction is uniform across all regions and frequencies, multi-scale analysis would be unnecessary

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Leveraging a pre-trained EEG foundation model provides effective spatiotemporal representations that can be fine-tuned for fMRI prediction
- Mechanism: The model uses LaBraM, which was pre-trained on approximately 2,500 hours of diverse EEG data, providing rich spatiotemporal embeddings that capture general EEG characteristics before being adapted to the specific task of fMRI prediction
- Core assumption: General EEG representation learning transfers to the specialized task of EEG-to-fMRI translation
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "we leverage LaBraM [20] as our baseline to obtain spatiotemporal representations of EEG signals"
  - [section 4.4] "Our model achieves an average correlation of 0.473 across all ROIs"
- Break condition: If the fMRI prediction task requires fundamentally different features than general EEG classification, the pre-trained representations may not transfer effectively

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Hemodynamic response function and its relationship to neural activity
  - Why needed here: Understanding the temporal delay between EEG neural signals and fMRI BOLD responses (typically 6 seconds peak delay) is crucial for selecting appropriate EEG windows and interpreting results
  - Quick check question: What is the typical peak delay of the hemodynamic response function between neural activity and BOLD signal changes?

- Concept: Short-Time Fourier Transform and multi-scale spectral analysis
  - Why needed here: The multi-scale spectral module relies on STFT with varying window sizes to capture both temporal and frequency information from EEG signals
  - Quick check question: How does window size in STFT affect the tradeoff between temporal and frequency resolution?

- Concept: Transformer architectures and self-attention mechanisms
  - Why needed here: The model uses transformer encoders for both spatiotemporal and spectral representations, requiring understanding of how attention mechanisms process sequential data
  - Quick check question: What is the computational complexity of standard self-attention versus linear attention approaches?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw EEG → Temporal-Spatial Module → Spectral Module → Fusion → Regression Head → fMRI prediction

- Critical path: Raw EEG → Temporal-Spatial Module → Spectral Module → Fusion → Regression Head → fMRI prediction

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using pre-trained LaBraM vs training from scratch (better performance but less flexibility)
  - Multi-scale spectral analysis vs single-scale (improved accuracy but increased complexity)
  - Separate modules vs joint training (modular design but potential for suboptimal feature alignment)

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor correlation with ground truth: Check if EEG preprocessing or window selection is appropriate
  - Overfitting to training subjects: Verify inter-subject validation performance
  - Slow training: Consider reducing spectral scales or using smaller transformer layers

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train with only temporal-spatial module (no spectral) to establish baseline performance
  2. Add single-scale spectral analysis to test improvement from spectral features
  3. Test different combinations of spectral scales (l1, l2, l3) to find optimal configuration for each ROI type

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How do multi-scale spectral representations compare to other advanced frequency analysis methods for EEG-to-fMRI translation?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that future work could benefit from incorporating more advanced frequency representations, such as the shift-invariant approach described in [43].
  - Why unresolved: While the paper uses multi-scale spectral representation and notes potential benefits of other methods, it does not directly compare different frequency analysis approaches.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments testing NeuroBOLT's multi-scale approach against alternative frequency representations like shift-invariant methods on the same EEG-fMRI datasets.

- Question: What is the optimal number of EEG channels needed to achieve reliable fMRI reconstruction across different brain regions?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that NeuroBOLT supports an arbitrary number of EEG input channels and successfully reconstructs resting-state fMRI signals from deep subcortical regions using only 26 electrodes.
  - Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates success with 26 channels, it doesn't systematically investigate how performance scales with different numbers of channels across various brain regions.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying the number of EEG channels and measuring reconstruction accuracy for different brain regions to determine the minimum effective channel count.

- Question: Can NeuroBOLT be extended to reconstruct full fMRI volumes rather than individual ROIs?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that future work could expand the framework by employing 3D decoders and sequence-based video analysis techniques to enable full fMRI volume reconstruction.
  - Why unresolved: The current framework focuses on predicting fMRI signals for individual ROIs, and while the paper suggests potential extensions, it hasn't implemented full volume reconstruction.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Implementation and validation of NeuroBOLT with 3D decoders to reconstruct complete fMRI volumes, followed by quantitative comparison with current ROI-based approach.

## Limitations

- The model's performance on subcortical regions is limited by volume conduction effects and the spatial resolution constraints of scalp EEG, which may prevent accurate prediction of deep brain activity.
- The multi-scale spectral analysis significantly increases computational complexity, and there is no clear evidence that all four scales are necessary for every brain region.
- The framework relies on a pre-trained EEG foundation model trained on general EEG data, introducing uncertainty about whether these representations are optimal for the specific task of fMRI prediction.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core architecture combining temporal-spatial and spectral representations is well-established in the literature and the implementation details are clearly specified.
- **Medium Confidence**: The inter-subject generalizability claims are supported by the experimental results but require validation on larger, more diverse datasets to confirm robustness across different populations and recording conditions.
- **Low Confidence**: The specific choice of 4 spectral scales and their window sizes lacks theoretical justification for why these particular values were optimal for fMRI prediction.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study on Spectral Scales**: Systematically evaluate the contribution of each spectral scale (0.5s, 1s, 2s, 4s) by training models with different combinations to determine if all scales are necessary or if a subset suffices for most regions.

2. **Cross-Modality Transfer Testing**: Test the pre-trained LaBraM representations on a completely different EEG-fMRI dataset (different subjects, different recording equipment) to assess the true generalizability of the learned features beyond the original training distribution.

3. **Temporal Alignment Analysis**: Conduct a detailed analysis of the temporal alignment between predicted and actual fMRI signals across different regions to quantify how well the model captures the hemodynamic delay and determine if region-specific temporal adjustments improve performance.
