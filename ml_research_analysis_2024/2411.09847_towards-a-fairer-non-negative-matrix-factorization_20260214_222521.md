- This paper proposes Fairer-NMF, a formulation that minimizes maximum reconstruction loss across groups to address bias in standard NMF.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses bias in standard Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) when representing data groups of different sizes and complexities. The authors propose a new formulation called Fairer-NMF that minimizes the maximum reconstruction loss across all groups, weighted by group size and intrinsic complexity. They present two algorithms for solving this problem: an alternating minimization (AM) scheme and a multiplicative updates (MU) scheme. The MU scheme demonstrates reduced computational time compared to AM while achieving similar performance.

## Method Summary
The authors reformulate NMF as a min-max optimization problem where the objective is to minimize the maximum reconstruction loss across all groups, weighted by group size and complexity. They develop two algorithms to solve this problem: an alternating minimization (AM) scheme and a multiplicative updates (MU) scheme. The MU approach achieves similar reconstruction quality with significantly reduced computational time compared to the AM method. The formulation explicitly accounts for group imbalance by weighting the reconstruction losses based on group sizes and their intrinsic data complexity.

## Key Results
- Fairer-NMF achieves more equitable reconstruction losses across groups compared to standard NMF
- Multiplicative updates (MU) scheme reduces computational time while maintaining similar performance to alternating minimization
- Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate improved fairness across majority and minority groups

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Standard NMF tends to favor majority groups because the optimization minimizes aggregate reconstruction error, which is dominated by larger groups. By reformulating the problem as a min-max optimization that explicitly minimizes the maximum weighted reconstruction loss across all groups, Fairer-NMF ensures that no group is systematically disadvantaged. The weighting scheme accounts for both group size and intrinsic complexity, preventing smaller or more complex groups from being ignored in the optimization process.

## Foundational Learning
- **Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)**: A matrix decomposition technique where both factor matrices are constrained to be non-negative. Why needed: Provides the foundation for understanding the standard approach being improved.
- **Min-max optimization**: An optimization framework that minimizes the maximum of a set of functions. Why needed: Forms the core mathematical approach for achieving fairness across groups.
- **Group imbalance in machine learning**: The phenomenon where algorithms favor larger or easier-to-model groups. Why needed: Explains the motivation for developing Fairer-NMF.
- **Alternating minimization**: An iterative optimization technique that alternates between optimizing different blocks of variables. Why needed: Describes one algorithmic approach for solving the Fairer-NMF problem.
- **Multiplicative updates**: An optimization method where parameters are updated by multiplicative factors rather than additive changes. Why needed: Explains the computationally efficient algorithm proposed in the paper.
- **Reconstruction loss**: The error between the original data and its approximation through matrix factorization. Why needed: Defines the primary metric being optimized and equalized across groups.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
Data matrix -> Group partitioning -> Weighted reconstruction loss calculation -> Min-max optimization -> Factor matrices W and H

**Critical path:**
1. Partition data into groups with known memberships
2. Compute weighted reconstruction losses for each group
3. Formulate min-max optimization problem
4. Apply AM or MU algorithm to solve for W and H
5. Evaluate fairness across groups

**Design tradeoffs:**
- Computational efficiency vs. fairness guarantees: MU scheme offers faster computation but may have different convergence properties than AM
- Fairness vs. overall reconstruction quality: Minimizing maximum loss may slightly increase average reconstruction error
- Known group memberships vs. flexibility: The method requires explicit group labels, limiting applicability to unsupervised scenarios

**Failure signatures:**
- Convergence issues when groups have vastly different complexities
- Numerical instability in MU updates when weights become very small
- Suboptimal solutions when the number of groups is very large relative to data size

**3 first experiments to run:**
1. Apply Fairer-NMF to a synthetic dataset with clearly defined majority and minority groups to verify improved fairness metrics
2. Compare computational time and convergence behavior between AM and MU schemes on medium-sized datasets
3. Test the method on a real-world dataset (e.g., text corpus) with known group memberships to validate practical performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Assumes known group memberships, which may not hold in many real-world scenarios where data arrives unlabeled
- Computational efficiency claims for the multiplicative updates scheme lack comprehensive scaling analysis with respect to dataset size and dimensionality
- Focuses primarily on reconstruction loss as a fairness metric, potentially overlooking other important aspects of fairness in NMF applications such as interpretability and downstream task performance

## Confidence

**High confidence:** Mathematical formulation of Fairer-NMF and its theoretical motivation for addressing group imbalance

**Medium confidence:** Empirical validation results based on limited datasets and specific evaluation metrics

**Low confidence:** Generalizability of fairness improvements across diverse application domains and data types not explored in the study

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate Fairer-NMF on datasets with unknown group memberships using unsupervised clustering to validate robustness in real-world scenarios where group labels are unavailable.

2. Conduct extensive scaling experiments comparing AM and MU schemes across varying dataset sizes (up to 10x larger than current experiments) and dimensions to verify computational efficiency claims.

3. Test the approach on diverse application domains including image processing, recommender systems, and bioinformatics to assess generalizability beyond topic modeling and text data.
