# Propagation and Pitfalls: Reasoning-based Assessment of Knowledge Editing through Counterfactual Tasks

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17585
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces ReCoE benchmark to evaluate knowledge editing methods' ability to propagate updates to interconnected facts

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ReCoE (Reasoning-based Counterfactual Evaluation), a benchmark designed to assess knowledge editing methods' ability to propagate updates to interconnected facts through six reasoning schemes: superlative, comparative, sorting, counting, aggregation, and subtraction. The benchmark focuses on natural queries reflecting real-world scenarios and evaluates three key competencies: fact-wise editing effectiveness, fact recall accuracy, and logical coherence in generation. Through experiments on Tülu models, the authors demonstrate that existing knowledge editing methods, including input augmentation, finetuning, and locate-and-edit approaches like MEMIT, significantly underperform on ReCoE, particularly for certain reasoning schemes.

The study reveals that while QLoRA-based finetuning adequately supports fact-wise editing and logical coherence, its primary deficiency lies in the retrieval of edited facts. MEMIT-edited models show substantial degradation across all three assessed abilities, indicating a significant loss of fundamental language modeling capabilities. These findings highlight critical limitations in current knowledge editing approaches and provide valuable insights for future research aimed at enhancing the efficacy and reliability of knowledge editing in computational models.

## Method Summary
The authors developed ReCoE, a reasoning-based benchmark for evaluating knowledge editing methods through counterfactual tasks. The benchmark covers six reasoning schemes (superlative, comparative, sorting, counting, aggregation, and subtraction) and includes natural queries that reflect real-world scenarios. The evaluation framework systematically assesses three key competencies: fact-wise editing effectiveness (whether individual facts are correctly edited), fact recall accuracy (whether edited facts can be retrieved), and logical coherence in generation (whether reasoning chains maintain consistency). Experiments were conducted on Tülu models using various knowledge editing approaches including input augmentation, finetuning, and MEMIT (locate-and-edit method), with comprehensive analysis of performance across different reasoning schemes.

## Key Results
- All evaluated knowledge editing methods significantly underperform on the ReCoE benchmark, especially for counting and aggregation reasoning schemes
- QLoRA-based finetuning adequately supports fact-wise editing and logical coherence but struggles primarily with edited fact retrieval
- MEMIT-edited models exhibit substantial degradation in all three assessed abilities, indicating significant loss of fundamental language modeling capabilities
- The benchmark reveals critical limitations in current knowledge editing approaches, particularly for interconnected facts requiring multi-step reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper's approach works by creating a systematic evaluation framework that tests knowledge editing methods through realistic counterfactual scenarios requiring multi-step reasoning. By focusing on interconnected facts and various reasoning schemes, the benchmark exposes weaknesses that simpler evaluation methods might miss. The three-competency framework (editing effectiveness, recall accuracy, and logical coherence) provides a comprehensive assessment of whether edited knowledge can be correctly propagated and utilized in downstream reasoning tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- **Knowledge Editing Methods**: Why needed - To understand different approaches (input augmentation, finetuning, locate-and-edit) for updating model knowledge without full retraining. Quick check - Can identify when each method is most appropriate based on use case constraints.
- **Reasoning Schemes**: Why needed - To evaluate how well edited knowledge propagates through different types of logical relationships. Quick check - Can distinguish between superlative, comparative, sorting, counting, aggregation, and subtraction reasoning patterns.
- **Fact Interconnectivity**: Why needed - To assess whether editing one fact properly updates related facts in the knowledge graph. Quick check - Can trace logical dependencies between facts and identify potential propagation failures.
- **Counterfactual Evaluation**: Why needed - To test model behavior under hypothetical scenarios that challenge edited knowledge. Quick check - Can design realistic counterfactual queries that expose knowledge editing limitations.
- **Three-competency Framework**: Why needed - To comprehensively evaluate knowledge editing effectiveness beyond simple fact recall. Quick check - Can systematically assess editing, retrieval, and reasoning coherence independently.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Input Query -> Knowledge Editing Method -> Reasoning Scheme Evaluation -> Competency Assessment

Critical Path: Query Generation → Knowledge Editing → Counterfactual Task Creation → Multi-competency Evaluation → Performance Analysis

Design Tradeoffs: The benchmark prioritizes realistic, natural queries over synthetic examples, trading scalability for ecological validity. The six reasoning schemes provide coverage but may miss other important reasoning patterns.

Failure Signatures: Poor performance on counting and aggregation schemes indicates difficulties with numerical reasoning post-editing. MEMIT's degradation across all competencies suggests fundamental interference with language modeling capabilities.

First Experiments:
1. Evaluate a baseline model on superlative and comparative reasoning tasks to establish performance baselines
2. Test QLoRA finetuning on a single reasoning scheme to isolate retrieval deficiencies
3. Apply MEMIT to a simple knowledge graph and assess propagation across connected facts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited scope of reasoning schemes (six types) may not comprehensively represent all real-world knowledge editing scenarios
- Focus primarily on Tülu models limits generalizability to other model architectures
- Reliance on human-annotated data introduces potential subjectivity and scalability concerns
- Does not fully investigate whether MEMIT degradation is inherent to locate-and-edit approaches or implementation-specific
- Does not explore temporal stability of knowledge edits or behavior under domain transfer

## Confidence

High confidence: All evaluated knowledge editing methods underperform on ReCoE benchmark, particularly for certain reasoning schemes. Systematic analysis of three competencies is methodologically sound.

Medium confidence: QLoRA-based finetuning primarily struggles with edited fact retrieval. While supported by experiments, alternative explanations are not fully explored.

Medium confidence: MEMIT-edited models show substantial loss of language modeling abilities. Experimental evidence supports this claim, but mechanism behind degradation warrants deeper investigation.

## Next Checks

1. Cross-architecture validation: Test ReCoE benchmark across diverse model architectures (e.g., LLaMA, Mistral, open-source alternatives) to assess whether limitations are model-specific or universal.

2. Longitudinal stability assessment: Conduct time-series evaluation of knowledge edits to determine how well edited facts persist through fine-tuning, continued pretraining, or domain adaptation scenarios.

3. Scaling analysis: Systematically vary dataset sizes and reasoning scheme complexities to identify whether performance gaps in certain schemes (particularly counting and aggregation) are due to algorithmic limitations or data quantity/quality issues.
