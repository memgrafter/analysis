# Investigating Critical Period Effects in Language Acquisition through Neural Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.19325
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19325
- Reference count: 40
- Language models do not exhibit human-like critical period effects for second language learning or first language attrition under standard training conditions

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether neural language models exhibit critical period effects in language acquisition, similar to those observed in human learners. The authors train bilingual language models on German-English and Finnish-English pairs using different exposure schedules and test whether L2 learning becomes harder with delayed exposure or whether L1 is retained when L2 exposure begins. Their results show that standard language models do not exhibit human-like critical period effects: L2 learning is equally easy regardless of exposure timing, and L1 is rapidly forgotten when L1 exposure ceases. However, introducing Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) regularization partway through training to simulate reduced plasticity produces human-like patterns for both L2 learning difficulty and L1 retention.

## Method Summary
The authors train autoregressive (GPT-2) and masked (RoBERTa) language models from scratch on bilingual datasets with controlled exposure schedules. They test five conditions: monolingual (L1 only), interleaved (simultaneous bilingual), sequential (L2 after L1), sequential with interleaved L1 exposure, and sequential with EWC regularization. The models are evaluated using perplexity (PPL), BLiMP (grammatical acceptability), and GLUE/SuperGLUE tasks to measure L1 and L2 performance. EWC is implemented with regularization strength λ = 20 for GPT-2 and λ = 150 for RoBERTa to simulate reduced plasticity.

## Key Results
- Language models do not exhibit human-like critical period effects: L2 learning is not harder when exposure is delayed, and L1 is rapidly forgotten when L1 exposure ceases
- EWC regularization partway through training produces human-like critical period effects, making L2 learning harder when delayed and preserving L1 knowledge
- Results contradict the claim that critical period effects are an inevitable result of statistical learning, suggesting these effects require explicit modeling of plasticity reduction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: EWC regularization simulates a reduction in neural plasticity that produces human-like critical period effects
- Mechanism: By adding a penalty term based on the Fisher Information Matrix, EWC constrains the model from deviating too far from its initial parameter values (L1 knowledge), mimicking reduced plasticity
- Core assumption: The Fisher Information Matrix can approximate the importance of parameters for retaining prior knowledge
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We show that we can reverse-engineer the CP by introducing a regularizer partway through training to simulate a maturational decrease in plasticity"
  - [section] "EWC introduces a Bayesian-inspired regularization term on a LM's loss partway through training; this term penalizes deviations from a prior distribution over the parameter space (defined in terms of L1 training), simulating the end of the critical period"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus does not directly address EWC mechanisms

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Standard statistical learning without explicit plasticity reduction does not produce critical period effects in language models
- Mechanism: Language models trained with typical gradient descent continue to update all parameters freely, allowing rapid forgetting of L1 when L2 training begins
- Core assumption: The learning algorithm and architecture allow unrestricted parameter updates throughout training
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our results contradict the claim that CP effects are an inevitable result of statistical learning"
  - [section] "Thus, our results contradict the view that CP effects are an expected consequence of statistical learning"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors discuss CP effects but don't directly test statistical learning mechanisms

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Language similarity affects L2 learning difficulty but not in the same way as human critical periods
- Mechanism: When L1 and L2 share more linguistic features, transfer learning is easier due to shared representations, but this effect is not modulated by age of exposure in LMs as it is in humans
- Core assumption: Language models can leverage shared representations across languages for transfer learning
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Are critical period effects in language models dependent on L1 and L2's similarity?"
  - [section] "The value of λ we selected preserved L1 performance substantially compared to the SEQUENTIAL models, at the cost of harming final performance in L2"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors mention language similarity but don't directly address L1-L2 similarity effects in CP context

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Critical period effects in language acquisition
  - Why needed here: Understanding what critical period effects are (harder L2 learning with delayed exposure, retention of L1) is essential for designing experiments and interpreting results
  - Quick check question: What are the two main observable phenomena that define critical period effects in human language acquisition?

- Concept: Catastrophic forgetting in neural networks
  - Why needed here: The rapid loss of L1 proficiency when L2 training begins is an example of catastrophic forgetting, which the experiments aim to prevent or study
  - Quick check question: What happens to a neural network's performance on task A when it is fine-tuned on task B without any regularization?

- Concept: Transfer learning and plasticity
  - Why needed here: The experiments manipulate when L2 exposure begins to test if plasticity (ability to learn new things while retaining old knowledge) changes over time, similar to humans
  - Quick check question: In transfer learning, what is typically expected when fine-tuning a model trained on task A to perform task B?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: GPT-2/RoBERTa models -> Bilingual datasets (German-English, Finnish-English) -> Five training conditions (monolingual, interleaved, sequential, sequential with interleaved L1, sequential with EWC) -> Evaluation metrics (PPL, BLiMP, GLUE/SuperGLUE)
- Critical path: 1) Prepare bilingual datasets with controlled L1/L2 exposure schedules, 2) Train models under different conditions, 3) Evaluate L1 and L2 performance at various stages, 4) Analyze results for critical period effects
- Design tradeoffs: Using English as the evaluation language simplifies comparisons but limits generalizability; using Transformer LMs provides scalability but may not fully capture human-like learning; using EWC provides a simple plasticity simulation but may not reflect human neurobiological mechanisms
- Failure signatures: If L1 performance doesn't drop in the sequential condition, there may be issues with data preparation or training; if EWC doesn't preserve L1, the regularization strength may be insufficient; if results don't replicate across languages, the effect may be language-specific
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train a monolingual model on L1 for 6 epochs to establish baseline performance
  2. Train an interleaved bilingual model on L1 and L2 for 6 epochs to compare with sequential learning
  3. Train a sequential model on L1 for 6 epochs then L2 for 6 epochs to observe catastrophic forgetting of L1

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do CP effects naturally emerge in larger language models with sufficient capacity to learn to convergence?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper suggests that earlier studies finding entrenchment effects used much smaller models, while their 125M-137M parameter LMs may be overparameterized enough to avoid CP effects through normal training
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests relatively small models (125M-137M parameters) and doesn't explore whether scaling up model size would induce CP effects without explicit plasticity reduction
- What evidence would resolve it: Training much larger language models (1B+ parameters) on similar bilingual datasets and testing for CP effects would determine if model capacity is the key factor preventing natural CP emergence

### Open Question 2
- Question: Would using learning rate schedules that decay over time naturally induce CP-like effects in language models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges that learning rate decay is standard in LM training and could be interpreted as an innate loss of plasticity, but doesn't systematically investigate its impact on CP effects
- Why unresolved: The paper uses standard LM training with learning rate restarts during L2 fine-tuning, which may artificially increase plasticity and mask CP effects that could emerge with standard decay schedules
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparing CP effects across different learning rate schedules (constant, linear decay, cosine decay, restarts) while keeping other factors constant would reveal whether learning rate decay alone can induce CP-like phenomena

### Open Question 3
- Question: Are CP effects language-pair dependent, or do they emerge more strongly with certain language combinations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Experiment 4 tested multiple language pairs but found inconsistent results, with PPL showing expected relatedness patterns but BLiMP showing seemingly random variation
- Why unresolved: The paper tested only 10 language pairs and found mixed results, leaving unclear whether CP effects are robust across language combinations or highly sensitive to specific linguistic relationships
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematically testing CP effects across many more language pairs (including closer/distant language combinations, different scripts, different families) would determine whether CP effects show consistent patterns related to language similarity or are idiosyncratic to specific pairs

## Limitations

- The study relies on a specific regularization approach (EWC) to simulate reduced plasticity, which may not fully capture the complexity of human neurobiological development
- Results may not generalize beyond Transformer-based LMs to other neural architectures
- The study only tests a limited number of language pairs, making it unclear whether CP effects are language-pair dependent

## Confidence

- Claim: Language models do not exhibit human-like critical period effects under standard training conditions -> Medium confidence
- Claim: Statistical learning alone cannot produce critical period effects -> Medium confidence
- Claim: EWC regularization produces human-like critical period effects -> Medium confidence

## Next Checks

1. Test whether critical period effects emerge in non-Transformer architectures (RNNs, CNNs) when exposed to sequential bilingual training, to determine if the absence of CP effects is architecture-specific

2. Implement and test alternative regularization approaches (L2 regularization, weight freezing, synaptic intelligence) to verify that EWC is not uniquely capable of producing human-like CP effects

3. Track parameter evolution throughout training to identify specific changes that occur when EWC is applied, providing mechanistic insight into how plasticity reduction creates CP-like patterns
