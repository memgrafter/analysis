# GTA: A Benchmark for General Tool Agents

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2407.08713
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08713
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** GTA benchmark reveals significant challenges in real-world tool use for LLMs, with even GPT-4 completing <50% of tasks

## Executive Summary
GTA is a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the tool-use capabilities of large language models in real-world scenarios. Unlike existing benchmarks that often rely on synthetic queries and simulated environments, GTA uses human-written queries, real deployed tools, and multimodal inputs to create authentic evaluation conditions. The benchmark covers 229 tasks across four tool categories: perception, operation, logic, and creativity, providing a robust framework for assessing LLM performance in practical applications.

The evaluation of 16 LLMs reveals that real-world tool-use tasks present significant challenges, with state-of-the-art models like GPT-4 achieving less than 50% success rate. Most models perform below 25% on these tasks, highlighting a substantial gap between current capabilities and practical requirements. The study identifies argument prediction as the weakest capability for most models and reveals distinct behavioral patterns in how models approach tool invocation, providing valuable insights for future research directions.

## Method Summary
GTA addresses limitations of existing tool-use benchmarks by incorporating human-written queries, real deployed tools, and multimodal inputs to create authentic evaluation scenarios. The benchmark includes 229 tasks distributed across four tool categories: perception (tools that process visual or sensory data), operation (tools that perform actions or modifications), logic (tools that reason or compute), and creativity (tools that generate novel content). Each task requires models to correctly identify and invoke appropriate tools with accurate arguments, simulating real-world tool-use scenarios. The evaluation framework captures both task completion and the quality of tool invocation decisions, providing granular insights into model capabilities and limitations.

## Key Results
- GPT-4 completes fewer than 50% of real-world tool-use tasks in the GTA benchmark
- Most evaluated LLMs achieve below 25% success rate on the benchmark
- Argument prediction emerges as the weakest capability across all evaluated models
- Models exhibit distinct behavioral patterns in tool invocation strategies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark's effectiveness stems from its focus on real-world complexity and authentic evaluation conditions. By using human-written queries that reflect natural language usage patterns, real deployed tools that capture actual system behaviors, and multimodal inputs that require integrated reasoning, GTA creates scenarios that closely mirror practical tool-use challenges. This approach forces models to demonstrate genuine understanding and reasoning capabilities rather than exploiting benchmark-specific patterns or limitations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Tool selection reasoning**: Understanding which tools to invoke based on task requirements is fundamental for practical applications. Quick check: Can models identify appropriate tools from task descriptions without prior exposure?
- **Argument prediction**: Accurately determining tool parameters is crucial for successful tool invocation. Quick check: Do models provide correct arguments across different tool categories?
- **Multimodal integration**: Combining information from multiple input types is essential for complex tool-use scenarios. Quick check: Can models effectively process and integrate visual and textual inputs?
- **Sequential reasoning**: Managing multi-step tool-use processes requires robust planning capabilities. Quick check: Do models maintain coherent reasoning across multiple tool invocations?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Human queries -> Tool selection module -> Argument prediction -> Tool execution -> Output validation

**Critical Path:** The most critical sequence involves query comprehension → tool selection → argument formulation → execution. Failures at any stage cascade to prevent task completion.

**Design Tradeoffs:** GTA prioritizes realism over controlled conditions, accepting higher variance in results to better reflect real-world deployment scenarios. This contrasts with more controlled benchmarks that may overestimate model capabilities.

**Failure Signatures:** Models frequently fail at argument prediction, suggesting limitations in understanding tool-specific requirements rather than general reasoning capabilities. Some models exhibit pattern-matching behaviors rather than genuine comprehension.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Evaluate model performance on synthetic versus human-written queries to quantify the impact of query authenticity
2. Test models with single-modal inputs to isolate the contribution of multimodal processing to overall performance
3. Compare success rates on perception versus logic tools to identify category-specific strengths and weaknesses

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The benchmark's 229 tasks across four categories may not fully represent the diversity of real-world tool-use scenarios
- Benchmark design and evaluation metrics may influence the observed weakness in argument prediction capabilities
- Behavioral patterns in tool invocation are identified through observed frequencies rather than systematic analysis of underlying decision-making processes

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Real-world tool-use tasks are challenging for current LLMs, supported by comprehensive evaluation across 16 models
- **Medium confidence**: Argument prediction is the weakest capability, as this is benchmark-dependent
- **Medium confidence**: Distinct behavioral patterns in tool invocation, requiring further validation with larger datasets

## Next Checks
1. Expand the benchmark to include a wider variety of tool types and more complex multi-step reasoning tasks to better assess model capabilities
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of different benchmark components (human-written queries, real tools, multimodal inputs) on model performance
3. Implement more granular evaluation metrics that capture not just task completion but also efficiency, accuracy of tool selection, and quality of intermediate reasoning steps
