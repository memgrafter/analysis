# Can visual language models resolve textual ambiguity with visual cues? Let visual puns tell you!

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2410.01023
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01023
- **Reference count**: 14
- **Primary result**: Visual context significantly improves model performance on pun comprehension tasks, with largest gains in more challenging disambiguation and reconstruction tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces UNPIE, a new benchmark designed to test whether models can resolve textual ambiguity using visual context. The dataset pairs 1,000 English puns with images that explain both meanings of each pun and separate images that disambiguate between them. Three tasks—Pun Grounding, Disambiguation, and Reconstruction—assess different aspects of multimodal literacy. Results show that both visual-language models and Socratic Models improve performance when given visual context, with the largest gains in more challenging tasks. Fine-tuning with standard multimodal translation data hurt performance, suggesting that visual understanding is key to handling pun ambiguity.

## Method Summary
The study uses 1,000 English puns paired with AI-generated images: one explaining both meanings of the pun and two disambiguating images. Three tasks evaluate pun comprehension: Pun Grounding (identifying the pun phrase), Disambiguation (selecting the correct meaning), and Reconstruction (generating text reflecting the visual meaning). Models tested include text-only LMs, Socratic Models (combining LMs with image captions), and VLMs. Evaluation uses BERTScore for text similarity and GPTEval for reconstruction quality. Fine-tuning experiments test the impact of standard translation datasets on performance.

## Key Results
- Visual context improves pun disambiguation across all model types, with largest gains in more challenging tasks
- Socratic Models and VLMs both benefit from visual cues, but Socratic Models show competitive performance despite being more modular
- Fine-tuning with standard multimodal translation datasets (Multi30k) degrades performance on pun reconstruction, suggesting visual dependencies specific to pun ambiguity are not captured in translation data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Visual context resolves textual ambiguity by providing an additional signal that disambiguates between multiple meanings of a pun phrase.
- **Mechanism**: Puns inherently contain lexical ambiguity (e.g., "pop" meaning both a sound and soda). Images can depict one or both of these meanings, providing cues that align with or contrast the textual context. This alignment enables models to infer the correct interpretation based on visual cues.
- **Core assumption**: Visual cues reliably correspond to one of the meanings in the pun, and the model can map these cues to textual interpretations.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "visual cues can deliver instant insight, preserving the humor and cleverness of the pun"
  - [section 2.1]: "images for each pun that 1. describes both meanings of the pun to explain it and 2. depicts only one meaning of the pun to disambiguate the pun"
- **Break condition**: If visual cues are ambiguous or fail to depict either meaning of the pun clearly, the model cannot rely on them for disambiguation.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Socratic Models improve pun understanding by encoding images into descriptive captions that the language model can process.
- **Mechanism**: The image is first processed by a visual encoder (e.g., BLIP-2) to generate a textual description. This description is then fed into the language model alongside the text, allowing the model to reason over both modalities without direct multimodal training.
- **Core assumption**: The visual encoder can produce captions that capture the semantic content of the images in a way that aids pun disambiguation.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section 4.1]: "SM (Socratic Models) ... is a two-staged framework extending text-only LMs to multimodal tasks by first encoding the multimodal context to textual descriptions"
  - [section 4.3]: "Both strengthening the language model ... and improving visual context processing ... led to more accurate disambiguation"
- **Break condition**: If the visual encoder fails to produce captions that accurately represent the image content, the language model cannot benefit from the additional context.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Fine-tuning with standard multimodal translation datasets can degrade performance on pun reconstruction because such datasets do not capture visual dependencies specific to pun ambiguity.
- **Mechanism**: Standard translation datasets often pair images with unambiguous text, leading the model to learn incorrect alignments between visual and textual information. When applied to puns, this misalignment results in poor reconstruction of ambiguous meanings.
- **Core assumption**: The fine-tuning data does not include examples of resolving lexical ambiguity, which is central to pun understanding.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "fine-tuning with a standard multimodal translation dataset adversely affects performance in the pun reconstruction task"
  - [section 4.3]: "fine-tuning with the Multi30k multimodal machine translation dataset ... harmed the accuracy of visual alignment"
- **Break condition**: If the fine-tuning dataset includes examples of resolving lexical ambiguity, the degradation may not occur.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Lexical ambiguity
  - Why needed here: Puns rely on words or phrases having multiple meanings. Understanding how models handle ambiguity is central to this work.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between homographic and heterographic puns, and why does it matter for model performance?

- **Concept**: Multimodal literacy
  - Why needed here: The ability to integrate information from multiple modalities (text and images) is the core capability being tested.
  - Quick check question: How does the inclusion of visual context improve model performance on tasks involving ambiguous text?

- **Concept**: Transfer learning and fine-tuning
  - Why needed here: The experiments involve both zero-shot and fine-tuned models, and understanding the impact of fine-tuning on performance is crucial.
  - Quick check question: Why might fine-tuning with a standard translation dataset harm performance on pun reconstruction tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Pun dataset (text + images) -> Language models (LM, SM, VLM) -> Visual encoders (for SMs) -> Evaluation metrics (BERTScore, GPTEval) -> Translation pipeline (for multilingual tasks)

- **Critical path**:
  1. Input: Pun sentence + image(s)
  2. Processing: Model inference (LM/SM/VLM)
  3. Output: Generated text (pun phrase, translation, or reconstruction)
  4. Evaluation: Metric computation (BERTScore, GPTEval)

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Using Socratic Models vs. VLMs: SMs are modular and leverage existing models but may lose nuance in image-to-text conversion. VLMs handle both modalities directly but require more computational resources.
  - Fine-tuning vs. zero-shot: Fine-tuning can improve performance on specific tasks but risks overfitting or learning incorrect alignments (as seen with Multi30k).

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Poor BERTScore correlation with human judgments: Indicates the model is not effectively disambiguating based on visual context.
  - GPTEval bias toward certain translation targets: Suggests the evaluation method itself is flawed and may need refinement.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Test pun grounding with and without visual context using Vicuna LM to verify the baseline improvement.
  2. Compare Socratic Models (Vicuna + BLIP-2) vs. VLMs (LLaVA) on pun disambiguation to assess the impact of direct vs. indirect multimodal processing.
  3. Fine-tune LLaVA with Multi30k and evaluate on pun reconstruction to confirm the degradation effect.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How can UNPIE be expanded to include lexical ambiguities from languages other than English?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The authors note that UNPIE is built on an English-only pun corpus and primarily models lexical ambiguities unique to English, suggesting the need for expansion to other languages.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper acknowledges the limitation of the current dataset being English-centric and suggests that expanding to other languages would enhance its linguistic diversity and applicability.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Evidence of successful expansion would include a dataset with puns from multiple languages, demonstrating the model's ability to handle ambiguities across different linguistic contexts.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: What are the potential biases in the generated images used in UNPIE, and how do they affect the model's performance?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors mention that UNPIE's images are AI-generated and conduct human evaluations to assess their naturalness compared to natural images.
- **Why unresolved**: While the paper shows that generated images perform well in human evaluations, it does not explore potential biases in these images or their impact on model performance.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Evidence would include a detailed analysis of biases in the generated images and studies showing how these biases influence model accuracy and understanding.

## Limitations

- Dataset construction relies heavily on automated DALL-E 3 image generation without specifying exact prompting strategy, introducing uncertainty about visual cue reliability
- Evaluation depends on GPTEval for reconstruction tasks, which shows bias toward certain translation targets and may be unreliable
- BERTScore-based similarity thresholds for disambiguation lack precise implementation details, affecting reproducibility

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core finding that visual context improves pun disambiguation across multiple model architectures is well-supported by the experimental results and consistent across all three tasks.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim about Socratic Models improving performance through caption-based multimodal reasoning is supported by results but lacks direct evidence in the corpus about this specific mechanism's efficacy.
- **Medium confidence**: The degradation observed when fine-tuning with Multi30k is clearly demonstrated, but the paper doesn't explore whether this is dataset-specific or a general phenomenon with translation data lacking ambiguity resolution examples.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-validation of visual cue reliability**: Manually verify a random sample (e.g., 50 puns) to assess whether the DALL-E 3 generated images consistently and accurately depict both meanings of each pun and the disambiguating meaning. This addresses the unknown about image generation quality and its impact on model performance.

2. **Ablation study on evaluation metrics**: Run the Disambiguation task using multiple BERTScore implementations and threshold settings to quantify how sensitive the results are to the specific evaluation configuration. This would clarify whether the observed performance differences are robust to implementation choices.

3. **Fine-tuning dataset analysis**: Test fine-tuning LLaVA on multiple translation datasets (not just Multi30k) that vary in their inclusion of ambiguous text examples. This would determine whether the degradation effect is specific to Multi30k or a general issue with translation data lacking ambiguity resolution examples.
