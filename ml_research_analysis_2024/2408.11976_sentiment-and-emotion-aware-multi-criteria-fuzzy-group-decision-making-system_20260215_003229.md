# Sentiment and Emotion-aware Multi-criteria Fuzzy Group Decision Making System

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.11976
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11976
- Reference count: 20
- Primary result: Sentiment and emotion-aware fuzzy GDM system improves consensus (mean consensus level 7.34 classified as high)

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel multi-criteria fuzzy group decision-making (GDM) system that integrates sentiment and emotion analysis to enhance consensus-reaching effectiveness. The system combines explicit numerical preference inputs with sentiment and emotion scores extracted from textual discussions using natural language processing techniques. Applied to a hotel selection scenario with 4 participants, the system demonstrates that incorporating sentiment and emotion analysis significantly improves consensus among participants compared to traditional GDM approaches.

## Method Summary
The system aggregates individual preferences into a collective preference matrix, applies sentiment analysis using VADER and emotion detection using Text2Emotion to chat discussions, and feeds these scores into a fuzzy inference system alongside numerical voting preferences. The FIS computes an overall preference score for each alternative, which is then used to rank options and evaluate consensus through IQR and mean consensus metrics. The approach was validated on a small hotel selection problem where 4 friends chose among 7 hotels based on 8 criteria.

## Key Results
- Mean consensus level of 7.34 classified as high consensus
- Sentiment and emotion analysis significantly improved group agreement
- System successfully integrated qualitative textual inputs with quantitative preferences
- IQR and mean consensus metrics effectively evaluated group agreement levels

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The system improves consensus by integrating sentiment and emotion analysis alongside numerical preferences.
- Mechanism: It uses sentiment analysis to convert textual opinions into preference scores, emotion detection to capture affective states, and a fuzzy inference system to merge these with explicit voting preferences into a unified score.
- Core assumption: Participants' textual expressions in discussions reliably encode both their rational preferences and affective attitudes toward options.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "integrating sentiment and emotion analysis into GDM systems significantly improves consensus among participants"
  - [section] "We utilized text analysis tools to extract sentiment and emotional scores from the chat"
  - [corpus] Weak - neighbors focus on sentiment analysis in GDM but do not explicitly address emotion-aware fuzzy systems
- Break condition: If textual data is sparse, ambiguous, or emotionally incongruent with expressed preferences, the system may produce misleading scores.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The fuzzy inference system effectively balances quantitative and qualitative inputs.
- Mechanism: It takes normalized voting scores (0-100) and sentiment/emotion scores (scaled -1 to 1) as fuzzy inputs and applies predefined fuzzy rules to output a total preference score (0-10).
- Core assumption: The mapping from linguistic input states (e.g., "Very Low", "High") to output states via fuzzy rules can capture the non-linear relationship between preference type and overall acceptability.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) integrates the quantitative results from the voting system with the qualitative results from sentiment analysis"
  - [section] Table 1 shows specific fuzzy rules mapping voting and sentiment inputs to total preferences
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence for the specific fuzzy rule structure used here
- Break condition: If the fuzzy rule base does not reflect actual participant reasoning, the output scores may not correlate with true consensus.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Consensus is measurable and actionable through IQR and mean consensus metrics.
- Mechanism: After computing total preference scores and feedback values, the system calculates IQR to assess spread and mean consensus level to classify agreement as high, medium, or low.
- Core assumption: Consensus can be meaningfully quantified using statistical spread and central tendency measures applied to the group's feedback and preference data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Consensus metrics, including the interquartile range (IQR) and mean consensus level, were used to evaluate the overall agreement"
  - [section] "The consensus level was classified as high, medium, or low based on the mean consensus score"
  - [corpus] Weak - neighbors do not mention IQR or consensus classification schemes
- Break condition: If participants' feedback is polarized or bimodal, IQR may understate true disagreement, leading to false consensus claims.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Fuzzy Logic and Fuzzy Sets
  - Why needed here: To handle imprecision and uncertainty in human preference expression and to merge numerical and linguistic inputs into a single score.
  - Quick check question: What are the membership functions for the voting and sentiment input variables, and how do they map to linguistic terms like "Low" or "High"?

- Concept: Sentiment Analysis (VADER)
  - Why needed here: To quantify the emotional tone of textual opinions and convert them into preference scores that can be combined with numerical votes.
  - Quick check question: How does VADER's compound score range (-1 to 1) relate to the normalized sentiment preference input in the fuzzy system?

- Concept: Emotion Detection (Text2Emotion)
  - Why needed here: To capture discrete emotional states (happy, angry, surprise, sad, fear) that may influence decision acceptance beyond sentiment polarity.
  - Quick check question: How are the positive and negative emotion scores aggregated to produce the final emotion score used in the preference calculation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data Ingestion -> Sentiment/Emotion Analyzer -> Preference Calculator -> Fuzzy Inference System -> Consensus Evaluator -> Feedback Module
- Critical path:
  1. Collect hotel data and participant preferences
  2. Run sentiment and emotion analysis on chat data
  3. Calculate individual and collective preference scores
  4. Feed into fuzzy inference system to get total preference scores
  5. Rank alternatives and gather feedback
  6. Compute consensus metrics
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Sentiment vs. Emotion weighting: The system uses 60% sentiment and 40% emotion; changing this affects sensitivity to emotional nuance vs. overall tone.
  - Fuzzy rule granularity: More rules can capture finer distinctions but increase complexity and risk overfitting.
  - Consensus threshold: High thresholds ensure strong agreement but may reject viable options in diverse groups.
- Failure signatures:
  - Low consensus despite high preference scores: May indicate rule misalignment or conflicting sentiments.
  - Unstable rankings across runs: Suggests sensitivity to input normalization or fuzzy parameter tuning.
  - High IQR with medium mean: Indicates polarized opinions not captured by central tendency alone.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run the system on a synthetic dataset with known sentiment/emotion distributions and verify that output rankings match expected outcomes.
  2. Vary the sentiment/emotion weighting ratio and observe impact on consensus scores and final rankings.
  3. Introduce conflicting textual opinions (e.g., high sentiment but low preference) and assess how the fuzzy rules resolve the contradiction.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed sentiment and emotion-aware GDM system perform in larger-scale decision-making scenarios with more alternatives and participants?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the proposed system was applied to a small decision-making process (choosing a hotel) by a group of friends. It also cites related work on large-scale GDM methods, suggesting that scaling up the proposed system is an open question.
- Why unresolved: The paper only demonstrates the effectiveness of the system on a small-scale problem. The performance of the system on larger, more complex decision-making scenarios remains untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with the proposed system on larger decision-making problems involving more alternatives, participants, and complex criteria would provide evidence for its scalability and performance in real-world scenarios.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do different weighting schemes for sentiment and emotion scores affect the overall preference scores and consensus levels in the proposed GDM system?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that sentiment and emotion scores are weighted and combined to form the total sentiment score, but it does not explore the impact of different weighting schemes on the results.
- Why unresolved: The paper uses a fixed weighting scheme (0.6 for sentiment and 0.4 for emotion) without investigating how alternative weightings might influence the outcomes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Performing sensitivity analysis by varying the weights assigned to sentiment and emotion scores and observing their effects on the preference scores and consensus levels would provide insights into the robustness of the proposed system.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed GDM system handle situations where participants have conflicting sentiments and emotions towards the same alternative?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper does not explicitly address how the system deals with conflicting sentiments and emotions expressed by participants. It mentions that sentiment and emotion analysis is used to understand participant opinions, but it does not discuss the handling of contradictory opinions.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide details on how the system resolves conflicts arising from participants having different sentiments and emotions towards the same alternative.
- What evidence would resolve it: Investigating how the system aggregates and reconciles conflicting sentiments and emotions, and how it affects the final preference scores and consensus levels, would provide insights into the system's ability to handle contradictory opinions.

## Limitations
- The system relies on the assumption that textual sentiment and emotion reliably encode preference strength, which is not empirically validated
- The fuzzy rule base appears ad hoc rather than derived from participant reasoning or expert validation
- The small sample size (4 participants, 7 hotels) limits generalizability to larger-scale decision-making scenarios

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The system architecture and methodology are clearly described and internally consistent
- Medium Confidence: The sentiment and emotion integration approach is plausible and supported by related literature, but direct validation is lacking
- Low Confidence: The claim that fuzzy rules accurately capture consensus dynamics is weakly supported, given the absence of participant validation or rule derivation process

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a larger-scale study with diverse participant groups and varied decision contexts to test generalizability
2. Validate the fuzzy rule base by comparing system outputs against participant reasoning or expert judgment
3. Test the system's robustness to conflicting sentiment-preference pairs (e.g., high sentiment but low preference) to ensure it can handle incongruent inputs
