# Self-Guided Robust Graph Structure Refinement

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.11837
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11837
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: SG-GSR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in node classification, achieving significant improvements in robustness under various attack scenarios.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the vulnerability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to adversarial attacks by proposing a Self-Guided Robust Graph Structure Refinement (SG-GSR) framework. The core idea is to extract a clean sub-graph from the attacked graph itself and use it as a proxy structure for refining the graph. SG-GSR handles two challenges: loss of structural information and imbalanced node degree distribution. It introduces a graph augmentation strategy and a group-training strategy to address these challenges. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SG-GSR under various scenarios, including non-targeted attacks, targeted attacks, feature attacks, e-commerce fraud, and noisy node labels.

## Method Summary
SG-GSR proposes a novel framework for robust graph structure refinement that addresses the vulnerability of GNNs to adversarial attacks. The method consists of three main components: clean sub-graph extraction, graph augmentation, and group-training. The clean sub-graph extraction module identifies and removes adversarial edges from the attacked graph based on structural proximity and feature similarity. The graph augmentation module supplements the loss of structural information by adding edges based on class homophily, feature smoothness, and structural proximity. The group-training module balances the node degree distribution by splitting the augmented sub-graph into three groups (low-low, high-high, and low-high) and independently training the link predictor on each group. The refined graph structure is then used to learn a robust node classifier.

## Key Results
- SG-GSR achieves significant improvements in node classification accuracy under various attack scenarios, including non-targeted attacks, targeted attacks, feature attacks, e-commerce fraud, and noisy node labels.
- The clean sub-graph extraction module effectively removes adversarial edges while preserving clean edges, leading to improved robustness against attacks.
- The graph augmentation and group-training strategies further enhance the performance of SG-GSR by supplementing lost structural information and balancing the node degree distribution.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Extracting a clean sub-graph from the attacked graph itself improves robustness compared to using the full attacked graph.
- **Mechanism:** The clean sub-graph extraction method removes edges with low structural proximity or low feature similarity, which are likely to be adversarial. This creates a "proxy structure" that is less corrupted by attacks, allowing the GSR module to train on cleaner data.
- **Core assumption:** Adversarial edges tend to have lower structural proximity and feature similarity than clean edges, making them identifiable and removable.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "The core idea is to extract a clean sub-graph from the attacked graph itself and use it as a proxy structure for refining the graph."
  - [section]: "To alleviate false positive edges , we propose a clean sub-graph extraction method that obtains a clean proxy structure from the target attacked graph..."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - the related papers focus on graph structure refinement in general, but do not specifically address clean sub-graph extraction from attacked graphs.
- **Break condition:** If adversarial edges are designed to mimic clean edges in terms of structural proximity and feature similarity, the extraction method will fail to identify and remove them.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Graph augmentation strategies supplement the loss of structural information in the extracted sub-graph, enhancing robustness.
- **Mechanism:** The augmentation strategy adds edges based on class homophily, feature smoothness, and structural proximity, which are important for accurate node classification. This compensates for the edges removed during clean sub-graph extraction.
- **Core assumption:** Adding edges that satisfy real-world graph properties (class homophily, feature smoothness, structural proximity) improves the predictive power of the GSR module.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "Furthermore, we propose a novel graph augmentation and a group-training strategy to handle the two technical challenges in the clean sub-graph extraction: 1) loss of structural information, and 2) imbalanced node degree distribution."
  - [section]: "To further handle the above two challenges of the clean sub-graph extraction, we propose 1) a novel graph structure augmentation strategy to supplement the loss of structural information..."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - the related papers discuss graph structure refinement and augmentation, but do not specifically address the loss of structural information in clean sub-graphs.
- **Break condition:** If the added edges introduce noise or do not align with the true graph structure, the augmentation strategy may degrade performance.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Group-training strategy balances the node degree distribution in the clean sub-graph, improving generalization to low-degree nodes.
- **Mechanism:** The group-training strategy splits the edge set into three groups based on node degree (low-low, high-high, and low-high), and independently trains the GSR module on each group. This ensures that the model pays more attention to low-degree nodes during training.
- **Core assumption:** The imbalanced node degree distribution in the clean sub-graph biases the GSR module towards high-degree nodes, hindering its generalization ability to low-degree nodes.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "... and 2) imbalanced node degree distribution. To further handle the above two challenges of the clean sub-graph extraction, we propose 1) a novel graph structure augmentation strategy to supplement the loss of structural information, and 2) a group-training strategy to balance the node degree distribution of the sub-graph..."
  - [section]: "To alleviate the imbalanced node degree distribution of the sub-graph, we balance the node degree distribution by splitting ˜Eaug into three groups, i.e., ˜EaugLL, ˜EaugHL, and ˜EaugHH, and independently train the link predictor in the GSR module on each set."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - the related papers discuss graph structure refinement and group training, but do not specifically address the imbalanced node degree distribution in clean sub-graphs.
- **Break condition:** If the node degree distribution in the clean sub-graph is not significantly imbalanced, or if the grouping strategy does not effectively balance the distribution, the group-training strategy may not provide significant benefits.

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Attacked graph -> Clean sub-graph extraction -> Graph augmentation -> Group-training -> GSR module (SuperGAT backbone) -> Refined graph structure and robust node classifier
- **Critical path:** 1. Extract clean sub-graph from attacked graph 2. Augment clean sub-graph with additional edges 3. Split augmented sub-graph into degree-balanced groups 4. Train GSR module on each group 5. Refine attacked graph using trained GSR module
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Clean sub-graph extraction: Balancing the trade-off between removing adversarial edges and preserving clean edges.
  - Graph augmentation: Choosing the right combination of augmentation strategies to supplement lost structural information.
  - Group-training: Determining the optimal degree split strategy to balance the node degree distribution.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Clean sub-graph extraction fails to remove adversarial edges: Performance degrades under attacks.
  - Graph augmentation introduces noise: Performance degrades on clean graphs.
  - Group-training strategy does not balance degree distribution: Low-degree nodes remain underrepresented.

  2. Test SG-GSR under various structure attack scenarios (e.g., metattack, nettack) to assess robustness.
  3. Analyze the impact of each component (clean sub-graph extraction, graph augmentation, group-training) on the overall performance through ablation studies.
