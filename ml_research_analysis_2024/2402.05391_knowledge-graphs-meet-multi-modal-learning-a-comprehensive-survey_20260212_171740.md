# Knowledge Graphs Meet Multi-Modal Learning: A Comprehensive Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.05391
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05391
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Comprehensive survey of KG-MM integration covering 300+ articles (2020-2023), categorizing tasks into KG4MM and MM4KG paradigms

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the integration between Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Multi-modal Learning, examining two primary domains: KG-driven Multi-modal Learning (KG4MM) and Multi-modal Knowledge Graphs (MM4KG). The survey systematically reviews over 300 articles published between 2020-2023, establishing a structured framework that categorizes KG4MM tasks into four paradigms (Understanding & Reasoning, Classification, Content Generation, Retrieval) and MM4KG tasks into four categories (Representation Learning, Acquisition, Fusion, Inference). The work emphasizes the complementary role of KGs in addressing long-tail knowledge and hallucination issues in Large Language Models (LLMs), while also exploring emerging trends such as multi-modal pre-training strategies and the potential of MMKGs in AI-for-Science applications.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a systematic literature review methodology, collecting relevant articles from platforms like Google Scholar and arXiv using unspecified search terms focused on KG-aware research in two principal aspects: KG-driven Multi-modal Learning and Multi-modal Knowledge Graphs. The collected articles are categorized based on the two domains, with methodological developments analyzed within each task category. The approach provides definitions, evaluation benchmarks, and essential insights for conducting relevant research, while discussing current challenges and identifying emerging trends. The review focuses specifically on recent developments (2020-2023) to capture the evolving landscape of MMKG research.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge Graphs (KGs)
  - Why needed here: KGs are fundamental to understanding the survey's focus on integrating symbolic knowledge with multi-modal learning.
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of a Knowledge Graph (KG)?

- Concept: Multi-modal Learning
  - Why needed here: Multi-modal learning is the other core component of the survey, highlighting the integration of data from multiple modalities.
  - Quick check question: How does multi-modal learning differ from multi-view learning?

- Concept: Multi-modal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs)
  - Why needed here: MMKGs are a central focus of the survey, representing the evolution of KGs to incorporate multi-modal data.
  - Quick check question: What are the two main representation methods for MMKGs, and how do they differ?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: KG-driven Multi-modal Learning (KG4MM) -> Understanding & Reasoning, Classification, Content Generation, Retrieval; Multi-modal Knowledge Graphs (MM4KG) -> Representation Learning, Acquisition, Fusion, Inference
- Critical path: Start with understanding foundational concepts of KGs and multi-modal learning, then explore KG4MM integration, followed by MMKG development and associated tasks
- Design tradeoffs: Balances depth and breadth by focusing on recent developments (2020-2023) while providing comprehensive overview, but may miss earlier foundational work or future trends beyond 2023
- Failure signatures: If categorization becomes too rigid or fails to accommodate new task categories, it may hinder interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement KG-driven Visual Question Answering using pre-trained VLM and external KG
  2. Construct simple MMKG by grounding KG symbols to images using small-scale dataset and basic ontology
  3. Apply multi-modal KG completion method to existing MMKG and evaluate performance on link prediction tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can MMKGs be constructed to efficiently represent both visualizable and non-visualizable concepts while maintaining data quality and avoiding hallucinations?
- Basis in paper: Explicit discussion in VI-A(v) about abstract concepts and the need for efficient storage and utilization of MMKGs.
- Why unresolved: The paper highlights challenges of representing abstract concepts and need for efficient MMKG construction but doesn't provide concrete solutions for balancing these requirements.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of new MMKG construction techniques demonstrating improved representation of abstract concepts while maintaining data quality and reducing hallucinations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can domain-specific MMKGs outperform general-purpose MLLMs in specific tasks, and if so, what are the key factors that contribute to this performance difference?
- Basis in paper: Explicit discussion in VI-B about potential advantages of multi-modal knowledge and need to identify unique benefits of structured (MM)KGs.
- Why unresolved: The paper raises question of whether structured (MM)KGs offer irreplaceable benefits but doesn't provide empirical evidence comparing their performance to MLLMs in specific tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies evaluating performance of domain-specific MMKGs and MLLMs on range of tasks with analysis of contributing factors.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can large-scale MMKGs be effectively integrated with MLLMs to enhance their capabilities in tasks requiring complex reasoning and generation?
- Basis in paper: Explicit discussion in VI-D(viii) about potential of LLMs to augment MMKGs and need for further exploration of this integration.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges potential benefits of integrating large-scale MMKGs with MLLMs but doesn't provide concrete approaches or evidence of their effectiveness.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of new techniques for integrating large-scale MMKGs with MLLMs demonstrating improved performance in tasks requiring complex reasoning and generation.

## Limitations

- The survey's focus on recent developments (2020-2023) may omit foundational work from earlier years, affecting historical context
- The four-paradigm categorization for both KG4MM and MM4KG may not be exhaustive as new task categories could emerge
- The emphasis on KG-driven multi-modal learning may not fully capture the broader landscape of multi-modal learning without KG integration

## Confidence

- High: Structured framework for categorizing KG-driven multi-modal tasks and MMKG tasks is well-supported by extensive literature review
- Medium: Claims about KGs addressing long-tail knowledge and hallucination issues in LLMs are plausible but may require further empirical validation
- Low: Claims to serve as comprehensive reference are limited by potential omission of earlier foundational work and focus on recent developments
