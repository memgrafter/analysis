core_contribution: This paper proposes NFARec, a negative feedback-aware recommender
  model that maximizes the utilization of negative feedback in sequential and structural
  patterns for recommendations. NFARec incorporates an auxiliary task based on the
  Transformer Hawkes Process to predict the feedback sentiment polarity of the next
  interaction, which helps identify items the user has interacted with but may not

# NFARec: A Negative Feedback-Aware Recommender Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.06900
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06900
- Reference count: 40
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 4.2% to 10.9% in Recall@K and 2.3% to 15.3% in NDCG@K

## Executive Summary
NFARec is a negative feedback-aware recommender model that maximizes the utilization of negative feedback in sequential and structural patterns for recommendations. It incorporates an auxiliary task based on the Transformer Hawkes Process to predict feedback sentiment polarity, helping identify items users have interacted with but may not prefer. The model also adopts a two-phase hypergraph convolution approach that leverages feedback relations between users and items to guide efficient information propagation. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

## Method Summary
NFARec is a recommender model that addresses the limitations of existing methods by effectively utilizing negative feedback. It consists of two main components: a sequential representation learning module using Transformer Hawkes Process to predict feedback sentiment polarity, and a structural representation learning module using a two-phase hypergraph convolution approach. The model is trained using a multi-task objective loss combining recommendation loss and auxiliary task loss, and is evaluated on five public datasets with Recall@K and NDCG@K metrics.

## Key Results
- NFARec outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 4.2% to 10.9% in Recall@K
- NFARec achieves 2.3% to 15.3% improvements in NDCG@K across different datasets
- The model effectively utilizes negative feedback to improve recommendation quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Negative feedback-aware correlation improves message-passing in hypergraph convolutions by weighting hyperedges according to user feedback polarity. A feedback correlation matrix is constructed where each element represents the agreement or disagreement between users' feedback on items. This matrix guides the hypergraph convolution to prioritize or suppress information flow based on whether users share similar or opposing feedback on items. Core assumption: Users with opposite feedback on the same item should have their influence on message-passing attenuated. Break condition: If the feedback correlation matrix fails to capture meaningful patterns of agreement/disagreement, the message-passing optimization will not improve performance.

### Mechanism 2
The Transformer Hawkes Process-based auxiliary task improves sequential representation learning by predicting feedback sentiment polarity of the next interaction. The THP models the intensity of future interactions based on historical feedback patterns. By predicting the sentiment polarity of the next interaction, the model learns sentiment-relatedness among items in the interaction sequence, identifying items users may have interacted with but do not prefer. Core assumption: Sequential patterns of positive and negative feedback contain sentiment-relatedness that can improve recommendation quality. Break condition: If the THP fails to capture meaningful temporal dependencies in feedback patterns, the auxiliary task will not improve sequential representations.

### Mechanism 3
Two-phase hypergraph convolution captures both high-order feedback relations and optimizes message-passing paths through feedback-aware aggregation. Phase 1 uses standard hypergraph convolution to capture correlations beyond pairwise interactions. Phase 2 constructs multi-order feedback correlation matrices and uses masking to guide efficient information propagation along optimal paths determined by feedback agreement. Core assumption: High-order feedback correlations between users and items contain valuable information for recommendation that standard graph convolutions miss. Break condition: If the high-order feedback correlations are noisy or do not represent meaningful relationships, the two-phase approach may degrade performance.

## Foundational Learning

- **Graph neural networks and their message-passing framework**: Why needed here: NFARec builds on GCNs and hypergraph convolutions, which require understanding of how node representations are aggregated from neighbors. Quick check question: How does standard GCN message-passing differ from hypergraph convolution in terms of neighborhood definition?

- **Hawkes processes and their application to temporal sequence modeling**: Why needed here: The THP-based auxiliary task requires understanding how past events influence future event intensity in temporal sequences. Quick check question: What is the key difference between Hawkes processes and standard recurrent neural networks in modeling sequential dependencies?

- **Contrastive learning and self-supervised learning techniques**: Why needed here: Several baseline methods in the comparison use contrastive learning, and understanding these approaches helps contextualize NFARec's contributions. Quick check question: How does contrastive learning differ from supervised learning in terms of label requirements and objective function?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input layer (item embeddings) → Sequential encoder (THP) → Auxiliary task (feedback polarity prediction) → Structural encoder (two-phase HGC) → Decoder (inner product) → Output (recommendations)
- **Critical path**: The sequential encoder and structural encoder are the two main branches that must both function correctly for good performance. The auxiliary task provides gradients to improve the sequential encoder.
- **Design tradeoffs**: The model trades increased complexity (two-phase HGC, THP-based sequential modeling) for improved utilization of negative feedback. The hyperparameter 𝛿 controls the balance between sequential and structural features.
- **Failure signatures**: Poor performance on datasets with imbalanced feedback ratios, failure to converge during training of the auxiliary task, or suboptimal performance when negative feedback is sparse
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Compare performance with and without the auxiliary task to verify its contribution to sequential representations
  2. Test different orders of feedback correlation matrices (1st, 2nd, 3rd order) to find optimal configuration
  3. Evaluate the impact of masking in the THP encoder by comparing with and without masking to confirm its necessity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does incorporating negative feedback into generative diffusion models affect their performance compared to current methods?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that DiffRec uses generative diffusion models but underperforms, suggesting potential for improvement by integrating negative feedback.
- Why unresolved: The paper only mentions the underperformance of DiffRec without exploring modifications to integrate negative feedback.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing DiffRec with a modified version that incorporates negative feedback to current methods like NFARec.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of different orders of feedback correlation on recommendation performance, and is there an optimal order?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explores the effect of various orders of feedback correlation on performance and finds that different orders work better for different datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not determine an optimal order of feedback correlation that generalizes across all datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study across a wider range of datasets to identify the optimal order of feedback correlation.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the inclusion of implicit negative feedback, such as content skipping, affect the performance of recommendation models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests future work on exploring the impact of implicit negative feedback to improve performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not experiment with implicit negative feedback like content skipping.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing models with and without the inclusion of implicit negative feedback to measure the impact on recommendation quality.

## Limitations

- The model's effectiveness depends heavily on the accuracy of feedback polarity classification
- The construction of the feedback correlation matrix and its ability to capture meaningful user-item relationships across diverse datasets remains unclear
- The computational complexity of the two-phase hypergraph convolution approach may limit scalability to larger datasets

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The experimental results showing NFARec outperforming baseline methods on five public datasets, with improvements of 4.2% to 10.9% in Recall@K and 2.3% to 15.3% in NDCG@K.
- **Medium Confidence**: The proposed mechanisms for incorporating negative feedback through the Transformer Hawkes Process and two-phase hypergraph convolution, as the theoretical foundations are sound but implementation details are not fully specified.
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability of NFARec to datasets with different feedback patterns and the model's robustness to noise in negative feedback classification.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct an ablation study to isolate the contributions of the Transformer Hawkes Process-based auxiliary task and the two-phase hypergraph convolution approach to the overall performance.
2. Evaluate NFARec on datasets with different feedback patterns and densities to assess its generalizability and robustness.
3. Analyze the computational efficiency of NFARec compared to baseline methods, particularly focusing on the overhead introduced by the two-phase hypergraph convolution approach.
