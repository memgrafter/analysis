# ADAM: An Embodied Causal Agent in Open-World Environments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.22194
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22194
- Reference count: 32
- Primary result: Achieves 2.2× speedup in diamond acquisition and 0 SHD in causal graph construction

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Adam, an embodied causal agent designed for Minecraft that autonomously navigates open-world environments, learns causal world knowledge, and tackles complex tasks through lifelong learning. The key innovation lies in integrating causal discovery methods with embodied exploration, enabling the agent to construct accurate causal graphs of item dependencies from scratch without prior knowledge. Adam achieves remarkable performance, obtaining diamonds 2.2× faster than state-of-the-art methods while successfully learning an almost perfect causal graph with zero Structure Hamming Distance. The agent demonstrates strong robustness when game rules are modified, maintaining performance while other methods fail.

## Method Summary
Adam is built on a four-module architecture: an interaction module for sampling and recording actions, a causal model module combining LLM-based and intervention-based causal discovery, a controller module with planner, actor, and memory components, and a perception module powered by multimodal LLMs. The agent uses GPT-4-turbo for causal inference and LLaVA-v1.5-13B for visual description processing. Through continuous interaction with the Minecraft environment, Adam constructs causal graphs from scratch, enabling it to understand item dependencies and craft complex tools. The approach eliminates reliance on omniscient metadata by using first-person screenshots and MLLM-based descriptions, aligning gameplay more closely with human players.

## Key Results
- Achieves 2.2× speedup in obtaining diamonds compared to state-of-the-art methods
- Successfully learns an almost perfect causal graph with 0 SHD (Structure Hamming Distance)
- Demonstrates strong robustness when game rules are modified, maintaining performance while other methods fail
- Generalizes effectively without relying on prior knowledge or omniscient metadata

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
LLM-based causal discovery with few-shot prompting effectively reduces the complexity of causal graph construction by processing interaction records in structured format, mapping items to letters, and using chain-of-thought reasoning to infer causal assumptions between cause and effect items.

### Mechanism 2
Intervention-based causal discovery refines LLM assumptions and constructs accurate causal subgraphs by systematically testing whether items in the cause set are truly necessary for effect items through controlled sampling and observation.

### Mechanism 3
Multimodal perception enables human-like gameplay without relying on omniscient metadata by capturing first-person screenshots and using MLLMs to generate text descriptions that align with human-observable information.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Causal Discovery (CD)
  - Why needed here: To construct accurate causal graphs from scratch without prior knowledge of game mechanics
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between observational and interventional causal discovery, and why is intervention important here?

- Concept: Multimodal Learning
  - Why needed here: To process visual information from the environment in a way that mimics human perception
  - Quick check question: How does using MLLMs for image description differ from using raw metadata, and what are the tradeoffs?

- Concept: Embodied AI and Lifelong Learning
  - Why needed here: To enable the agent to continuously learn and adapt through interaction with the open-world environment
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes lifelong learning in embodied agents from traditional supervised learning approaches?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Interaction Module -> Causal Model Module -> Controller Module -> Perception Module -> Environmental Loop
- Critical path: Task received → Interaction Module executes initial action → Data recorded → Causal Model Module constructs/updates causal graph → Causal graph complete → Controller Module plans and executes task → New items discovered → Perception Module updates observations → Loop back to step 1 for lifelong learning
- Design tradeoffs: LLM-based vs rule-based CD (Flexibility vs precision), Parallel sampling vs sequential (Speed vs computational resources), Metadata vs visual perception (Accuracy vs human-alignment), Discrete vs continuous actions (Simplicity vs expressiveness)
- Failure signatures: Causal graph errors (Incorrect dependencies or missing edges), Perception failures (Misinterpreted visual information), Controller inefficiencies (Suboptimal planning or action selection), Learning stagnation (Failure to discover new items or actions)
- First 3 experiments: 1) Test LLM-based CD on simple crafting recipes with clean sampling data, 2) Evaluate intervention-based CD on causal assumptions with known ground truth, 3) Measure perception module accuracy with controlled visual scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the performance of LLM-based causal discovery vary with different LLM model sizes and architectures, and what are the implications for scalability and generalizability across different domains? The paper conducts ablation studies on LLM-based CD but only tests a limited set of models and does not explore the full spectrum of model sizes and architectures.

### Open Question 2
How can the integration of causal discovery methods with embodied exploration be further optimized to improve the accuracy and efficiency of causal graph construction in open-world environments? The paper introduces optimization techniques like Temporal Modeling and Subgraph Decomposition but does not explore other potential optimization strategies.

### Open Question 3
How can the Adam architecture be adapted to handle more complex and dynamic environments, such as those with changing causal relationships or multiple interacting agents? The paper demonstrates robustness in modified Minecraft environments but does not explore scenarios with changing causal relationships or multiple agents.

## Limitations
- Reliance on GPT-4-turbo for causal inference may limit scalability and introduces significant computational costs
- Evaluation confined to a single game environment, raising questions about generalizability to other open-world domains
- Causal discovery process depends on extensive sampling that may not scale efficiently to environments with larger action spaces

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: 2.2× speedup in diamond acquisition and zero SHD in causal graph construction are well-supported by experimental results
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about human-like gameplay without omniscient metadata are supported by ablation studies but could benefit from direct human performance comparisons
- **Medium Confidence**: Lifelong learning capabilities are demonstrated but extent of knowledge transfer between tasks could be more thoroughly evaluated

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-domain generalization**: Test Adam's causal discovery capabilities in different open-world environments (e.g., other games or simulation platforms) to validate generalizability beyond Minecraft.

2. **Sample efficiency analysis**: Systematically vary the number of samples (N) in both LLM-based and intervention-based causal discovery to quantify the relationship between sampling effort and causal graph accuracy.

3. **Human performance comparison**: Conduct user studies comparing Adam's gameplay patterns and task completion times against human players to better validate the claim of human-like gameplay without metadata reliance.
