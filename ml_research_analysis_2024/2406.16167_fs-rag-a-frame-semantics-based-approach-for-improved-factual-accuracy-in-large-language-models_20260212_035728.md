# FS-RAG: A Frame Semantics Based Approach for Improved Factual Accuracy in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.16167
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16167
- Authors: Harish Tayyar Madabushi
- Reference count: 5
- Primary result: Frame semantic retrieval achieves recall@40 of 0.464, significantly outperforming keyword-based (0.390) and LLM-generated search term (0.333) baselines on Entailment Bank dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces FS-RAG, a novel approach that leverages frame semantics to improve factual accuracy in large language models by addressing the hallucination problem. The method uses cognitive linguistic theory to index and retrieve factual information through frames rather than keywords, enabling more effective retrieval of logically connected but semantically distant information. Experiments demonstrate that FS-RAG significantly outperforms both simple keyword-based retrieval and LLM-generated search term baselines, while offering the added benefit of interpretability that enables analysis and potential improvements to frame semantics theory.

## Method Summary
FS-RAG implements frame semantic indexing and retrieval through three stages: frame identification, frame relations, and qualitative analysis. The approach uses GPT-4 to generate frames for facts and questions from the Entailment Bank dataset, then retrieves relevant facts based on frames associated with questions and their related frames. The method is compared against two baselines: simple RAKE-based keyword extraction and GPT-4-generated search terms. Retrieval effectiveness is measured using recall@k metrics across multiple k values to evaluate the system's ability to retrieve relevant facts for answering science questions from school years 4-6.

## Key Results
- FS-RAG achieves recall@40 of 0.464, outperforming keyword-based retrieval (0.390) and LLM-generated search terms (0.333)
- Frame semantic retrieval demonstrates superior effectiveness in retrieving facts relevant to answering questions
- The method maintains interpretability while achieving strong retrieval performance, enabling potential debugging and improvement of the retrieval process

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: FS-RAG uses frame semantics to index facts, enabling retrieval of logically connected but semantically distant information
- Mechanism: Facts are indexed by the frames they invoke, and retrieval is based on frames associated with the question and related frames
- Core assumption: Frames provide a better indexing structure than keywords for tasks requiring multi-step reasoning
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Specifically, our method draws on the cognitive linguistic theory of frame semantics for the indexing and retrieval of factual information relevant to helping large language models answer queries."
  - [section 3]: "We propose that this mechanism can be found in the concept of Frame Semantics in cognitive linguistics, which purportedly facilitate human understanding of words by allowing us to recall pertinent information."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - the paper demonstrates effectiveness on a single domain (Entailment Bank) but does not show generalization to other domains
- Break condition: If frames do not capture the relevant semantic relationships for a given task, retrieval performance will degrade

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: FS-RAG outperforms keyword-based and LLM-generated search term baselines in retrieval effectiveness
- Mechanism: Frame semantic retrieval leverages both the frames invoked by the question and the relations between frames to retrieve relevant facts
- Core assumption: The combination of frames and frame relations provides a more effective search mechanism than keywords or LLM-generated terms alone
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Experiments on the Entailment Bank dataset demonstrate that FS-RAG significantly outperforms keyword-based and LLM-generated search term baselines in retrieval effectiveness, with recall@40 of 0.464 compared to 0.390 and 0.333 respectively."
  - [section 6]: "Overall, we find that frame semantic retrieval outperforms both the simple search based baseline and the baseline where search terms are generated using GPT-4 by a significant margin."
  - [corpus]: Strong evidence - the paper provides empirical results comparing FS-RAG to two baselines on the Entailment Bank dataset
- Break condition: If the LLM used to generate frames or frame relations performs poorly, the overall retrieval performance will suffer

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: FS-RAG is interpretable, allowing for data-driven insights into frame semantics theory
- Mechanism: Each stage of the FS-RAG process outputs frames, enabling analysis and debugging of the retrieval process
- Core assumption: Interpretability is valuable for understanding and improving the retrieval process
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The method's interpretability and potential for data-driven insights into frame semantics theory are highlighted as additional advantages."
  - [section 6]: "Frame semantic indexing and retrieval has one significant advantage. It is the fact that each stage of the process can be improved by fine-tuning LLMs for the specific purpose. In addition, the transparent nature of this process, which outputs frames at each stage, allows for the analysis and 'debugging' of each stage."
  - [corpus]: Moderate evidence - the paper discusses the interpretability of FS-RAG but does not provide concrete examples of how it has been used to gain insights into frame semantics theory
- Break condition: If the frames generated by the LLM are not meaningful or interpretable, the overall interpretability of the system will be compromised

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Frame semantics
  - Why needed here: Frame semantics is the theoretical foundation of FS-RAG, providing a way to index and retrieve facts based on their semantic meaning rather than just keywords
  - Quick check question: What is the main idea behind frame semantics, and how does it differ from traditional keyword-based indexing?

- Concept: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
  - Why needed here: RAG is the broader context in which FS-RAG operates, providing a way to enhance LLM outputs with external knowledge
  - Quick check question: How does RAG work, and what are its main advantages and limitations?

- Concept: Large language models (LLMs)
  - Why needed here: FS-RAG is designed to improve the factual accuracy of LLM outputs by providing relevant external knowledge
  - Quick check question: What are the main challenges associated with using LLMs for factual question answering, and how does FS-RAG aim to address them?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Frame identification -> Frame relations -> Frame semantic retrieval -> LLM generation
- Critical path: Frame identification → Frame relations → Frame semantic retrieval → LLM generation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using LLMs for frame generation and identification introduces a dependency on their performance and interpretability
  - Focusing on a single domain (Entailment Bank) may limit the generalizability of the approach
  - The interpretability of FS-RAG comes at the cost of potentially lower retrieval performance compared to more opaque methods
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor retrieval performance if frames do not capture relevant semantic relationships
  - Uninterpretable or meaningless frames if the LLM used for generation performs poorly
  - Limited generalizability if the approach is too domain-specific
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare FS-RAG to keyword-based retrieval on a small subset of the Entailment Bank dataset
  2. Evaluate the interpretability of the frames generated by the LLM on a sample of facts and questions
  3. Test the impact of using different LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5 vs. GPT-4) on the performance of FS-RAG

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How effective is frame semantic retrieval at reducing hallucinations in large language models across multiple tasks and domains?
- Basis in paper: Explicit
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests frame semantic retrieval on a single task in a specific domain (science questions from school years 4 to 6). The effectiveness of this method across multiple tasks and domains remains unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments on multiple tasks and domains to compare the performance of frame semantic retrieval with other methods in reducing hallucinations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can fine-tuning LLMs specifically for frame generation, frame identification, and frame relation identification significantly improve the effectiveness of frame semantic retrieval?
- Basis in paper: Explicit
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions that each stage of the frame semantic retrieval process can be improved by fine-tuning LLMs for specific purposes, but does not provide evidence of the extent to which this would improve performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments to compare the performance of frame semantic retrieval with and without fine-tuned LLMs for each stage of the process.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of frame semantic retrieval compare to other methods of improving retrieval and reducing hallucinations in large language models, such as question decomposition and chain of thought prompting?
- Basis in paper: Explicit
- Why unresolved: The paper compares the performance of frame semantic retrieval to two search-based baselines, but does not compare it to other methods of improving retrieval and reducing hallucinations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments to compare the performance of frame semantic retrieval with other methods of improving retrieval and reducing hallucinations, such as question decomposition and chain of thought prompting.

## Limitations

- The approach has only been validated on a single domain (science education questions), limiting generalizability claims
- Heavy dependency on GPT-4 for frame generation creates potential bottlenecks and raises questions about reproducibility with different LLM models
- The paper does not demonstrate concrete examples of how the interpretability feature has been used to gain insights into frame semantics theory

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The retrieval effectiveness comparison between FS-RAG and baseline methods (recall@40: 0.464 vs 0.390 and 0.333) is well-supported by experimental results on the Entailment Bank dataset.

**Medium Confidence:** The claim about interpretability enabling data-driven insights into frame semantics theory is theoretically plausible but lacks concrete demonstrations in the paper.

**Low Confidence:** The generalizability of FS-RAG to domains beyond science education questions (Entailment Bank) cannot be established from the current results.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-domain validation:** Test FS-RAG on at least two additional domains (e.g., historical facts, technical documentation) to assess generalizability beyond the Entailment Bank dataset.

2. **Frame quality analysis:** Conduct a systematic evaluation of the interpretability and semantic coherence of frames generated by GPT-4, measuring inter-annotator agreement on frame quality.

3. **Robustness testing:** Evaluate FS-RAG's performance when using different LLM models (GPT-3.5, Claude, or open-source alternatives) for frame generation to determine dependency on specific model capabilities.
