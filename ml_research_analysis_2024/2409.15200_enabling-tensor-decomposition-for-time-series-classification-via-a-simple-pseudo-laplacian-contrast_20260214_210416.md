# Enabling Tensor Decomposition for Time-Series Classification via A Simple Pseudo-Laplacian Contrast

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.15200
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15200
- Reference count: 29
- This paper proposes a Pseudo Laplacian Contrast (PLC) framework that significantly improves time-series classification accuracy by leveraging tensor decomposition non-uniqueness

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of applying tensor decomposition to time-series classification, where traditional approaches fail due to non-uniqueness and rotation invariance. The authors propose a Pseudo Laplacian Contrast (PLC) framework that combines data augmentation with cross-view graph Laplacian to extract class-aware representations while maintaining low-rank structure. The method iteratively learns a pseudo-signed graph through clustering and uses it to enhance feature vectors via contrastive learning. Experimental results on three real-world datasets (HAR, Sleep-EDF, PTB-XL) demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art tensor-based and self-supervised methods, achieving up to 5.35% higher classification accuracy while requiring less training data.

## Method Summary
The PLC framework addresses tensor decomposition non-uniqueness by introducing a pseudo cross-view Laplacian contrast loss. The method performs CP decomposition on 3D STFT tensors, applies class-preserving data augmentation, constructs pseudo graphs through clustering, and iteratively optimizes feature matrices using ALS. The key innovation is using the non-uniqueness property of tensor decomposition as an advantage rather than a limitation, by "rotating" the decomposition to maximize class information preservation while maintaining reconstruction quality. The framework is trained end-to-end with a combined loss function that balances reconstruction error, parameter regularization, and the pseudo cross-view Laplacian contrast.

## Key Results
- PLC achieves up to 5.35% higher classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art tensor-based methods
- The method requires significantly less training data than supervised approaches while maintaining competitive performance
- PLC demonstrates strong scalability, with running time comparable to pure self-supervised methods despite the additional pseudo graph construction step

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Pseudo graph Laplacian contrastive loss leverages non-uniqueness of tensor decomposition to find class-preserving rotations
- Mechanism: Tensor decomposition creates a small epsilon region of equivalent reconstruction loss. Within this region, PLC loss "rotates" the decomposition to maximize class information preservation via cross-view Laplacian penalty
- Core assumption: The epsilon region contains multiple decomposition results with similar reconstruction loss but different class information content
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "non-uniqueness and rotation invariance of tensor decomposition allow us to identify the directions with largest class-variability"
  - [section 3.2]: "the decomposition result is not identifiable and rotation-invariant: firstly, due to the non-uniqueness, the reconstruction loss provides a bunch of non-identifiable decomposition results with a small ϵ region; then, thanks to the rotation-invariance, our pseudo graph contrast is actually 'rotating' the decomposition result to an angel that maps the class pattern to the most while maintaining the same reconstruction loss"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Cross-view Laplacian provides robustness to pseudo graph learning
- Mechanism: Original data and augmented data are decomposed into shared matrices A, B, C but different feature vectors w and ew. The cross-view Laplacian pulls features from the same class across views together while pushing different classes apart
- Core assumption: Augmentation preserves class information while adding noise to improve pseudo graph robustness
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1.2]: "we first introduce class-preserve augmentations that augment data samples in ways that maintain their original class labels...To enhance the robustness of pseudo labeling"
  - [section 3.1.2]: "Since our augmentation doesn't change the class belonging, which means w(n) and ew(n) admit the same class"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Iterative EM-style optimization improves both features and pseudo graph quality
- Mechanism: ALS algorithm alternates between updating mode matrices A, B, C, features W, fW and reconstructing the pseudo graph G via clustering. Better features lead to better pseudo graph, which in turn improves features
- Core assumption: Initial CP decomposition provides reasonable starting point for iterative refinement
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3]: "We apply the alternative least squares (ALS) algorithm to update mode matrices A, B, C, features W, fW iteratively, and then use clustering method for pseudo labeling in an unsupervised manner"
  - [section 4.2]: "Fig. 5 presents the visualization of feature vectors W and pseudo graph G on HAR data...the adjacent matrix of the pseudo graph is progressively approaching the true graph"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Tensor decomposition and CP model
  - Why needed here: The entire framework builds on CP decomposition as the base dimensionality reduction method
  - Quick check question: What are the three mode matrices in CP decomposition and how are they related to the original tensor?

- Concept: Graph Laplacian and its regularization properties
  - Why needed here: Pseudo graph Laplacian is the key mechanism for incorporating class information into the optimization
  - Quick check question: How does the signed graph Laplacian differ from traditional graph Laplacian in terms of edge weights?

- Concept: Contrastive learning and InfoNCE
  - Why needed here: PLC loss is shown to be equivalent to a constrained contrastive learning method with different positive sampling strategy
  - Quick check question: What is the main difference between PLC's positive sampling and InfoNCE's positive sampling?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: CP decomposition → Data augmentation → Pseudo graph construction via clustering → Cross-view Laplacian loss → ALS optimization → Classifier
- Critical path: The iterative loop between feature learning and pseudo graph construction is the critical path
- Design tradeoffs: Using clustering for pseudo labeling trades computational simplicity for potential pseudo label noise
- Failure signatures: Poor classification performance could indicate either bad initial decomposition or poor pseudo graph construction
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify that CP decomposition with only reconstruction loss performs worse than with PLC loss
  2. Test different clustering methods for pseudo graph construction and measure impact on final accuracy
  3. Compare running time and accuracy trade-offs between PLC and pure self-supervised methods on small datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the PLC framework perform when applied to data where class information is not consistent with the underlying low-rank structure?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "However it may not work well when class information is not consistent with the data correlation itself" and suggests more exploration is needed.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tested on datasets where class information aligns with the low-rank structure, and does not provide evidence of performance on datasets with misaligned class information.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying PLC to datasets where class labels do not correspond to the natural data correlations (e.g., random class assignments or adversarial class-labeling) would demonstrate performance degradation or stability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the theoretical upper bound on classification accuracy that PLC can achieve, and how does this compare to supervised tensor decomposition methods?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows PLC has "only a very tiny gap with the upper bound" when comparing to supervised learning with ground truth labels, but does not establish the theoretical limit.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides empirical evidence that PLC approaches supervised performance but does not formally analyze the gap between PLC's theoretical maximum and fully supervised approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal proof or empirical study establishing the information-theoretic limits of PLC's performance relative to fully supervised tensor decomposition methods would clarify the practical value of the unsupervised approach.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How sensitive is the PLC framework to the choice of clustering algorithm for pseudo-label generation, and are there more optimal clustering strategies for specific types of time-series data?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions using "a lite and off-the-shelf clustering method" and states "the quality of the pseudo labeling theoretically highly affects the performance" but does not systematically explore alternative clustering methods.
- Why unresolved: The paper only uses k-means clustering without comparing it to other clustering approaches or investigating data-specific clustering strategies that might better capture class structure in time-series data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments using different clustering algorithms (hierarchical clustering, spectral clustering, DBSCAN, etc.) on the same datasets would reveal which clustering approach works best for PLC and under what conditions.

## Limitations
- Method's reliance on clustering for pseudo graph construction introduces sensitivity to initialization and parameter selection
- Computational complexity scales poorly with tensor rank R, making it less suitable for high-dimensional data
- The augmentation pipeline's effectiveness is not extensively validated across diverse time-series domains

## Confidence
- High confidence: The core mechanism of using pseudo graph Laplacian to address tensor decomposition non-uniqueness
- Medium confidence: The superiority of PLC over existing tensor-based methods
- Low confidence: The claim of "significantly less training data" requirement

## Next Checks
1. Conduct sensitivity analysis on clustering hyperparameters and augmentation parameters to establish robustness bounds
2. Evaluate scalability by testing on larger tensors with higher rank R and measuring computational overhead
3. Perform cross-domain validation by applying PLC to additional time-series classification tasks beyond the three presented datasets
