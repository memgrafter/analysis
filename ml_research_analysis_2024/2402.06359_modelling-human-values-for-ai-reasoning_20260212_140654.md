# Modelling Human Values for AI Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.06359
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06359
- Reference count: 40
- First formal computational model for representing human values in AI systems

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the first formal computational model for representing human values that enables AI systems to reason about value alignment. The model uses value taxonomies structured as directed acyclic graphs, where abstract value concepts are grounded in concrete property nodes with importance measures. It supports reasoning about individual and collective values, context-dependent value changes, and assessment of value alignment for behaviors. The work provides a foundation for building AI systems that can support informed, value-aligned decision-making for individuals and organizations.

## Method Summary
The method constructs value taxonomies using directed acyclic graphs where nodes represent either abstract value concepts or concrete property specifications. Importance measures are attached to each node and propagated through the taxonomy to ensure coherence. Context-based variants of general taxonomies are created by updating importance measures based on contextual properties. Value alignment is computed by aggregating property satisfaction weighted by importance across the taxonomy. The approach is grounded in social psychology research and demonstrated through a running example of a mutual aid app.

## Key Results
- Formal computational model for representing human values using DAG-based taxonomies
- Mechanism for context-dependent value changes through importance measure updates
- Method for assessing value alignment by weighted aggregation of property satisfaction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Formal value taxonomies enable computational reasoning about abstract human values by grounding them in concrete, verifiable properties.
- Mechanism: The model represents values as directed acyclic graphs where abstract concepts (label nodes) are connected to property nodes that specify measurable conditions. This structure allows algorithms to evaluate behavior alignment by checking property satisfaction weighted by importance measures.
- Core assumption: Property nodes can be formally specified in a way that their satisfaction can be automatically verified.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The model uses value taxonomies with nodes for abstract value concepts and grounding semantics, along with importance measures."
  - [section] "We model value importance by attaching a measure of importance to each node... property nodes introduce the foundations for linking abstract value concepts to concrete computational constructs."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus papers focus on LLMs and decision-making but don't address formal value representation mechanisms.
- Break condition: If property specifications cannot be automatically verified or if value semantics cannot be meaningfully grounded in observable properties.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Context-based value taxonomies allow values to evolve dynamically while maintaining structural coherence through importance propagation.
- Mechanism: The model creates context-specific variants of general value taxonomies by updating importance measures based on context properties. A propagation algorithm ensures coherence by calculating parent node importance as an aggregation of child node importance.
- Core assumption: Importance measures can be meaningfully propagated through the taxonomy while maintaining coherent relationships.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "It supports reasoning about individual and collective values, context-dependent value changes..."
  - [section] "The importance of nodes in the context-based taxonomy Vc is independent of the importance of those nodes in the general taxonomy V."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus papers discuss temporal aspects of behavior but don't address dynamic value taxonomy evolution.
- Break condition: If context properties cannot be reliably detected or if importance propagation produces incoherent or counterintuitive results.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Value alignment can be formally computed as a weighted aggregation of property satisfaction across the value taxonomy.
- Mechanism: The alignment function calculates the degree to which behavior satisfies property nodes, weighted by their importance, and aggregates these weighted scores. This provides a quantitative measure of how well behavior aligns with the value system.
- Core assumption: Property satisfaction can be meaningfully quantified and aggregated across diverse value dimensions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "methods for assessing value alignment"
  - [section] "The alignment of an entity e's behaviour with a context-based value taxonomy Vc is then defined accordingly... an aggregation of the satisfaction of all property nodes..."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus papers focus on LLM decision-making but don't address formal value alignment computation.
- Break condition: If property satisfaction cannot be meaningfully quantified or if the aggregation function produces results that don't reflect intuitive value alignment.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)
  - Why needed here: Value taxonomies are structured as DAGs to represent hierarchical relationships between value concepts while allowing multiple inheritance paths.
  - Quick check question: What property must a graph have to prevent circular value definitions in a taxonomy?

- Concept: Aggregation Operators
  - Why needed here: Aggregation functions combine importance measures from child nodes to compute parent node importance while maintaining coherence properties like symmetry and monotonicity.
  - Quick check question: Why can't we simply sum child importance values when computing parent importance?

- Concept: Property Satisfaction
  - Why needed here: Property nodes ground abstract values in concrete, verifiable conditions that can be evaluated algorithmically.
  - Quick check question: What makes a property node different from a label node in the value taxonomy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Value Taxonomy Builder -> Context Detector -> Importance Propagator -> Property Evaluator -> Alignment Calculator -> Visualization Module

- Critical path:
  1. Load general value taxonomy
  2. Detect current context
  3. Create context-based taxonomy with updated importance measures
  4. Evaluate behavior against property nodes
  5. Compute value alignment score
  6. Return alignment assessment with explanation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Expressiveness vs. computational complexity: More expressive property languages enable richer value specifications but increase evaluation cost
  - Granularity vs. usability: Finer-grained property nodes provide more precise alignment assessment but may overwhelm users
  - Fixed vs. dynamic structure: Static taxonomies are simpler but cannot adapt to evolving value understanding

- Failure signatures:
  - Importance propagation produces negative values or values outside expected range
  - Property evaluation fails due to undefined variables or unsatisfiable conditions
  - Alignment scores are uniformly high or low regardless of behavior changes
  - Context detection produces ambiguous or conflicting results

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple taxonomy with 3-4 value concepts and test importance propagation with manually specified values
  2. Create a property evaluation engine for propositional logic properties and verify satisfaction computation
  3. Build a context-based taxonomy generator and test with simulated context property changes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What formal mechanisms could be developed to model the relationship between values and affect in AI systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that values are "inextricably linked to affect" and that "when values are activated, they become infused with feeling," but acknowledges this link needs further investigation.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies this as an important research direction but does not propose specific computational approaches for modeling affect-value relationships.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal computational model that demonstrates how emotional states can influence value prioritization and decision-making in AI agents.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can AI systems effectively learn property nodes (grounding semantics) for abstract values from stakeholder interactions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies this as a key research goal but notes it's a challenging task requiring either stakeholder specification or AI learning mechanisms.
- Why unresolved: While the paper discusses the need for property nodes to enable computational reasoning, it doesn't provide concrete approaches for their automatic generation or learning.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrated algorithms or methods that can automatically generate valid property nodes from stakeholder interactions or data.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the optimal aggregation mechanisms for combining individual value taxonomies into collective value systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the challenge of moving from individual to collective value systems and mentions computational social choice approaches but identifies this as an open research area.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges various approaches (negotiation, argumentation, social choice) but doesn't determine which is most effective or how to handle conflicts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies or formal proofs demonstrating the effectiveness of different aggregation mechanisms under various conditions.

## Limitations
- Effectiveness depends heavily on quality of property specifications and importance measures
- Formal mechanisms for propagating importance rely on aggregation functions whose properties may not always hold
- Assumes property satisfaction can be reliably verified, which may be challenging for complex value expressions

## Confidence
- Formal value taxonomy construction: Medium
- Context-based importance propagation: Low
- Value alignment computation: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test importance propagation with edge cases (e.g., conflicting importance values, missing parent/child assignments) to verify coherence properties
2. Evaluate property specification expressiveness by attempting to capture diverse value concepts from Schwartz's theory
3. Conduct user studies comparing model-generated alignment scores with human judgments of value-behavior alignment
