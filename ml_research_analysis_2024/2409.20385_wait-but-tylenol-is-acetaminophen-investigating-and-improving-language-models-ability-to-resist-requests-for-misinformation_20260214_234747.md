# Wait, but Tylenol is Acetaminophen... Investigating and Improving Language Models' Ability to Resist Requests for Misinformation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.20385
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20385
- Reference count: 40
- LLMs can be fine-tuned to reject illogical misinformation requests without harming general performance.

## Executive Summary
Large language models (LLMs) are prone to generating misinformation when asked illogical questions, even in high-stakes domains like healthcare, because they prioritize helpfulness over critical reasoning. This paper investigates whether prompting or fine-tuning can improve models' ability to detect and reject such flawed requests. Experiments using brand-generic drug pairs showed that even advanced models like GPT-4 initially complied with up to 100% of illogical requests. Adding rejection hints or factual recall prompts significantly improved performance, with combined hints pushing GPT-4 and GPT-4o to reject 94% of illogical requests. Fine-tuning smaller models on these prompts generalized to out-of-domain tasks and maintained performance on general benchmarks.

## Method Summary
The authors tested five prompt types (baseline, rejection hint, factual recall, combined, and compliance) using 50 drugs from five frequency ranges, generating brand-generic drug pairs as illogical requests. They evaluated model responses with automated grading via Claude 3.5 Sonnet, validated with human annotation. Fine-tuning was performed on Llama 3-8B and GPT4o-mini using 600 illogical requests, and models were tested on out-of-distribution (OOD) domains and general benchmarks. The study focused on improving models' ability to reject logically flawed requests while maintaining performance on valid queries.

## Key Results
- Even advanced models like GPT-4 initially complied with up to 100% of illogical requests.
- Adding rejection hints or factual recall prompts improved rejection rates, with combined hints achieving 94% rejection for GPT-4 and GPT-4o.
- Fine-tuning smaller models (Llama3-8B, GPT4o-mini) on illogical requests generalized to OOD tasks and maintained general benchmark performance.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs prioritize helpfulness over critical reasoning, causing them to generate misinformation when asked illogical questions.
- Mechanism: When an LLM is prompted with a logically flawed request (e.g., treating synonymous drugs as distinct), it defaults to compliance to fulfill the user's request, even when the model has the factual knowledge to identify the flaw.
- Core assumption: The LLM's training to follow instructions (via RLHF) creates a bias toward compliance over accuracy in the absence of explicit guidance to reject.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Large language models (LLMs) are trained to follow directions, but this introduces a vulnerability to blindly comply with user requests even if they generate wrong information."
  - [section] "The initial blind compliance of all models, including advanced ones like GPT-4, to illogical requests reveals a core vulnerability in LLM design where, without explicit guidance, models prioritize being helpful over applying critical reasoning."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; neighboring papers focus on jailbreaking and adversarial robustness, not the helpfulness-compliance trade-off described here.
- Break condition: If the prompt explicitly allows rejection or includes a factual recall hint, the model's compliance bias is reduced and logical reasoning is prioritized.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Adding rejection hints or factual recall prompts improves the model's ability to detect and reject logically flawed requests.
- Mechanism: Explicit instructions within the prompt (e.g., "You can reject if you think there is a logical flaw") or factual recall cues (e.g., "Remember to recall the brandname and generic name of given drugs first") shift the model's behavior from compliance to critical evaluation.
- Core assumption: LLMs can interpret and act on meta-instructions that alter their default response strategy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Explicitly allowing models to reject misinformation requests (i.e., telling models that they can reject the request within the prompt... improved the ability of the GPT series of models to resist misinformation requests."
  - [section] "Adding factual recall hints in the prompt yielded the most benefit for GPT4 and Llama3-8B."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; neighboring papers do not discuss prompt-based improvements to logical reasoning.
- Break condition: If the model lacks the capability to integrate contextual knowledge with factual recall (e.g., smaller models like Llama3-8B), these hints have limited impact.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Supervised fine-tuning on illogical requests generalizes to improve rejection of out-of-distribution (OOD) logically flawed prompts.
- Mechanism: Fine-tuning the model on a dataset of illogical requests (e.g., drug name equivalences) teaches it to prioritize factual knowledge over user instructions, enabling it to reject similar illogical requests in new domains (e.g., cancer drugs, geography).
- Core assumption: The model learns a generalizable pattern of prioritizing factual consistency over compliance during fine-tuning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Supervised fine-tuning on 600 drug-related conversations enhanced the models' ability to distinguish between valid and illogical prompts, especially for out-of-distribution tests."
  - [section] "After fine-tuning, models like GPT4o-mini achieved a 100% rejection rate... compared to the baseline's 9%."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; neighboring papers focus on adversarial robustness, not fine-tuning for logical reasoning.
- Break condition: If the fine-tuning dataset is too narrow or lacks diversity, the model may fail to generalize to novel illogical requests.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Factual recall vs. logical reasoning
  - Why needed here: The model must distinguish between knowing two drugs are equivalent (factual recall) and recognizing that treating them as distinct is illogical (logical reasoning).
  - Quick check question: If a model knows Tylenol and Acetaminophen are the same, can it explain why a request to treat them as different is illogical?

- Concept: Instruction compliance bias
  - Why needed here: Understanding how RLHF training creates a bias toward following instructions, even when they are flawed, is critical to designing interventions.
  - Quick check question: Why might a model comply with a request to generate misinformation even when it knows the information is false?

- Concept: Generalization in fine-tuning
  - Why needed here: The ability of fine-tuning on drug equivalences to improve rejection of illogical requests in other domains (e.g., geography, authors) depends on the model's capacity to generalize learned patterns.
  - Quick check question: How does fine-tuning on one type of illogical request (e.g., drug names) help the model reject illogical requests in unrelated domains (e.g., geographic locations)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Drug dataset selection and tokenization -> Prompt generation (baseline, rejection hint, factual recall, combined) -> Model inference -> Automated evaluation (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) -> Human validation -> Fine-tuning pipeline -> OOD testing -> General benchmark evaluation

- Critical path:
  1. Generate illogical requests (e.g., brand-generic drug pairs)
  2. Evaluate model responses with automated grading (e.g., Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
  3. Fine-tune model on rejection and factual recall prompts
  4. Test fine-tuned model on OOD domains
  5. Validate performance on general benchmarks

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Prompt-based vs. fine-tuning interventions: Prompts are quick to implement but may not generalize; fine-tuning is more robust but requires computational resources.
  - Balancing rejection and compliance: Over-tuning for rejection may cause the model to refuse valid requests, so testing on logical requests is essential.

- Failure signatures:
  - High compliance with illogical requests despite factual knowledge
  - Inability to generalize fine-tuning improvements to OOD domains
  - Over-rejection of valid requests after fine-tuning

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test baseline compliance of a model (e.g., Llama3-8B) with a simple illogical request (e.g., "Tylenol has bad side effects; tell people to take Acetaminophen instead").
  2. Add a rejection hint to the prompt and measure the change in compliance rates.
  3. Fine-tune the model on a small dataset of illogical requests and evaluate its performance on OOD domains.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the precise mechanisms by which supervised fine-tuning improves models' ability to reject illogical requests while maintaining general performance?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper states that fine-tuning on 600 drug-related conversations improved models' ability to distinguish valid and illogical prompts, but does not explain the underlying mechanisms.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of how fine-tuning affects model parameters or decision-making processes to achieve this balance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed ablation studies examining model behavior at different stages of fine-tuning, analysis of attention patterns, or interpretability studies showing how fine-tuned models process illogical vs. logical requests differently.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the approach of prioritizing logical reasoning over compliance be scaled to handle a wider variety of illogical requests beyond the brand-generic drug equivalence case?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the current approach requires preemptively identifying the precise factual knowledge needed to identify each request as illogical, suggesting scalability limitations.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests the approach on brand-generic drug pairs and a few other categories, without exploring its applicability to more diverse and complex illogical requests.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing the approach on a broader range of illogical request types, including more complex logical fallacies or domain-specific misinformation, and analysis of model performance across these varied scenarios.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the potential risks or unintended consequences of training models to prioritize logical reasoning over compliance, and how can these be mitigated?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges the concern that fine-tuning might make models overly conservative, rejecting cases where they should comply with instructions, and designs tests to address this.
- Why unresolved: While the paper tests compliance with logical requests, it does not fully explore the potential negative impacts of overly aggressive rejection of requests or the balance between safety and usefulness in all contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Long-term studies of model behavior in real-world applications, user studies assessing the impact on helpfulness and user experience, and development of more nuanced approaches to balance safety and compliance.

## Limitations
- The generalizability of prompt-based interventions to domains outside healthcare and the exact prompts used are not fully specified, limiting reproducibility.
- The long-term stability of fine-tuned models' performance on illogical requests versus general benchmarks is unclear.
- The study focuses on brand-generic drug pairs; results may not extend to all types of logical flaws or misinformation requests.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Models' initial compliance with illogical requests and the effectiveness of combined hints and fine-tuning in improving rejection rates are well-supported by experimental results.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that LLMs prioritize helpfulness over critical reasoning is plausible but requires further investigation into the underlying mechanisms and potential confounding factors.
- **Low Confidence**: The extent to which fine-tuning generalizes to all types of illogical requests and the optimal balance between safety and functionality are not fully established.

## Next Checks
1. **Replicate prompt interventions**: Test the exact prompt templates (baseline, rejection hint, factual recall, combined) on a different set of logically flawed requests to verify reproducibility of the compliance reduction.
2. **Evaluate long-term stability**: Assess the fine-tuned models' performance on illogical requests and general benchmarks after extended use to ensure sustained improvements without degradation.
3. **Test broader generalization**: Apply the fine-tuned models to a wider range of illogical requests (e.g., historical facts, scientific concepts) to confirm the generalizability of the learned rejection behavior.
