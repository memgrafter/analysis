# Graph Neural Networks for Emulation of Finite-Element Ice Dynamics in Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.18423
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18423
- Authors: Younghyun Koo; Maryam Rahnemoonfar
- Reference count: 16
- Key outcome: EGCN achieves ice thickness RMSE of 27.55 m and 14.75 m for Helheim Glacier and PIG, respectively, with R-values greater than 0.999, while being 260x and 44x faster than ISSM.

## Executive Summary
This study introduces an equivariant graph convolutional network (EGCN) to emulate finite-element ice dynamics in Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. The EGCN preserves equivariance to translation and rotation in graph structures, making it particularly effective for modeling ice sheet deformation. Trained on transient simulation data from the Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model (ISSM), the EGCN outperforms traditional CNN and GCN approaches in predicting ice thickness and velocity while achieving significant computational speedups.

## Method Summary
The study employs three deep learning models—EGCN, GCN, and CNN—to emulate ice sheet dynamics using transient simulation data from ISSM for Helheim Glacier and Pine Island Glacier. The models are trained to predict ice thickness and velocity changes, with performance evaluated using RMSE and R-value metrics. EGCN's architecture is specifically designed to preserve equivariance through message passing across all nodes, while GCN and CNN serve as comparative baselines. The models are tested on datasets with varying calving and melting parameters to assess generalization.

## Key Results
- EGCN achieves ice thickness RMSE of 27.55 m (Helheim) and 14.75 m (PIG) with R-values > 0.999
- EGCN outperforms GCN and CNN in accuracy, particularly near fast ice streams
- Computational speedup of 260x (Helheim) and 44x (PIG) compared to ISSM
- EGCN preserves equivariance to translation and rotation, improving generalization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: EGCN preserves equivariance to translation and rotation of graph structures, enabling accurate ice thickness prediction near fast ice streams
- Mechanism: By using position embeddings and message passing from all nodes rather than spatial distance-based weighting, EGCN maintains geometric consistency when the ice sheet deforms, leading to better generalization
- Core assumption: Ice sheet deformation is a continuous transformation that preserves local geometric relationships
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "EGCN shows outstanding accuracy in thickness prediction near fast ice streams by preserving the equivariance to the translation and rotation of graphs"; [section]: "EGCN uses the message passing from all nodes to preserve the equivariance of the entire graph"
- Break condition: If ice sheet deformation involves discontinuous changes or topological changes that break geometric relationships

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Graph representation of unstructured meshes enables better representation of boundary conditions and variable resolution compared to regular grids
- Mechanism: GNNs operate directly on the graph structure of finite-element meshes, preserving fine resolution near fast ice streams and coarser resolution in static regions without interpolation artifacts
- Core assumption: The spatial distribution of computational resources in finite-element models reflects the physical importance of different regions
- Evidence anchors: [section]: "ISSM and GNN emulators use irregular meshes, which assign a finer resolution for fast ice and a coarser resolution for static ice, they can describe the ice boundaries more accurately with fine resolutions"; [section]: "Since FCN uses the interpolated 1-km regular grid for all points without any adjustment to ice velocity, FCN inhibits delineating boundary conditions in a fine resolution"
- Break condition: If the finite-element mesh resolution is too coarse in critical regions to capture important dynamics

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: EGCN's architecture allows better prediction of ice thickness changes induced by ice velocity through learned spatial embeddings
- Mechanism: The coordinate embeddings (x-components) are used to predict hidden feature embeddings (ice thickness), creating a direct link between deformation and thickness evolution
- Core assumption: Ice thickness changes are directly related to the displacement caused by ice flow
- Evidence anchors: [section]: "Additionally, we highlight that GNN emulators outperform traditional FCN. Since FCN uses the interpolated 1-km regular grid for all points without any adjustment to ice velocity, FCN inhibits delineating boundary conditions in a fine resolution, leading to significant errors"; [section]: "Additionally, we highlight that GNN emulators outperform traditional FCN. Since FCN uses the interpolated 1-km regular grid for all points without any adjustment to ice velocity, FCN inhibits delineating boundary conditions in a fine resolution, leading to significant errors"
- Break condition: If ice thickness changes are dominated by processes unrelated to ice flow (e.g., basal melting in certain contexts)

## Foundational Learning

- Graph Neural Networks:
  - Why needed here: Ice sheet models use unstructured meshes that can be represented as graphs, making GNNs more suitable than CNNs which require regular grids
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between how GNNs and CNNs process data structures?

- Equivariance in Deep Learning:
  - Why needed here: Ice sheet dynamics involve continuous transformations (translation and rotation) that should preserve certain properties in the model's predictions
  - Quick check question: How does preserving equivariance help a model generalize to different ice sheet configurations?

- Finite Element Methods in Ice Sheet Modeling:
  - Why needed here: Understanding how ISSM uses adaptive mesh refinement helps explain why graph-based approaches can capture the same computational efficiency
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of adaptive mesh refinement in finite element ice sheet models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input layer → 5 EGCN layers (with message passing) → Output layer → Ice dynamics prediction
- Critical path: Graph → Input layer → 5 EGCN layers (with message passing) → Output layer → Ice dynamics prediction
- Design tradeoffs:
  - EGCN vs GCN: EGCN preserves equivariance but is computationally more expensive (759s vs 201s for Helheim)
  - EGCN vs CNN: EGCN handles unstructured meshes natively, while CNN requires interpolation to regular grids
  - Model complexity: 5 layers with 128 features each provides good balance between accuracy and computational cost
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor accuracy on test datasets with different calving/melting parameters suggests overfitting
  - Large error near ice stream boundaries indicates insufficient mesh resolution capture
  - Computational time approaching ISSM suggests architectural inefficiency
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train EGCN on Helheim Glacier data with only 2 EGCN layers to test minimum architecture requirements
  2. Compare EGCN and GCN predictions on a simplified synthetic ice sheet with known ground truth
  3. Test EGCN's ability to generalize to unseen calving/melting parameter values by training on a subset of parameters

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Limitations

- Data Generalization Gap: Uncertainty about EGCN's performance on ice sheet configurations or climate scenarios outside the training range of SMB and ocean thermal forcing values
- Computational Efficiency Claims: Speedup comparisons depend on specific ISSM configuration and may vary with different mesh resolutions or simulation complexities
- Physical Interpretability: Relationship between learned embeddings and actual ice dynamics mechanisms remains unclear and unvalidated

## Confidence

- High Confidence: Claims about EGCN's superior accuracy compared to CNN and GCN on specific test datasets (RMSE 27.55 m and 14.75 m, R > 0.999)
- Medium Confidence: Claims about EGCN's computational efficiency and equivariance preservation properties
- Low Confidence: Claims about EGCN's general applicability to all ice sheet configurations and physical interpretability

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate EGCN performance on ice sheet configurations with SMB and ocean thermal forcing values outside the training range to assess true generalization capability

2. Test EGCN's performance across different finite-element mesh resolutions to verify that computational efficiency claims hold across varying levels of discretization complexity

3. Compare EGCN's learned embeddings with physically-based features from ISSM to establish interpretability and validate that the model captures the correct ice sheet dynamics mechanisms
