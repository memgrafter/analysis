# Multimodal Fusion on Low-quality Data: A Comprehensive Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.18947
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18947
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Comprehensive survey categorizing challenges and methods for multimodal learning on low-quality data

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a systematic investigation of multimodal learning challenges arising from low-quality data, organizing them into four fundamental categories: noisy, incomplete, imbalanced, and quality-varying data. The authors present a detailed taxonomy of existing methods to address these challenges, covering joint variation-based fusion for noise reduction, imputation-based and imputation-free methods for incomplete data, balanced multimodal learning techniques for imbalanced data, and dynamic fusion strategies for quality-varying data. The survey emphasizes the importance of developing robust multimodal learning methods that can handle real-world data imperfections and identifies promising research directions in this field.

## Method Summary
The survey synthesizes existing research on multimodal fusion methods designed to handle various data quality issues. It categorizes methods into joint variation-based approaches that leverage multiple modalities for noise reduction, imputation-based and imputation-free techniques for handling missing data, balanced learning strategies for addressing class imbalance, and dynamic fusion approaches that adapt to varying data quality. The authors provide implementation guidance through their taxonomy, suggesting that researchers can select appropriate methods based on the specific quality challenges present in their data. Minimum viable reproduction involves selecting benchmark multimodal datasets with known quality issues, implementing baseline and advanced fusion methods from each category, and evaluating performance across different quality scenarios.

## Key Results
- Multimodal fusion can leverage complementary information across modalities to mitigate noise and improve robustness through joint variation-based methods
- Imputation-based methods can recover missing modality information by learning relationships between available modalities
- Dynamic fusion strategies can adapt to varying quality of modalities across different samples, enhancing robustness and performance
- The survey provides a comprehensive taxonomy covering approaches for all four main quality challenges: noisy, incomplete, imbalanced, and quality-varying data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multimodal fusion can leverage complementary information across modalities to mitigate the influence of noise and improve robustness.
- Mechanism: When multiple modalities are integrated, the correlation between them can be exploited to identify and reduce noise. Joint variation-based fusion methods use total variation models to denoise multimodal images by optimizing over multiple modalities simultaneously, allowing the model to suppress noise that is inconsistent across modalities.
- Core assumption: Different modalities capture overlapping information, and noise patterns are not perfectly correlated across modalities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Multimodal data [15] noise can arise from sensor errors [16], environmental interference, or transmission losses... To make things worse, weakly aligned or even unaligned multimodal samples are also commonly presented, which can be seen as more complex noise that lies in a higher-level semantic space."
  - [section] "Joint optimization is often used in variation-based noise reduction when fusing multiple visual modalities, e.g., RGB and thermal. In unimodal noise reduction field, taking image modality as an example, classical denoise model based on Total Variation (TV) is equivalent to solving the following optimization problems: min ZZ [u(x, y) − u0(x, y)]2 dxdy + λ ZZ |▽u(x, y)| dxdy"
  - [corpus] Weak, no direct mention of joint variation-based noise reduction methods.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Imputation-based methods can recover missing modality information by leveraging the relationships between available modalities.
- Mechanism: For incomplete multimodal data, methods can impute missing modalities either by directly filling in missing values or by learning to generate the missing data using available modalities. Learning-based imputation methods, such as those using generative adversarial networks (GANs) or matrix factorization, can recover missing modalities by exploiting the common representation learned from available modalities.
- Core assumption: There exists a meaningful relationship between modalities that can be learned to impute missing data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "For the incomplete multimodal data, a natural approach to address the missing modality learning issue is to directly impute the missing modalities or related missing information in the kernels or graphs constructed from the data as shown in Fig. 2."
  - [section] "VIGAN (View Imputation via Generative Adversarial Network) [58] is a pioneering work based on generative adversarial network (GAN) and Autoencoder for missing modality recovery. VIGAN employs GAN to initialize the missing modality according to another modality of the same sample and then uses denoise Autoencoder to refine the recovered missing modalities."
  - [corpus] Weak, no direct mention of GAN-based or matrix factorization-based imputation methods.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Dynamic fusion strategies can adapt to varying quality of modalities across different samples, enhancing robustness and performance.
- Mechanism: Dynamic fusion methods adjust the contribution of each modality based on its quality or reliability for a given sample. This can be achieved through attention mechanisms that weigh modalities differently or uncertainty-aware methods that model the uncertainty of each modality's prediction. Uncertainty-aware methods can use entropy or Gaussian distributions to measure the uncertainty of each modality and dynamically adjust fusion weights accordingly.
- Core assumption: The quality of modalities varies across samples, and this variation can be effectively measured and utilized for dynamic fusion.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The fourth fundamental challenge is how to adapt the quality dynamically varying nature of multimodal data. In practice, the quality of one modality often varies for different samples due to unforeseeable environmental factors or sensor issues."
  - [section] "Uncertainty-aware methods... can use entropy or Gaussian distributions to measure the uncertainty of each modality and dynamically adjust fusion weights accordingly."
  - [corpus] Weak, no direct mention of entropy or Gaussian distribution-based uncertainty estimation methods.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Total Variation (TV) denoising
  - Why needed here: TV denoising is a foundational technique used in joint variation-based fusion methods to reduce noise in multimodal data by promoting piecewise smoothness.
  - Quick check question: What is the mathematical formulation of the total variation denoising model for a single image?

- Concept: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
  - Why needed here: GANs are used in learning-based imputation methods to generate missing modality data by learning the distribution of available modalities.
  - Quick check question: How do GANs work, and what are the key components of a GAN architecture?

- Concept: Attention mechanisms
  - Why needed here: Attention mechanisms are used in dynamic fusion methods to weigh the contribution of each modality based on its importance or reliability for a given sample.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between self-attention and cross-attention, and how are they used in multimodal fusion?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing -> Modality encoders -> Fusion module -> Decoder/prediction head
- Critical path: Data preprocessing → Modality encoders → Fusion module → Decoder/prediction head
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model complexity vs. interpretability: More complex fusion strategies may achieve better performance but are harder to interpret
  - Generalization vs. overfitting: Models should be robust to variations in data quality but not overfit to specific noise patterns
  - Computational cost vs. accuracy: More sophisticated fusion methods may require more computational resources
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on samples with high-quality modalities: Indicates over-reliance on low-quality modalities
  - Inability to handle missing modalities: Suggests issues with imputation or fusion strategies
  - Sensitivity to noise: Implies inadequate noise reduction mechanisms
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the performance of joint variation-based fusion methods on multimodal image denoising tasks
  2. Assess the effectiveness of learning-based imputation methods for recovering missing modality information in incomplete multimodal datasets
  3. Test the robustness of dynamic fusion strategies in scenarios with varying quality of modalities across different samples

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Many specific method implementations are not detailed, making exact reproduction difficult
- The evaluation protocols for quality-varying scenarios across different modalities remain unspecified
- The survey does not provide quantitative benchmarks comparing different approaches under controlled quality degradation scenarios

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The categorization of four main quality challenges (noisy, incomplete, imbalanced, quality-varying) is well-supported by the literature and represents a consensus view in the field.

**Medium Confidence:** The taxonomy of solution approaches is reasonably comprehensive, but the relative effectiveness of different methods within each category is not well-established due to lack of systematic comparative studies.

**Low Confidence:** Specific implementation details for advanced methods like DUA-Net, TMC, or OGM-GE are not provided, and their performance claims cannot be independently verified without access to original implementations.

## Next Checks

1. **Benchmark Implementation Study:** Implement three representative methods from different categories (e.g., joint variation-based, imputation-based, and dynamic fusion) on a standardized multimodal dataset with controlled quality degradation. Compare their performance across all four quality challenge types using consistent metrics.

2. **Quality-Robustness Analysis:** Systematically vary the quality parameters (noise levels, missing data ratios, class imbalance ratios, quality variance) and measure how each fusion strategy's performance degrades. This would identify which methods are most robust to specific quality issues.

3. **Transferability Assessment:** Test whether fusion methods trained on high-quality data can effectively handle low-quality scenarios, and vice versa. This would validate the survey's claim that multimodal fusion can leverage complementary information to improve robustness across quality variations.
