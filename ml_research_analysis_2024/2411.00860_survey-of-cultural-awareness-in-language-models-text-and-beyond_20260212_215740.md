# Survey of Cultural Awareness in Language Models: Text and Beyond

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2411.00860
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00860
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: This survey consolidates recent research on cultural inclusion in large language models (LLMs) across text, vision, and other modalities. It identifies two main approaches for achieving cultural awareness: training-based methods (pre-training, fine-tuning, and instruction-tuning with culturally relevant data) and training-free methods (prompts and sociodemographic conditioning).

## Executive Summary
This comprehensive survey examines cultural awareness in language models across text, vision, and multimodal domains. The authors consolidate recent research on cultural inclusion in LLMs and identify two primary approaches for achieving cultural awareness: training-based methods that embed cultural knowledge through culturally relevant data, and training-free methods that adapt model behavior through prompts and sociodemographic conditioning. The survey highlights significant gaps in current research, particularly the overrepresentation of WEIRD cultures in datasets and evaluation benchmarks, and calls for more inclusive data collection strategies and interdisciplinary collaboration.

## Method Summary
The survey analyzed 300+ papers from major AI conferences (ACL, EMNLP, ICLR, ICML, ICCV, CVPR) and Arxiv, focusing on cultural alignment methodologies in LLMs. The authors categorized cultural elements into eight domains and examined both text-based and multimodal approaches to cultural awareness. The research methodology included systematic review of data sources, creation methodologies for cultural alignment datasets, and evaluation frameworks for cultural competence across academic knowledge, commonsense knowledge, social values, norms and morals, bias and stereotypes, toxicity and safety, and linguistics.

## Key Results
- Two main approaches for cultural awareness: training-based (pre-training, fine-tuning, instruction-tuning with culturally relevant data) and training-free (prompts and sociodemographic conditioning)
- Significant research gaps exist in low-resource languages and cultures, with most studies focusing on WEIRD countries
- Current evaluation benchmarks heavily rely on multiple-choice questions and lack robust metrics for assessing cultural understanding in real-world, conversational contexts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Cultural alignment is achieved through either training-based methods (pre-training, fine-tuning, instruction-tuning with culturally relevant data) or training-free methods (prompting and sociodemographic conditioning).
- Mechanism: Training-based methods embed cultural knowledge directly into the model by using culturally relevant data during pre-training or fine-tuning. Training-free methods adapt model behavior without retraining by using culturally specific prompts or sociodemographic information to guide responses.
- Core assumption: Embedding or conditioning on cultural data improves model performance on culturally sensitive tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "This survey consolidates recent research on cultural inclusion in large language models (LLMs) across text, vision, and other modalities. It identifies two main approaches for achieving cultural awareness: training-based methods (pre-training, fine-tuning, and instruction-tuning with culturally relevant data) and training-free methods (prompts and sociodemographic conditioning)."
  - [section]: "Cultural alignment can be done through two approaches: training-based (§4.1.1) and training-free (§4.1.2)."
- Break condition: If the culturally relevant data used in training is insufficient, biased, or unrepresentative, the model may not learn accurate cultural nuances. Similarly, if prompts or sociodemographic conditioning are not well-designed, they may lead to stereotypical or inappropriate outputs.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Cultural awareness in language models requires understanding both the context in which a task is performed and how cultural elements of the task vary across cultures.
- Mechanism: Models first recognize the social context of a task (e.g., where it is deployed, what is the end goal) and then interpret the cultural elements of the task based on that context. This involves cultural competence and the ability to understand variance in cultural elements across different cultures.
- Core assumption: Context recognition is necessary for appropriate cultural interpretation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Cultural awareness also includes the ability to understand the variance of cultural elements across different cultures. Understating the cultural context consists of two things: (a) Recognizing the social context in which a task is performed and (b) based on the context, interpreting different elements of the task."
- Break condition: If the model cannot accurately recognize the social context, it may misinterpret cultural elements, leading to inappropriate or irrelevant responses. Additionally, if the model lacks sufficient cultural knowledge, it may not be able to interpret cultural elements correctly even with context recognition.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Effective evaluation of cultural awareness in language models requires benchmarks and evaluation frameworks that measure alignment with diverse cultural contexts.
- Mechanism: Benchmarks and evaluation frameworks are developed to assess cultural elements through various tasks, such as academic knowledge, commonsense knowledge, social values, social norms and morals, social bias and stereotypes, toxicity and safety, and emotional and subjective topics. These benchmarks often use multiple-choice questions or short-answer questions that require cultural knowledge.
- Core assumption: Well-designed benchmarks can accurately measure a model's cultural awareness.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Furthermore, there is increasing attention toward developing benchmarks and evaluation frameworks that measure how well LLMs align with diverse cultural contexts."
  - [section]: "In this section, we provide an overview of various benchmarks designed to assess cultural elements through text-based tasks. The cultural elements are categorized into eight domains as specified in Figure 3."
- Break condition: If the benchmarks are not comprehensive or do not cover a wide range of cultures, they may not accurately measure a model's cultural awareness. Additionally, if the evaluation methods are not robust or culturally sensitive, they may lead to biased or inaccurate assessments.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data collection and preprocessing -> Model training and fine-tuning (for training-based methods) -> Prompt engineering and sociodemographic conditioning (for training-free methods) -> Benchmark and evaluation framework development -> Cultural context recognition

- Critical path:
  1. Data collection and preprocessing
  2. Model training and fine-tuning (for training-based methods)
  3. Prompt engineering and sociodemographic conditioning (for training-free methods)
  4. Benchmark and evaluation framework development
  5. Cultural context recognition

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Training-based vs. training-free methods: Training-based methods may be more effective but require more resources, while training-free methods are less resource-intensive but may be less effective.
  - Data quality and representativeness: Ensuring culturally relevant data is of high quality and representative of diverse cultures is crucial for effective cultural alignment.
  - Benchmark comprehensiveness: Benchmarks should cover a wide range of cultures and cultural elements to accurately measure cultural awareness.

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on culturally sensitive tasks: If the model does not accurately recognize cultural context or interpret cultural elements, it may generate inappropriate or irrelevant responses.
  - Biased outputs: If the culturally relevant data used in training is biased or unrepresentative, the model may generate biased outputs.
  - Inaccurate benchmark results: If the benchmarks are not comprehensive or culturally sensitive, they may lead to inaccurate assessments of cultural awareness.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the performance of a language model on a culturally sensitive task using both training-based and training-free methods to compare their effectiveness.
  2. Analyze the impact of data quality and representativeness on cultural alignment by training models with different datasets and evaluating their performance on cultural tasks.
  3. Develop and test a new benchmark for cultural awareness that covers a wider range of cultures and cultural elements than existing benchmarks.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we systematically develop robust automatic evaluation methods for long-form generation tasks in culturally-aware language models, given the limitations of current human evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge methods?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] from discussion in Section 4.2.2 highlighting the need for robust automatic evaluation methods, especially for long-form generation tasks, and the limitations of current methods.
- Why unresolved: Current long-form evaluation approaches depend on human evaluation or LLM-as-a-judge methods, which are limited in scalability and lack culturally-specific evaluation. There is a gap in developing culturally specific and robust automatic evaluation techniques.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of new automatic evaluation metrics that are culturally sensitive, scalable, and reliable for assessing long-form generation tasks in culturally-aware language models.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we balance the development of culture-specific LLMs tailored to local needs with the creation of comprehensive cross-cultural LLMs that can serve a global audience, considering the diverse cultural backgrounds of users?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] from the "Balance Development of Culturally-specific LLMs and Comprehensive Universal LLMs" section in Section 9.
- Why unresolved: There is a tension between developing culture-specific LLMs and creating comprehensive cross-cultural LLMs. Most efforts focus on aligning LLMs with individual local cultures, with limited research on developing cross-cultural LLMs that encompass comprehensive knowledge of multiple cultures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Research demonstrating effective methods for creating cross-cultural LLMs that can reason across diverse cultural contexts while maintaining sensitivity to local needs, along with user studies showing the effectiveness of such models in serving a global audience.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we develop LLMs that can adapt and evolve with cultural change over time, given the dynamic nature of culture and the limitations of static LLMs that only align with current cultural norms?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] from the "Develop LLMs that can Adapt and Evolve with Cultural Change over Time" section in Section 9.
- Why unresolved: Current LLMs are static and only align with current cultural norms. However, culture is dynamic and constantly evolving, requiring LLMs to adapt and evolve with cultural change. There is a need for LLMs that can act as repositories for cultural preservation and adaptable systems that can respond to ongoing cultural transformations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of LLMs that can continuously learn and adapt to cultural changes over time, along with validation studies demonstrating their ability to accurately reflect evolving cultural norms and values.

## Limitations

- Current evaluation benchmarks rely heavily on multiple-choice formats and short-answer questions, which may not adequately capture cultural understanding in real-world conversational contexts
- Significant gap in research on low-resource languages and cultures, with most studies focusing on WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) countries
- Many datasets suffer from flattened cultural representations, failing to capture the diversity within countries and local cultural nuances

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The identification of two main approaches for achieving cultural awareness (training-based and training-free methods) is well-supported by the literature review and provides a clear framework for understanding current research directions.
- **Medium Confidence**: The assertion that effective evaluation requires new benchmarks and evaluation frameworks is reasonable but faces implementation challenges, as evidenced by the limited number of comprehensive evaluation methods currently available.
- **Low Confidence**: The claim that interdisciplinary collaboration and user-centered approaches are necessary for culturally aware LLMs, while logical, lacks concrete evidence of successful implementation in current research.

## Next Checks

1. **Benchmark Validation**: Develop and test a new evaluation framework that moves beyond multiple-choice questions to assess cultural understanding in long-form generation and real-world conversational contexts.

2. **Low-Resource Language Assessment**: Conduct a systematic analysis of cultural awareness research across different language resource levels, specifically comparing the effectiveness of cultural alignment methods in high-resource versus low-resource language contexts.

3. **Cultural Diversity Measurement**: Create and validate metrics for measuring cultural diversity within datasets, focusing on capturing local cultural variations rather than national-level generalizations.
