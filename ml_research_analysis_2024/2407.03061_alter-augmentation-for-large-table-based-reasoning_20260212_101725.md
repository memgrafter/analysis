core_contribution: ALTER addresses the challenge of applying large language models
  to large tables by proposing a framework that augments both queries and tables with
  structured information. The method uses a query augmentor to generate sub-queries
  and a table augmentor to provide schema, semantic, and literal information about
  the table, enabling the model to reason effectively using only a small subset of
  relevant data.

# ALTER: Augmentation for Large-Table-Based Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.03061
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03061
- Authors: Han Zhang; Yuheng Ma; Hanfang Yang
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-table reasoning tasks by augmenting queries and tables

## Executive Summary
ALTER introduces a novel framework for applying large language models to large table reasoning tasks. The method addresses the challenge of LLMs' limited context windows by augmenting both queries and tables with structured information, enabling effective reasoning using only small subsets of relevant data. The approach combines query augmentation to generate sub-queries with table augmentation that provides schema, semantic, and literal information about the table content.

## Method Summary
ALTER proposes a framework that augments both queries and tables with structured information to enable LLM reasoning on large tables. The method employs a query augmentor that generates sub-queries from the original query, while a table augmentor provides schema, semantic, and literal information about the table. This augmentation allows the LLM to focus on relevant subsets of data rather than processing entire tables. The framework was evaluated on WikiTQ and TabFact datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance for large-table scenarios.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-table reasoning tasks
- Outperforms existing methods on WikiTQ and TabFact datasets
- Demonstrates robustness to perturbations while using only small subsets of table data
- Successfully handles tables up to 1,000 tokens through effective augmentation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ALTER works by systematically augmenting both the input query and table to provide richer context for LLM reasoning. The query augmentation breaks down complex questions into manageable sub-queries, while table augmentation enriches the table with schema information, semantic relationships, and literal values. This dual augmentation strategy enables the LLM to efficiently process and reason about large tables without exceeding context limits, focusing computational resources on the most relevant information.

## Foundational Learning

Schema Representation
- Why needed: Enables structured understanding of table organization and relationships
- Quick check: Verify correct parsing of column headers and data types

Semantic Augmentation
- Why needed: Provides contextual meaning beyond literal table values
- Quick check: Validate that generated semantic information accurately reflects table content

Literal Information Extraction
- Why needed: Captures concrete values for precise numerical and categorical reasoning
- Quick check: Ensure accurate extraction of numerical values and their units

Sub-query Generation
- Why needed: Breaks complex queries into manageable components for LLM processing
- Quick check: Verify that generated sub-queries maintain logical consistency with the original query

In-context Learning Adaptation
- Why needed: Optimizes LLM performance within context window constraints
- Quick check: Confirm that augmented inputs fit within LLM's maximum context length

Token Limit Management
- Why needed: Ensures augmented inputs remain processable by LLMs
- Quick check: Validate that augmented table size stays within 1,000-token limit

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Query Augmentor -> Table Augmentor -> LLM Reasoning Engine

Critical Path: Query → Sub-queries → Table Augmentation (Schema/Semantic/Literal) → Augmented Input → LLM Reasoning

Design Tradeoffs: 
- Larger table augmentation improves accuracy but risks exceeding token limits
- More sub-queries increase coverage but may introduce complexity
- Schema-only augmentation is faster but less informative than full semantic augmentation

Failure Signatures:
- Query augmentor generates irrelevant or redundant sub-queries
- Table augmentor fails to capture important semantic relationships
- Augmented inputs exceed LLM's context window
- LLM struggles with numerical reasoning despite accurate augmentation

First Experiments:
1. Test query augmentor with simple SELECT queries on small tables
2. Validate table augmentor's schema extraction on tables with varying structures
3. Evaluate complete pipeline on WikiTQ with tables under 500 tokens

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations

- Limited scalability beyond 1,000-token tables for enterprise applications
- Dependence on quality of generated sub-queries which may introduce errors
- Evaluation primarily on WikiTQ and TabFact datasets may not reflect real-world complexity

## Confidence

- Claim about state-of-the-art performance: Medium
- Claim about robustness to perturbations: Medium
- Claim about effectiveness with small table subsets: High

## Next Checks

1. Test ALTER's performance on tables exceeding 1,000 tokens to evaluate true scalability limits
2. Evaluate the method on industrial table datasets with varying structures and complexity
3. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each augmentation type (schema, semantic, literal) to overall performance
