# Optimization Proxies using Limited Labeled Data and Training Time -- A Semi-Supervised Bayesian Neural Network Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.03085
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03085
- Reference count: 31
- Primary result: Up to 10× reduction in equality gaps and 2× reduction in inequality gaps vs standard DNN methods on AC-OPF benchmarks, all within 10 minutes on a CPU.

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles constrained optimization problems (like power grid AC-OPF) in data-limited and compute-limited settings. It introduces a semi-supervised Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) trained via a sandwich-style approach: alternating supervised cost minimization with unsupervised constraint feasibility enforcement using unlabeled data. The BNN's posterior uncertainty is leveraged for tight probabilistic confidence bounds via Bernstein's inequality, avoiding expensive out-of-sample testing. Experiments on AC-OPF benchmarks (cases 57, 118, 500, 2000) show up to 10× reduction in equality gaps and 2× reduction in inequality gaps compared to standard DNN methods, all within 10 minutes on a CPU. Selection via Posterior (SvP) further reduces equality gaps by >10%. The Bernstein-based bounds are tighter and more practical than Hoeffding's, enabling reliable constraint satisfaction without additional computational overhead.

## Method Summary
The method uses a sandwich-style training approach: alternating supervised cost minimization with unsupervised constraint feasibility enforcement using unlabeled data. The BNN's posterior uncertainty is leveraged for tight probabilistic confidence bounds via Bernstein's inequality, avoiding expensive out-of-sample testing. Experiments on AC-OPF benchmarks (cases 57, 118, 500, 2000) show up to 10× reduction in equality gaps and 2× reduction in inequality gaps compared to standard DNN methods, all within 10 minutes on a CPU. Selection via Posterior (SvP) further reduces equality gaps by >10%. The Bernstein-based bounds are tighter and more practical than Hoeffding's, enabling reliable constraint satisfaction without additional computational overhead.

## Key Results
- Up to 10× reduction in equality gaps and 2× reduction in inequality gaps vs standard DNN methods on AC-OPF benchmarks.
- All results achieved within 10 minutes on a CPU.
- Selection via Posterior (SvP) further reduces equality gaps by >10%.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The sandwich-style training approach leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to improve constraint satisfaction in optimization proxies. By alternating between supervised cost minimization and unsupervised constraint feasibility enforcement, the model learns to balance objective optimization with constraint adherence. The Bayesian Neural Network's posterior uncertainty is used to generate tight confidence bounds via Bernstein's inequality, ensuring reliable constraint satisfaction without expensive out-of-sample testing.

## Foundational Learning

**Semi-supervised learning** - Combines labeled and unlabeled data to improve model performance when labeled data is scarce. Needed because labeled data for optimization proxies is expensive to obtain. Quick check: Model should show improved performance with limited labeled data.

**Bayesian Neural Networks** - Provides uncertainty quantification through posterior distributions over network weights. Needed to generate probabilistic confidence bounds for constraint satisfaction. Quick check: Posterior should capture reasonable uncertainty estimates.

**Constrained optimization proxies** - Machine learning models that approximate expensive optimization problems while maintaining feasibility. Needed to accelerate optimization in time-sensitive applications. Quick check: Proxy should closely approximate true optimization results.

**Bernstein's inequality** - Concentration inequality that provides tighter bounds than Hoeffding's for bounded random variables. Needed to generate practical confidence bounds from BNN uncertainty. Quick check: Bounds should be tighter than Hoeffding-based alternatives.

**Sandwich-style training** - Alternating between supervised cost minimization and unsupervised constraint enforcement. Needed to balance objective optimization with constraint satisfaction. Quick check: Training should converge to feasible solutions.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Input data -> Feature extraction -> BNN layers -> Cost output + Constraint outputs -> Bernstein bounds -> Final prediction

**Critical path**: Data preprocessing → Sandwich-style training loop → BNN inference → Bernstein bound calculation → Constraint satisfaction verification

**Design tradeoffs**: Semi-supervised approach trades labeled data quality for quantity, while BNN adds computational overhead for uncertainty quantification. The sandwich-style training requires careful balancing between cost and constraint objectives.

**Failure signatures**: Poor constraint satisfaction indicates insufficient unlabeled data or improper sandwich-style training balance. Overconfident uncertainty estimates suggest inadequate BNN posterior approximation.

**First experiments**: 1) Test sandwich-style training convergence on synthetic constrained problems. 2) Compare Bernstein vs Hoeffding bounds on AC-OPF benchmarks. 3) Evaluate SvP selection impact on equality gaps.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

- Scalability of sandwich-style training to larger, more complex constrained optimization problems beyond AC-OPF benchmarks.
- Effectiveness of unlabeled data-based constraint enforcement when unlabeled data is sparse or noisy.
- Robustness of Bernstein-based bounds in highly non-linear or dynamic systems not explicitly tested.

## Confidence

- **High** for methodology's effectiveness on AC-OPF benchmarks (10× reduction in equality gaps).
- **Medium** for scalability and generalizability to other constrained optimization problems (limited experimental scope).
- **Low** for robustness of Bernstein-based bounds in highly non-linear or dynamic systems (not explicitly tested).

## Next Checks

1. Test sandwich-style training approach on larger and more complex constrained optimization problems, such as those in logistics or supply chain management, to assess scalability.

2. Evaluate the effectiveness of the unlabeled data-based constraint enforcement in scenarios with sparse or noisy unlabeled data.

3. Validate the robustness of the Bernstein-based confidence bounds in highly non-linear or dynamic systems, such as real-time adaptive control problems.
