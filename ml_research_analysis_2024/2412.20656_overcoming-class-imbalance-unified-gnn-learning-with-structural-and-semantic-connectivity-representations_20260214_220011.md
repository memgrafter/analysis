# Overcoming Class Imbalance: Unified GNN Learning with Structural and Semantic Connectivity Representations

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2412.20656
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20656
- **Reference count**: 38
- **Primary result**: Uni-GNN achieves 3-11% higher accuracy and 6-12% higher balanced accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods on imbalanced graph datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of class imbalance in graph-structured data by introducing a Unified Graph Neural Network (Uni-GNN) framework that integrates structural and semantic connectivity representations. The method proposes dedicated node encoders that propagate node embeddings beyond immediate neighbors, capturing both broader graph structure and fine-grained semantic similarities. The framework also incorporates a balanced pseudo-label generation mechanism to leverage unlabeled nodes from minority classes, addressing the data scarcity problem in imbalanced graph learning.

## Method Summary
Uni-GNN introduces a novel approach to handle class imbalance in graph data by combining structural and semantic connectivity representations. The framework employs a structural encoder that uses shortest path distances to capture broader graph structure, and a semantic encoder that employs fine-grained clustering to connect semantically similar nodes regardless of structural distance. A key innovation is the balanced pseudo-label generation mechanism that helps leverage unlabeled nodes from minority classes. The method is evaluated on standard citation network benchmarks (Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed) under various imbalance scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods in both accuracy and balanced accuracy metrics.

## Key Results
- Uni-GNN achieves 3-11% higher accuracy compared to second-best methods across different imbalance scenarios
- Balanced accuracy improves by 6-12% over competing approaches
- Consistent performance gains observed across Cora, CiteSeer, and PubMed datasets
- The method shows particular strength in highly imbalanced settings (10% minority class ratio)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by addressing two key challenges in imbalanced graph learning: limited information propagation for minority classes and the need for better representation of both structural and semantic relationships. The structural encoder captures long-range dependencies through shortest path-based adjacency, while the semantic encoder identifies fine-grained clusters of semantically similar nodes. The balanced pseudo-label generation mechanism effectively utilizes unlabeled data from minority classes, mitigating the scarcity problem. By combining these complementary approaches, Uni-GNN creates more informative representations that help classifiers distinguish minority classes even with limited labeled data.

## Foundational Learning
**Graph Neural Networks**: Neural networks designed to operate on graph-structured data by aggregating information from neighboring nodes. Why needed: Standard GNNs struggle with imbalanced classes due to insufficient minority class samples and limited information propagation. Quick check: Verify understanding of message passing and aggregation mechanisms.

**Class Imbalance in Machine Learning**: Occurs when training data distribution is skewed across classes, leading to biased models that favor majority classes. Why needed: Traditional GNNs perform poorly on imbalanced graph data, requiring specialized techniques. Quick check: Understand different imbalance ratios and their impact on model performance.

**Pseudo-label Generation**: Technique where a model generates labels for unlabeled data based on its current predictions. Why needed: Addresses data scarcity in minority classes by leveraging unlabeled nodes. Quick check: Know the difference between hard and soft pseudo-labels and their respective advantages.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Graph -> Structural Encoder (Shortest Path Adjacency) -> Semantic Encoder (Fine-grained Clustering) -> Combined Representation -> Balanced Pseudo-label Generator -> Classification Head

**Critical Path**: The most critical components are the structural and semantic encoders, as they directly determine the quality of node representations. The balanced pseudo-label generation is also crucial as it addresses the core imbalance problem by leveraging unlabeled minority class nodes.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades computational complexity (shortest path calculations) for improved representation quality. It also requires careful balancing between structural and semantic information, and between labeled and pseudo-labeled data during training.

**Failure Signatures**: Potential failures include poor clustering quality leading to incorrect semantic connections, overly aggressive pseudo-label generation causing noise amplification, and computational bottlenecks with large graphs due to shortest path calculations.

**First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate performance on a simple synthetic graph with known community structure under controlled imbalance
2. Compare structural vs semantic encoder performance in isolation to validate their individual contributions
3. Test the impact of different imbalance ratios on the effectiveness of the balanced pseudo-label mechanism

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper acknowledges that its evaluation is limited to citation network datasets and suggests that future work should explore the method's performance on other graph types including biological networks, social networks, and knowledge graphs. The authors also note the need for more extensive analysis of computational complexity and hyperparameter sensitivity across different imbalance scenarios.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to three citation network datasets (Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed), raising questions about generalization to other graph types
- Computational complexity of shortest path calculations may limit scalability to large-scale graphs
- Multiple hyperparameters require careful tuning, with sensitivity analysis not thoroughly explored

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Core architectural contributions are well-defined and theoretically sound
- **Medium Confidence**: Empirical performance improvements demonstrated but limited dataset scope
- **Low Confidence**: Claims of superiority over all existing methods are premature given limited experimental validation

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Dataset Validation**: Evaluate Uni-GNN on at least 5-7 additional graph datasets with varying characteristics (different edge densities, community structures, and domain types) to assess generalizability beyond citation networks.

2. **Scalability Analysis**: Implement and test the method on large-scale graphs (100K+ nodes) to measure computational efficiency and memory requirements, particularly focusing on the shortest path computation bottleneck.

3. **Ablation Studies**: Conduct comprehensive ablation experiments to quantify the individual contributions of structural connectivity, semantic connectivity, and balanced pseudo-label components to overall performance.
