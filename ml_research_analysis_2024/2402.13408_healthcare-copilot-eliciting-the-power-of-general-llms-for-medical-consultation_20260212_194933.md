# Healthcare Copilot: Eliciting the Power of General LLMs for Medical Consultation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.13408
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13408
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Framework enhances general LLMs for medical consultation without fine-tuning, showing improvements across multiple evaluation metrics

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Healthcare Copilot, a framework designed to enhance general large language models (LLMs) for medical consultation tasks without requiring model fine-tuning. The framework consists of three main components: Dialogue, Memory, and Processing, which enable effective patient interactions, historical data storage, and report generation. Experiments demonstrate that Healthcare Copilot significantly improves the performance of various LLMs including GPT-4, GPT-3.5, LLaMA2, and ChatGLM across metrics such as inquiry capability, conversational fluency, response accuracy, and safety. The system was evaluated using an auto-evaluation scheme with ChatGPT acting as both virtual patient and evaluator, achieving high performance across all metrics.

## Method Summary
Healthcare Copilot is a framework that enhances general LLMs for medical consultation without fine-tuning. It consists of three main components: Dialogue for patient interaction, Memory for storing historical data, and Processing for generating reports. The framework was evaluated using an auto-evaluation scheme where ChatGPT acted as both virtual patient and evaluator. Experiments were conducted on multiple LLMs including GPT-4, GPT-3.5, LLaMA2, and ChatGLM, measuring performance across inquiry capability, conversational fluency, response accuracy, and safety metrics.

## Key Results
- Healthcare Copilot significantly improves inquiry capability, conversational fluency, response accuracy, and safety across multiple LLMs
- The framework demonstrates effectiveness on both proprietary (GPT-4, GPT-3.5) and open-source models (LLaMA2, ChatGLM)
- Auto-evaluation scheme using ChatGPT as both patient simulator and evaluator showed high performance across all metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Healthcare Copilot works by providing a structured framework that compensates for the limitations of general LLMs in medical contexts without requiring expensive fine-tuning. The Dialogue component enables systematic patient interaction through guided questioning, the Memory component maintains context and historical information across conversations, and the Processing component ensures accurate report generation and medical reasoning. This architectural approach leverages the existing capabilities of general LLMs while adding domain-specific structure and safety mechanisms that are critical for medical applications.

## Foundational Learning

**Large Language Models in Healthcare**: Why needed - Understanding how general-purpose LLMs can be adapted for medical tasks without domain-specific training. Quick check - Can the model maintain medical accuracy while preserving conversational quality?

**Framework-based Enhancement**: Why needed - Recognizing that architectural scaffolding can improve LLM performance in specialized domains without fine-tuning. Quick check - Does the framework provide measurable improvements over baseline LLM performance?

**Evaluation Methodology in Medical AI**: Why needed - Understanding the challenges of validating medical AI systems, particularly the limitations of automated evaluation. Quick check - Are evaluation results consistent across different evaluation approaches and independent verification?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Dialogue -> Memory -> Processing -> Report Generation

**Critical Path**: Patient Interaction (Dialogue) -> Context Storage (Memory) -> Analysis & Report (Processing) -> Output Delivery

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades model-specific fine-tuning for architectural enhancement, prioritizing flexibility and generalizability over maximum domain-specific optimization. This approach enables faster deployment across different LLM platforms but may not achieve the peak performance of specialized medical models.

**Failure Signatures**: Potential failures include incomplete patient history capture due to memory limitations, incorrect medical reasoning in the processing component, and safety concerns from inadequate safety checks in the dialogue system. The framework may also struggle with rare medical conditions or emergency scenarios requiring rapid, specialized responses.

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Baseline performance comparison of different LLMs without Healthcare Copilot framework
2. Cross-model evaluation of Healthcare Copilot implementation on GPT-4, GPT-3.5, LLaMA2, and ChatGLM
3. Safety and accuracy validation using the auto-evaluation scheme with ChatGPT as both patient and evaluator

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Auto-evaluation methodology using ChatGPT as both patient and evaluator may introduce biases and lacks independent verification
- Clinical safety and reliability thresholds are not clearly established against human medical standards
- Framework's ability to handle complex, rare, or emergency medical scenarios remains unclear

## Confidence
- Framework architecture and design: High confidence
- Performance improvements on benchmark metrics: Medium confidence (due to self-referential evaluation)
- Clinical safety and reliability: Low confidence (insufficient real-world validation)

## Next Checks
1. Independent human expert evaluation across diverse medical scenarios and specialties
2. Real-world pilot testing with actual patients and healthcare providers in controlled clinical settings
3. External validation using established medical benchmarks and comparison against state-of-the-art fine-tuned medical LLMs
