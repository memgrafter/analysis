# Go-Explore for Residential Energy Management

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.07710
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07710
- Reference count: 17
- Primary result: Go-Explore achieves up to 19.84% cost savings compared to baseline RL algorithms (PPO and DQN) in residential energy management with stochastic and deceptive rewards

## Executive Summary
This paper applies the Go-Explore algorithm to residential energy management, specifically targeting cost minimization in environments with stochastic rewards and deceptive reward signals. The method combines planning and reinforcement learning through a two-phase approach: Phase 1 explores to discover promising states and trajectories, while Phase 2 robustifies the policy through imitation and refinement. The results demonstrate that Go-Explore's exploration efficiency leads to significant cost savings compared to standard RL baselines, particularly in handling the exploration challenges inherent in residential energy systems.

## Method Summary
The paper implements a two-phase Go-Explore approach for residential energy management. Phase 1 involves exploration where the agent stores "cells" (state clusters) and associated trajectories, then resets to these cells to continue exploration, avoiding getting stuck in locally optimal deceptive states. Phase 2 robustifies the policy through two sub-phases: policy cloning where a PPO agent imitates the Phase 1 trajectories, followed by fine-tuning with true reward signals. The method is evaluated on a single shiftable appliance scenario using real-world electricity price data from PJM and background load/renewable generation data from Smart*.

## Key Results
- Go-Explore (robustification) achieves up to 19.84% cost savings compared to baseline RL algorithms
- The method effectively handles deceptive reward signals and stochastic environments in residential energy management
- Phase 1 exploration successfully discovers promising trajectories that Phase 2 robustification can improve upon
- The improvement from robustification is relatively small, attributed to the environment's determinism and limited action-state influence

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Go-Explore addresses deceptive reward signals by returning to promising states and exploring from them
- Mechanism: The algorithm stores "cells" (state clusters) and their associated trajectories, then resets to these cells to continue exploration. This avoids the agent getting stuck in locally optimal deceptive states.
- Core assumption: A simulator reset capability is available to return to specific state clusters
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Go-Explore is a family of algorithms which combines planning methods and reinforcement learning methods to achieve efficient exploration."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Go-Explore's two-phase approach ensures both discovery of good policies and their refinement
- Mechanism: Phase 1 explores to find promising trajectories and stores them; Phase 2 (robustification) trains a policy to imitate and improve upon these trajectories
- Core assumption: The stored trajectories in Phase 1 are sufficiently good to serve as demonstrations for Phase 2
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "The method leverages Go-Explore's efficient exploration by combining planning and reinforcement learning techniques, using a two-phase approach: (1) exploration to discover promising states, and (2) robustification to learn a robust policy."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Go-Explore improves exploration efficiency by avoiding "detachment" and "derailment" problems
- Mechanism: The agent always returns to a promising cell before exploring again, preventing it from forgetting how to get back to good states (detachment) and ensuring it explores from known good positions (derailment)
- Core assumption: The state space can be meaningfully partitioned into cells that capture similar states
- Evidence anchors: [section] "They pointed out that two main challenges in achieving efficient exploration are the phenomenon referred to as 'detachment' and 'derailment.'"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Markov Decision Process (MDP)
  - Why needed here: The entire problem is formulated as an MDP with states, actions, rewards, and transition dynamics
  - Quick check question: What tuple defines an MDP, and which component is unknown in model-free RL?

- Concept: Reinforcement Learning Paradigms
  - Why needed here: Understanding policy-based, value-based, and actor-critic methods is crucial for implementing Go-Explore and its baselines
  - Quick check question: What is the ultimate goal shared by all RL paradigms mentioned in the background?

- Concept: Exploration vs. Exploitation
  - Why needed here: Go-Explore specifically addresses the exploration challenge in environments with deceptive rewards
  - Quick check question: What are the two main challenges in exploration that Go-Explore addresses, and how does it solve them?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Go-Explore archive (stores cells, trajectories, visit counts, costs) → Phase 1 explorer (resets to cells, explores, updates archive) → Phase 2.1 policy cloner (imitates Phase 1 trajectories) → Phase 2.2 robustifier (fine-tunes with true rewards) → Final policy
- Critical path: Archive update → Cell sampling → Environment reset → Action sampling → Trajectory evaluation → Archive update
- Design tradeoffs: Phase 1 exploration is computationally expensive due to repeated resets but finds better initial trajectories; Phase 2 refinement is cheaper but depends on Phase 1 quality
- Failure signatures: Archive grows too slowly (exploration issue), robustification phase shows no improvement (poor Phase 1 trajectories), or cost savings are minimal (environment too deterministic)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run Phase 1 with a small number of episodes and visualize the archive growth to verify exploration is working
  2. Test Phase 2.1 policy cloning by comparing the learned policy's actions against Phase 1 trajectories
  3. Compare the final robustified policy's cost against the baseline PPO agent on the validation dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of Go-Explore change when applied to more complex multi-agent residential energy management scenarios with increased stochasticity?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that future extensions could involve applying Go-Explore to a multi-agent environment and that the robustification phase may show more benefits in such settings due to increased stochasticity.
- Why unresolved: The current study focuses on a single-agent scenario with limited stochasticity. The impact of increased complexity and stochasticity on Go-Explore's performance remains unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing Go-Explore's performance in single-agent versus multi-agent settings with varying levels of stochasticity, measuring cost savings and policy robustness.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the specific factors contributing to the relatively small improvement between Go-Explore with and without robustification in this study?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that the improvement between the versions with/without robustification is very close, attributing this to the environment's relative determinism and limited influence of actions on states.
- Why unresolved: While the authors provide a hypothesis, a detailed analysis of the factors limiting the benefits of robustification in this specific environment is not provided.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive analysis identifying the key factors limiting robustification's impact, such as the degree of environmental determinism, action-state influence, and the effectiveness of the policy cloning phase.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of cell representation (remaining task, time by hour) impact the efficiency and effectiveness of Go-Explore's exploration phase?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors describe the cell representation used but do not explore alternative representations or their potential impact on exploration efficiency.
- Why unresolved: The study uses a specific cell representation without comparing it to other possible representations that might better capture the state space or improve exploration.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing Go-Explore's performance using different cell representations, such as incorporating additional state variables or using alternative similarity metrics, and measuring their impact on exploration efficiency and final policy quality.

## Limitations
- The exact archive scoring mechanism beyond basic visit count normalization is not specified, which could significantly impact exploration efficiency
- Hyperparameter choices for Go-Explore are missing from Table 1, making exact reproduction difficult
- The paper doesn't address how cell representations are defined in the continuous state space of residential energy systems
- The comparison with PPO and DQN baselines may not be entirely fair if these baselines weren't optimized for the specific stochastic and deceptive reward structure

## Confidence

- **High confidence** in the general two-phase Go-Explore framework and its theoretical advantages for exploration
- **Medium confidence** in the reported 19.84% cost savings, as the exact comparison methodology and baseline implementations are not fully detailed
- **Low confidence** in the specific implementation details of the archive mechanism and cell representation strategy

## Next Checks

1. Implement a simplified version with fixed hyperparameters and verify that the archive grows and samples cells as expected during Phase 1 exploration
2. Test the policy cloning phase by comparing the learned policy's action sequences against the stored demonstration trajectories from Phase 1
3. Evaluate the final robustified policy on a held-out validation dataset to verify that the reported cost savings are reproducible and not due to overfitting on the training data
