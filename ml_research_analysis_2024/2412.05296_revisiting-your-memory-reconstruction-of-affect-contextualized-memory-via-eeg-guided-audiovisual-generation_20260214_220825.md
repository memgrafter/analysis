# Revisiting Your Memory: Reconstruction of Affect-Contextualized Memory via EEG-guided Audiovisual Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.05296
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05296
- Reference count: 23
- Primary result: Novel framework for reconstructing autobiographical memories through affect-guided audiovisual generation using EEG signals, achieving F1=0.9 affect decoding and 56% user preference

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces RYM, a novel framework for reconstructing autobiographical memories through affect-guided audiovisual generation using EEG signals. The authors develop a three-stage approach that decodes dynamic affective trajectories from EEG during memory recall and generates synchronized audio-visual content reflecting these trajectories. Their EEG-AffectiveMemory dataset contains multi-modal data from nine participants recalling memories while EEG, keypress-based valence reports, text descriptions, sketches, and music were recorded. The work advances affect decoding research and demonstrates practical applications in personalized media creation through neural-based affect comprehension.

## Method Summary
RYM is a three-stage framework that first extracts affective trajectories from EEG signals using CEBRA (a contrastive learning approach) with temporally aligned valence keypresses as auxiliary variables. The decoded affect states are then mapped to generative prompts through affect-text alignment using language models. Finally, the framework generates synchronized audio-visual content using MusicGen-melody for music generation and Stable Diffusion for video generation, with content segmented according to affective state durations. The method achieves affect decoding with F1=0.9 and generates content showing strong concordance with participants' recalled memories.

## Key Results
- CEBRA achieves F1=0.9 in decoding temporal affective states from EEG during memory recall
- User studies show 56% preference for content generated from subject-reported affect dynamics over randomly reordered affect dynamics
- Correlation between generated and reported affect dynamics is r=0.265 (p<0.05)
- Semantic evaluation using CLIP and CLAP embeddings shows consistent distances between reference prompts and affect-contextualized outputs across affective states

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: CEBRA's contrastive learning effectively decodes individual affective trajectories from EEG during memory recall
- Mechanism: CEBRA uses temporally aligned behavioral sequences (keypressed valence) as auxiliary variables to identify individual-level latent clusters for each affective state, maximizing separation between distinct behavioral states while clustering similar states
- Core assumption: Temporally aligned valence keypresses provide reliable ground truth for affective states during memory recall
- Evidence anchors:
  - Experimental results indicate that our method can faithfully reconstruct affect-contextualized audio-visual memory across all subjects...with participants reporting strong affective concordance
  - Our CEBRA model demonstrated a plateau in learning performance in multiple-session training with EEG signals and real-time valence keypresses from nine participants
  - Weak evidence - no corpus papers directly discuss CEBRA or contrastive learning for EEG-based affect decoding
- Break condition: If keypress timing is unreliable or affective states are too rapidly fluctuating for temporal alignment to capture

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Affect-text alignment using language models successfully maps decoded affective states to generative prompts
- Mechanism: Pre-defined descriptive terms for positive/negative affective states are combined with original memory text prompts through fine-tuning with a pre-trained language model (Claude), creating affect-contextualized text prompts
- Core assumption: Language models can effectively integrate affect descriptors with memory content while preserving semantic coherence
- Evidence anchors:
  - we pre-defined descriptive terms for positive and negative affective states with the pre-trained language model, claude.ai
  - In the neutral state, the original text prompts remain unaltered
  - Semantic evaluation using CLIP and CLAP embeddings shows consistent distances between reference prompts and affect-contextualized outputs across affective states
- Break condition: If language model integration produces incoherent or contradictory prompts that confuse generative models

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Synchronized audio-visual generation preserves both content and affective dynamics of autobiographical memories
- Mechanism: Music and video generation models (MusicGen-melody and Stable Diffusion) are conditioned on affect-contextualized text prompts and memory-associated guiding melodies, with content segmented according to affective state durations
- Core assumption: Diffusion-based generative models can effectively incorporate text-conditioned affect information while maintaining temporal synchronization
- Evidence anchors:
  - Using MusicGen-melody, we generated music using affect-specific text prompts and memory-associated guiding melodies selected by participants
  - For video generation, we used stable diffusion ver.1.5...We use the author-released codes using default configurations
  - Experimental results demonstrate our method successfully decodes individual affect dynamics trajectories from neural signals during memory recall (F1=0.9)
- Break condition: If generative models fail to maintain synchronization between audio and visual components or if affect conditioning is too weak to influence output style

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: EEG signal preprocessing and artifact removal
  - Why needed here: Raw EEG contains noise from muscle movements, eye blinks, and electrical interference that must be cleaned before affect decoding
  - Quick check question: What are the most common artifacts in EEG recordings and how do they affect frequency band analysis?

- Concept: Affective state representation and temporal dynamics
  - Why needed here: Understanding how valence changes over time during memory recall is crucial for CEBRA's temporal contrastive learning approach
  - Quick check question: How do different temporal granularities (continuous vs. discrete) affect the representation of affective trajectories?

- Concept: Diffusion model conditioning and style transfer
  - Why needed here: The framework relies on text-conditioned diffusion models for both music and video generation, requiring understanding of how prompts influence output style
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between classifier-free guidance and text guidance in diffusion models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: EEG acquisition → Preprocessing → CEBRA affect extraction → Text prompt generation → MusicGen generation → Stable Diffusion generation → Audio-visual synchronization → User evaluation
- Critical path: EEG → CEBRA → Text alignment → Generation → Synchronization
- Design tradeoffs: Single-session vs. multi-session training (convenience vs. model generalization), discrete vs. continuous affect representation (simplicity vs. granularity), pre-trained vs. custom generative models (quality vs. control)
- Failure signatures: Low F1 scores in affect decoding indicate EEG preprocessing or CEBRA hyperparameter issues; poor semantic alignment suggests text prompt generation problems; unsynchronized outputs point to segmentation or crossfading issues
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test CEBRA affect decoding on a single participant with known ground truth to validate the pipeline end-to-end
  2. Generate music and video separately using neutral prompts to verify basic generation functionality before adding affect conditioning
  3. Perform cross-correlation analysis between decoded affect trajectories and generated content attributes to validate affective expression

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the CEBRA model's affective decoding generalize across different types of autobiographical memories and participants beyond the current dataset?
- Basis in paper: The authors mention that CEBRA demonstrated a plateau in learning performance in multiple-session training with EEG signals and real-time valence keypresses from nine participants, and they achieved a test-weighted F1 score of 0.9 using a KNN classifier for leave-one-out classification. However, they note that future work will address improving the generalizability of their approach.
- Why unresolved: The current study used a relatively small sample size (nine participants) and focused on specific types of autobiographical memories. The generalizability of the CEBRA model to other memory types and larger, more diverse participant groups remains untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the CEBRA model with a larger, more diverse dataset including different types of autobiographical memories and a broader range of participants would provide evidence for its generalizability. Additionally, comparing its performance to other affective decoding models on the same dataset would help establish its effectiveness.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the smoothness of transitions between affective states in the generated content be improved?
- Basis in paper: The authors acknowledge that despite successfully generating affect-contextualized content, future work will address improving the smoothness of transitions between affective states in the generated content.
- Why unresolved: The current framework generates content based on discrete affective states, which may result in abrupt transitions between different emotional expressions. The authors recognize this limitation and suggest that improving the smoothness of these transitions is an important area for future research.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing new algorithms or techniques that can create more gradual and natural transitions between affective states in the generated content would provide evidence for improved smoothness. User studies comparing the perceived quality of transitions in the current and improved versions could also help evaluate the effectiveness of these changes.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can end-to-end generative models be developed to more seamlessly integrate affective trajectories into the generation process?
- Basis in paper: The authors mention that future research will explore the feasibility of end-to-end generative models for more seamless integration of affective trajectories.
- Why unresolved: The current framework uses a three-stage approach, where affective states are first decoded from EEG signals and then used to guide the generation of audio-visual content. An end-to-end model could potentially learn to directly map EEG signals to affective expressions in the generated content, potentially improving the overall coherence and quality of the output.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing end-to-end generative models that can directly learn the mapping between EEG signals and affective expressions in the generated content would provide evidence for their feasibility. Comparing the performance of these models to the current three-stage approach in terms of generated content quality, user preference, and affective concordance would help evaluate their effectiveness.

## Limitations

- Small sample size (nine participants) raises questions about generalizability across diverse populations and memory types
- Reliance on keypress-based valence reports as ground truth may not capture the full complexity of emotional experiences during memory recall
- User preference results (56%) provide suggestive but not definitive evidence of affective concordance between generated content and recalled memories

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The EEG-based affect decoding pipeline using CEBRA achieves reliable performance (F1=0.9) for temporal affective state classification
- **Medium confidence**: The three-stage RYM framework successfully generates affect-contextualized audiovisual content that shows meaningful correspondence with participants' recalled memories
- **Low confidence**: The user preference results (56% preference, r=0.265) provide strong evidence that subject-reported affect dynamics produce superior content compared to randomly reordered affect dynamics

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-validation across participants**: Test the CEBRA model's ability to decode affect from unseen participants to assess generalizability beyond the training set.

2. **Ablation study on affect decoding**: Compare RYM performance using affect trajectories decoded from EEG versus ground truth keypress data to isolate the contribution of neural decoding accuracy.

3. **Longitudinal consistency test**: Evaluate the stability of affect decoding and content generation across multiple recall sessions for the same memories to assess temporal consistency of the framework.
