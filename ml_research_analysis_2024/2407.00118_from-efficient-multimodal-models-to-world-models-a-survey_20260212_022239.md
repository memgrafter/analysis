- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Comprehensive survey of multimodal large models and their potential for achieving world models through rule-driven and data-driven approaches.

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically reviews multimodal large models (MLMs) and their potential in achieving world models, covering key techniques like multimodal chain of thought, instruction tuning, and in-context learning. The paper explores architectural foundations, optimization strategies, and generative capabilities while identifying critical challenges including perception limitations, reasoning fragility, and instruction compliance. It proposes two main routes to world models: rule-driven approaches incorporating external knowledge systems and data-driven methods using autoregressive or JEPA architectures. The survey also highlights the role of 3D generation and embodied intelligence in advancing world simulation capabilities.

## Method Summary
The survey provides a comprehensive literature review of multimodal large models, analyzing existing architectures, optimization techniques, and generative models. It systematically categorizes findings based on their relevance to world model development, distinguishing between rule-driven and data-driven approaches. The methodology involves synthesizing insights from existing research to identify gaps, challenges, and future research directions for unified multimodal world models.

## Key Results
- Multimodal models can achieve world models through rule-driven approaches using external knowledge systems or data-driven methods with autoregressive/JEPA architectures
- Key challenges include perception limitations, reasoning fragility, and instruction compliance across multimodal data
- Integration of 3D generation and embodied intelligence capabilities is essential for enhancing world simulation and physical environment interaction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multimodal models can achieve world models through rule-driven approaches with limited data by incorporating external rule systems that encode human common sense and domain knowledge.
- Mechanism: Injecting mathematical, physical, chemical, and biological rules into multimodal models enables them to make predictions and reason about outcomes without requiring extensive training data. This mimics how humans use prior knowledge to understand new situations.
- Core assumption: External rule systems can be effectively encoded and integrated into multimodal model architectures to enhance reasoning capabilities without extensive retraining.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We discuss the integration of 3D generation and embodied intelligence to enhance world simulation capabilities and propose incorporating external rule systems for improved reasoning and decision-making."
  - [section]: "Humans rely on mathematical, physical, chemical, and biological tools in the objective world, using a series of theorems to derive and predict the outcomes of events that have not yet occurred."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - the corpus neighbors focus on embodied AI and adversarial attacks but don't directly address rule integration mechanisms.
- Break condition: The model cannot effectively incorporate or apply the external rule systems to new situations, or the rule integration significantly degrades multimodal understanding capabilities.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multimodal models can achieve world models through data-driven approaches using autoregressive methods and JEPA (Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture) methods.
- Mechanism: Autoregressive models generate data step-by-step, capturing contextual information and maintaining coherence through incremental generation. JEPA uses hierarchical planning to break down complex tasks into multiple abstraction levels, enabling efficient prediction of environmental state changes.
- Core assumption: Large-scale training data can effectively capture the patterns and dynamics of the real world, allowing models to learn world simulation capabilities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "This review explores the latest developments and challenges in MLMs, emphasizing their potential in achieving artificial general intelligence and as a pathway to world models."
  - [section]: "In summary, we can clearly define a world model as shown in Figure 1. A world model refers to a model that can predict and simulate environmental state changes by learning from various data in the environment."
  - [corpus]: Moderate evidence - the corpus includes papers on multimodal reasoning and embodied AI that support the data-driven approach concept.
- Break condition: The model fails to capture long-range dependencies or cannot effectively handle the computational complexity of long-sequence data.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multimodal models can achieve world models by expanding modal information to include embodied intelligence capabilities through coordinate systems, point clouds, and depth information.
- Mechanism: Integrating additional sensor modalities (coordinate systems, point clouds, depth) into multimodal models enables robots to perceive, understand, and act in physical environments, creating embodied intelligence that can simulate world dynamics.
- Core assumption: Sensor data from multiple modalities can be effectively fused and processed to create comprehensive world understanding for embodied systems.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We discuss the integration of 3D generation and embodied intelligence to enhance world simulation capabilities."
  - [section]: "Another approach to achieving world simulators is through embodied intelligence models. Current multimodal models cover daily information media such as images, text, and audio. However, developing embodied intelligent robots requires expanding these modal information to include coordinate systems, point clouds, and depth."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus neighbors mention embodied AI but don't specifically address the sensor modality expansion mechanism.
- Break condition: The model cannot effectively fuse and process the additional sensor modalities, or the expanded modal information doesn't improve world simulation capabilities.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Attention mechanisms and their variants (Linear Attention, Grouped-Query Attention, Multi-Query Attention)
  - Why needed here: Understanding attention mechanisms is crucial for optimizing multimodal model architectures and improving computational efficiency in handling long-sequence data.
  - Quick check question: What is the computational complexity difference between standard multi-head attention and linear attention, and how does this impact model performance on long sequences?

- Concept: Multimodal instruction tuning and in-context learning
  - Why needed here: These techniques enable multimodal models to understand and execute tasks involving multiple data modalities, which is essential for world model development.
  - Quick check question: How does multimodal instruction tuning differ from traditional supervised fine-tuning, and what are the key challenges in implementing it?

- Concept: 3D generation techniques and representations (explicit, implicit, hybrid)
  - Why needed here: 3D generation is a critical component for creating realistic virtual environments and world simulators that can be integrated with multimodal models.
  - Quick check question: What are the main advantages and disadvantages of explicit vs. implicit 3D representations, and how do they impact generation quality and computational requirements?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Text Encoder → Text Alignment → Text Projection → LLM → Text Diffusion
  Vision Encoder → Vision Alignment → Vision Projection → LLM → Vision Diffusion
  Audio Encoder → Audio Alignment → Audio Projection → LLM → Audio Diffusion
  Combined outputs through LLM for multimodal generation and reasoning

- Critical path: Encoder → Alignment → Projection → LLM Integration → Diffusion
  The most critical path involves the encoder processing, feature alignment across modalities, and integration through the large language model for unified understanding.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - End-to-end learning vs. modular approaches (tradeoff between training efficiency and flexibility)
  - Resolution vs. computational cost in vision encoders (affects perception quality)
  - Model size vs. inference speed (impacts real-time world simulation capabilities)

- Failure signatures:
  - Inconsistent outputs across modalities indicating alignment issues
  - Degradation in reasoning quality when processing long sequences
  - Inability to generate coherent multimodal outputs in complex scenarios

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test basic multimodal understanding by inputting text and image pairs and verifying coherent output generation
  2. Evaluate attention mechanism efficiency by comparing standard vs. linear attention on long-sequence data
  3. Assess 3D generation quality by generating objects from text descriptions and measuring realism metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper presents two main routes to world models - data-driven (like OpenAI's approach) and rule-driven (like Meta's JEPA) - but does not evaluate their relative effectiveness for achieving counterfactual reasoning.
- Why unresolved: While both approaches are described, the paper does not provide quantitative comparisons or theoretical analysis of their effectiveness for different types of reasoning tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic evaluations comparing world models developed through data-driven versus rule-driven approaches on standardized counterfactual reasoning benchmarks.

## Limitations
