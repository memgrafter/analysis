# Machine Unlearning: Taxonomy, Metrics, Applications, Challenges, and Prospects

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2403.08254
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08254
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Comprehensive survey of machine unlearning taxonomy, metrics, applications, and challenges, categorizing algorithms into exact and approximate methods.

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive survey of machine unlearning, a technique for removing specific data influence from trained models while maintaining utility. The survey categorizes unlearning algorithms into exact methods (rapid retraining) and approximate methods (direct parameter modification), discusses verification metrics, explores applications in areas like LLMs and federated learning, and identifies key challenges and future research directions. The work serves as a foundational guide for scholars entering this emerging field, emphasizing the importance of data privacy and the need for effective unlearning techniques in machine learning systems.

## Method Summary
The paper synthesizes existing literature on machine unlearning through a systematic categorization approach. It organizes unlearning algorithms into exact and approximate categories based on their underlying strategies, reviews verification and evaluation metrics for assessing unlearning quality, examines applications across various domains including federated learning and LLMs, and analyzes attacks targeting unlearning mechanisms. The survey methodology involves comprehensive literature review and taxonomy construction rather than experimental validation.

## Key Results

- Recognition of attacks targeting unlearning processes and future research directions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Machine unlearning can remove specific data influence from trained models while maintaining model utility.
- Mechanism: The paper describes two main categories of unlearning algorithms: exact unlearning (rapid retraining on remaining data) and approximate unlearning (direct parameter modification). Exact unlearning ensures indistinguishability from retrained models by focusing retraining only on data shards containing the to-be-forgotten data. Approximate unlearning achieves similar statistical indistinguishability by manipulating model parameters directly without full retraining.
- Core assumption: The unlearned model must be indistinguishable from a model retrained from scratch on the remaining dataset.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "exact unlearning focuses on rapid retraining to achieve indistinguishability from retrained models, while approximate unlearning directly modifies model parameters"
  - [section] "Exact unlearning aims at expediting the (re)training process, while approximate unlearning obviates the need for retraining by directly altering the model parameters, both making the model after unlearning indistinguishable from one obtained using the naive approach."
- Break condition: If the unlearned model retains significant information about the forgotten data or suffers substantial utility loss, the mechanism fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Distributed unlearning (especially federated unlearning) addresses privacy concerns by enabling unlearning without sharing raw data.
- Mechanism: In federated learning settings, unlearning can be performed either server-side (approximating unlearning on the global model) or client-side (retraining local models). Server-side methods use historical updates or noise injection to approximate unlearning, while client-side methods perform actual retraining on local data.
- Core assumption: Clients can effectively unlearn their data without sharing it with the server, and the global model can be updated accordingly.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "distributed settings (especially federated learning)"
  - [section] "Machine unlearning can assist LLMs in ensuring security, adhering to ethical standards, and eliminating bias by unlearning specific data."
- Break condition: If clients cannot perform effective unlearning due to computational limitations, or if the global model cannot be properly updated, the mechanism fails.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Machine unlearning serves as both passive and active defense against various attacks.
- Mechanism: As passive defense, unlearning removes the effects of data poisoning or backdoor attacks by eliminating compromised memories. As active defense, it proactively removes sensitive information to prevent membership inference, property inference, and model inversion attacks.
- Core assumption: Unlearning effectively removes the targeted data's influence and associated attack vectors from the model.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "unlearning harmful information enabled by machine unlearning" and "attacks targeting machine unlearning"
  - [section] "Machine unlearning can serve as a passive defense to clean up the negative impact of attacks on the model and restore model utility."
- Break condition: If unlearning leaves residual information that can still be exploited by attacks, or if the unlearning process itself introduces new vulnerabilities, the mechanism fails.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Privacy regulations and the "right to be forgotten"
  - Why needed here: Machine unlearning is fundamentally driven by legal requirements for data deletion and privacy protection.
  - Quick check question: What are the key privacy regulations mentioned that mandate the right to be forgotten?

- Concept: Federated learning and distributed machine learning
  - Why needed here: Understanding distributed learning settings is crucial for grasping the challenges and solutions in federated unlearning.
  - Quick check question: What are the main challenges in applying unlearning to federated learning compared to centralized learning?

  - Quick check question: How do exact and approximate unlearning differ in their approach to modifying the trained model?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Data storage and management -> Model training pipeline -> Unlearning algorithm selection -> Verification and evaluation metrics -> Distributed learning coordination (for federated settings)

- Critical path:
  1. Receive unlearning request
  2. Identify data to be unlearned
  3. Select appropriate unlearning algorithm
  4. Execute unlearning process
  5. Verify unlearning effectiveness
  6. Update model for service

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Exact vs. approximate unlearning: balance between completeness and efficiency
  - Server-side vs. client-side federated unlearning: trade-off between communication costs and unlearning effectiveness
  - Storage of historical updates: enables more effective unlearning but increases memory overhead

- Failure signatures:
  - Inability to completely remove data influence
  - Significant drop in model utility after unlearning
  - Excessive computational or time costs
  - Security vulnerabilities exposed by the unlearning process

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple exact unlearning algorithm on a small dataset and verify its effectiveness using similarity-based metrics
  2. Compare the performance of exact vs. approximate unlearning on a medium-sized dataset, measuring both effectiveness and efficiency
  3. Set up a federated learning environment and implement server-side unlearning, then evaluate its effectiveness compared to client-side unlearning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we design a unified, secure, and easy-to-deploy verification metric for machine unlearning that doesn't negatively impact model performance or require advanced cryptographic knowledge?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly identifies this as a future direction, noting that current verification metrics are inadequate because some impair model performance and many are complex to understand and deploy.
- Why unresolved: Existing metrics either compromise model utility (e.g., watermark-based methods) or are too complex for average users (e.g., cryptographic-based methods).
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of a verification metric that is both secure and user-friendly, demonstrated through real-world testing across various machine learning models and applications.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the most effective strategies for achieving both effectiveness and efficiency in distributed unlearning across different distributed learning settings (e.g., federated learning, split learning, peer-to-peer learning)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies this as a key challenge, noting that current federated unlearning methods fail to simultaneously satisfy effectiveness and efficiency.
- Why unresolved: Most existing methods focus on federated learning and often sacrifice either completeness of unlearning or computational efficiency.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of distributed unlearning methods across various settings, demonstrating both effective data removal and efficient resource usage.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can machine unlearning be effectively implemented for feature-level and task-level unlearning requests, rather than just class-based or sample-based requests?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies this as a future direction, noting that current methods focus on class-based and sample-based requests, which fall short of meeting user demands for feature-level or task-level unlearning.
- Why unresolved: Most existing unlearning algorithms are designed for classification tasks and do not consider the unique connections among data or different applications' objectives.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of unlearning algorithms capable of selectively removing specific features or tasks from models while maintaining overall performance.

## Limitations

- Significant gaps in quantitative evaluation standards for unlearning algorithms, with current metrics primarily focusing on theoretical indistinguishability rather than practical effectiveness
- Complexity of unlearning in distributed settings, particularly federated learning, remains underexplored with limited empirical validation of proposed approaches
- Most unlearning methods assume static datasets, while real-world scenarios often involve continuously evolving data streams

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The taxonomy categorization of unlearning algorithms into exact and approximate methods is well-supported by existing literature and provides a clear conceptual framework
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of approximate unlearning methods in maintaining model utility while removing data influence, as theoretical guarantees exist but practical implementations show variable results
- **Medium confidence**: The application of unlearning to federated learning settings, as the survey acknowledges significant challenges but limited empirical validation of proposed solutions

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a systematic benchmark study comparing exact and approximate unlearning methods across multiple datasets and model architectures, using standardized effectiveness and efficiency metrics
2. Implement and evaluate federated unlearning algorithms in realistic multi-client scenarios, measuring both unlearning effectiveness and impact on model convergence
3. Develop and test a comprehensive verification framework that combines similarity-based metrics, data reconstruction resistance, and privacy-preserving query mechanisms to assess unlearning quality
