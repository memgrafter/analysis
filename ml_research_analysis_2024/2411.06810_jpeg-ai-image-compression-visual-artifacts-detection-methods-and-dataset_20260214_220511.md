# JPEG AI Image Compression Visual Artifacts: Detection Methods and Dataset
arXiv ID: 2411.06810
Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06810
Reference count: 36
Key outcome: Automatic detection methods for JPEG AI compression artifacts with dataset of 46,440 validated artifacts

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of detecting visual artifacts in images compressed using neural-network-based methods, particularly the JPEG AI codec. The authors propose automatic methods to detect three types of artifacts: texture degradation, color distortion, and text corruption. These methods work by comparing the neural-compressed image to a traditionally compressed reference image, identifying regions where the neural method performs worse. Using these methods, the authors compiled a dataset of 46,440 JPEG AI compression artifacts, validated through crowdsourced subjective assessment.

The detection methods employ metrics such as MS-SSIM, CIEDE2000, and custom feature-similarity indices to locate and quantify artifact severity. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed detection methods outperform existing image quality assessment metrics in identifying neural-compression artifacts, with AUC values up to 0.88 for text artifacts. The dataset and methods provide valuable tools for testing and improving neural-network-based image codecs.

## Method Summary
The authors developed automatic detection methods for three types of JPEG AI compression artifacts by comparing neural-compressed images to traditionally compressed reference images. For texture degradation, they used MS-SSIM to identify regions where the neural method performed worse than traditional compression. For color distortion, they employed CIEDE2000 to measure color differences and compared these to traditional compression results. For text corruption, they used feature similarity indices to detect degradation in text regions. These detection methods were then applied to a large image set to create a dataset of 46,440 artifacts, which was validated through crowdsourced subjective assessment.

## Key Results
- Detection methods achieved AUC values up to 0.88 for text artifacts
- Dataset contains 46,440 JPEG AI compression artifacts validated through crowdsourced assessment
- Proposed methods outperformed existing image quality assessment metrics for neural-compression artifact detection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The detection methods work by leveraging the reference image obtained through traditional compression as a benchmark for acceptable quality. By comparing neural-compressed images against this reference, the methods can identify specific regions where the neural approach introduces artifacts that traditional methods avoid. This comparative approach allows for precise localization and quantification of artifact severity across different artifact types.

## Foundational Learning
1. **MS-SSIM (Multi-Scale Structural Similarity Index)** - why needed: measures structural similarity between images at multiple scales; quick check: values close to 1 indicate high similarity
2. **CIEDE2000** - why needed: calculates perceptual color differences between images; quick check: values below 2.3 indicate imperceptible differences
3. **Feature similarity indices** - why needed: detect degradation in specific image features like text; quick check: compare similarity scores between reference and compressed images
4. **JPEG AI codec** - why needed: neural-network-based image compression standard; quick check: understand its compression artifacts differ from traditional JPEG
5. **AUC (Area Under Curve)** - why needed: evaluates detection method performance; quick check: higher values (closer to 1) indicate better detection

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Reference image generation -> Artifact detection methods -> Region classification -> Dataset compilation
**Critical Path:** Traditional compression -> Neural compression -> Artifact detection -> Validation
**Design Tradeoffs:** Reference-based detection provides accuracy but requires access to original content; computational complexity vs. detection precision
**Failure Signatures:** False positives when traditional and neural methods have similar artifacts; false negatives when artifacts are subtle or global
**First Experiments:** 1) Apply detection methods to synthetic artifacts 2) Compare detection performance across compression ratios 3) Test generalization to other neural codecs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Detection methods require reference images, limiting practical deployment scenarios
- Performance evaluation relies on AUC metrics without complete characterization of perceived quality relationships
- Dataset limited to JPEG AI codec and three artifact types, potentially limiting generalizability

## Confidence
**Major Claim Clusters Confidence:**
- Detection method effectiveness: High - supported by AUC metrics up to 0.88 for text artifacts and clear methodology description
- Dataset utility: Medium - dataset size is substantial but validation method limitations and codec-specific nature introduce uncertainty
- Comparison to existing metrics: High - experimental results demonstrate clear improvements over baseline methods

## Next Checks
1. Test detection methods on artifacts from other neural compression codecs beyond JPEG AI to assess generalizability
2. Conduct professional subjective assessment studies to validate crowdsourced results and establish correlation with objective metrics
3. Evaluate detection performance when only the neural-compressed image is available (without reference image)
