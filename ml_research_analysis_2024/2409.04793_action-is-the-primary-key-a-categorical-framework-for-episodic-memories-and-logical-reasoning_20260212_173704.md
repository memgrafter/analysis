# Action is the primary key: a categorical framework for episodic memories and logical reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.04793
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04793

- Primary result: A theoretical model that represents logical reasoning as functor searches between cognitive-logs, enabling planning, comprehension, and hierarchical abstraction while maintaining machine computation accuracy

## Executive Summary
This study proposes a categorical framework for representing episodic memories and enabling logical reasoning through a data format called cognitive-logs. The framework combines relational and graph databases to store episodic memories as structured networks where actions serve as primary entities connected by morphisms representing causal relationships and participant roles. The core innovation lies in using category theory operations, particularly functor searches, to compare episodic memories with known rules and scenarios, enabling various forms of logical inference including planning, comprehension, and hierarchical abstraction. The approach aims to bridge the gap between neural-network-based systems that lack rigorous logical reasoning and traditional symbolic AI that struggles with explainability.

## Method Summary
The method employs cognitive-logs as a structured knowledge representation system consisting of three components: e-logs for episodic memories, be-logs for static relationships and similarities, and s-logs for reference scenarios and rules. Episodic memories are decomposed into discrete actions and participants connected by causal relationships, stored as graphical networks. Logical reasoning is implemented through functor searches between these cognitive-logs, where functors serve as structure-preserving mappings evaluated based on structural matching, temporal order consistency, and similarity assessment. The framework leverages database technologies to handle large knowledge volumes while maintaining the precision of categorical operations for rigorous inference generation.

## Key Results
- Cognitive-logs successfully represent episodic memories as structured networks with actions as primary entities
- Functor searches enable multiple inference types including planning, comprehension, and hierarchical abstraction
- Database implementation allows storage of vast knowledge volumes while maintaining computational rigor and explainability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The categorical framework enables rigorous logical reasoning by representing episodic memories as structured graphs with actions as primary entities.
- Mechanism: Cognitive-logs store episodic memories as graphical networks where actions (verbs) and participants are connected by morphisms representing causal relationships, participant roles, and temporal order. This structure allows for precise mathematical operations like functor searches between memory logs and reference scenarios.
- Core assumption: Actions can be discretized and serve as the fundamental building blocks of episodic memories, with causal relationships existing between discrete actions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Cognitive-logs store an episodic memory as a graphical network that consist of 'actions' represented by verbs in natural languages and 'participants' who perform the actions."
  - [section] "The framework, named cognitive-logs, consist of e-logs, be-logs, and s-logs that record episodic memories, static relationships between objects, and knowledge of laws and rules, respectively."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence found supporting the specific claim about actions as primary entities in episodic memory representation.
- Break condition: If actions cannot be adequately discretized or if causal relationships are not strictly between discrete actions, the categorical operations would fail.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Functor searches between cognitive-logs enable various types of logical inferences including planning, comprehension, and hierarchical abstraction.
- Mechanism: Functors serve as structure-preserving mappings between different cognitive-logs (e-logs, s-logs, t-logs), allowing comparison of episodic memories with reference scenarios and rules. The functor evaluation criteria include structural matching, temporal order consistency, and similarity assessment.
- Core assumption: Similarity between objects in different cognitive-logs can be evaluated using be-logs that store static relationships like "resembles" or "is similar to."
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Operations based on category theory enable such comparisons between episodic memories or scenarios. These operations represent various inferences including planning, comprehensions, and hierarchical abstractions of stories."
  - [section] "A functor—a structure preserving map—between cognitive-logs represents these inference processes."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence found supporting the specific claim about functor searches enabling planning and comprehension.
- Break condition: If similarity evaluation between objects cannot be performed accurately, or if temporal order constraints cannot be maintained during functor operations, the inference quality would degrade.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The database-driven approach allows storage of vast knowledge volumes while maintaining computational rigor and explainability.
- Mechanism: Cognitive-logs are implemented as relational and graph databases, leveraging existing database technologies that can handle petabyte-scale data. This enables storing more knowledge than neural-network-based systems while providing exact, interpretable reasoning through categorical operations.
- Core assumption: Database technologies can efficiently handle the complex graph structures and categorical operations required for cognitive-logs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The vast capacities of databases (up to petabyte scales in current technologies) enable the artificial intelligence to store a greater volume of knowledge than neural-network based artificial intelligences."
  - [section] "With the spread of social networking services, current databases technology is now able to handle enormous amount of data, even on a petabyte scale."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence found supporting the specific claim about database scalability for cognitive-log implementations.
- Break condition: If database query performance degrades significantly with the complexity of categorical operations, or if storage requirements exceed practical limits, the system would become unusable.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Category Theory and Functors
  - Why needed here: Provides the mathematical foundation for representing and manipulating structured knowledge, enabling precise logical reasoning operations between different types of cognitive logs.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between a category and a functor, and why functors are useful for comparing different knowledge representations?

- Concept: Episodic Memory Structure
  - Why needed here: Understanding how episodic memories are decomposed into discrete actions and participants with causal relationships is fundamental to implementing the cognitive-logs framework.
  - Quick check question: How does the "do-be done decomposition" transform a simple event like "Bob loves Alice" into a structured cognitive-log representation?

- Concept: Database Implementation of Categorical Structures
  - Why needed here: The practical implementation requires converting categorical structures into database schemas that can efficiently store and query the complex relationships in cognitive-logs.
  - Quick check question: What are the key challenges in implementing categorical operations like functor searches using relational database technologies?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: e-logs (episodic memories) -> be-logs (static relationships/similarities) -> s-logs (reference scenarios/rules) -> functor searches -> inference generation
- Critical path: Store episodic memory → Convert to e-log structure → Perform functor search with s-logs → Evaluate functor based on structure, temporal order, and similarity → Generate inference or plan
- Design tradeoffs: Relational databases provide scalability and precision but may have performance limitations for complex categorical operations; neural networks offer pattern recognition but lack explainability and rigorous logical reasoning
- Failure signatures: Poor functor matching results (suggesting similarity evaluation issues), slow query performance (database optimization problems), or incorrect inferences (temporal order or structural matching errors)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement basic e-log storage for simple events and verify categorical structure integrity
  2. Create be-logs for similarity relationships and test functor similarity evaluation
  3. Implement functor search between e-logs and simple s-logs and evaluate matching quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that quantum computing seems suitable for the functor search operations within cognitive-logs and might be a game changer.
- Why unresolved: While the paper suggests that quantum computing could be beneficial for functor search, it does not provide specific algorithms or methods for implementing this idea.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed algorithm or method for using quantum computing to optimize functor search operations, along with experimental results demonstrating its effectiveness.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the similarity evaluation between actions and participants in cognitive-logs be improved to better model human-like reasoning?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the importance of similarity evaluation for functor searches and mentions that actions and participants are recorded as tokens, but it does not provide a concrete algorithm for evaluating similarity.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the need for similarity evaluation but does not offer a specific method for implementing it, leaving room for further research.
- What evidence would resolve it: A concrete algorithm for evaluating similarity between actions and participants, along with experimental results showing improved reasoning performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can cognitive-logs be extended to incorporate more complex social cognition elements, such as volition and personification, to better model human intelligence?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the importance of volition and personification in human cognition and questions whether these elements are essential for artificial intelligence.
- Why unresolved: The paper raises the question of incorporating social cognition into cognitive-logs but does not provide a specific method for doing so, leaving it as a future consideration.
- What evidence would resolve it: A method for incorporating volition and personification into cognitive-logs, along with experimental results demonstrating improved modeling of human-like reasoning.

## Limitations

- Practical implementation faces significant challenges in scaling categorical operations across large knowledge bases
- Lack of concrete algorithms for key components like similarity evaluation and functor matching thresholds
- Translation from theoretical framework to efficient database operations remains unclear

## Next Checks

1. Implement a prototype system to test functor search performance on datasets with 10,000+ episodic memories and measure query response times
