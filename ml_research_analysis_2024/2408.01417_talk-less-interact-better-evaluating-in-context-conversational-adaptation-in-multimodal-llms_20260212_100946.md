# Talk Less, Interact Better: Evaluating In-context Conversational Adaptation in Multimodal LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.01417
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01417
- Authors: Yilun Hua; Yoav Artzi
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: MLLMs struggle with spontaneous in-context conversational adaptation in reference games, showing limited improvement even with explicit prompting

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether multimodal large language models can adapt their communication style to become more efficient during interactions, similar to how humans naturally converge on concise terms in repeated reference games. The authors introduce ICCA, an automated evaluation framework, to test five state-of-the-art MLLMs as both speakers and listeners in repeated interactions. Their findings reveal that current MLLMs struggle with spontaneous adaptation, failing to reduce message length or consistently converge on terminology without heavy-handed prompting. While some models show modest improvement with explicit instructions, they still fall short of human-level efficiency, highlighting a significant gap in multimodal conversational AI.

## Method Summary
The study employs ICCA (In-Context Conversational Adaptation), an automated framework designed to evaluate how well MLLMs adapt their language during repeated reference game interactions. Five state-of-the-art MLLMs are tested in dual roles: as speakers generating referring expressions and as listeners interpreting them. The framework measures efficiency through message length reduction and term convergence over multiple rounds. Models are evaluated both with and without explicit instructions to communicate efficiently, allowing comparison of spontaneous versus prompted adaptation behaviors.

## Key Results
- All MLLMs struggle to spontaneously reduce message length or converge on consistent terms during repeated reference games
- GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude show some improvement with explicit efficiency instructions, but performance remains below human levels
- As listeners, GPT-4 shows modest accuracy improvement over time while other models perform poorly or degrade

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper does not provide a clear mechanistic explanation for why MLLMs struggle with in-context conversational adaptation. This appears to be a fundamental limitation in their architecture and training approach, where models lack the implicit learning mechanisms that humans use to naturally optimize communication efficiency through repeated interactions.

## Foundational Learning

### Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
- Why needed: Combine visual and textual understanding for holistic comprehension
- Quick check: Can process and generate both image and text inputs in unified frameworks

### In-Context Learning
- Why needed: Ability to adapt behavior based on conversational history without parameter updates
- Quick check: Models must maintain and utilize conversation context across multiple turns

### Reference Games
- Why needed: Controlled environment to study communication efficiency and term convergence
- Quick check: Success measured by accurate identification of target objects through minimal referring expressions

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Multimodal Input -> Joint Embedding Space -> Language Generation Module -> Output Text

### Critical Path
Input processing → Context window integration → Generation → Evaluation of efficiency metrics

### Design Tradeoffs
- Balance between computational efficiency and adaptation capability
- Trade-off between prompt specificity and natural language generation

### Failure Signatures
- Inability to reduce message length across turns
- Failure to converge on consistent terminology
- Degradation in listener accuracy over time

### First Experiments
1. Test spontaneous adaptation without any efficiency prompts
2. Evaluate performance with explicit instructions to be concise
3. Measure listener accuracy trends across multiple interaction rounds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions. However, the findings suggest several important areas for future research, including understanding the underlying architectural limitations that prevent efficient in-context adaptation and developing training approaches that could enable more human-like communication optimization.

## Limitations
- Findings may not generalize beyond the specific reference game setup used in ICCA
- Study focuses on narrow interaction type, unclear if adaptation failures extend to other conversational contexts
- Automated evaluation metrics may miss subtle nuances in language efficiency that human evaluators would catch

## Confidence
- High confidence: MLLMs struggle with spontaneous in-context adaptation without explicit prompting
- Medium confidence: Performance improvements with heavy-handed instructions are limited and inconsistent across models
- Low confidence: Generalizability of findings to other multimodal interaction types beyond reference games

## Next Checks
1. Test the ICCA framework with human participants to establish ground truth baselines for efficient communication patterns and validate the automated metrics
2. Extend evaluation to other multimodal interaction types (e.g., collaborative problem-solving, instruction following) to assess generalizability of adaptation limitations
3. Implement controlled ablation studies varying prompt specificity, context window size, and training data composition to isolate factors affecting in-context adaptation performance
