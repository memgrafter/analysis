# OneKE: A Dockerized Schema-Guided LLM Agent-based Knowledge Extraction System

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.20005
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20005
- Reference count: 11
- One-line primary result: A schema-guided LLM agent-based system that improves knowledge extraction F1 scores by up to 40% through case retrieval and reflection mechanisms

## Executive Summary
OneKE is a dockerized, schema-guided LLM agent-based system designed for knowledge extraction from raw web and PDF sources. It employs multiple specialized agents (Schema, Extraction, Reflection) working with a configurable knowledge base to support diverse domains and complex schemas. The system enables structured information extraction without requiring model fine-tuning, making it adaptable to various data formats and task contexts.

## Method Summary
OneKE operates through a three-agent architecture: the Schema Agent preprocesses data and generates structured output schemas, the Extraction Agent leverages LLMs with case retrieval for knowledge extraction, and the Reflection Agent enables debugging and error correction using historical cases. The system is containerized using Docker and processes diverse data formats including web pages and PDFs. It uses a configurable knowledge base to support different domains and complex schemas, with agents coordinating to extract structured information from unstructured sources.

## Key Results
- Improves F1 scores by up to 40% using case retrieval and reflection mechanisms
- Successfully extracts structured information from both web news and PDF book formats
- Achieves domain adaptability without requiring model fine-tuning
- Demonstrates effectiveness on CrossNER and NYT-11-HRL benchmark datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system's effectiveness stems from its multi-agent coordination where each agent specializes in a distinct aspect of the knowledge extraction pipeline. The Schema Agent handles data preprocessing and schema generation, ensuring consistent output structure. The Extraction Agent leverages LLMs with case retrieval to improve extraction accuracy by learning from similar past cases. The Reflection Agent provides a feedback loop for error correction using historical cases, enabling continuous improvement. This division of labor allows the system to handle complex extraction tasks while maintaining flexibility across different domains and data formats.

## Foundational Learning
- **Schema-guided extraction**: The system uses predefined schemas to guide extraction, ensuring structured and consistent output. This is needed because raw LLMs often produce inconsistent or incomplete extractions. Quick check: Verify schema completeness and consistency across different data types.
- **Case retrieval mechanism**: Historical extraction cases are retrieved to improve current extraction accuracy. This is needed because it provides context and examples for the LLM to follow. Quick check: Assess case retrieval relevance and retrieval time impact.
- **Reflection-based debugging**: The system uses past extraction errors to improve future performance. This is needed because it creates a learning loop for continuous improvement. Quick check: Measure error reduction rate over time.
- **Docker containerization**: The entire system is packaged as a Docker container for deployment consistency. This is needed for reproducibility and ease of deployment across different environments. Quick check: Validate container startup time and resource usage.
- **Multi-agent coordination**: Different specialized agents work together to handle complex extraction tasks. This is needed because no single agent can handle all aspects of knowledge extraction effectively. Quick check: Monitor agent communication latency and coordination overhead.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Schema Agent -> Extraction Agent -> Reflection Agent -> Knowledge Base

**Critical Path**: Raw input → Schema Agent preprocessing → Schema generation → Extraction Agent with case retrieval → Knowledge extraction → Reflection Agent validation → Final output

**Design Tradeoffs**: The three-agent architecture provides specialization and modularity but increases system complexity and coordination overhead. Dockerization ensures deployment consistency but may add container management overhead. Case retrieval improves accuracy but increases computational requirements.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Schema Agent failures result in inconsistent or invalid output schemas
- Extraction Agent failures manifest as incomplete or inaccurate knowledge extraction
- Reflection Agent failures lead to persistent extraction errors without correction
- Dockerization failures cause deployment inconsistencies or resource constraints

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test basic schema generation with simple web page input to validate Schema Agent functionality
2. Run knowledge extraction on a single PDF document to verify Extraction Agent performance
3. Execute end-to-end pipeline with a small dataset to validate multi-agent coordination

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Evaluation scope limited to CrossNER and NYT-11-HRL datasets, potentially missing real-world complexity
- Dockerization details lack specific information about container performance and deployment considerations
- Three-agent architecture complexity implications for real-world deployment are not thoroughly discussed
- Claims of "up to 40% improvement" represent maximum rather than consistent improvements

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Core architecture description and basic functionality claims are well-supported by methodology section.

**Medium Confidence**: Performance improvements and dataset evaluation results are methodologically sound but based on limited evaluation scope.

**Low Confidence**: Real-world deployment implications and scalability assessments due to insufficient discussion of practical constraints.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct comprehensive testing across diverse real-world knowledge extraction scenarios beyond the two reported datasets, including domain-specific knowledge bases.
2. Perform detailed benchmarking of system performance with varying container sizes and resource constraints to validate dockerization claims.
3. Implement A/B testing comparing OneKE's three-agent approach against simpler single-agent architectures in production environments to assess practical benefits versus complexity overhead.
