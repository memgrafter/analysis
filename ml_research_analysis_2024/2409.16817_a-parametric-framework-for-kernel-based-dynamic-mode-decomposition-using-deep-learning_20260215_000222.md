# A parametric framework for kernel-based dynamic mode decomposition using deep learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.16817
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16817
- Authors: Konstantinos Kevopoulos; Dongwei Ye
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: This paper presents a parametric extension of kernel-based dynamic mode decomposition using deep learning. The proposed framework addresses the challenge of efficient parametric prediction for dynamical systems by combining LANDO (Linear and Nonlinear Disambiguation Optimization) models with deep neural networks. In the offline stage, individual LANDO models are constructed for each parameter instance from the training data. During the online stage, these models generate new data at desired time instants, and a deep neural network learns the mapping between parameters and states. The method is demonstrated on three numerical examples: Lotka-Volterra model, heat equation, and reaction-diffusion equation. Results show high accuracy with mean relative L2 errors typically below 5% across various test cases, even when extrapolating beyond the training time window. For high-dimensional systems, the framework incorporates dimensionality reduction techniques to improve computational efficiency.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a parametric framework that combines kernel-based dynamic mode decomposition with deep learning for efficient prediction of dynamical systems with varying parameters. The method operates in two stages: an offline stage where LANDO models are constructed for each parameter instance in the training data, and an online stage where these models generate synthetic data for desired time instants, which are then used to train a deep neural network to learn the mapping between parameters and states. The framework demonstrates high accuracy with mean relative L2 errors below 5% across three numerical examples including Lotka-Volterra, heat equation, and reaction-diffusion equation. For high-dimensional systems, the approach incorporates dimensionality reduction techniques to maintain computational efficiency.

## Method Summary
The framework operates in two stages. In the offline stage, for each parameter instance in the training data, a LANDO (Linear and Nonlinear Disambiguation Optimization) model is constructed by solving a kernel-based optimization problem with sparse dictionary learning via the ALD test. This generates a surrogate model that approximates the dynamics for that specific parameter. In the online stage, these LANDO models are used to generate synthetic state data at desired time instants across the parameter space. A deep neural network is then trained to learn the mapping between parameters and states at these time instants. For high-dimensional systems, proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the state space before DNN training, with reconstruction performed after prediction.

## Key Results
- Mean relative L2 errors below 5% for Lotka-Volterra model predictions, with standard deviations ranging from 0.06% to 3.91%
- Heat equation predictions show mean relative L2 errors between 0.07% and 1.45%, with extrapolation to later times maintaining accuracy
- Reaction-diffusion equation predictions achieve mean relative L2 errors below 3% for both Allen-Cahn and Cahn-Hilliard equations
- The framework successfully handles extrapolation beyond the training time window while maintaining reasonable accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
LANDO surrogate models for each parameter instance capture the dynamics accurately enough to serve as high-quality training data for the DNN. By solving the LANDO optimization problem for each parameter instance, the framework constructs localized approximations of the dynamics that generate synthetic state trajectories at desired time instants, which are well-distributed in parameter space due to the training set coverage.

### Mechanism 2
The DNN learns a smooth mapping from parameters to reduced states that generalizes to unseen parameters within the training domain. The DNN is trained on pairs of (parameter, reduced state) at specific time instants, and with enough training samples and appropriate architecture, it can interpolate and extrapolate within the parameter domain, capturing the underlying solution manifold.

### Mechanism 3
Dimensionality reduction via POD improves computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy for high-dimensional systems. By projecting high-dimensional states onto a lower-dimensional subspace spanned by POD modes, the DNN operates in a reduced space, reducing both training time and memory requirements while maintaining accuracy.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Kernel methods and their role in capturing nonlinear dynamics
  - Why needed here: LANDO relies on kernel representations to approximate the underlying dynamics; understanding how kernel choice affects expressiveness is crucial.
  - Quick check question: What is the effect of using a quadratic kernel vs a linear kernel in LANDO for a nonlinear dynamical system like Lotka-Volterra?

- Concept: Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and its application to high-dimensional data
  - Why needed here: POD is used to reduce the dimensionality of state data before DNN training; understanding its truncation error and energy capture is important.
  - Quick check question: How does the number of POD modes affect the reconstruction error and computational cost in the heat equation example?

- Concept: Deep neural network training and generalization
  - Why needed here: The DNN must learn the mapping between parameters and states accurately; understanding overfitting, activation functions, and architecture choices is essential.
  - Quick check question: Why was the snake activation function chosen for the Lotka-Volterra example, and how does it help with periodic behavior?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Training data generation (parameter instances + state snapshots) -> LANDO model construction (kernel learning + sparse dictionary via ALD test) -> Synthetic data generation (LANDO models at desired time instants) -> POD dimensionality reduction (for high-dimensional systems) -> DNN training (parameter to reduced state mapping) -> Prediction (new parameters) -> State reconstruction (if applicable) -> Accuracy evaluation (relative L2 error)

- Critical path:
  1. Generate training data for each parameter instance
  2. Construct LANDO models via kernel learning and sparse dictionary
  3. Generate synthetic data at desired time instants using LANDO models
  4. Apply POD (if high-dimensional) to reduce state dimensionality
  5. Train DNN to learn mapping from parameters to reduced states
  6. Predict for new parameters and reconstruct full state (if applicable)
  7. Evaluate prediction accuracy

- Design tradeoffs:
  - LANDO kernel choice vs. model expressiveness and computational cost
  - ALD threshold vs. dictionary size and approximation accuracy
  - DNN architecture (layers, neurons, activation) vs. generalization and training time
  - POD truncation threshold vs. dimensionality reduction and reconstruction error

- Failure signatures:
  - High relative L2 error indicates poor LANDO approximation or insufficient DNN capacity
  - Increasing error over time suggests error accumulation in LANDO time integration
  - Poor performance near parameter boundaries suggests inadequate training data coverage
  - High computational cost suggests inefficient POD truncation or DNN architecture

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement LANDO for a simple 2D dynamical system (e.g., Lotka-Volterra) with varying one parameter; verify sparse dictionary construction and kernel approximation.
  2. Train a DNN to map parameters to states for the same system at a fixed time; evaluate interpolation and extrapolation performance.
  3. Apply POD to high-dimensional data (e.g., heat equation) and train a DNN in reduced space; compare accuracy and computational cost vs. full-dimensional approach.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How does the parametric LANDO framework perform when extrapolating beyond the training time window for systems with highly nonlinear dynamics?
- Basis in paper: The paper demonstrates extrapolation capabilities but notes that errors increase over time, particularly when the solution manifold becomes more complex.
- Why unresolved: While the paper shows that mean relative L2 errors remain below 5% for various test cases, the long-term stability and accuracy of predictions for highly nonlinear systems beyond the training time window requires further investigation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic studies varying the degree of nonlinearity, the length of the extrapolation period, and the complexity of the solution manifold would provide insights into the framework's limitations and robustness.

- Question: What is the impact of different dimensionality reduction techniques on the accuracy and computational efficiency of the parametric LANDO framework for high-dimensional systems?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions the application of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) for high-dimensional systems but acknowledges that nonlinear model order reduction methods like kernel-PCA and autoencoders could be applied to mitigate issues with slowly decaying Kolmogorov N-width.
- Why unresolved: The paper only demonstrates the use of POD and does not compare its performance with other dimensionality reduction techniques in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies evaluating the performance of POD, kernel-PCA, and autoencoders in conjunction with the parametric LANDO framework on various high-dimensional systems would provide insights into the optimal choice of dimensionality reduction technique.

- Question: How does the incorporation of uncertainty quantification techniques, such as ensemble methods or Bayesian schemes, affect the credibility and reliability of the parametric LANDO framework?
- Basis in paper: The paper acknowledges the importance of uncertainty quantification and mentions that either ensemble methods or Bayesian schemes could be integrated into the framework to provide estimates of distribution or intervals rather than point estimations.
- Why evidence would resolve it: The paper does not explore the integration of uncertainty quantification techniques and their impact on the framework's performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Studies implementing ensemble methods or Bayesian schemes within the parametric LANDO framework and evaluating their effect on prediction accuracy, reliability, and credibility would provide insights into the benefits and limitations of incorporating uncertainty quantification.

## Limitations

- Scalability concerns for high-dimensional systems where POD dimensionality reduction may be insufficient to capture complex spatiotemporal dynamics
- Kernel function selection appears ad hoc rather than systematic, with no clear methodology for choosing optimal kernels for different dynamical systems
- Lack of theoretical guarantees on prediction accuracy when extrapolating beyond the training parameter domain

## Confidence

- High confidence: The core methodology of combining LANDO models with DNNs for parametric prediction is well-established in the paper. The mathematical formulation of the LANDO optimization problem and the overall two-stage framework are clearly presented and theoretically sound.
- Medium confidence: The numerical results demonstrating the framework's effectiveness on the three test cases. While the reported mean relative L2 errors are encouraging (typically below 5%), the limited number of test cases and lack of comparison with alternative methods reduce confidence in the generality of these findings.
- Low confidence: The claim that the framework can efficiently handle high-dimensional systems through POD. The paper provides limited quantitative analysis of the trade-off between dimensionality reduction and accuracy, and the specific conditions under which POD remains effective are not clearly established.

## Next Checks

1. **Kernel sensitivity analysis**: Systematically test different kernel functions (linear, quadratic, RBF) on the Lotka-Volterra model to determine which provides the best balance between approximation accuracy and computational efficiency. Compare the resulting LANDO models' ability to generate training data for the DNN.

2. **POD truncation study**: For the heat equation example, systematically vary the number of POD modes retained and quantify the trade-off between computational cost and prediction accuracy. Determine the minimum number of modes required to maintain the reported sub-5% error threshold.

3. **Extrapolation robustness test**: Design a parameter sampling strategy that includes points near and beyond the training domain boundaries. Evaluate how prediction accuracy degrades as parameters move away from the training set, and identify the maximum extrapolation distance before significant accuracy loss occurs.
