# Claim Verification in the Age of Large Language Models: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2408.14317
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14317
- **Reference count**: 17
- **Primary result**: Comprehensive survey of 49 LLM-based claim verification approaches, categorizing techniques and analyzing effectiveness across datasets like FEVER and SCIVER.

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming automated claim verification to combat misinformation. The authors review contemporary methodologies across the complete verification pipeline, from evidence retrieval through generation strategies. By analyzing 49 papers, they categorize approaches into four key components: evidence retrieval (RAG, iterative retrieval), prompt engineering (manual/automated prompting, chain-of-thought), transfer learning (fine-tuning, in-context learning), and generation strategies (label/evidence generation, explainability). The work identifies critical challenges including handling irrelevant context, knowledge conflicts, and multilinguality, while providing a foundational resource for advancing LLM-driven fact-checking systems.

## Method Summary
The survey analyzes 49 papers on LLM-based claim verification, systematically categorizing techniques across the verification pipeline. The methodology involves evidence retrieval using RAG and iterative approaches, prompt engineering through manual and automated strategies including chain-of-thought reasoning, transfer learning via fine-tuning and in-context learning, and generation of veracity labels and explanations. Evaluation metrics include F1 score, FEVER score, precision/recall/accuracy, and evidence retrieval metrics like Recall@k. The survey synthesizes findings across datasets such as FEVER and SCIVER to identify effective approaches and open challenges in the field.

## Key Results
- RAG models significantly improve claim verification by retrieving relevant evidence and reducing LLM hallucinations
- Prompt engineering strategies enhance robustness and reasoning capabilities, particularly for complex and multi-hop claims
- Transfer learning through fine-tuning and in-context learning adapts LLMs to domain-specific verification tasks
- Current approaches face challenges with irrelevant context, knowledge conflicts between retrieved evidence and internal LLM knowledge, and limited multilingual capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: RAG models improve claim verification by retrieving relevant evidence during inference.
- **Mechanism**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are augmented with external knowledge retrieval (RAG) to conditionally generate veracity labels. The model retrieves documents from sources like Wikipedia, then generates labels conditioned on the retrieved evidence and the input claim.
- **Core assumption**: LLMs suffer from hallucinations and may rely on outdated or incorrect internal knowledge, so retrieval of recent, relevant information is necessary.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "With the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their superior performance in several NLP tasks, we have seen a surge of LLM-based approaches to claim verification along with the use of novel methods such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)."
  - [section] "RAG models, which have been developed to address hallucination in LLMs for knowledge-intensive tasks, have shown success for fact verification [Gao et al., 2023; Guan et al., 2023]."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct mention of RAG mechanisms in neighbor papers, suggesting this is a specific focus of the survey.
- **Break condition**: RAG models fail on long or complex claims due to context length limitations, leading to incorrect labels or evidence.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Prompt engineering improves LLM performance on claim verification by structuring input and guiding reasoning.
- **Mechanism**: Manual and automated prompting strategies (e.g., chain-of-thought, hierarchical prompting, consistency mechanisms) are used to improve the robustness and reasoning capabilities of LLMs when verifying claims.
- **Core assumption**: LLMs can be guided to better reasoning through structured prompts that break down complex claims or enforce logical consistency.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "The survey analyzes 49 papers, categorizing techniques by their components and evaluating them across datasets like FEVER and SCIVER."
  - [section] "Text prompting has shown to be effective for improving the output of LLMs. In the context of claim verification, several works investigate both manual and automated prompting strategies to increase robustness."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence of prompting strategies in neighbor papers.
- **Break condition**: Poorly designed prompts may lead to model confusion or reliance on incorrect internal knowledge, producing unreliable outputs.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Transfer learning strategies (fine-tuning and in-context learning) adapt LLMs to domain-specific claim verification tasks.
- **Mechanism**: LLMs are fine-tuned on task-specific datasets or used in few-shot settings with in-context learning (e.g., chain-of-thought reasoning) to improve performance on claim verification.
- **Core assumption**: Pre-trained LLMs have limited internal knowledge for real-world claims, requiring adaptation through fine-tuning or demonstration-based learning.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "The survey analyzes 49 papers, categorizing techniques by their components and evaluating them across datasets like FEVER and SCIVER."
  - [section] "Fine-Tuning. Although recent studies show the success of pre-trained LLMs on zero- or few-shot tasks, they often fail at verifying real-world claims given their limited internal knowledge."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct mention of transfer learning strategies in neighbor papers.
- **Break condition**: Overfitting during fine-tuning or incorrect demonstrations in few-shot learning can degrade model generalization.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
  - **Why needed here**: RAG addresses LLM hallucination by retrieving relevant evidence during inference, improving fact verification accuracy.
  - **Quick check question**: How does RAG mitigate the hallucination problem in LLMs during claim verification?

- **Concept**: Prompt Engineering
  - **Why needed here**: Structured prompts guide LLM reasoning and improve robustness, especially for complex or multi-hop claims.
  - **Quick check question**: What are the benefits of using chain-of-thought prompting in claim verification?

- **Concept**: Transfer Learning (Fine-tuning and In-context Learning)
  - **Why needed here**: Pre-trained LLMs require adaptation to domain-specific claim verification tasks for optimal performance.
  - **Quick check question**: Why is fine-tuning necessary for LLMs in real-world claim verification scenarios?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Claim → Evidence Retrieval → Prompt Creation → Transfer Learning → LLM Generation → Veracity Label
- **Critical path**: The verification pipeline flows from claim input through evidence retrieval (RAG/iterative), prompt engineering (manual/automated), transfer learning adaptation (fine-tuning/in-context), to LLM generation of labels and explanations.
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - RAG vs. internal knowledge: RAG improves accuracy but adds latency; relying on internal knowledge is faster but prone to hallucination
  - Prompt complexity vs. robustness: Complex prompts improve reasoning but may confuse the model; simple prompts are faster but less reliable
  - Fine-tuning vs. few-shot learning: Fine-tuning adapts the model but requires labeled data; few-shot learning is data-efficient but less stable
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Incorrect labels with plausible explanations (hallucination)
  - Slow response times (heavy retrieval or complex prompting)
  - Inconsistent outputs across similar claims (prompt instability)
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Compare RAG vs. no RAG on a small claim verification dataset to measure hallucination reduction
  2. Test different prompting strategies (chain-of-thought vs. direct prompting) on complex claims
  3. Evaluate fine-tuning vs. few-shot learning on a domain-specific claim verification task

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How can we effectively handle irrelevant context in retrieval-augmented fact verification systems to improve robustness?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper explicitly identifies handling irrelevant context as an open challenge, noting that LLMs may not be trained to ignore such evidence, leading to misinformation and incorrect verification.
- **Why unresolved**: While recent research has proposed techniques to identify the most relevant context, the paper states that more work is required to verify the effectiveness across different domains.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Empirical studies demonstrating improved performance of fact verification systems across multiple domains when irrelevant context is effectively filtered out, compared to baseline systems.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: How can knowledge conflicts between retrieved evidence and a pre-trained LLM's internal parameters be resolved to avoid hallucinations?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper explicitly identifies handling knowledge conflicts as an open challenge, explaining that retrieved external evidence may conflict with the internal parameters of the pre-trained LLM, causing it to ignore the retrieved evidence and produce hallucinations.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper notes that while approaches for avoiding knowledge conflicts have been introduced for question answering, expanding this work to fact-verification is vital but remains underdeveloped.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Development and evaluation of fact-verification systems that effectively resolve knowledge conflicts, demonstrating improved accuracy and reduced hallucinations compared to systems that do not address this issue.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: What strategies can be employed to develop effective multilingual fact-verification approaches given the current reliance on English datasets and limited multilingual resources?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper explicitly identifies multilinguality as an open challenge, noting that most automated claim verification approaches rely on English datasets and there are limited multilingual fact-verification datasets.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper states that this hinders the development of approaches for multilingual fact-verification, which achieve the best performance when trained on language-specific datasets.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Creation and evaluation of multilingual fact-verification systems that demonstrate performance comparable to English-only systems when trained on language-specific datasets.

## Limitations
- The survey lacks direct experimental validation of mechanisms, relying on reported results from individual studies rather than unified experiments
- No systematic evaluation of interactions between components (e.g., how RAG interacts with specific prompting strategies)
- Limited coverage of multilingual approaches due to dataset availability constraints
- No ablation studies demonstrating the relative contribution of each technique to overall performance

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The survey's categorization framework and systematic literature review methodology
- **Medium confidence**: Effectiveness claims for RAG-based approaches in improving retrieval accuracy
- **Medium confidence**: Importance of prompt engineering for complex claim verification
- **Low confidence**: Claims about transfer learning superiority without specific comparative experiments

## Next Checks

1. Conduct controlled experiments comparing RAG vs. non-RAG approaches on standardized claim verification datasets (FEVER, SCIVER) using identical LLM configurations and evaluation metrics
2. Perform ablation studies to isolate the impact of different prompting strategies (manual vs. automated, chain-of-thought vs. direct prompting) on verification accuracy across claim complexity levels
3. Evaluate the interaction effects between retrieval quality, prompt design, and fine-tuning strategies through systematic variation of component combinations on domain-specific claim verification tasks
