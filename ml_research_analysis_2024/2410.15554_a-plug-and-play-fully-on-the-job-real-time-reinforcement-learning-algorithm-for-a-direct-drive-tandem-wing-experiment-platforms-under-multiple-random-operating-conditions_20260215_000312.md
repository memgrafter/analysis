# A Plug-and-Play Fully On-the-Job Real-Time Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for a Direct-Drive Tandem-Wing Experiment Platforms Under Multiple Random Operating Conditions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.15554
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15554
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: CRL2E achieves 14-66× better tracking accuracy and 36.11-65.85% faster convergence than baselines on direct-drive tandem-wing platforms under six challenging operating conditions.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CRL2E, a plug-and-play reinforcement learning algorithm designed for real-time control of direct-drive tandem-wing experimental platforms under multiple random operating conditions. The algorithm addresses the challenges of nonlinear dynamics, underactuation, and the need for safe and efficient training in non-stationary environments. CRL2E employs a Physics-Inspired Rule-Based Policy Composer Strategy with Perturbation Module and a lightweight network optimized for real-time control. Experiments under six challenging operating conditions demonstrate that CRL2E achieves safe and stable training within 500 steps, improving tracking accuracy by 14-66 times compared to SAC, PPO, and TD3, and showing 8.3-60.4% improvements over the CRL algorithm with 36.11-57.64% faster convergence speed.

## Method Summary
CRL2E is an on-policy deterministic actor-critic algorithm that uses a Physics-Inspired Rule-Based Policy Composer Strategy with Perturbation Module and a lightweight network optimized for real-time control. The algorithm employs a Time-Interleaved Module that alternates between a classical PID controller and an RL policy at 2000Hz, ensuring Lipschitz continuity in error dynamics. A gradient-domain Laplace transform is used to estimate Q-values without a critic network, enabling rapid execution on edge computing devices. Composer Perturbation and Time-Interleaved Capability Perturbation jointly enhance exploration efficiency and convergence speed by adding noise to policy weights and varying PID parameters, respectively.

## Key Results
- CRL2E achieves 14-66× better tracking accuracy than SAC, PPO, and TD3 under six challenging operating conditions.
- CRL2E shows 8.3-60.4% improvements in tracking accuracy over the CRL algorithm.
- CRL2E demonstrates 36.11-57.64% faster convergence speed compared to CRL variants.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Time-interleaved execution of classical and RL controllers enforces Lipschitz continuity in error dynamics.
- Mechanism: The algorithm alternates between a PID controller and the RL policy at each step. The PID contributes a bounded error-reduction rate (PC_lass), while the RL contributes an error-increase rate (PE_rl(t)). The net error change over two steps is bounded by a linear combination of these rates, satisfying a Lipschitz inequality with constant λ_Lipschitz = (-PC_lass + PE_rl,max)/2.
- Core assumption: The classical controller's error-reduction capability is constant and sufficiently large to counteract the worst-case RL-induced error growth, and the alternating step timing is fixed.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The convergence speed of CRL2E is 36.11% to 57.64% faster than the CRL algorithm with only the Composer Perturbation and 43.52% to 65.85% faster than the CRL algorithm when both the Composer Perturbation and Time-Interleaved Capability Perturbation are introduced"
  - [section] "Based on the above proof, it is evident that Time -Interleaved module with Time -Interleaved Capability ensure Lipschitz continuity in the algorithm execution process, guaranteeing boundedness in the update process"
  - [corpus] No direct citations found; Lipschitz-based safety arguments are not common in RL literature. This is an original contribution.
- Break condition: If the classical controller's error-reduction rate becomes smaller than the RL's worst-case error-increase rate, the Lipschitz bound fails and divergence risk increases.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Physics-Inspired Rule-Based Policy Composer strategy uses gradient-domain Laplace transform to estimate Q-values without a critic.
- Mechanism: Instead of relying on a critic network, the algorithm transforms the gradient sequence of the policy parameters (θ) into the complex domain via Laplace transform. This yields an approximate relationship between reward r(θ) and Q-value Q(θ) as Q(θ) ≈ r(θ)/(1 - γ_mean), where γ_mean is the average discount factor over the single life. This allows on-the-fly Q estimation for composer weight updates.
- Core assumption: The discount factor γ varies slowly enough over the finite time horizon that its mean can be used as a constant approximation without significant bias.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The CRL2E algorithm introduces an innovative policy composer that significantly improves performance under multiple random operating conditions"
  - [section] "To address these issues and facilitate rapid execution on edge computing devices... this work employs a gradient-domain Laplace transform that does not rely on the critic"
  - [corpus] Laplace transform for policy optimization is not standard in RL literature; this is a novel method not widely cited.
- Break condition: If the time-varying discount factor has large variance or if the finite time is too short for the mean approximation to hold, the Q estimate becomes unreliable.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Composer Perturbation and Time-Interleaved Capability Perturbation jointly enhance exploration efficiency and convergence speed.
- Mechanism: Composer Perturbation adds noise to the policy weights (up to 20%) to explore new gradient descent segments. Time-Interleaved Capability Perturbation varies PID parameters within ±10% to ±40% to adjust the classical controller's Lipschitz capability. Both perturbations force the composer to adapt to a wider range of dynamics, leading to faster identification of effective strategies.
- Core assumption: The perturbations are within a range that does not destabilize the system but is large enough to avoid local optima and encourage exploration.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "improvements in tracking accuracy ranging from 8.3% to 60.4% compared to the Concerto Reinforcement Learning (CRL) algorithm"
  - [section] "To explore the impact of introducing perturbation into the algorithm... perturbation was introduced as described in equation (103)"
  - [corpus] Perturbation-based exploration in RL is common, but joint perturbation of both the composer and classical controller is not widely cited.
- Break condition: If perturbations exceed stability bounds, the system diverges; if too small, exploration gain is negligible.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Lipschitz continuity in control systems
  - Why needed here: Ensures bounded error growth when switching between controllers, critical for safety in nonlinear, underactuated systems.
  - Quick check question: What is the Lipschitz constant for a PID controller with Kp=0.48, Ki=2e-5, Kd=7e-4 under worst-case disturbance?

- Concept: Gradient-domain Laplace transform
  - Why needed here: Enables Q-value estimation without a critic network, reducing computation for real-time control.
  - Quick check question: If r(θ) = 0.1 at a parameter change step, and γ_mean = 0.9, what is the approximate Q-value using the gradient-domain Laplace formula?

- Concept: Perturbation-based exploration
  - Why needed here: Avoids local optima in highly nonlinear, non-stationary environments with multiple operating conditions.
  - Quick check question: What is the maximum weight perturbation percentage used in the composer, and why is this limit chosen?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: State → Composer → Policy Network → Action → System → Reward → Q Estimation → Composer Update
- Critical path: State → Composer → Policy Network → Action → System → Reward → Q Estimation → Composer Update
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Low parameter count (26× reduction) vs. expressiveness.
  - No critic network vs. potential bias in Q estimation.
  - Fixed alternation timing vs. adaptive switching.
- Failure signatures:
  - Divergence when PID perturbation exceeds Lipschitz bound.
  - Slow convergence if composer cannot adapt to new operating conditions.
  - Inaccurate Q estimation leading to poor composer weights.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify Time-Interleaved Lipschitz bound: Run with increasing PID perturbation and measure error growth rate.
  2. Test composer Q estimation: Compare composer-based Q estimates with critic-based estimates in simulation.
  3. Validate real-time performance: Measure inference time on target hardware (Orange Pi 5 Plus) under full system load.

## Limitations
- The theoretical foundation of the gradient-domain Laplace transform for Q-value estimation is not fully elaborated, and its convergence guarantees are unclear.
- The assumption of Lipschitz continuity through time-interleaved execution relies on worst-case bounds that may not hold under all operating conditions.
- The reliance on a lightweight network may limit the algorithm's ability to generalize to more complex tasks.
- Experimental validation is confined to a specific platform, and results may not generalize to other underactuated systems or higher-dimensional state spaces.

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The experimental results demonstrating CRL2E's superior performance in terms of tracking accuracy and convergence speed under the tested operating conditions.
- Medium Confidence: The theoretical claims regarding Lipschitz continuity and the safety of the time-interleaved module, as these rely on specific parameter choices and worst-case assumptions.
- Low Confidence: The efficacy of the gradient-domain Laplace transform for Q-value estimation, as this is a novel approach without extensive validation or comparison to critic-based methods.

## Next Checks
1. **Theoretical Validation:** Rigorously prove the Lipschitz continuity bounds for the time-interleaved module under varying classical controller parameters and disturbance scenarios.
2. **Q-Estimation Validation:** Compare the performance and accuracy of the gradient-domain Laplace transform Q-estimation with a traditional critic-based approach on a benchmark RL task.
3. **Generalization Test:** Evaluate CRL2E on a different underactuated system (e.g., a quadrotor or a different wing configuration) to assess its broader applicability and robustness.
