# Diversity of What? On the Different Conceptualizations of Diversity in Recommender Systems

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2405.02026
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02026
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Diversity conceptualization in recommender systems is highly context-dependent and influenced by organizational missions, requiring effective communication rather than standardized definitions.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates how practitioners at three Dutch public service media organizations conceptualize diversity in recommender systems. Through semi-structured interviews with 12 stakeholders, researchers identified diverse goals, aspects, and tactics for implementing diversity. Key findings include varying interpretations of diversity across organizations, with aspects ranging from content categories and user demographics to world events and societal structures. The study reveals that diversity conceptualization is highly context-dependent and influenced by organizational missions. Results show that diversity is not simply about adding more variety, but involves complex normative choices about which aspects to prioritize and how to balance competing goals. The authors conclude that a standardized definition of diversity in recommender systems is unlikely, emphasizing instead the need for effective communication of diversity's meaning within specific contexts to enable nuanced operationalizations.

## Method Summary
The study employed semi-structured interviews with 12 stakeholders from three Dutch public service media organizations (a broadcaster, news organization, and library). Researchers conducted interviews to explore practitioners' understanding of diversity goals, relevant aspects, and diversification tactics. The interview process included a recommendation exercise where participants discussed candidate item sets from each organization's catalogue. Data analysis involved inductive thematic coding to identify patterns in how practitioners conceptualized diversity, resulting in a mapping of goals, aspects, and tactics. The analysis was guided by components of diversity formalization, examining the various dimensions through which diversity is understood and implemented in these contexts.

## Key Results
- Diversity conceptualization varies significantly across organizations and is tied to their specific missions and contexts
- Effective diversity implementation requires clear communication and shared understanding within organizations about what diversity means in their specific context
- Diversity involves complex normative choices about which aspects to prioritize, going beyond simple variety metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Diversity conceptualization in recommender systems is inherently tied to organizational mission and context.
- Mechanism: Organizations interpret and operationalize diversity based on their specific goals, values, and societal role, leading to varied implementations.
- Core assumption: Different organizational missions lead to fundamentally different definitions and operationalizations of diversity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "conceptualization of diversity greatly varies" and "unlikely that a standardized conceptualization will be achieved"
  - [section 4.1] "The goal of recommendation is different for each organization, and is strongly linked to its mission"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct citations about organizational mission impact on diversity in recommender systems
- Break condition: If organizational missions become standardized or if a universal metric for diversity becomes widely adopted.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Effective diversity implementation requires clear communication and shared understanding within organizations.
- Mechanism: By mapping out goals, aspects, and tactics, stakeholders can align on what diversity means in their specific context.
- Core assumption: Lack of shared vocabulary and understanding hinders effective diversity implementation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we should focus on effective communication of what diversity in this particular system means"
  - [section 5.3] "we hope that our mapping of goals, aspects, and tactics can contribute in effectively communicating what diversity entails"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct citations about communication strategies for diversity in recommender systems
- Break condition: If stakeholders cannot agree on a common vocabulary or if organizational silos prevent effective communication.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Diversity in recommender systems involves complex normative choices about which aspects to prioritize.
- Mechanism: Organizations must make deliberate decisions about which dimensions of diversity to focus on, balancing competing goals and values.
- Core assumption: Diversity is not simply about adding more variety, but involves making value-laden choices.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "diversity is not simply about adding more variety, but involves complex normative choices"
  - [section 5.1] "different expectations on whether a recommendation should have high or low diversity"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct citations about normative choices in diversity implementation
- Break condition: If diversity becomes reduced to a purely technical metric without consideration of underlying values.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Semi-structured interviews
  - Why needed here: To explore how practitioners conceptualize diversity in their specific contexts
  - Quick check question: What is the main advantage of semi-structured interviews over structured interviews in exploratory research?

- Concept: Thematic analysis
  - Why needed here: To identify patterns and themes in how practitioners discuss diversity
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between inductive and deductive thematic analysis?

- Concept: Normative vs descriptive research
  - Why needed here: To distinguish between what diversity is and what it should be in recommender systems
  - Quick check question: How does normative research differ from descriptive research in terms of its goals and methods?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Interview protocol -> Data collection -> Coding scheme development -> Thematic analysis -> Results synthesis
- Critical path: Interview protocol → Data collection → Coding scheme development → Thematic analysis → Results synthesis
- Design tradeoffs: Balancing depth of individual interviews with breadth of organizational representation; choosing between inductive and deductive coding approaches
- Failure signatures: Inconsistent coding between researchers; difficulty reaching thematic saturation; inability to map diverse concepts to actionable tactics
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Conduct pilot interviews with 2-3 practitioners to test and refine interview protocol
  2. Apply initial coding scheme to a subset of interviews and assess inter-rater reliability
  3. Create preliminary mapping of goals, aspects, and tactics and validate with a sample of interviewees

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different cultural contexts influence the conceptualization and implementation of diversity in recommender systems?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper acknowledges that the research was conducted in the Netherlands and that cultural context shapes diversity conceptualization, noting that participants were predominantly white and male, which influences their awareness of diverse needs.
- Why unresolved: The study focused on a specific cultural context (Dutch public service media) and did not explore how diversity concepts might differ in other cultural settings.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of diversity conceptualization in recommender systems across different countries and cultural contexts, with attention to varying social norms and media landscapes.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the long-term effects of implementing different diversity tactics on user satisfaction and information exposure?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper identifies various tactics for diversification (e.g., ensuring diversity between items, catering to user-specific needs) but does not examine their long-term impacts on user behavior or satisfaction.
- Why unresolved: The study is exploratory and qualitative, focusing on current conceptualizations rather than measuring outcomes of implemented diversity strategies over time.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies tracking user engagement, satisfaction, and information exposure patterns after implementing different diversity tactics in recommender systems.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can recommender systems effectively balance the tension between reflecting existing societal biases and countering them to promote diversity?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the dilemma of whether to reflect or diverge from existing societal norms and biases, particularly in the context of library catalogs and content representation.
- Why unresolved: The study identifies this tension but does not provide a framework or methodology for resolving it in practice, highlighting the normative complexity of the issue.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies testing different approaches to balancing bias reflection and counteraction, with clear metrics for evaluating their effectiveness in promoting diversity while maintaining relevance.

## Limitations
- Small sample size of 12 participants across three organizations restricts generalizability
- Qualitative nature of interviews introduces potential researcher bias in thematic coding and interpretation
- Focus on Dutch public service media organizations may not represent other regions or commercial entities

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Diversity conceptualization varies significantly across organizations and is tied to their specific missions and contexts.
- **Medium Confidence**: Effective diversity implementation requires clear communication and shared understanding within organizations about what diversity means in their specific context.
- **Medium Confidence**: Diversity involves complex normative choices about which aspects to prioritize, going beyond simple variety metrics.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct follow-up interviews with additional public service media organizations in different countries to assess whether the identified patterns hold across diverse regulatory and cultural contexts.
2. Perform inter-rater reliability tests on a subset of interview transcripts with independent coders to validate the thematic analysis methodology and coding scheme.
3. Implement a longitudinal study tracking how diversity conceptualization and operationalization evolve at these three organizations over a 12-24 month period, particularly as their recommender systems mature.
