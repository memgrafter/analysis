# A Kernelizable Primal-Dual Formulation of the Multilinear Singular Value Decomposition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.10504
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10504
- Authors: Frederiek Wesel; Kim Batselier
- Reference count: 21
- Primary result: Derives a primal-dual formulation of MLSVD that recovers PCA/SVD as special cases and enables kernel extensions

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel primal-dual formulation of the Multilinear Singular Value Decomposition (MLSVD) by extending the Lanczos decomposition theorem to tensors. The key insight is expressing MLSVD as an optimization problem with both primal weights and dual Lagrange multipliers, which naturally recovers PCA and SVD as special cases. The formulation enables nonlinear extensions through feature maps, resulting in a kernel tensor in the dual problem. This approach provides flexibility in choosing between primal and dual formulations based on computational considerations, with the primal being advantageous for large sample sizes and the dual preferred for high-dimensional data.

## Method Summary
The method extends the Lanczos decomposition theorem to tensors, establishing coupled matrix equations that characterize the MLSVD. This enables formulation of a primal optimization problem with weights W and error matrices E, whose dual corresponds to the MLSVD of a kernel tensor K defined through feature matrices Φ1, Φ2, Φ3 and compatibility tensor C. The primal formulation operates in vector space RM1×M2×M3 with complexity O(NM²), while the dual operates in RN1×N2×N3 with complexity O(N³). The kernel tensor can be asymmetric, allowing for directed relationships in data. Implementation requires defining features Φd, choosing primal/dual formulation based on relative sizes of samples (N) versus features (M), solving the optimization problem, and extracting weights or multipliers.

## Key Results
- MLSVD can be reformulated as primal-dual optimization problem recovering both PCA and SVD as special cases
- Primal formulation is computationally advantageous for large sample sizes (O(NM²)) while dual is preferred for high-dimensional data (O(N³))
- Kernel tensor does not need to be symmetric or positive-definite, enabling asymmetric relationships in data
- Formulation is applicable to signal analysis, image processing, and deep learning tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: MLSVD can be reformulated as primal-dual optimization problem recovering PCA/SVD
- Mechanism: Extending Lanczos decomposition theorem to tensors creates coupled matrix equations enabling primal optimization with weights/error terms, whose dual corresponds to MLSVD of kernel tensor
- Core assumption: Coupled matrix equations in Theorem 3.1 hold and kernel tensor K can be defined as vec(K) := (Φ3 ⊗ Φ2 ⊗ Φ1) vec(C)
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states MLSVD recovers PCA/SVD; Theorem 3.3 establishes dual optimization equals MLSVD of kernel tensor
- Break condition: If coupled matrix equations cannot be satisfied or kernel tensor cannot be defined due to dimensionality issues

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Primal formulation advantageous for large samples, dual for high-dimensional data
- Mechanism: Primal operates in RM1×M2×M3 (O(NM²) complexity) vs dual in RN1×N2×N3 (O(N³) complexity), allowing formulation choice based on N vs M
- Core assumption: Computational complexity estimates hold and storage requirements are manageable
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states primal advantage for large samples; Remark 3.5 explicitly states computational complexities
- Break condition: If N and M are both large, neither formulation may be tractable

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Kernel tensor can be asymmetric, allowing for directed relationships
- Mechanism: Unlike traditional symmetric positive-definite kernel matrices, tensor kernel can be asymmetric through compatibility tensor C encoding asymmetric relationships
- Core assumption: MLSVD can handle asymmetric core tensors and optimization remains well-defined
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions tensor kernel need not be symmetric/positive; discussion of asymmetric kernels in KSVD context
- Break condition: If asymmetric kernel causes numerical instability or violates MLSVD assumptions

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Lanczos decomposition theorem for matrices
  - Why needed here: Extended to tensors to establish coupled matrix equations enabling primal-dual formulation
  - Quick check question: What are the shifted eigenvalue problems that characterize SVD according to Lanczos theorem?

- Concept: Multilinear Singular Value Decomposition (MLSVD)
  - Why needed here: Core decomposition being reformulated in primal-dual terms
  - Quick check question: How does MLSVD generalize SVD to higher-order tensors?

- Concept: Kernel methods and feature maps
  - Why needed here: Enable nonlinear extension of MLSVD through kernel tensor
  - Quick check question: How does kernel trick allow computation in high-dimensional feature spaces without explicit mapping?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: X ∈ RN1×N2×N3 -> Φ1, Φ2, Φ3 (feature matrices) -> C (compatibility tensor) -> W1, W2, W3 or U1, U2, U3 (weights/multipliers) -> E1, E2, E3 (error matrices) -> K (kernel tensor)

- Critical path:
  1. Define features Φd and compatibility tensor C
  2. Choose primal or dual formulation based on N vs M
  3. Solve optimization problem (primal: maximize J; dual: compute MLSVD of K)
  4. Extract weights/multipliers and reconstruct tensor

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Primal vs dual: Computational complexity (O(NM²) vs O(N³)) and storage requirements
  - Linear vs nonlinear: Choice of feature maps and kernel functions
  - Symmetry: Whether to use symmetric or asymmetric kernel tensors

- Failure signatures:
  - Ill-conditioning of optimization problem
  - Incompatibility between feature spaces
  - Numerical instability in computing kernel tensor
  - Divergence of optimization algorithm

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement linear MLSVD (features = unfoldings of data tensor) and verify recovery of standard MLSVD
  2. Compare primal and dual formulations on synthetic tensor with known properties
  3. Test nonlinear extension with polynomial kernel on image data and evaluate reconstruction quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we design generally applicable kernel functions with more than two vector inputs that capture asymmetric nature of real-world data?
- Basis in paper: Explicit discussion of potential for designing kernel functions with multiple vector inputs and need for further research
- Why unresolved: Paper provides theoretical framework but no concrete examples or guidelines for designing such kernel functions
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of specific kernel functions with multiple vector inputs demonstrating superior performance on real-world asymmetric datasets compared to existing symmetric kernels

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are most effective strategies for decomposing or approximating complex kernel tensors to leverage computational advantages of primal formulation?
- Basis in paper: Inferred from mention of primal formulation potential for approximating nonlinear kernel tensors in deep learning without specific strategies provided

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can primal formulation of MLSVD be effectively applied to approximate activated convolution kernels in CNN and multi-vector attention mechanisms in Transformer models?
- Basis in paper: Explicit suggestion of potential applications in deep learning, specifically mentioning activated convolution kernels in CNNs and multi-vector attention mechanisms in Transformers
- Why unresolved: Paper proposes these as potential applications without providing specific methodologies or experimental results
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation of primal MLSVD formulation for approximating convolution kernels in CNNs and attention mechanisms in Transformers, with performance comparisons to existing methods on standard benchmarks

## Limitations
- Scalability: Dual formulation's O(N³) complexity may limit applicability to large datasets with minimal practical scaling experiments
- Kernel Function Selection: Limited systematic evaluation of different kernel choices beyond polynomial and exponential kernels
- Numerical Stability: Asymmetric tensor kernels may introduce numerical challenges not addressed in theoretical framework

## Confidence
- Primal-dual MLSVD formulation claims: Medium confidence (solid theoretical foundation but limited empirical validation)
- Practical advantages of asymmetric kernel tensors: Low confidence (discusses potential applications but minimal concrete evidence)
- Computational complexity analysis: Medium-High confidence (standard tensor operations assumed, may not account for modern parallel optimizations)

## Next Checks
1. **Convergence Verification**: Implement and test primal optimization algorithm on synthetic tensors with known MLSVD, measuring convergence rates and solution accuracy across different regularization parameters.

2. **Asymmetric vs Symmetric Kernel Performance**: Conduct controlled experiments comparing asymmetric kernel MLSVD against symmetric counterparts on tasks involving directed relationships (e.g., citation networks or temporal data).

3. **Memory-Complexity Analysis**: Benchmark both primal and dual formulations on tensors of varying dimensions (N, M) to empirically validate theoretical complexity claims and identify practical crossover points.
