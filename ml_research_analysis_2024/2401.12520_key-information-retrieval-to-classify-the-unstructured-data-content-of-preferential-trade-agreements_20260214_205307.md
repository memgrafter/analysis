# Key Information Retrieval to Classify the Unstructured Data Content of Preferential Trade Agreements

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2401.12520
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12520
- **Reference count:** 27
- **Primary result:** BERT embeddings improve similarity scores by over 50% compared to TF-IDF for long-text classification of PTAs

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to long-text classification and prediction for Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs). The method employs embedding techniques, specifically BERT, to condense long texts and select top-k relevant paragraphs. The Context-Aware Text Partitioning (CATP) method is used to ensure semantic integrity during document segmentation. Experimental results show that the BERT embedding method significantly improves similarity scores (over 50% improvement) compared to the baseline TF-IDF model in identifying relevant paragraphs for specific questions. The approach reduces computational complexity and enhances prediction accuracy for long-text classification tasks in the domain of international trade agreements.

## Method Summary
The proposed method combines BERT embeddings with Context-Aware Text Partitioning (CATP) to classify unstructured content in PTAs. Long documents are first segmented using CATP to preserve semantic coherence, then BERT embeddings are generated for each segment. The system identifies top-k most relevant paragraphs based on similarity scores to specific questions or topics. This approach addresses the challenge of processing lengthy trade agreements by reducing computational complexity while maintaining classification accuracy. The method contrasts with traditional TF-IDF approaches by leveraging contextual understanding through transformer-based embeddings.

## Key Results
- BERT embedding method achieves over 50% improvement in similarity scores compared to TF-IDF baseline
- Top-k paragraph selection effectively identifies relevant content for specific questions
- CATP ensures semantic integrity during document segmentation, improving classification accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach leverages BERT's contextual understanding capabilities to capture semantic relationships within long documents that TF-IDF cannot detect. By embedding text segments and selecting the most relevant paragraphs, the method focuses computational resources on the most informative portions of lengthy trade agreements. The CATP method prevents the loss of contextual meaning that occurs with naive text segmentation, ensuring that selected paragraphs maintain their full semantic value for classification tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- **BERT embeddings:** Transformer-based contextual representations that capture semantic meaning beyond keyword matching. Why needed: Traditional methods like TF-IDF miss contextual relationships. Quick check: Verify embeddings capture synonyms and contextual usage correctly.
- **Context-Aware Text Partitioning (CATP):** Document segmentation that preserves semantic coherence. Why needed: Naive segmentation destroys contextual relationships. Quick check: Ensure segmented paragraphs maintain logical flow and meaning.
- **Top-k selection:** Method for identifying most relevant paragraphs based on similarity scores. Why needed: Full document processing is computationally expensive. Quick check: Validate that selected paragraphs truly contain most relevant information.
- **Similarity scoring:** Measuring relevance between questions and text segments. Why needed: Quantitative assessment of paragraph relevance. Quick check: Compare scores against human relevance judgments.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Document -> CATP Segmentation -> BERT Embedding -> Similarity Scoring -> Top-k Selection -> Classification

**Critical Path:** Document input flows through CATP segmentation, then each segment undergoes BERT embedding. Similarity scores are calculated between embeddings and query vectors, followed by top-k selection and final classification.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The method trades computational efficiency for potential loss of information from discarded paragraphs. While BERT provides superior semantic understanding, it requires significant computational resources compared to TF-IDF. The k parameter introduces a tunable tradeoff between completeness and efficiency.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor performance occurs when relevant information is split across multiple segments, when domain-specific terminology is not captured by BERT, or when the k value is set too low to capture all relevant content. The method may also fail on documents with highly irregular structures or non-standard formatting.

**First Experiments:**
1. Test baseline TF-IDF performance on the same dataset to quantify improvement margins
2. Evaluate different k values to determine optimal tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency
3. Assess performance on documents with varying lengths to establish scalability limits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance on other long-text domains (legal contracts, policy documents) remains untested
- Selection of k relevant paragraphs introduces potential bias depending on chosen threshold
- Method does not address documents with varying structures or languages beyond English PTAs examined

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** BERT embedding improvement over TF-IDF within specific PTA domain tested
- **Medium confidence:** General applicability of CATP method for long-text segmentation
- **Low confidence:** Performance on multilingual documents and non-trade agreement domains

## Next Checks
1. Test the approach on diverse long-text domains (medical records, legal contracts, academic papers) to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies to determine optimal k values across different document types and lengths
3. Evaluate model performance on non-English PTAs and documents with mixed languages to assess multilingual capabilities
