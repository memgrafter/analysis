# CEB: Compositional Evaluation Benchmark for Fairness in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2407.02408
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02408
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Introduces CEB, a Compositional Evaluation Benchmark with 11,004 samples that evaluates LLM bias across social groups and tasks using a unified three-dimensional taxonomy.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of evaluating bias in large language models across different social groups and tasks by proposing the Compositional Evaluation Benchmark (CEB). The benchmark is built on a novel compositional taxonomy that characterizes each dataset along three dimensions: bias types, social groups, and tasks. By curating diverse datasets and mapping them to this shared configuration space, CEB enables unified evaluation of bias in LLMs that was previously impossible due to incompatible metrics and heterogeneous dataset formats. The experimental results reveal that bias levels vary significantly across different dimensions, providing actionable insights for developing targeted bias mitigation strategies.

## Method Summary
CEB is developed through a systematic process of dataset curation and compositional taxonomy mapping. The authors first collect 16 existing bias evaluation datasets covering four social groups (age, gender, race, religion) and two bias types (stereotyping, toxicity) across four task types (recognition, continuation, conversation, classification). Each dataset is then mapped to the three-dimensional taxonomy configuration. For evaluation, the paper uses GPT-4 and Perspective API to score bias in generated content, with human evaluation showing good alignment. The unified framework allows for consistent comparison across datasets that previously used incompatible metrics, enabling comprehensive analysis of how bias manifests across different social groups and task types.

## Key Results
- CEB benchmark covers 11,004 samples across 16 datasets with unified evaluation metrics
- Bias levels vary significantly across social groups, with age and gender showing higher bias levels than race and religion
- Different LLM models exhibit varying bias patterns across tasks and social groups
- GPT-4 demonstrates reliable bias evaluation performance that correlates with human judgments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: The compositional taxonomy enables unified evaluation across disparate bias datasets by mapping each dataset to a shared configuration space (bias type, social group, task).
- **Mechanism**: By decomposing each dataset into the three-dimensional taxonomy, the paper can define consistent evaluation metrics that apply across different dataset formats and biases, solving the metric incompatibility problem.
- **Core assumption**: Different bias evaluation datasets can be meaningfully characterized and compared using the same three-dimensional configuration framework.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "The curation of CEB is based on our newly proposed compositional taxonomy, which characterizes each dataset from three dimensions: bias types, social groups, and tasks."
  - [section 3.4]: "With our proposed taxonomy, we could assign configurations to existing datasets, thus allowing for a unified evaluation across datasets with similar configurations."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus shows related work on fairness benchmarks but no direct comparison to compositional taxonomy approach.
- **Break condition**: If bias evaluation cannot be decomposed into the three proposed dimensions, or if datasets contain bias aspects that don't fit this framework, the unified evaluation approach fails.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: The CEB benchmark identifies specific bias mitigation opportunities by revealing how bias levels vary across different social groups and bias types.
- **Mechanism**: Experimental results show that bias manifests differently across social groups (age, gender, race, religion) and bias types (stereotyping, toxicity), providing empirical guidance for targeted bias mitigation strategies.
- **Core assumption**: Bias patterns are sufficiently consistent within specific social groups and bias types to enable targeted mitigation approaches.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "Our experiments demonstrate that the levels of bias vary across these dimensions, thereby providing guidance for the development of specific bias mitigation methods."
  - [section 6.3]: "The performance on social groups of ages and genders is generally more paramount across LLMs" and "The performance on social groups of ages and genders is generally more paramount across LLMs."
  - [corpus]: Moderate evidence - related papers discuss fairness benchmarking but don't provide the same dimensional analysis approach.
- **Break condition**: If bias patterns are too inconsistent or context-dependent to allow for targeted mitigation, or if the dimensional analysis doesn't reveal actionable patterns.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Using GPT-4 for bias evaluation provides reliable, scalable assessment that correlates with human judgments.
- **Mechanism**: GPT-4 evaluates generated content for bias using detailed prompts, with human evaluation showing good alignment, making it a viable alternative to expensive human evaluation.
- **Core assumption**: GPT-4 can serve as a sufficiently unbiased evaluator of bias, despite being an LLM that may contain its own biases.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section 6.1]: "Humans are generally aligned with GPT-4 in terms of evaluation performance in most cases" and "GPT-4's superior performance as an evaluator does not stem from an inherent bias in favor of its own generated outputs."
  - [section 5.1]: "we adopt classifier-based metrics for evaluation" including using GPT-4 for stereotyping and Perspective API for toxicity.
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus shows related work on bias evaluation but no direct comparison of GPT-4 as evaluator.
- **Break condition**: If GPT-4's own biases systematically affect its evaluations, or if human-GPT-4 alignment breaks down for specific types of bias or social groups.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Dimensionality reduction in bias evaluation
  - Why needed here: The paper reduces complex bias evaluation to three key dimensions (bias type, social group, task) to enable systematic comparison and analysis.
  - Quick check question: How would you characterize a dataset measuring gender bias in text summarization using this taxonomy?

- **Concept**: Evaluation metric standardization
  - Why needed here: Different bias datasets use incompatible metrics; standardization is essential for meaningful comparison across datasets.
  - Quick check question: What metric would you use to compare a yes/no bias detection task with a bias severity scoring task?

- **Concept**: Bias evaluation in generative models
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates bias in LLM outputs, not just static datasets, requiring methods to assess bias in generated text.
  - Quick check question: How would you evaluate whether an LLM's generated text contains stereotyping bias?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Dataset collection → Taxonomy mapping → Task-specific generation → Bias scoring (human/GPT-4/Perspective API) → Dimensional analysis
- **Critical path**: Dataset → Taxonomy mapping → Task-specific generation → Bias scoring → Analysis of dimensional patterns
- **Design tradeoffs**: Using GPT-4 for evaluation provides scalability but introduces potential evaluator bias; using multiple metrics provides comprehensive assessment but complicates comparison
- **Failure signatures**: Poor human-GPT-4 alignment indicates evaluator reliability issues; high refuse-to-answer rates suggest safety alignment interferes with bias evaluation; inconsistent patterns across dimensions suggest taxonomy limitations
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Run the taxonomy mapping on a small set of existing datasets to verify configuration assignment works as expected.
  2. Test GPT-4 bias evaluation on a small sample of LLM outputs with human verification to establish alignment.
  3. Generate a small CEB dataset for one configuration (e.g., age stereotyping in recognition task) and test evaluation pipeline end-to-end.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How can the compositional taxonomy be extended to include additional social groups (e.g., nationality, physical appearance) and bias types (e.g., "Exclusionary Norms") not currently covered?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The paper acknowledges limitations in the current scope of social groups and bias types, suggesting potential for future expansion.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper focuses on four social groups and two bias types, leaving other potentially relevant categories unexplored.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Development and validation of new datasets covering additional social groups and bias types, demonstrating their impact on LLM bias.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: What are the potential unintended consequences of using LLMs like GPT-4 to generate new evaluation datasets, and how can these be mitigated?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper discusses the use of GPT-4 for dataset generation and acknowledges the risk of incorporating inherent biases.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper does not provide specific strategies for mitigating biases introduced during dataset generation.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Empirical studies comparing datasets generated by different LLMs or with human oversight, showing reduced bias compared to GPT-4-only generation.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: How can the evaluation metrics be further unified to ensure complete consistency and comparability across all datasets and configurations in the CEB benchmark?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The paper mentions that current evaluation metrics are split into three categories, suggesting a need for further unification.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper does not propose specific solutions for unifying all evaluation metrics.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Development of a single, comprehensive evaluation metric that can be applied consistently across all tasks, bias types, and social groups in the CEB benchmark.

## Limitations

- The compositional taxonomy may not capture all aspects of bias, particularly intersectional or context-dependent biases that don't fit neatly into the three dimensions
- Reliance on GPT-4 for bias evaluation introduces potential evaluator bias, as the evaluator itself may contain inherent biases
- The benchmark focuses on four social groups and two bias types, potentially missing important categories and bias manifestations

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The compositional taxonomy as a framework for organizing bias evaluation datasets - this is well-specified and the dimensional analysis approach is clearly defined.
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of GPT-4 as a bias evaluator - while human evaluation shows good alignment, the long-term reliability and potential for systematic evaluator bias remains uncertain.
- **Medium confidence**: The actionable insights from dimensional bias patterns - the paper shows variation across dimensions, but the practical utility for developing targeted mitigation strategies needs further validation.

## Next Checks

1. Test the compositional taxonomy mapping on additional existing bias datasets not included in CEB to verify the framework generalizes beyond the curated datasets.
2. Conduct longitudinal evaluation of GPT-4's bias assessment performance across different LLM versions and updates to ensure consistency over time.
3. Implement and evaluate targeted bias mitigation strategies based on the dimensional patterns identified in CEB to verify the practical utility of the insights for bias reduction.
