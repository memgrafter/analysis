# Reasoning Abilities of Large Language Models: In-Depth Analysis on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2403.11793
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11793
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: LLMs achieve 4-14% accuracy on ARC tasks compared to human 80% performance, showing significant limitations in abstract reasoning

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates large language models' reasoning capabilities through the lens of the Language of Thought Hypothesis, focusing on logical coherence, compositionality, and productivity. Using the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark, the authors designed experiments to assess these three components of reasoning. Results demonstrate that while LLMs can perform basic image understanding and simple manipulations, they significantly lag behind human reasoning in maintaining logical consistency across related instances, combining simple components into complex solutions, and generating novel representations under constraints.

The study provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM reasoning beyond task completion, offering insights into current limitations and suggesting directions for future research to enhance their abstract reasoning capabilities.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates LLM reasoning through three experiments using the ARC benchmark. The first experiment tests logical coherence using three prompting techniques (Chain of Thought, Least to Most, and Tree of Thought) on 100 random ARC evaluation tasks, measuring both accuracy and semantic coherence. The second experiment assesses compositionality by providing LLMs with step-by-step Domain Specific Language (DSL) functions and testing their ability to select appropriate operations to solve 158 solvable ARC tasks. The third experiment evaluates productivity using Inverse Transformation Prompting (ITP) to test whether LLMs can generate valid new examples from given ARC tasks and abstract rules.

## Key Results
- LLMs achieved only 4-14% accuracy on ARC tasks compared to human performance of 80%
- 57.8% of tasks achieved below 10% accuracy on augmented examples, indicating lack of inferential coherence
- Average valid generation ratio was approximately 17.1% for novel example generation under constraints
- Accuracy degrades with increasing DSL sequence length, showing compositional limitations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: LLMs can perform basic image understanding and simple manipulations but lack inferential coherence.
- **Mechanism**: The study uses ARC tasks with augmented examples to test whether LLMs can consistently apply the same logical inference across related instances. By generating 100 additional examples per solved task using Re-ARC, the experiment isolates whether correct answers are due to pattern matching or true understanding.
- **Core assumption**: Inferential coherence requires maintaining the same logical inference across tasks sharing an underlying analogical rule.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "LLMs achieved only 4-14% accuracy on ARC tasks compared to human performance of 80%"
  - [section 3.1.3] "57.8% of tasks achieved below 10% accuracy on augmented examples"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct citations found in neighboring papers about inferential coherence testing

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: LLMs struggle with compositionality, particularly in selecting and combining DSL operations correctly.
- **Mechanism**: The study provides LLMs with step-by-step DSL functions and tests whether they can select appropriate operations to solve ARC tasks. By comparing accuracy with and without correct outputs or human descriptions, the experiment isolates compositional ability from simple pattern matching.
- **Core assumption**: Compositionality involves combining given semantics appropriately to produce desired results.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "they lag in three areas: ... Their logical reasoning abilities, especially in a step-by-step manner, are weak"
  - [section 3.2.2] "average accuracy of 9% was observed when the test output was provided, and 3% without the test output"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct citations found in neighboring papers about DSL compositionality testing

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: LLMs lack productivity in generating unseen representations under complex constraints.
- **Mechanism**: The study uses Inverse Transformation Prompting (ITP) to test whether LLMs can generate valid new examples from given ARC tasks and abstract rules. By evaluating the validity of generated examples, the experiment measures rule-based generation capacity.
- **Core assumption**: Productivity involves generating unseen expressions by combining a limited set of semantics under constraints.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "they struggle with understanding and generating unseen representations under complex constraints"
  - [section 3.3.2] "average valid generation ratio was approximately 17.1%, with the remaining examples deemed invalid"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct citations found in neighboring papers about productivity measurement through ITP

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Language of Thought Hypothesis (LoTH)**
  - Why needed here: Provides the theoretical framework for evaluating reasoning as logical coherence, compositionality, and productivity rather than just task completion
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how LoTH differs from traditional results-oriented AI evaluation approaches?

- **Concept: Domain Specific Language (DSL) for ARC**
  - Why needed here: Enables step-by-step analysis of compositional reasoning by breaking down solutions into discrete operations
  - Quick check question: What are the three parameter types used in the DSL functions and which operations use each type?

- **Concept: Prompt engineering techniques (CoT, LtM, ToT)**
  - Why needed here: Different prompting strategies reveal varying levels of reasoning coherence and help isolate LLM capabilities from prompt effects
  - Quick check question: How does Least to Most prompting differ from Chain of Thought in its approach to problem decomposition?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: ARC task parser → Object extraction (PnP algorithm) → DSL environment → LLM inference → Result validation → Augmentation module (Re-ARC) for inferential coherence testing → ITP generator for productivity testing

- **Critical path**: 1. Parse ARC task and extract objects 2. Generate appropriate prompt (CoT/LtM/ToT or DSL-based) 3. Send to LLM and receive response 4. Validate response against ground truth or generated examples 5. Analyze reasoning process for coherence assessment

- **Design tradeoffs**: Using Re-ARC augmentation provides controlled testing but may not capture all rule variations; DSL approach enables detailed analysis but limits task complexity to 10 steps; Human validation ensures quality but introduces subjectivity and scalability limitations

- **Failure signatures**: Low accuracy on augmented examples indicates lack of inferential coherence; Correct answers with incorrect reasoning steps indicate lack of semantic coherence; Degradation in accuracy with increasing DSL sequence length indicates compositional limitations

- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Implement CoT prompt comparison across 100 random ARC evaluation tasks 2. Set up Re-ARC augmentation for 400 training tasks and test inferential coherence 3. Build DSL environment and test compositionality on 158 solvable tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How does the choice of prompting technique (CoT, LtM, ToT) impact the model's ability to maintain logical coherence in ARC tasks?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper compares three prompting techniques (CoT, LtM, ToT) in terms of their impact on LLMs' logical coherence in Section 3.1.2.
- **Why unresolved**: While the paper shows that all three techniques result in low accuracy, it doesn't delve into why this is the case or whether specific prompting strategies could be developed to improve logical coherence.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Comparative analysis of different prompting techniques with a focus on their ability to elicit logical reasoning from LLMs, potentially leading to the development of more effective prompting strategies.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: How can LLMs be improved to better understand and combine DSLs for solving ARC tasks?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper identifies a lack of compositionality in LLMs when it comes to combining DSLs to solve ARC tasks in Section 3.2.
- **Why unresolved**: While the paper suggests that LLMs struggle with understanding and combining DSLs, it doesn't provide concrete solutions for improving this capability.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Development and evaluation of novel techniques or architectures that enable LLMs to better comprehend and combine DSLs for solving complex tasks.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: What are the key factors limiting LLMs' productivity in generating valid examples based on given rules?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper highlights the low productivity of LLMs in generating valid examples based on given rules in Section 3.3.
- **Why unresolved**: While the paper identifies the low productivity of LLMs, it doesn't provide a detailed analysis of the underlying factors contributing to this limitation.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: In-depth analysis of the factors limiting LLMs' productivity, potentially leading to the development of strategies to enhance their ability to generate valid examples under complex constraints.

## Limitations
- Re-ARC augmentation program may not fully capture the breadth of human-like analogical reasoning
- Human validation process for generated examples introduces subjectivity and limits scalability
- DSL environment constrains task complexity to 10 steps, potentially underestimating LLM capabilities
- Evaluation framework assumes semantic coherence can be reliably assessed through step-by-step analysis

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The empirical results showing LLMs achieving 4-14% accuracy on ARC tasks versus human 80% performance are directly measurable and reproducible.
- **Medium Confidence**: The interpretation that these results indicate fundamental limitations in LLM reasoning rather than task-specific difficulties requires additional validation across different reasoning benchmarks.
- **Medium Confidence**: The distinction between surface pattern matching and true understanding through augmented examples is methodologically sound but may not capture all dimensions of reasoning capability.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Benchmark Validation**: Test the same reasoning components (coherence, compositionality, productivity) on alternative reasoning benchmarks like PGM and RAVEN to determine if limitations are ARC-specific or general.

2. **Multi-Language LLM Testing**: Evaluate reasoning capabilities of LLMs trained on non-English corpora to assess whether observed limitations are language-dependent.

3. **Alternative Reasoning Path Analysis**: Implement a framework to identify and evaluate multiple valid solution paths for ARC tasks, distinguishing between incorrect reasoning and alternative correct approaches.
