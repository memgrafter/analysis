# Time-Aware Knowledge Representations of Dynamic Objects with Multidimensional Persistence

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.13157
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13157
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces TMP (Temporal MultiPersistence), a framework using multidimensional persistence for time-aware knowledge representation that achieves up to 59.5x faster vectorization and outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models in forecasting tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of representing time-dependent dynamic objects by introducing Temporal MultiPersistence (TMP), a novel framework that leverages multidimensional persistence theory. TMP creates stable topological fingerprints by using time as a natural slicing direction in multiparameter persistence modules, combining it with zigzag persistence to capture temporal topological features. The method produces efficient vectorizations that are compatible with machine learning models and theoretically stable. When integrated into a GNN-based architecture (TMP-Nets), TMP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models in forecasting tasks across traffic, Ethereum blockchain, and ECG datasets, particularly in limited data scenarios.

## Method Summary
TMP constructs time-aware knowledge representations by creating bifiltrations using time and spatial filtering functions, then computing zigzag persistence diagrams along the time direction for each spatial threshold. Single-parameter persistence vectorizations (landscapes, silhouettes, persistence images) are applied to these diagrams to produce multidimensional TMP arrays. These arrays are integrated into TMP-Nets, a GNN-based architecture that combines spatial graph convolutions on adaptive adjacency matrices with CNN-based processing of TMP fingerprints, followed by GRU layers for forecasting. The method is theoretically grounded with stability guarantees and demonstrates computational efficiency improvements over existing multipersistence methods.

## Key Results
- TMP-Nets consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models in forecasting tasks on traffic, Ethereum blockchain, and ECG datasets
- TMP vectorizations are up to 59.5x faster than state-of-the-art multipersistence methods
- TMP-Nets achieves relative gains of 7.89% and 3.66% over the best baseline (Z-GCNETs) on Bytom and Decentraland Ethereum datasets
- TMP demonstrates particular strength in limited data scenarios where traditional methods struggle

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** TMP vectorizations capture time-evolving topological features by combining zigzag persistence in time with multi-parameter persistence in spatial dimensions.
- **Mechanism:** The method constructs zigzag persistence diagrams along the time axis for each fixed spatial filtration threshold, then applies single-parameter persistence vectorizations to these diagrams. This produces multidimensional arrays that encode both temporal evolution and spatial structure.
- **Core assumption:** Time direction provides a natural slicing direction that avoids the partial ordering problem in multiparameter persistence.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "TMP produces multidimensional topological fingerprints by leveraging time as a natural slicing direction in multiparameter persistence modules"
  - [section]: "We overcome this problem by using the naturally inherited special direction in the data: Time"
- **Break condition:** If temporal patterns are not meaningful or the data lacks a clear time dimension, the zigzag construction becomes arbitrary and loses topological significance.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** TMP-Nets outperform baselines especially under limited data scenarios due to enhanced topological feature extraction.
- **Mechanism:** TMP-Nets integrates TMP vectorizations into a GNN framework by learning spatial graph convolutions on adaptive adjacency matrices and combining them with topological feature embeddings from TMP vectorizations. This dual embedding captures both local connectivity and global topological structure.
- **Core assumption:** Temporal topological features provide complementary information to spatial features that improves forecasting accuracy.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "TMP-Nets, a GNN-based architecture utilizing TMP fingerprints, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models"
  - [section]: "TMP-Nets achieves the best performance on Bytom and Decentraland, and the relative gains of TMP-Nets over the best baseline (i.e., Z-GCNETs) are 7.89% and 3.66%"
- **Break condition:** If the temporal topological patterns are dominated by noise or the network structure is too simple, the added complexity may not yield performance gains.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** TMP provides theoretical stability guarantees for the induced vectorizations.
- **Mechanism:** The paper proves that if the source single-parameter vectorization is stable under Wasserstein distance, then the induced TMP vectorization is stable under the induced matching distance between zigzag persistence diagrams across all spatial thresholds.
- **Core assumption:** The stability of the base vectorization transfers to the multidimensional case through the tensor structure.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "Theoretical stability guarantees and broad applicability across various time-dependent data types are also established"
  - [section]: "We now prove that when the source single parameter vectorization φ is stable, then so is its induced TMP vectorization Mφ"
- **Break condition:** If the base vectorization lacks stability or the matching distance behaves pathologically, the stability transfer may fail.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Persistent Homology**
  - Why needed here: TMP builds directly on PH concepts to capture topological features that persist across scales.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a birth time and a death time in persistent homology?

- **Concept: Zigzag Persistence**
  - Why needed here: TMP uses zigzag persistence to handle non-nested temporal sequences of graphs.
  - Quick check question: How does zigzag persistence differ from standard persistent homology in terms of filtration requirements?

- **Concept: Multiparameter Persistence**
  - Why needed here: TMP extends PH to multiple filtering parameters while using time as a natural slicing direction.
  - Quick check question: Why does multiparameter persistence face challenges with barcode decomposition that single-parameter persistence does not?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data preprocessing -> TMP vectorization (filtering + zigzag PH + vectorization) -> TMP-Nets (spatial GNN + topological feature CNN + GRU fusion) -> Model training -> Forecasting output

- **Critical path:**
  1. Construct bifiltrations using time and spatial filtering functions
  2. Compute zigzag persistence diagrams for each spatial threshold
  3. Apply single-parameter vectorizations to obtain multidimensional TMP arrays
  4. Feed TMP arrays and spatial features into TMP-Nets
  5. Train end-to-end for forecasting

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Higher resolution spatial filtering increases computational cost but captures finer topological detail
  - Choice of vectorization method (landscapes vs. silhouettes vs. images) affects stability and representational power
  - Using landmark-based TMP could reduce computation for large graphs at potential information loss

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Poor performance on datasets with weak temporal patterns
  - High variance in results indicating sensitivity to parameter choices
  - Computational bottlenecks when using high-dimensional filtrations

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Baseline comparison: TMP-Nets vs. Z-GCNETs on Ethereum blockchain data with varying time windows
  2. Ablation study: Remove TMP vectorizations to isolate their contribution to forecasting accuracy
  3. Parameter sensitivity: Vary number of spatial thresholds and vectorization resolution to find optimal configuration

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the theoretical foundation for multiparameter persistence modules, and how does the partial ordering of the threshold set in higher dimensions affect the existence of barcode decomposition?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the fundamental challenges in multipersistence theory, particularly the non-existence of barcode decomposition due to the partially ordered structure of the index set in higher dimensions.
- Why unresolved: The paper states that complete generalization of single persistence to multipersistence is out of reach for now due to these theoretical issues.
- What evidence would resolve it: A proof or counterexample showing whether barcode decomposition exists for general multipersistence modules in higher dimensions would resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can TMP be scaled to handle ultra high-dimensional processes and large-scale streaming data in real-time applications?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that scaling for ultra high-dimensional processes, especially in modern data streaming scenarios, may be infeasible for TMP, and suggests exploring algorithms based on landmarks or pruning to advance computational efficiency.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the computational complexity challenge but does not provide a concrete solution or algorithm for scaling TMP to handle ultra high-dimensional processes and streaming data.
- What evidence would resolve it: A demonstration of TMP's performance on ultra high-dimensional processes and streaming data, along with a comparison to other methods, would provide evidence of its scalability.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal choice of filtering functions and thresholds for TMP in different applications and data types?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the choice of filtering functions (e.g., degree, closeness, betweenness, transaction amount) and thresholds for TMP in the context of Ethereum blockchain networks, but does not provide a general guideline for other applications or data types.
- Why unresolved: The paper shows that the choice of filtering functions and thresholds can affect the computational time and performance of TMP, but does not provide a systematic approach to selecting the optimal combination for different applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study comparing the performance of TMP with different filtering functions and thresholds on various data types and applications would provide insights into the optimal choices.

## Limitations
- TMP's computational complexity may become prohibitive for ultra high-dimensional processes and large-scale streaming data
- The framework relies on the existence of a meaningful time dimension, limiting applicability to non-temporal data
- The choice of filtering functions and threshold resolution significantly impacts performance but lacks systematic selection guidelines

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The core TMP framework construction and its compatibility with existing single-parameter persistence vectorizations are well-founded mathematically
- **Medium Confidence:** The stability guarantees transfer correctly from base vectorizations to the multidimensional case, pending verification of specific vectorization properties
- **Medium Confidence:** The empirical performance improvements over baselines, though significant, may be partially dataset-dependent and require broader validation across different dynamic network types

## Next Checks

1. **Theoretical Verification:** Rigorously test the stability transfer claim by analyzing specific vectorization methods (landscapes, silhouettes, persistence images) under various matching distance configurations to identify potential failure modes.

2. **Computational Scalability:** Evaluate TMP-Nets performance on progressively larger graphs (100K+ nodes) to identify bottlenecks and assess the trade-offs between full persistence computation and landmark-based approximations.

3. **Robustness Testing:** Conduct experiments on synthetic dynamic networks with controlled topological noise to quantify TMP's sensitivity to data perturbations and verify stability claims empirically.
