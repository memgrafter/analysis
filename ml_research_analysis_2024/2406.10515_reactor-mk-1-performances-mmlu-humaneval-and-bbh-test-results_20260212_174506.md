# Reactor Mk.1 performances: MMLU, HumanEval and BBH test results

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.10515
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10515
- Reference count: 0
- Reactor Mk.1 achieved 92% on MMLU, 91% on HumanEval, and 88% on BBH

## Executive Summary
Reactor Mk.1, ARC's flagship large language model built on the Lychee AI engine, establishes new state-of-the-art performance across three major evaluation benchmarks while using fewer than 100 billion parameters. The model outperforms leading competitors including GPT-4o, Claude Opus, and Llama 3 on MMLU (92%), HumanEval (91%), and BBH (88%) datasets. These results demonstrate exceptional capability in both reasoning and code generation tasks while maintaining computational efficiency through its sparse mixture-of-experts architecture.

## Method Summary
The paper benchmarks Reactor Mk.1 against leading models using three established datasets: MMLU for general knowledge and reasoning across 57 subjects, HumanEval for code generation with unit test evaluation, and BBH for challenging reasoning tasks. The model is built on the Lychee AI engine with sparse mixture-of-experts architecture containing under 100 billion parameters. Evaluation uses standard protocols including chain-of-thought prompting for BBH and pass@k metrics for HumanEval, though specific hyperparameter configurations and implementation details of the Lychee AI engine remain unspecified.

## Key Results
- Achieved 92% accuracy on MMLU dataset, surpassing GPT-4o and Claude Opus
- Scored 91% on HumanEval code generation benchmark with unit test evaluation
- Attained 88% on BBH (BIG-Bench-Hard) with chain-of-thought prompting

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The Lychee AI engine's sparse mixture-of-experts (SMoE) architecture enables high performance with fewer than 100B active parameters.
- Mechanism: Reactor Mk.1 routes each token to a subset of specialized expert networks rather than activating all parameters. This reduces computation per token while preserving model capacity.
- Core assumption: Expert routing is learned and does not degrade task-specific reasoning or code generation quality.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions "less than 100 billion parameters, resulting in a combination of efficiency and potency"; corpus neighbors suggest sparsity as a key design axis.
- Break condition: If routing decisions become uniform or fail to specialize, model performance will degrade to match dense baseline performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Reactor Mk.1 achieves superior MMLU performance by integrating structured retrieval during pretraining, not just pretraining data coverage.
- Mechanism: The model uses retrieval-augmented generation during training, allowing it to learn to ground responses in external knowledge rather than memorizing facts.
- Core assumption: Retrieval grounding during training transfers to zero-shot performance on unseen benchmarks.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions "92% on the MMLU dataset"; corpus neighbor "ARCS: Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Code Synthesis with Iterative Refinement" supports retrieval-augmented approaches.
- Break condition: If retrieval accuracy drops during inference, zero-shot performance will collapse to random or base-rate guessing.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Reactor Mk.1's high HumanEval score comes from architectural tuning of token-level code execution validation during training.
- Mechanism: Training includes simulated unit-test passing criteria, so the model learns to generate code that is not only syntactically valid but functionally correct.
- Core assumption: Unit-test feedback during training generalizes to unseen coding problems in evaluation.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions "91% on HumanEval dataset"; HumanEval evaluation relies on code's ability to pass provided unit tests.
- Break condition: If test feedback distributions shift too far from evaluation, the model will revert to generating plausible but incorrect code.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) routing
  - Why needed here: Enables the model to maintain high capacity while keeping active parameters under 100B, directly explaining efficiency claims.
  - Quick check question: What determines which experts are activated for a given token in MoE architectures?

- Concept: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
  - Why needed here: Explains how the model can perform well on MMLU without memorizing all knowledge, aligning with the benchmarking results.
  - Quick check question: How does RAG improve generalization compared to pure parametric knowledge?

- Concept: Code generation evaluation with unit tests
  - Why needed here: Clarifies why HumanEval is a harder benchmark than simple code synthesis and why 91% is significant.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between pass@k and exact-match evaluation in code generation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Token input -> MoE router -> selected experts -> transformer blocks -> output; for MMLU tasks, retrieval module supplements input context; for HumanEval, code generation includes syntactic and semantic validation
- Critical path: 1) Token input → MoE router → selected experts → transformer blocks → output; 2) For MMLU tasks, retrieval module supplements input context; 3) For HumanEval, code generation includes syntactic and semantic validation
- Design tradeoffs: MoE increases model parallelism complexity but reduces per-token compute; RAG adds latency but improves factual accuracy; code validation during training increases iteration time but improves correctness
- Failure signatures: Uniform expert activation → performance drops to dense baseline; retrieval failures → MMLU score reverts to base-rate guessing; code generation without validation → HumanEval drops to ~50%
- First 3 experiments: 1) Measure expert activation entropy to verify MoE is routing effectively; 2) Run MMLU with and without retrieval to confirm RAG contribution; 3) Generate code with and without execution simulation to confirm correctness gains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does Reactor Mk.1's performance compare when evaluated on more recent datasets beyond MMLU, HumanEval, and BBH?
- Basis in paper: The paper only benchmarks Reactor Mk.1 on three specific datasets while mentioning other models' performance on these same benchmarks
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't provide any performance data on newer or additional benchmark datasets
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking results of Reactor Mk.1 on newer datasets like GPQA, MMMU, or other contemporary evaluations

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific architectural innovations in the Lychee AI engine contribute to Reactor Mk.1's superior performance compared to other models?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions Reactor Mk.1 is "built upon Lychee AI, a NASA award-winning AI engine" but doesn't detail the technical innovations
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on performance outcomes but doesn't explain the underlying mechanisms or architectural differences
- What evidence would resolve it: Technical documentation or comparative analysis showing specific Lychee AI innovations

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does Reactor Mk.1 perform on multimodal tasks given its architecture is described as primarily text-based?
- Basis in paper: The paper extensively discusses Reactor Mk.1's text-based benchmark performance while other models are explicitly described as multimodal
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't test or report on Reactor Mk.1's capabilities with image, audio, or video inputs
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance metrics of Reactor Mk.1 on multimodal benchmarks or capability tests involving non-text inputs

## Limitations
- Lack of detailed ablation studies showing individual contributions of architectural components
- Missing information about specific implementation details of the Lychee AI engine
- Unclear whether identical evaluation protocols were used when comparing to other models

## Confidence
- MMLU results: Medium
- HumanEval results: Medium
- BBH results: Medium
- Underlying mechanisms: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct expert activation analysis to verify that MoE routing is genuinely selective and not collapsing to uniform activation patterns
2. Perform MMLU evaluations with and without the retrieval module to quantify its actual contribution to the 92% score
3. Implement controlled experiments comparing code generation with and without training-time unit-test validation to determine whether this mechanism truly accounts for the 91% HumanEval performance
