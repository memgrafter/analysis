# SAAS: Solving Ability Amplification Strategy for Enhanced Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.03887
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03887
- Reference count: 24
- Outperforms existing methods by up to 7.71% on average across model sizes

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SAAS, a sequential learning approach that transitions from Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to Program-of-Thought (PoT) learning to enhance mathematical reasoning in LLMs. By first learning logical reasoning through CoT and then amplifying problem-solving ability through PoT, SAAS effectively combines the strengths of both approaches. A cognitive retention strategy ensures mathematical reasoning skills are maintained during the PoT phase. Experimental results on benchmarks including MATH, GSM8K, and others show SAAS achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by up to 7.71% on average across model sizes. The approach demonstrates significant improvements in solving challenging mathematical problems that require both reasoning and accurate computation.

## Method Summary
SAAS employs a two-phase sequential learning approach: first, the model is fine-tuned on Chain-of-Thought rationales to establish mathematical reasoning capabilities, then it undergoes fine-tuning on Program-of-Thought rationales while incorporating a cognitive retention strategy that mixes in CoT examples. This prevents forgetting of reasoning skills while the model learns computational precision. The approach uses synthetically generated datasets from existing mathematical reasoning benchmarks, and demonstrates that this sequential learning strategy outperforms both individual approaches and simultaneous learning methods.

## Key Results
- SAAS achieves state-of-the-art performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks
- The sequential learning approach shows consistent improvements over single-phase methods
- Performance gains scale with reasoning complexity, showing greater advantages on harder problems
- Cognitive retention strategy effectively prevents deterioration of mathematical reasoning skills

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Sequential learning from CoT to PoT amplifies problem-solving ability because CoT first establishes logical reasoning skills that PoT then leverages for accurate computation
- Mechanism: The model first learns step-by-step logical reasoning through CoT, creating a foundation of mathematical reasoning ability. This foundation is then utilized during PoT learning where the model can translate reasoning steps into precise code while maintaining the logical understanding
- Core assumption: Mathematical reasoning ability developed during CoT learning transfers and enhances computational accuracy during PoT learning
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "prioritizing the learning of mathematical reasoning ability is helpful for the amplification of problem-solving ability"
  - [section 2.2] "we hypothesize that prioritizing the learning of mathematical reasoning ability is helpful for the amplification of problem-solving ability"
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers focus on different aspects of mathematical reasoning but don't directly validate the sequential learning hypothesis
- Break condition: If the mathematical reasoning skills learned during CoT phase deteriorate during PoT phase, the amplification effect disappears

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The cognitive retention strategy prevents forgetting of mathematical reasoning skills during PoT learning by mixing CoT rationales with PoT rationales
- Mechanism: During PoT learning phase, CoT rationales are randomly sampled and included alongside PoT rationales. This mixed training prevents the model from losing its reasoning capabilities while adapting to code-based problem-solving
- Core assumption: Mathematical reasoning skills are susceptible to forgetting during domain shifts, and mixing training data can preserve these skills
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.2] "we observed that focusing exclusively on PoT rationales during this phase leads to a deterioration in mathematical reasoning ability"
  - [section 3.2.2] "reverse SAAS without cognitive retention strategy shows a lower accuracy than combining of CoT and PoT learning"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence about forgetting prevention through mixed training in related papers
- Break condition: If the ratio of CoT to PoT examples is too low, reasoning skills may still deteriorate despite the cognitive retention strategy

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Different mathematical reasoning tasks require different reasoning depths, and SAAS's sequential approach scales better with reasoning complexity
- Mechanism: As problems require more reasoning steps, the logical foundation from CoT learning becomes increasingly important for maintaining accuracy, while PoT provides computational precision
- Core assumption: The difficulty gap between basic and complex mathematical problems increases with reasoning depth, making sequential learning more valuable for harder problems
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2.3] "as the reasoning steps in a mathematical problem extend (i.e., the difficulty increases), especially the step 5 or above, the difference between our SAAS and other strategies becomes more pronounced"
  - [section 3.2.4] Shows SAAS combining both precise computation and enhanced reasoning compared to individual approaches
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers don't specifically address scaling with reasoning depth
- Break condition: If the model's reasoning depth is limited by architecture constraints, the sequential advantage may plateau

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
  - Why needed here: Understanding how step-by-step reasoning works is fundamental to grasping why CoT learning is the first phase in SAAS
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how CoT differs from direct answer generation in terms of model behavior?

- Concept: Program-of-Thought (PoT) and code execution
  - Why needed here: PoT represents the second phase where reasoning steps are converted to code, so understanding this mechanism is crucial for understanding the transition
  - Quick check question: How does PoT address the arithmetic calculation errors that CoT approaches suffer from?

- Concept: Sequential learning and knowledge transfer
  - Why needed here: The core innovation is the sequential transition from CoT to PoT, requiring understanding of how learning phases can build upon each other
  - Quick check question: What would happen if we reversed the learning order (PoT first, then CoT)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data synthesis pipeline (generating CoT and PoT rationales from seed datasets)
  - Two-phase training framework (CoT phase → PoT phase with cognitive retention)
  - Evaluation suite (in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks)
  - Base model (CodeLLaMA 13B as starting point)

- Critical path: Data synthesis → CoT fine-tuning → PoT fine-tuning with cognitive retention → Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: 
  - Sequential learning vs. simultaneous learning of both reasoning and computation
  - Cognitive retention ratio vs. computational efficiency
  - Model size vs. training resource constraints

- Failure signatures:
  - If CoT phase is too short, reasoning foundation will be weak
  - If cognitive retention ratio is too low, reasoning skills will deteriorate
  - If seed datasets lack diversity, model will not generalize well

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare CoT-only vs PoT-only vs SAAS on GSM8K to validate sequential learning benefit
  2. Test different cognitive retention ratios (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%) to find optimal balance
  3. Evaluate performance on reasoning-step stratified subsets to confirm scaling advantage with complexity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal sequence and proportion of CoT and PoT data during the PoT learning phase to maximize mathematical reasoning and problem-solving abilities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention using a cognitive retention strategy that randomly samples CoT rationales and incorporates them into the PoT learning phase, but they do not explore different ratios or sequences of CoT/PoT data.
- Why unresolved: The paper only describes a single approach to mixing CoT and PoT data during the PoT phase, without experimenting with different ratios or sequences.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments testing different proportions of CoT vs PoT data during the PoT learning phase (e.g., 10% CoT/90% PoT, 25% CoT/75% PoT, etc.) and different sequences of presentation (e.g., alternating batches, grouped batches).

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does SAAS performance scale with different base model sizes, particularly beyond the 34B parameter limit tested in this study?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state they could not fine-tune a 70B model due to hardware constraints, but mention SAAS with 10.7B showed similar performance to ToRA with 70B.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide comprehensive scaling results for very large models (70B+), which would be important for understanding the approach's effectiveness at different scales.
- What evidence would resolve it: Complete scaling experiments across a wider range of model sizes including 70B and larger models, with performance comparisons to baseline approaches.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the cognitive retention strategy affect the model's ability to retain reasoning skills over time, particularly after the training period ends?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors propose a cognitive retention strategy to prevent deterioration of mathematical reasoning during the PoT phase, but do not evaluate long-term retention or forgetting.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on training performance but does not investigate how well the model maintains its reasoning abilities during inference or after extended periods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Long-term studies measuring performance degradation over time, retention tests after different intervals, and comparison of models trained with vs without cognitive retention.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does SAAS perform on mathematical reasoning tasks that require domain-specific knowledge beyond standard arithmetic and algebra?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The benchmarks used are primarily focused on arithmetic and standard mathematical problem-solving, with limited evaluation of domain-specific mathematical reasoning.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not test the model's ability to handle specialized mathematical domains like advanced calculus, abstract algebra, or mathematical proofs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments using specialized mathematical datasets (e.g., proof-based problems, advanced theoretical mathematics, or domain-specific applications) to evaluate generalization to more complex mathematical reasoning tasks.

## Limitations

- The paper relies entirely on synthetically generated data rather than human-annotated datasets, which may introduce biases
- The cognitive retention strategy lacks systematic exploration of optimal parameters
- Limited investigation into whether sequential learning benefits transfer to non-mathematical reasoning domains

## Confidence

- High confidence: The sequential learning approach shows consistent improvements over single-phase methods across multiple benchmarks and model sizes
- Medium confidence: The cognitive retention strategy effectively prevents reasoning skill deterioration, though optimal parameters remain unspecified  
- Medium confidence: The scaling advantage with reasoning complexity is demonstrated, but the upper bounds of this benefit are not fully explored

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study on cognitive retention ratio**: Systematically test different CoT-to-PoT mixing ratios (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) during the PoT phase to identify the optimal balance between computational accuracy and reasoning preservation.

2. **Generalization to non-mathematical reasoning**: Evaluate SAAS on logical reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and other non-mathematical reasoning tasks to determine if the sequential learning benefits transfer beyond mathematical domains.

3. **Alternative sequential orderings**: Compare SAAS against reversed sequential learning (PoT-then-CoT) and parallel learning approaches to isolate whether the specific order matters or if sequential learning itself is the key factor.
