# TCAN: Animating Human Images with Temporally Consistent Pose Guidance using Diffusion Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.09012
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09012
- Reference count: 40
- Achieves FID-VID of 29.74 and FVD of 189.77 on TikTok dataset

## Executive Summary
TCAN is a pose-driven human image animation framework that achieves temporally consistent video synthesis by leveraging pre-trained ControlNet without fine-tuning. The key innovation is the Appearance-Pose Adaptation (APPA) layer, which aligns appearance and pose features through low-rank adaptation while keeping ControlNet frozen to preserve its pre-acquired knowledge. The method introduces a Pose-driven Temperature Map (PTM) to maintain static backgrounds and a Temporal ControlNet to handle pose estimation errors across frames. On the TikTok dataset, TCAN achieves state-of-the-art performance with FID-VID of 29.74 and FVD of 189.77, outperforming baselines like MagicAnimate and Disco. The method generalizes effectively to unseen domains like chibi animation characters while maintaining identity and temporal consistency.

## Method Summary
TCAN builds on pre-trained ControlNet (frozen) for pose conditioning, using a two-stage training approach. In stage 1, an Appearance-Pose Adaptation (APPA) layer aligns appearance features from the source image with pose features using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). In stage 2, temporal layers are added to both the denoising UNet and ControlNet to create Temporal ControlNet, which smooths pose sequences across frames. A Pose-driven Temperature Map (PTM) modulates temporal attention scores based on pose distance to maintain static backgrounds. The framework generates videos by progressively denoising latent representations while conditioning on both appearance and temporally smoothed pose sequences.

## Key Results
- Achieves FID-VID of 29.74 and FVD of 189.77 on TikTok dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines
- Successfully generalizes to unseen domains including chibi animation characters
- Maintains identity preservation and temporal consistency across frames

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Freezing ControlNet preserves its pre-acquired pose knowledge while preventing overfitting to the target domain.
- Mechanism: By keeping ControlNet frozen, TCAN avoids domain-specific fine-tuning that would distort the general pose conditioning capability learned from large-scale pose-image-caption pairs.
- Core assumption: The pre-trained ControlNet has sufficient generalization capability across domains, and its pose conditioning knowledge transfers effectively to unseen domains.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "In contrast to previous methods, we utilize the pre-trained ControlNet without fine-tuning to leverage its extensive pre-acquired knowledge from numerous pose-image-caption pairs."
  - [section 3.1] "To leverage the well-generalized pose conditioning capability of the pre-trained ControlNet, we opted to freeze the ControlNet in the first stage"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related papers focus on pose-driven animation but don't directly address frozen ControlNet benefits
- Break condition: If the pre-trained ControlNet's pose knowledge is domain-specific rather than general, freezing it would prevent adaptation to target domain characteristics.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: APPA layer aligns appearance and pose features through low-rank adaptation while keeping ControlNet frozen.
- Mechanism: The APPA layer uses LoRA to create adaptation matrices that bridge the feature space gap between appearance features from the appearance UNet and pose features from frozen ControlNet, enabling effective feature fusion.
- Core assumption: The misalignment between appearance and pose features is primarily a low-rank transformation that can be captured by LoRA adaptation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1] "By introducing the Appearance-Pose Adaptation (APPA) layer, we effectively address artifacts caused by frozen ControlNet adaptation."
  - [section 3.1] "We implement the APPA layer by employing low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to the existing attention layers of the denoising UNet"
  - [corpus] Missing evidence - no corpus papers specifically discuss LoRA-based feature alignment in this context
- Break condition: If the feature misalignment requires higher-rank transformations than LoRA can provide, or if the appearance-pose feature spaces are fundamentally incompatible.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Pose-driven Temperature Map (PTM) maintains static backgrounds by smoothing attention scores for background regions based on pose distance.
- Mechanism: PTM creates a distance map from pose keypoints, then uses this to modulate temporal attention scores, reducing background flickering by decreasing temporal attention for regions far from dynamic objects.
- Core assumption: Background regions have less specific temporal focus than foreground regions, and this can be captured through distance-based attention modulation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3] "Through the analysis of attention maps over the temporal axis, we also designed a novel temperature map leveraging pose information, allowing for a more static background."
  - [section 3.3] "Consequently, we designed a temperature map to smooth the attention scores far from the dynamic object."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related papers don't discuss temperature-based background stabilization
- Break condition: If background flickering is caused by factors other than temporal attention (e.g., appearance domain shift), PTM would be ineffective.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Diffusion models and denoising process
  - Why needed here: TCAN builds on diffusion models for video generation, requiring understanding of the forward noising and reverse denoising processes
  - Quick check question: How does the denoising UNet progressively remove noise from latent representations during inference?

- Concept: ControlNet architecture and conditioning
  - Why needed here: TCAN leverages pre-trained ControlNet for pose conditioning, requiring understanding of how ControlNet injects conditions into the denoising process
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the cross-attention mechanism in ControlNet for condition injection?

- Concept: Temporal consistency in video generation
  - Why needed here: TCAN specifically addresses temporal consistency through Temporal ControlNet and PTM, requiring understanding of temporal attention mechanisms
  - Quick check question: How do temporal layers in video diffusion models maintain consistency across frames?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Pre-trained ControlNet (frozen) -> Denoising UNet -> Output video
  Appearance UNet -> Denoising UNet -> Output video
  Appearance and pose features -> APPA layer -> Denoised output

- Critical path: Source image → Appearance UNet → Denoising UNet → Output video
  Pose sequence → ControlNet → Denoising UNet → Output video
  Appearance and pose features → APPA layer → Denoised output

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Freezing ControlNet vs fine-tuning: Trade generalization for domain adaptation
  - APPA layer complexity vs feature alignment effectiveness
  - Temporal ControlNet vs simpler pose smoothing approaches
  - PTM hyperparameters vs background stability vs foreground responsiveness

- Failure signatures:
  - Identity loss in foreground: Indicates APPA layer ineffective or ControlNet conditioning insufficient
  - Background flickering: Suggests PTM parameters need adjustment or temporal consistency issue
  - Severe artifacts in driving poses: Points to Temporal ControlNet insufficient for pose smoothing
  - Texture degradation: Indicates feature misalignment not properly addressed by APPA

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation study: Compare TCAN with frozen vs unfrozen ControlNet on identity preservation metrics
  2. PTM sensitivity: Test different PTM scaling parameters (τP T M) on background stability metrics
  3. Temporal ControlNet effectiveness: Compare TCAN with and without Temporal ControlNet on pose smoothing metrics using erroneous pose inputs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but several important research directions emerge from the methodology and limitations discussed:

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed pose-driven temperature map (PTM) perform when applied to domains beyond human animation, such as non-human characters or abstract motion?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates PTM on human and chibi animation characters but does not explore other domains like animals, vehicles, or abstract shapes.
- Why unresolved: The authors focus on human-centric datasets (TikTok, Bizarre Pose Dataset) and do not test PTM's generalization to non-human motion patterns or objects without traditional foreground/background distinctions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing PTM on datasets with diverse subjects (e.g., animal videos, robotic motion, abstract shape animations) and comparing performance metrics like temporal consistency and artifact reduction.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of using different pose estimation models (e.g., MediaPipe, AlphaPose) on the temporal consistency and identity preservation of TCAN?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses OpenPose but mentions that the quality of generated outputs relies on the accuracy of the pose estimator, making them inherently susceptible to inaccuracies.
- Why unresolved: While the paper acknowledges the importance of pose estimator accuracy, it does not empirically compare different pose estimation models or analyze how their specific characteristics (e.g., keypoint detection accuracy, noise patterns) affect TCAN's performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments using multiple pose estimation models (e.g., MediaPipe, AlphaPose, HRNet) on the same datasets and comparing TCAN's performance metrics (FID-VID, FVD, user study scores) across models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does TCAN's performance scale with video length, and what are the limitations of the current long-term video prediction approach using MultiDiffusion?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions memory constraints prevent generating long-term videos all at once and uses MultiDiffusion for long-term video prediction, but does not analyze performance degradation or computational costs with increasing video length.
- Why unresolved: The paper only briefly mentions the MultiDiffusion approach for long-term video generation without providing quantitative analysis of how temporal consistency, identity preservation, or quality metrics change as video length increases.
- What evidence would resolve it: Generating videos of varying lengths (e.g., 30, 60, 120 frames) and measuring performance degradation in terms of identity drift, temporal consistency (FID-VID, FVD), and computational requirements (GPU memory, inference time).

## Limitations
- Limited generalization testing beyond one alternative domain (chibi characters)
- Computational overhead not quantified despite claiming "slightly heavier" than baselines
- Heavy dependence on pose estimator quality with limited analysis of failure modes

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Core mechanism of frozen ControlNet with APPA layers is well-supported by ablation studies and quantitative metrics
- Medium Confidence: PTM effectiveness for background stabilization demonstrated qualitatively but lacks comprehensive quantitative validation
- Medium Confidence: Two-stage training approach is methodologically sound but contribution of each stage needs more granular analysis

## Next Checks
1. Cross-Domain Robustness Test: Evaluate TCAN on at least 3 additional unseen domains beyond chibi characters to assess generalization limits and identify failure patterns
2. Pose Corruption Analysis: Systematically test TCAN with driving poses containing varying degrees and types of errors to quantify Temporal ControlNet's effectiveness and identify failure thresholds
3. Computational Overhead Benchmark: Measure and compare TCAN's inference time, memory usage, and parameter count against baseline methods on identical hardware to quantify practical deployment cost
