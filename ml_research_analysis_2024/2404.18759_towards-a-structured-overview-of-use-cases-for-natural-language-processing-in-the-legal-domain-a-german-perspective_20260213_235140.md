# Towards A Structured Overview of Use Cases for Natural Language Processing in the Legal Domain: A German Perspective

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.18759
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18759
- Reference count: 3
- Primary result: Identifies significant misalignment between NLP research trends and practical legal needs, with contract generation as a high-demand use case poorly represented in current research

## Executive Summary
This study bridges the gap between Legal NLP research and practical legal applications through a systematic literature review and interviews with German legal professionals. The research identifies seven NLP technology categories and 22 legal use cases, revealing that information extraction is both the most prevalent technology and desired use case. A striking finding is the misalignment between research focus (LLMs) and practitioner needs, with contract generation emerging as a high-demand use case mentioned 10 times by interviewees but only once in literature. The study also catalogs 15 ethical, legal, and social aspects (ELSA) concerns, with data protection, compliance, and AI making final decisions as primary implementation barriers.

## Method Summary
The study employed a two-part methodology combining a systematic literature review (SLR) with semi-structured interviews. The SLR searched four databases using a comprehensive query, screening 49 peer-reviewed papers through five exclusion criteria to extract NLP technologies, ELSA concerns, and legal use cases. Simultaneously, 18 semi-structured interviews were conducted with German legal professionals, exploring their use of digital tools, repetitive tasks, desired future use cases, and ELSA concerns. Thematic content analysis was applied to interview transcripts, with results cross-referenced against literature findings to identify discrepancies and patterns.

## Key Results
- Information extraction identified as most prevalent NLP technology (18 mentions) and desired use case (12 literature, 8 interview mentions)
- Contract generation discrepancy: 10 interview mentions vs 1 literature mention
- Document classification: 10 literature mentions vs 0 interview mentions
- 79 total ELSA mentions across interviews and literature, with data protection (5 interviews), compliance (11 interviews), and AI making final decisions (10 interviews) as primary concerns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Structured overviews align NLP research with legal practice needs by identifying specific use cases
- Mechanism: The systematic literature review (SLR) and semi-structured interviews (SSIs) create a comprehensive mapping between NLP technologies and practical legal tasks, revealing gaps between research focus and practitioner needs
- Core assumption: Legal professionals can articulate their needs and NLP researchers can translate those needs into technical solutions
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the study of use cases has fallen behind, leading to a number of innovative technical methods without a place in practice"
  - [section] "Information extraction as the most prevalent NLP technology (18 mentions) and information extraction as the most desired use case (12 mentions in literature, 8 in interviews)"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: ELSA concerns identified through mixed methods provide actionable guidance for responsible NLP development
- Mechanism: Combining SLR findings (18 papers mentioning ELSA) with interview data (79 total ELSA mentions) creates a comprehensive risk assessment framework that highlights practical implementation barriers
- Core assumption: Ethical, legal, and social concerns directly impact adoption and implementation of NLP tools in legal practice
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "ELSA concerns were widespread, with 79 total mentions across interviews and literature, particularly around data protection (5 interviews), compliance (11 interviews), and AI making final decisions (10 interviews)"
  - [section] "Legal compliance was a very common concern, and many interviewees seemingly valued it more than other aspects such as security or transparency"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Identifying technology-use case mismatches reveals research directions for practical impact
- Mechanism: The discrepancy between contract generation (10 interview mentions, 1 literature mention) and document classification (10 literature mentions, 0 interview mentions) highlights where NLP research should redirect efforts
- Core assumption: Research impact is maximized when focused on high-demand, low-supply use cases
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Contract generation emerged as a key discrepancy, mentioned 10 times by interviewees but only once in literature"
  - [section] "The divide between state-of-the-art NLP research and the needs of legal practitioners thus raises the question of whether the objectives of Legal NLP research and practical Legal Tech use cases are aligned"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Systematic Literature Review methodology
  - Why needed here: Provides structured, reproducible method for identifying NLP technologies in legal domain
  - Quick check question: What are the five exclusion criteria used in the SLR filtering process?

- Concept: Semi-Structured Interview design and analysis
  - Why needed here: Captures practitioner perspectives that complement literature findings and reveal practical implementation barriers
  - Quick check question: How many interview questions were asked, and what was the primary purpose of the thematic content analysis?

- Concept: Ethical, Legal, and Social Aspects (ELSA) framework
  - Why needed here: Provides structured approach to identifying and categorizing concerns that impact NLP adoption in sensitive legal contexts
  - Quick check question: What are the three main categories of ELSA concerns identified in the study?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Database search → SLR filtering → Technology/use case extraction → Interview design → Data collection → Thematic analysis → ELSA identification → Discrepancy mapping → Synthesis

- Critical path: Database search → SLR filtering → Use case extraction → Interview design → Data collection → Thematic analysis → ELSA identification → Discrepancy mapping → Synthesis

- Design tradeoffs: Depth vs breadth in interview questions (open-ended allows discovery but requires more analysis time) vs comprehensive literature coverage (exhaustive search ensures completeness but may include less relevant papers)

- Failure signatures: If interview saturation not reached (new themes emerging in later interviews), if ELSA concerns not actionable, if technology-use case mapping proves too complex for practical application

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate SLR with different legal jurisdiction (US vs German focus) to test generalizability
  2. Pilot interview with single legal professional to refine question clarity and timing
  3. Test ELSA mapping with small sample of identified use cases to validate concern categorization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different NLP technologies (information extraction, text classification, document analysis, etc.) map to specific legal use cases in practice?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies a mapping challenge between NLP categories and use cases, noting that "many use cases, such as Legal Reasoning, the successful adoption of such a Legal Tech solution would necessitate a confluence of NLP technologies, making direct mapping quite difficult."
- Why unresolved: The study identified both NLP technologies and legal use cases but did not fully explore their interconnections. The relationship between technical capabilities and practical applications remains unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive matrix showing which combinations of NLP technologies are required for each legal use case, validated by legal practitioners in different jurisdictions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the major obstacles preventing legal professionals from adopting large language models (LLMs) despite their prominence in NLP research?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes "a significant gap between the current trend of NLP technologies that focuses on the development and optimization of LLMs, the need for such tools as expressed by our interviewees is markedly low."
- Why unresolved: The interviews revealed low demand for LLM-based solutions but did not investigate the underlying reasons why legal professionals are hesitant to adopt this technology.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic investigation of legal professionals' concerns about LLMs, including data privacy, accuracy requirements, interpretability, and integration challenges, with comparative analysis across different legal domains.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Which specific legal use cases evoke the strongest ethical, legal, and social concerns (ELSA), and how can these concerns be addressed in the design of Legal Tech solutions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] While the paper identified numerous ELSA concerns and legal use cases, it did not systematically explore which use cases trigger which specific concerns or how to mitigate them.
- Why unresolved: The study cataloged ELSA concerns separately from use cases without analyzing their interdependencies or providing design recommendations for addressing these concerns.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical study mapping each legal use case to the specific ELSA concerns it raises, followed by case studies of successfully implemented solutions that address these concerns through technical or procedural design.

## Limitations
- German legal context may limit generalizability to other jurisdictions with different legal systems and technological adoption rates
- Interview sample size (18 participants) may not capture the full spectrum of legal professional perspectives across all specializations
- Literature review focused on peer-reviewed papers, potentially missing relevant industry reports, white papers, or commercial tool documentation

## Confidence
- High confidence in identifying the misalignment between NLP research focus and practical legal needs, supported by both quantitative data (technology-use case mapping) and qualitative interview evidence
- Medium confidence in the comprehensiveness of ELSA concern identification, as the thematic analysis captured recurring themes but may have missed emerging or context-specific concerns
- Medium confidence in the categorization of NLP technologies and legal use cases, as the methodology provided clear structure but relied on subjective interpretation of paper content and interview responses

## Next Checks
1. Conduct replication study in different legal jurisdiction (e.g., US or UK) to test generalizability of findings and identify jurisdiction-specific variations in use case priorities and ELSA concerns
2. Perform case study validation with legal tech companies to verify whether identified high-demand use cases (particularly contract generation) align with commercial development priorities and market adoption rates
3. Test the ELSA framework with a broader stakeholder group including legal technologists, ethicists, and policymakers to assess comprehensiveness and practical applicability of identified concerns
