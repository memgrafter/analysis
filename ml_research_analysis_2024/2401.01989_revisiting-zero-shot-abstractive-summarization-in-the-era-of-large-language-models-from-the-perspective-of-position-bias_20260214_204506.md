# Revisiting Zero-Shot Abstractive Summarization in the Era of Large Language Models from the Perspective of Position Bias

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.01989
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01989
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: Position bias analysis reveals LLMs generally have low position bias except on XSum dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates position bias in zero-shot abstractive summarization by examining how large language models (LLMs) and pretrained encoder-decoder models prioritize information from different parts of input texts. The authors introduce a method to quantify position bias by mapping summary sentences to article segments and measuring distributional differences using Wasserstein distance. Their experiments across four datasets reveal that LLMs exhibit low position bias and high ROUGE scores in most cases, but show significant lead bias on the XSum dataset. In contrast, pretrained models like BART and Pegasus demonstrate high position bias and poor performance unless fine-tuned, highlighting the importance of understanding positional preferences when selecting models for zero-shot summarization tasks.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a method to estimate position bias by mapping summary sentences to corresponding article segments and computing distributional differences between these positions. They use Wasserstein distance as the metric to quantify how summary sentences are distributed across different parts of the input text. The study compares LLMs (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) with pretrained encoder-decoder models (BART and Pegasus) on four summarization datasets. Position bias is measured by analyzing where summary sentences originate within the source articles, with the hypothesis that lower position bias indicates better coverage of the entire input text rather than over-reliance on specific sections like the beginning or end.

## Key Results
- LLMs show generally low position bias across multiple datasets, indicating balanced coverage of source content
- On the XSum dataset, LLMs exhibit significant lead bias, favoring information from the beginning of articles
- Pretrained models (BART, Pegasus) demonstrate high position bias and poor zero-shot performance compared to LLMs
- Position bias correlates with ROUGE scores, with lower bias generally associated with higher summarization quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by quantifying how evenly summary sentences are distributed across different positions in the source text. When a model generates summaries, the positional distribution of source sentences used reveals the model's bias. Low position bias indicates the model effectively extracts and synthesizes information from throughout the document rather than disproportionately relying on certain sections. This approach provides an interpretable metric for understanding model behavior beyond traditional evaluation metrics like ROUGE, revealing whether models are truly comprehending and integrating information from the full input or simply regurgitating prominent sections.

## Foundational Learning
**Position Bias** - The tendency of models to prioritize information from certain parts of input text over others
- Why needed: Essential for understanding whether models comprehensively process full documents or rely on specific sections
- Quick check: Compare positional distributions of source sentences used in summaries across different model types

**Wasserstein Distance** - A metric for measuring distributional differences between two probability distributions
- Why needed: Provides quantitative measure of position bias by comparing summary sentence positions to uniform distribution
- Quick check: Verify that Wasserstein distance increases when summaries rely heavily on lead sentences

**Zero-Shot Summarization** - Generating summaries without task-specific fine-tuning
- Why needed: Critical for evaluating model generalization capabilities and practical deployment scenarios
- Quick check: Compare performance of same model with and without fine-tuning on target dataset

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Input Text -> Model (LLM/Pretrained) -> Summary Generation -> Position Mapping -> Wasserstein Distance Calculation
**Critical Path:** The mapping of summary sentences to article segments and subsequent position bias calculation represents the core analytical pathway
**Design Tradeoffs:** Using ROUGE for quality evaluation provides standardized comparison but may not capture all aspects of summary quality; Wasserstein distance offers interpretable bias measurement but requires accurate sentence-to-segment mapping
**Failure Signatures:** High position bias coupled with low ROUGE scores indicates poor model performance; low ROUGE but low position bias may suggest alternative summarization strategies; extreme lead bias on XSum reveals dataset-specific challenges
**First Experiments:**
1. Compare position bias distributions between LLMs and pretrained models on the same dataset
2. Analyze correlation between position bias metrics and traditional ROUGE scores
3. Test position bias on additional datasets to verify generalizability across domains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Analysis focuses primarily on lead bias, potentially missing other forms of positional preferences
- Wasserstein distance metric assumes specific sentence-to-segment mapping that may not capture all positional nuances
- Reliance on ROUGE scores as primary evaluation metric may not fully reflect summary quality or faithfulness

## Confidence
**High confidence:** General low position bias in LLMs across multiple datasets (excluding XSum) and contrasting high position bias in pretrained models
**Medium confidence:** Specific claims about XSum's lead bias pattern due to dataset-specific characteristics
**Medium confidence:** Effectiveness of proposed position bias estimation method depending on mapping accuracy

## Next Checks
1. Test position bias estimation method on additional datasets beyond the four studied to verify generalizability
2. Conduct human evaluation studies to assess correlation between low position bias and summary quality
3. Investigate fine-tuning strategies to reduce position bias in pretrained models while maintaining performance
