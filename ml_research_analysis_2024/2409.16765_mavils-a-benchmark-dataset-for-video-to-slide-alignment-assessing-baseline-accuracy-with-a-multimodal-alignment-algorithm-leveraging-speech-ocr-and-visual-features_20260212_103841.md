# MaViLS, a Benchmark Dataset for Video-to-Slide Alignment, Assessing Baseline Accuracy with a Multimodal Alignment Algorithm Leveraging Speech, OCR, and Visual Features

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.16765
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16765
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: MaViLS dataset and multimodal algorithm for video-to-slide alignment

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MaViLS, a benchmark dataset designed to address the challenge of aligning lecture videos with their corresponding slides. The dataset comprises 20 university lectures with detailed alignment annotations, providing a standardized evaluation framework for alignment algorithms. The authors propose a novel multimodal algorithm that leverages three complementary feature types: speech transcripts, optical character recognition (OCR) from slides, and visual embeddings of slide images.

The proposed algorithm achieves an average F1 score of 0.82, significantly outperforming the traditional SIFT baseline (0.56) while demonstrating approximately 11 times faster processing speed. Through ablation studies, the authors identify OCR features as the most critical component for alignment accuracy, followed by visual embeddings, with speech transcripts providing supplementary value particularly when OCR data is limited or noisy.

## Method Summary
The proposed alignment algorithm processes lecture videos by extracting three distinct feature streams: speech transcriptions using automated speech recognition, OCR text from detected slides using Tesseract, and visual embeddings from slides using ResNet-50. These features are then combined using a dynamic programming approach that finds the optimal alignment path between video frames and slide positions. The algorithm models the alignment problem as finding the path through a cost matrix that minimizes the cumulative distance between features while enforcing temporal monotonicity constraints.

## Key Results
- Achieved average F1 score of 0.82, outperforming SIFT baseline (0.56)
- Demonstrated 11x computational speedup compared to traditional methods
- OCR features identified as most critical component, followed by image features and speech transcripts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The multimodal approach succeeds by capturing complementary information from different modalities. OCR provides precise textual content from slides, visual embeddings capture layout and design patterns, and speech transcripts offer context and explanations that may not appear on slides. The dynamic programming framework effectively combines these signals while maintaining temporal coherence, allowing the algorithm to handle variations in presentation style and content delivery.

## Foundational Learning
- **Dynamic Programming for Sequence Alignment**: Used to find optimal alignment path through cost matrix; needed for efficient computation of best slide-video correspondence; quick check: verify recurrence relation and boundary conditions
- **Multimodal Feature Fusion**: Combines text, image, and audio embeddings; needed to leverage complementary information sources; quick check: test each modality independently before fusion
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: Extracts text from slide images; needed for precise content matching; quick check: validate OCR accuracy on sample slides
- **Visual Embeddings**: Uses ResNet-50 to encode slide images; needed for layout and design pattern matching; quick check: visualize embedding distances between similar/dissimilar slides
- **F1 Score for Evaluation**: Measures alignment precision and recall; needed to quantify algorithm performance; quick check: verify calculation with known alignment examples
- **Cost Matrix Construction**: Aggregates distances between video frames and slides; needed to represent alignment quality; quick check: visualize cost matrix for sample videos

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Speech Transcriptions -> Feature Extractor -> Cost Matrix
OCR Text -> Feature Extractor -> Cost Matrix
Visual Embeddings -> Feature Extractor -> Cost Matrix
Cost Matrix -> Dynamic Programming -> Slide Alignment

Critical Path:
Feature extraction from all three modalities → Cost matrix construction → Dynamic programming alignment → Post-processing → Evaluation

Design Tradeoffs:
The algorithm trades computational complexity for accuracy by using dynamic programming instead of exhaustive search. The three-modal approach increases robustness but requires more processing power and careful feature engineering. The temporal monotonicity constraint simplifies computation but may limit handling of non-linear slide navigation.

Failure Signatures:
Poor OCR quality will manifest as degraded alignment accuracy, particularly for text-heavy slides. Inconsistent lighting or video quality affects visual embeddings. Background noise or unclear speech impacts transcription accuracy. Rapid slide changes or complex animations may challenge the temporal alignment model.

Three First Experiments:
1. Ablation study removing each modality to quantify individual contributions
2. Cross-validation with different video qualities to test robustness
3. Comparison with human annotators on alignment accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dataset limited to English-language lectures from single university
- Evaluation based on relatively small sample of 20 lecture videos
- Dynamic programming assumes monotonic slide progression

## Confidence
- High confidence in relative performance comparison between MaViLS and SIFT baseline
- Medium confidence in computational efficiency claim due to implementation-specific factors
- Medium confidence in feature contribution analysis from ablation study design

## Next Checks
1. Cross-institutional validation using lecture videos from multiple universities and disciplines
2. Multilingual evaluation with non-English lecture videos
3. Long-term robustness testing with lectures recorded under varying technical conditions
