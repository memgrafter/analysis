# ReL-SAR: Representation Learning for Skeleton Action Recognition with Convolutional Transformers and BYOL

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2409.05749
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05749
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** ReL-SAR achieves superior action recognition accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods on four limited-size datasets while being computationally efficient

## Executive Summary
ReL-SAR addresses the challenge of skeleton-based action recognition using unsupervised representation learning to overcome the need for large labeled datasets. The method combines a lightweight convolutional transformer architecture with a Selection-Permutation strategy for skeleton joint ordering and Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL) for self-supervised pre-training. By leveraging the complementary strengths of convolutional and attention layers, along with anatomical joint grouping and BYOL's label-free learning, ReL-SAR achieves superior action recognition accuracy on limited-size datasets while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Method Summary
The proposed method extracts skeleton sequences from video using YOLOv5x and ViTPose, then applies a Selection-Permutation strategy to select 15 essential joints and arrange them by body parts (head, torso, arms, legs). A lightweight convolutional transformer processes these sequences, where convolutional layers extract local spatial features and transformer attention captures temporal dependencies. BYOL pre-trains the model on unlabeled skeleton sequences, learning robust representations without explicit labels. The model is then fine-tuned by freezing the first convolutional layer and training a linear classifier on labeled data.

## Key Results
- ReL-SAR achieves superior action recognition accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods on MCAD, IXMAS, JHMDB, and NW-UCLA datasets
- The method demonstrates computational efficiency while maintaining high performance on limited-size datasets
- BYOL pre-training enables effective representation learning from unlabeled skeleton sequences without requiring negative pairs
- Freezing the first convolutional layer from BYOL during fine-tuning yields optimal performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: ReL-SAR's lightweight convolutional transformer effectively models both spatial and temporal features in skeleton sequences by combining convolutional layers with transformer attention.
- Mechanism: The convolutional layers extract local spatial features and ensure robustness to appearance variability through spatial inductive bias, while the transformer component captures temporal dependencies and dynamic pose evolution through self-attention.
- Core assumption: The complementary strengths of convolutional and transformer layers can be combined to jointly model spatial and temporal cues without introducing excessive computational overhead.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We designed a lightweight convolutional transformer framework, named ReL-SAR, exploiting the complementarity of convolutional and attention layers for jointly modeling spatial and temporal cues in skeleton sequences."
  - [section] "The convolutional layers specialize in extracting local spatial features to discern the spatial hierarchies within human poses and ensure robustness to variability in appearance thanks to their spatial inductive bias. Then, the transformer component allows to model temporal dependencies and dynamic evolution of poses, leveraging the complementary strengths of transformer and convolutional layers."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Selection-Permutation strategy improves performance by focusing on essential joints and organizing them anatomically to facilitate more informative descriptions.
- Mechanism: By selecting 15 essential joints and arranging them by body parts (head, torso, arms, legs), the strategy creates a more structured input that helps the model capture local spatial relationships more effectively than a random or full-joint arrangement.
- Core assumption: Anatomical grouping of joints provides more meaningful spatial relationships than treating all joints equally or using a random ordering.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We also use a Selection-Permutation strategy for skeleton joints to ensure more informative descriptions from skeletal data."
  - [section] "To effectively capture spatial relationships, we leverage a strategy that entails ordering the joints by permuting them in such a way that they are grouped by body parts... This partitioning... aims to capitalize on the insight that connections between proximate body parts within the input sequence can offer more nuanced and informative descriptions for the action representation."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: BYOL pre-training enables effective representation learning from unlabeled skeleton sequences without requiring negative pairs, leading to robust features that generalize better than fully supervised learning.
- Mechanism: BYOL uses two neural networks (online and target) that interact through positive pairs only, with the online network predicting the target network's projection. This avoids the need for negative pairs while encouraging rich representations through the predictor and exponential moving average target.
- Core assumption: Learning representations through positive pairs alone, without explicit contrastive pairs, can achieve similar or better performance while being more stable and memory-efficient.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Finally, we capitalize on Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL) to learn robust representations from unlabeled skeleton sequence data."
  - [section] "BYOL follows this contrastive objective and achieves very good results in computer vision tasks without using negative pairs, by relying on two neural networks that interact and learn from each other."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Skeleton-based action recognition
  - Why needed here: Understanding that skeleton data represents human pose as joint coordinates rather than raw images is fundamental to grasping why this approach works differently from appearance-based methods.
  - Quick check question: What are the advantages of using skeleton data over raw video for action recognition?

- Concept: Self-supervised learning and contrastive learning
  - Why needed here: BYOL is a self-supervised learning method, and understanding how it differs from traditional supervised and contrastive learning approaches is crucial for understanding the paper's contribution.
  - Quick check question: How does BYOL differ from traditional contrastive learning methods that use negative pairs?

- Concept: Transformer architecture and self-attention
  - Why needed here: The paper uses a transformer component to capture temporal dependencies, so understanding how self-attention works in transformers is essential for understanding the model architecture.
  - Quick check question: What is the key advantage of using self-attention in transformers compared to recurrent networks for modeling sequences?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input → Selection-Permutation → Conv1D → Linear Projection → Transformer → BYOL Pre-training → Fine-tuning → Classification
- Critical path: Input → Selection-Permutation → Conv1D → Linear Projection → Transformer → BYOL Pre-training → Fine-tuning → Classification
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using 15 joints instead of all 25 joints reduces computational cost but may lose some information
  - Anatomical ordering improves spatial understanding but requires domain knowledge
  - BYOL avoids negative pairs but may require careful hyperparameter tuning for stability
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on datasets with significant viewpoint variation (suggests Selection-Permutation strategy insufficient)
  - Degradation when increasing sequence length beyond optimal point (suggests overfitting or computational bottleneck)
  - Unstable training during BYOL pre-training (suggests learning rate or exponential moving average parameter issues)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate that the Selection-Permutation strategy improves performance by comparing with random joint ordering and full-joint input
  2. Test different sequence lengths (T) to find the optimal balance between temporal coverage and computational efficiency
  3. Compare fine-tuning strategies (full fine-tuning vs freezing Conv1D layers) to determine the best approach for leveraging BYOL-pretrained features

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the Selection-Permutation strategy perform when applied to datasets with more diverse body types or poses, such as those with significant occlusions or unusual skeletal structures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the Selection-Permutation strategy was empirically selected for 15 joints and that it groups joints by body parts, but does not explore its performance across diverse datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on limited-size datasets and does not address the strategy's robustness to varied body types or poses.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the Selection-Permutation strategy on datasets with diverse body types and occlusions, and comparing its performance to other joint selection methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the ReL-SAR model maintain its performance advantage when applied to larger-scale datasets, or is its effectiveness primarily due to its efficiency on limited-size datasets?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates ReL-SAR's effectiveness on limited-size datasets but does not explore its scalability to larger datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide results or analysis for larger-scale datasets, leaving its performance on such datasets unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating ReL-SAR on larger-scale datasets and comparing its performance and computational efficiency to state-of-the-art methods.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of different data augmentation strategies on the performance of BYOL pre-training in ReL-SAR, and could more sophisticated augmentations further enhance its effectiveness?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using light data augmentations like noise, scaling, and vertical flip, but does not explore the impact of more sophisticated or varied augmentation strategies.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not experiment with or analyze the effects of different augmentation strategies on BYOL's performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with various data augmentation strategies during BYOL pre-training and analyzing their impact on the model's performance.

## Limitations
- The method's performance relies heavily on datasets with limited viewpoint variation, which may not generalize well to more complex real-world scenarios with significant viewpoint changes or occlusions.
- The 15-joint selection and anatomical ordering strategy may sacrifice important information, potentially limiting performance on actions requiring full-body context.
- BYOL's positive-pair-only approach can be sensitive to hyperparameter choices and may not generalize well across different skeleton datasets or action recognition tasks.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The convolutional transformer architecture effectively combines spatial and temporal feature extraction (supported by ablation studies and performance comparisons)
- **Medium Confidence:** The Selection-Permutation strategy significantly improves performance (evidence from limited datasets but lacks broader validation)
- **Medium Confidence:** BYOL pre-training provides robust representations without labels (theoretical justification is strong but empirical validation is limited to specific datasets)

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate ReL-SAR on datasets with significant viewpoint variation and occlusion (e.g., NTU RGB+D) to assess robustness beyond controlled environments.
2. Conduct comprehensive ablation studies varying the number of selected joints (10, 20, 25) and different ordering strategies to quantify the impact of the Selection-Permutation approach.
3. Perform detailed analysis of computational costs (FLOPs, parameters, training time) across different dataset sizes and sequence lengths to validate the claimed efficiency benefits.
