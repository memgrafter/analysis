# Can ChatGPT Make Explanatory Inferences? Benchmarks for Abductive Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.18982
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18982
- Authors: Paul Thagard
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: ChatGPT demonstrates capability for explanatory inference across multiple domains and modalities, though lacks emotional motivations and multimodal inference beyond verbal and visual.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces benchmarks to evaluate generative AI models' ability to perform explanatory inference, a form of abductive reasoning that involves creating and evaluating hypotheses to explain puzzling occurrences. The study focuses on ChatGPT, testing its performance across domains, modalities, hypothesis formation, and evaluation. Results show ChatGPT excels in both creative and evaluative explanatory inference, generating novel hypotheses using causal reasoning, analogy, and conceptual combination. The model also demonstrates sophisticated understanding of evaluating competing hypotheses using criteria like explanatory breadth and simplicity. The findings challenge claims that AI models like ChatGPT are incapable of explanation, understanding, causality, meaning, and creativity.

## Method Summary
The study developed comprehensive benchmarks to assess ChatGPT's abductive reasoning capabilities. These benchmarks covered multiple domains and modalities, focusing on two key aspects: hypothesis formation and hypothesis evaluation. The evaluation included creative tasks where ChatGPT generated novel explanations for given scenarios, as well as evaluative tasks where it assessed competing hypotheses using established criteria such as explanatory breadth and simplicity. The study tested both verbal and visual modalities, examining ChatGPT's ability to form and evaluate explanations across these domains. The benchmarks were designed to capture the full spectrum of explanatory inference, from initial hypothesis generation to sophisticated evaluation of competing explanations.

## Key Results
- ChatGPT performs well in creative and evaluative explanatory inference across multiple domains and modalities.
- The model can generate novel hypotheses using causal reasoning, analogy, and conceptual combination.
- ChatGPT demonstrates sophisticated understanding of evaluating competing hypotheses using criteria like explanatory breadth and simplicity.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study's benchmarks effectively capture the complexity of abductive reasoning by testing both hypothesis formation and evaluation. ChatGPT's performance suggests it can integrate multiple reasoning strategies, including causal reasoning, analogy, and conceptual combination, to generate and assess explanations. The model's ability to evaluate competing hypotheses using established criteria indicates a level of abstract reasoning and understanding of explanatory principles.

## Foundational Learning
1. Abductive reasoning (why needed: Core concept being tested; quick check: Can ChatGPT generate plausible explanations for given scenarios?)
2. Explanatory inference (why needed: Specific form of reasoning assessed; quick check: Does ChatGPT create and evaluate hypotheses that explain puzzling occurrences?)
3. Causal reasoning (why needed: Key strategy for hypothesis generation; quick check: Can ChatGPT identify and use causal relationships in explanations?)
4. Analogical reasoning (why needed: Important for generating novel hypotheses; quick check: Does ChatGPT use analogies to create explanations?)
5. Conceptual combination (why needed: Method for creating new hypotheses; quick check: Can ChatGPT combine concepts to form new explanations?)
6. Hypothesis evaluation (why needed: Critical aspect of explanatory inference; quick check: Does ChatGPT assess explanations using criteria like simplicity and breadth?)

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Input -> Language Model -> Reasoning Module -> Output
Critical path: User query -> ChatGPT processing -> Abductive reasoning application -> Explanation generation/evaluation -> Response output
Design tradeoffs: Balanced approach between creative hypothesis generation and rigorous evaluation criteria
Failure signatures: Inability to generate novel hypotheses, over-reliance on common explanations, failure to consider multiple competing hypotheses
First experiments:
1. Test ChatGPT's ability to generate explanations for novel scenarios across different domains
2. Evaluate ChatGPT's performance in comparing and ranking multiple competing hypotheses
3. Assess ChatGPT's use of analogical reasoning in creating explanations for unfamiliar concepts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily focuses on verbal and visual modalities, potentially missing other sensory domains
- Does not address emotional motivations behind hypothesis formation
- Benchmarks may not fully capture the complexity of real-world abductive reasoning scenarios

## Confidence
- ChatGPT's performance across creative and evaluative explanatory inference: Medium-High
- Claims about ChatGPT's understanding of causality, meaning, and creativity: Medium
- Assertion that findings rebut claims about ChatGPT's incapacity for explanation and related abilities: Low

## Next Checks
1. Develop and implement benchmarks that assess emotional motivations in hypothesis formation to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of explanatory inference capabilities.
2. Create multimodal benchmarks that include non-verbal and non-visual sensory inputs to test the full range of ChatGPT's abductive reasoning abilities.
3. Conduct longitudinal studies to evaluate the consistency and evolution of ChatGPT's abductive reasoning performance over time and across diverse real-world scenarios.
