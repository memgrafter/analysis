# LLMs for Relational Reasoning: How Far are We?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.09042
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09042
- Reference count: 37
- Primary result: Evaluates LLMs on inductive logic programming benchmarks, finding that GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo perform best among LLMs but still lag behind smaller neural program induction models in relational reasoning tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of large language models' (LLMs) relational reasoning capabilities using inductive logic programming benchmarks. The study implements a universal evaluation pipeline supporting both natural language and truth-value matrix prompting modalities to assess LLMs and neural program induction models on family tree and graph reasoning tasks. The results reveal that while GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo achieve the highest performance among evaluated LLMs, they remain inferior to the neural program induction model DLM, which is significantly smaller in size. The evaluation demonstrates that LLMs struggle particularly with tasks requiring complex task-solving logic, and even advanced prompting techniques like chain-of-thought cannot consistently improve their relational reasoning capabilities.

## Method Summary
The study implements a universal evaluation pipeline that supports two prompting modalities: natural language and truth-value matrix formats. This pipeline is applied to assess both LLMs and neural program induction models across two task categories: family tree reasoning and general graph reasoning. The evaluation framework includes systematic testing across multiple tasks with varying complexity levels, allowing for detailed comparison between different model types. The pipeline enables controlled assessment of model performance while accounting for different prompting strategies, including chain-of-thought approaches, to understand their impact on relational reasoning outcomes.

## Key Results
- GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo achieve the best performance among evaluated LLMs but still underperform compared to the smaller neural program induction model DLM
- LLMs show significant performance drops on tasks requiring complex task-solving logic and multi-step reasoning
- Chain-of-thought prompting, while beneficial in some cases, does not consistently improve LLMs' relational reasoning capabilities across all task types

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The evaluation pipeline's effectiveness stems from its systematic approach to testing relational reasoning through controlled benchmark tasks. By implementing both natural language and truth-value matrix prompting modalities, the framework captures different aspects of how models process relational information. The use of family tree and graph reasoning tasks provides structured yet challenging scenarios that require logical inference and pattern recognition. The comparison between LLMs and neural program induction models like DLM highlights fundamental differences in how these architectures approach relational reasoning problems.

## Foundational Learning
- **Inductive Logic Programming**: Understanding how systems learn logical rules from examples is crucial for evaluating relational reasoning. Quick check: Can the model induce valid rules from given positive and negative examples?
- **Neural Program Induction**: These models can synthesize executable programs from examples, providing a different approach to relational reasoning. Quick check: Does the model generate executable programs that correctly solve the given relational tasks?
- **Prompting Modalities**: Natural language vs. truth-value matrix formats represent different ways of presenting relational information to models. Quick check: How does model performance vary across different prompting formats for the same task?
- **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**: This prompting technique guides models through step-by-step reasoning processes. Quick check: Does the model maintain logical consistency throughout multi-step reasoning chains?

## Architecture Onboarding
Component Map: Evaluation Pipeline -> Prompting Modalities -> Task Categories -> Performance Metrics
Critical Path: Benchmark Selection → Model Input Preparation → Reasoning Execution → Output Evaluation → Performance Analysis
Design Tradeoffs: The universal pipeline balances comprehensiveness with specificity, allowing detailed assessment while maintaining comparability across different model types and prompting strategies.
Failure Signatures: Models struggle particularly with complex multi-step reasoning, tasks requiring rule induction from limited examples, and scenarios demanding generalization beyond training patterns.
First Experiments:
1. Baseline performance comparison between LLMs and DLM on simple family tree reasoning tasks
2. Cross-prompting modality evaluation using identical tasks to assess format sensitivity
3. Chain-of-thought prompting effectiveness test across different task complexity levels

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The evaluation focuses narrowly on inductive logic programming benchmarks, potentially missing broader aspects of relational reasoning
- Results are based on synthetic family tree and graph reasoning tasks that may not reflect real-world complexity and ambiguity
- The comparison between LLMs and DLM doesn't fully account for fundamental architectural differences between neural program induction models and transformer-based LLMs

## Confidence
- LLMs' Relational Reasoning Performance: High confidence - systematic testing provides strong empirical support
- Effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought Prompting: Medium confidence - results show variability that suggests potential for improved prompting strategies
- Generalizability of Results: Low confidence - controlled environment may not capture real-world relational reasoning complexity

## Next Checks
1. Expand benchmark diversity by testing LLMs on natural language understanding, visual reasoning, and multi-modal relational reasoning tasks to assess generalizability
2. Investigate advanced prompting strategies including few-shot learning with diverse examples and dynamic prompting based on task complexity
3. Conduct comparative analysis with emerging neuro-symbolic approaches and models incorporating explicit reasoning modules to evaluate relative performance
