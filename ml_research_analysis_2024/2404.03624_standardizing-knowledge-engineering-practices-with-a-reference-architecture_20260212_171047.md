# Standardizing Knowledge Engineering Practices with a Reference Architecture

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.03624
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03624
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Six-step methodology for developing reference architectures that align knowledge engineering stakeholder requirements with systemic design patterns from the SWeMLS corpus

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a systematic methodology for developing reference architectures (RAs) to standardize knowledge engineering (KE) practices. The authors propose a six-step process that begins with scope definition and ends with software instantiation, using the SWeMLS knowledge graph of neurosymbolic systems as an information source. The methodology enables the development of RAs that can adapt to evolving requirements and facilitate adoption by software engineers and data scientists, addressing the challenge of aligning KE user requirements with recurring systemic patterns.

## Method Summary
The methodology consists of six steps: scope identification (defining functional requirements and quality attributes), information source selection (querying the SWeMLS corpus for KE-related patterns), architectural analysis (mapping QAs to patterns using zero-shot text classification), RA synthesis (assembling patterns into an architectural framework), evaluation through instantiation (using ATAM-based evaluation with stakeholders), and software instantiation (implementing RA components with appropriate tools). The process is iterative, allowing for modification as stakeholder requirements shift. The SWeMLS corpus provides the architectural patterns, while quality attributes and functional requirements guide the synthesis process.

## Key Results
- Developed a six-step methodology for creating reference architectures in knowledge engineering
- Demonstrated mapping of 23 quality attributes to 8 functional requirements using SWeMLS corpus patterns
- Showed how neurosymbolic system boxology patterns can be assembled into KE reference architectures
- Proposed iterative design approach allowing RAs to adapt to evolving KE paradigms and requirements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Reference architectures enable alignment between stakeholder requirements and recurring systemic patterns in knowledge engineering.
- Mechanism: The six-step methodology systematically connects user needs (captured as functional requirements and quality attributes) with design patterns from the SWeMLS corpus, ensuring that KE workflows are both standardized and adaptable.
- Core assumption: Stakeholder requirements can be accurately captured and mapped to systemic patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We describe how a reference architecture can be iteratively designed and implemented to associate user needs with recurring systemic patterns..."
  - [section 4.1] "The scope of the RA framework should enable machine, human, and joint machine-human knowledge processes"
  - [corpus] Weak - The corpus provides system patterns but doesn't directly show requirement mapping evidence.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Iterative design allows RAs to adapt to evolving KE paradigms and technological trends.
- Mechanism: The methodology treats RA development as an iterative process where architectural analysis, synthesis, and evaluation can be revisited as new patterns emerge or requirements shift.
- Core assumption: KE paradigms will continue to evolve and require architectural adaptation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.1] "The dominant paradigm of KE has been shifting through the history of AI, from its early days through the eras of expert systems and semantic web"
  - [section 4] "We see the last three steps as iterative steps, which can be modified given the shifting stakeholder requirements"
  - [corpus] Weak - The corpus shows pattern evolution but doesn't demonstrate iterative RA adaptation.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: SWeMLS knowledge graph provides a structured information source for identifying KE-relevant patterns.
- Mechanism: The SWeMLS corpus systematically annotates systems with architectural patterns, enabling targeted selection of KE-related patterns through SPARQL queries.
- Core assumption: The SWeMLS corpus comprehensively covers relevant KE systems and accurately annotates patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2] "we identified a subset of 139 papers as KE-related, consisting of papers whose systems perform Graph creation or Graph extension tasks"
  - [section 4.3] "We use this set of 139 KE papers in the rest of our methodology, given the systematic approach to collecting them"
  - [corpus] Moderate - The corpus shows systematic collection but the claim of comprehensiveness is not directly verified.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Software Reference Architecture Development Methodology
  - Why needed here: Provides the structured approach for creating RAs that align stakeholder requirements with systemic patterns
  - Quick check question: What are the five core steps in Nakagawa et al.'s methodology for designing software architectures?

- Concept: Quality Attributes vs Functional Requirements
  - Why needed here: Differentiates between "what the system must do" (FRs) and "how well it does it" (QAs) in KE contexts
  - Quick check question: In KE, is "scalability" a quality attribute or functional requirement?

- Concept: Neurosymbolic System Boxology Patterns
  - Why needed here: Provides the architectural components that can be assembled into KE RAs
  - Quick check question: What are the three types of components in the boxology framework?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component Map: Scope Definition -> Information Source Selection -> Architectural Analysis -> RA Synthesis -> Evaluation -> Instantiation
- Critical Path: Scope Definition → Information Source Selection → Architectural Analysis → RA Synthesis → Evaluation → Instantiation
- Design Tradeoffs:
  - Breadth vs depth of scope: Broader scope increases applicability but reduces specificity
  - Pattern selection: More patterns increase flexibility but add complexity
  - Evaluation rigor: More rigorous evaluation catches issues but increases time/cost
- Failure Signatures:
  - Misalignment between requirements and patterns (Scope/Analysis issues)
  - Inflexible architecture unable to adapt to new requirements (Synthesis issues)
  - Poor instantiation leading to performance issues (Implementation issues)
- First 3 Experiments:
  1. Implement a minimal RA for ontology creation task, testing basic pattern alignment
  2. Conduct ATAM evaluation with a small stakeholder group to validate requirement coverage
  3. Prototype instantiation of RA components using KGTK toolkit for graph operations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the most effective way to automatically derive functional requirements (FRs) and quality attributes (QAs) from a systematically collected set of papers, based on formally defined requirements?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that deriving FRs and QAs from a systematically collected set of papers is critical future work.
- Why unresolved: While some initial FRs and QAs have been proposed, they were not derived from a systematic selection of papers. A robust method for automatically deriving these requirements from a large corpus of relevant papers is still needed.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of a method that can automatically extract FRs and QAs from a large corpus of papers related to knowledge engineering, with high accuracy and consistency.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the SWeMLS knowledge graph be extended to store and share reference architectures for content recommendation and other knowledge engineering applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests mapping elements of the reference architecture definition into the SWeMLS knowledge graph to enable sharing and reuse.
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides examples of how some elements can be mapped, a comprehensive and standardized approach for representing reference architectures in the SWeMLS knowledge graph is still needed.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of a complete ontology for representing reference architectures in the SWeMLS knowledge graph, along with examples of how to map existing architectures to this ontology.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the most effective strategies for implementing and evaluating reference architectures for knowledge engineering in specific domains and use cases?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper outlines a six-step roadmap for developing reference architectures but acknowledges that the implementation and evaluation steps are highly use-case dependent.
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides a general methodology, specific strategies for implementing and evaluating reference architectures in different domains and use cases are still needed.
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies and empirical evaluations of reference architectures implemented in various knowledge engineering domains, demonstrating their effectiveness in addressing specific requirements and use cases.

## Limitations
- Reliance on a single corpus (SWeMLS) may miss emerging KE paradigms or domain-specific variations
- Zero-shot classification for quality attribute to pattern mapping introduces uncertainty and potential misclassification
- Concrete software instantiation details are deferred to implementation, making practical feasibility assessment difficult
- Limited empirical validation of the methodology's effectiveness in real-world KE applications

## Confidence
- Reference Architecture Development Methodology: Medium
- Quality Attribute to Pattern Mapping: Low-Medium
- Iterative Adaptation Claims: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a comparative analysis of the SWeMLS corpus coverage against broader KE literature to identify potential gaps in pattern representation
2. Perform a validation study with domain experts to verify the accuracy of quality attribute to pattern mappings identified through zero-shot classification
3. Implement a prototype instantiation using the KGTK toolkit to assess practical feasibility and identify implementation challenges not apparent in the methodology design
