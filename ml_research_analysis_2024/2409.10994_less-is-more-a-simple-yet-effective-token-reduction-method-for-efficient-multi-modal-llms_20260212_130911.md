# Less is More: A Simple yet Effective Token Reduction Method for Efficient Multi-modal LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.10994
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10994
- Reference count: 22
- Major claim: 79% reduction in image tokens while maintaining comparable performance

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TRIM (Token Reduction using CLIP Metric), a method that reduces the number of image tokens in multimodal large language models by approximately 79% while maintaining comparable performance. The approach leverages CLIP similarity scores and the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to select important image tokens, supplemented by an aggregated token to retain information from unselected tokens. Tested across 12 datasets, TRIM significantly reduces computational overhead—67% in processing time and 30% in memory usage—while preserving model accuracy. It outperforms existing token reduction methods like PruMerge and achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art models like LLaVA-1.5.

## Method Summary
TRIM employs a three-stage token reduction process. First, it uses CLIP similarity scores to evaluate the importance of each image token by measuring its semantic alignment with the text prompt. Second, it applies the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to filter out tokens that fall below a relevance threshold, retaining only the most semantically significant tokens. Finally, it introduces an aggregation token that encodes information from the discarded tokens, ensuring no critical visual information is lost. This approach significantly reduces the computational load during both training and inference while maintaining model performance across diverse tasks.

## Key Results
- Achieves approximately 79% reduction in image tokens
- Reduces processing time by 67% and memory usage by 30%
- Maintains comparable performance across 12 datasets
- Outperforms existing token reduction methods like PruMerge

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TRIM works by leveraging the semantic understanding capabilities of CLIP to identify which image tokens carry the most relevant information for the given text prompt. By using CLIP's pre-trained visual-semantic alignment, the method can effectively prioritize tokens that contribute most to the multimodal understanding task. The IQR filtering ensures robust selection by eliminating outliers and noise, while the aggregation token acts as a residual information container. This selective reduction approach maintains the critical visual-semantic relationships needed for accurate multimodal reasoning while dramatically reducing computational overhead.

## Foundational Learning

**CLIP Similarity Score**: A metric that measures semantic alignment between image patches and text prompts using a pre-trained CLIP model. Why needed: To identify which image tokens are most relevant to the text context. Quick check: Verify that CLIP scores correlate with human judgment of token relevance.

**Interquartile Range (IQR) Method**: A statistical technique that filters out data points falling below a certain percentile threshold. Why needed: To eliminate noisy or irrelevant tokens while maintaining robust selection. Quick check: Test different percentile thresholds to find optimal balance between reduction and performance.

**Aggregation Token**: A synthetic token that encodes information from discarded tokens to prevent information loss. Why needed: To retain residual information from tokens that are removed during reduction. Quick check: Verify that the aggregation token captures information not represented in selected tokens.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: CLIP Encoder -> Token Scoring -> IQR Filter -> Selected Tokens + Aggregation Token -> Multimodal LLM

Critical Path: Image input → CLIP-based scoring → IQR filtering → Token selection → Aggregation token creation → Multimodal model input

Design Tradeoffs: The method balances token reduction against information retention, trading some computational efficiency for potential minor accuracy impacts. The aggregation token adds minimal overhead while preventing catastrophic information loss.

Failure Signatures: Over-aggressive reduction may lead to loss of fine-grained visual details; under-aggressive reduction provides minimal efficiency gains; poor CLIP alignment may result in irrelevant token selection.

First Experiments:
1. Measure computational savings (time and memory) on a representative dataset
2. Compare performance degradation across different reduction percentages
3. Evaluate robustness on domain-specific datasets where CLIP pre-training may be limited

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

The evaluation focuses primarily on computational efficiency metrics rather than comprehensive accuracy degradation analysis. The CLIP similarity score-based token selection may not generalize well to domains where CLIP's pre-training data coverage is limited. The paper doesn't thoroughly analyze potential information loss or quality degradation in the aggregated representation.

## Confidence

- High confidence in computational efficiency improvements (processing time and memory reduction)
- Medium confidence in accuracy preservation claims across 12 datasets
- Medium confidence in comparison with existing methods like PruMerge

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of CLIP-based selection, IQR filtering, and aggregation token components
2. Test the method across diverse hardware platforms to verify scalability and consistency of efficiency gains
3. Evaluate performance on domain-specific datasets (medical imaging, satellite imagery) to assess robustness of token selection approach
