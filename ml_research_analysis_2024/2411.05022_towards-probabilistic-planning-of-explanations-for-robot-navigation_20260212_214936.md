# Towards Probabilistic Planning of Explanations for Robot Navigation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.05022
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05022
- Reference count: 22
- This paper proposes a probabilistic framework for generating personalized robot explanations using RDDL to model user preferences as stochastic variables.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of generating personalized explanations for robot navigation by modeling user preferences as probabilistic variables within a Relational Dynamic Influence Diagram Language (RDDL) framework. The authors propose integrating user-centered design principles directly into robot path planning to enhance transparency and trust in human-robot interaction. By treating explanation attributes (representation, detail level, duration, and scope) as probabilistic variables, the system can anticipate and adapt to diverse user explanation needs, generating context-aware explanations aligned with individual expectations.

## Method Summary
The approach models human explanation preferences as probabilistic variables within the RDDL formalism, treating attributes like explanation representation, detail level, duration, and scope as Bernoulli random variables. The framework integrates these preferences into the robot's decision-making process through state variables, action variables, reward functions, and transition functions. The system generates explanations by optimizing actions to satisfy user preferences while accounting for uncertainty in both human preferences and environmental conditions. The authors provide generalized RDDL domain and problem files that can be adapted to various scenarios through modification of non-fluents, initial states, and conditional probabilities.

## Key Results
- Demonstrates a conceptual framework for probabilistic planning of robot explanations
- Shows how RDDL can model user preferences as stochastic variables
- Provides adaptable templates for domain and problem files across different scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Probabilistic modeling of user preferences enables adaptive explanation generation aligned with individual user expectations.
- Mechanism: The system treats user explanation preferences as probabilistic variables within the RDDL framework, allowing the robot to probabilistically reason about these preferences and structure explanations accordingly.
- Core assumption: Human explanation preferences can be effectively modeled as probabilistic variables that influence the robot's decision-making process.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We propose a probabilistic framework for automated planning of explanations for robot navigation, where the preferences of different users regarding explanations are probabilistically modeled to tailor the stochasticity of the real-world human-robot interaction"
  - [section] "To model human explanation preferences as probabilistic variables in RDDL, we define several key components: State Variables, Action Variables, Reward Functions, and Transition Functions"
- Break condition: If the initial and conditional probabilities are not representative of actual user preferences, the model's accuracy will be compromised, leading to misaligned explanations.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The integration of user-centered design principles directly into robot path planning enhances transparency and trust in human-robot interaction.
- Mechanism: By incorporating user preferences for explanation attributes into the planning domain, the robot can generate explanations that are not only personalized but also context-aware.
- Core assumption: Personalized and context-aware explanations significantly improve user understanding and trust in robot actions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This approach aims to enhance the transparency of robot path planning and adapt to diverse user explanation needs by anticipating the types of explanations that will satisfy individual users"
  - [section] "Effective communication is a cornerstone of successful HRI, and explanations that align with user preferences can significantly enhance the user experience"
- Break condition: If the robot fails to accurately anticipate user needs or if the explanations are not delivered in a timely manner, the intended enhancement of transparency and trust may not be realized.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The flexibility of the RDDL framework allows for easy adaptation to various scenarios and user needs.
- Mechanism: The RDDL domain and problem files are designed as templates that can be modified for different scenarios by adjusting non-fluents, initial state, and conditional probabilities.
- Core assumption: The RDDL framework's flexibility enables effective customization for different domains without significant redesign.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "To customize domain and problem files for different domains, it is enough to do the following: 1) Modifying Non-Fluents, 2) Adjusting Initial State"
  - [section] "By defining explanation attributes (representation, detail level, duration, and scope) and integrating them into a probabilistic model, we can generate explanations tailored to individual preferences"
- Break condition: If the customization process is too complex or if the framework cannot adequately capture the nuances of a new domain, the model's flexibility and effectiveness may be limited.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Probabilistic planning and uncertainty modeling
  - Why needed here: The approach relies on modeling uncertain human preferences and environmental conditions to generate adaptive explanations.
  - Quick check question: What is the primary advantage of using probabilistic planning over deterministic planning in the context of human-robot interaction?

- Concept: RDDL (Relational Dynamic Influence Diagram Language)
  - Why needed here: RDDL provides the formalism for representing probabilistic effects and relational structures, essential for modeling the robot's decision-making process under uncertainty.
  - Quick check question: How does RDDL differ from traditional PDDL in handling uncertainty and probabilistic effects?

- Concept: User-centered design principles
  - Why needed here: Integrating user preferences directly into the planning process ensures that the robot's explanations are aligned with individual user needs and expectations.
  - Quick check question: Why is it important to consider user preferences in the design of explainable robotic systems?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - State Variables: Represent the robot's state and human user's preferences
  - Action Variables: Represent possible actions the robot can take, including providing explanations
  - Reward Functions: Capture the utility of different outcomes based on user preference satisfaction
  - Transition Functions: Define how state variables evolve based on actions and probabilistic effects
  - Explanation Attributes: Representation, detail level, duration, and scope of explanations

- Critical path:
  1. Define user explanation preferences as probabilistic variables in RDDL
  2. Model the robot's state and possible actions
  3. Establish reward functions to optimize for user preference satisfaction
  4. Implement transition functions to handle probabilistic effects
  5. Generate and deliver personalized explanations based on the planned actions

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Computational complexity vs. explanation personalization: More detailed probabilistic models increase computational load but provide better personalization.
  - Model accuracy vs. adaptability: Highly accurate models may be less adaptable to new scenarios compared to more flexible, generalized models.

- Failure signatures:
  - Misaligned explanations: If the robot consistently provides explanations that do not match user preferences, it may indicate issues with the probabilistic model or reward function.
  - Increased user confusion: If users report confusion despite receiving explanations, it may suggest problems with the explanation attributes or delivery timing.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate the probabilistic model by testing explanation generation with predefined user preference profiles.
  2. Assess the impact of personalized explanations on user trust and understanding through user studies.
  3. Test the adaptability of the model by applying it to different robot navigation scenarios and evaluating explanation effectiveness.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the probabilistic model be adapted in real-time to account for changing user preferences during interactions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions future work exploring real-time adaptation based on user feedback and machine learning integration to refine probabilistic parameters.
- Why unresolved: Current framework uses static probabilities; dynamic adjustment mechanisms are not implemented or tested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results demonstrating the model's ability to update probabilities and improve explanation quality based on continuous user interaction data.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of cultural differences on user preferences for robot explanations, and how can the model be adapted to different cultural contexts?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The discussion section mentions exploring cross-cultural applicability, noting that preferences for explanations can vary significantly across cultures.
- Why unresolved: No empirical studies or cultural adaptation mechanisms are presented in the current work.
- What evidence would resolve it: Cross-cultural user studies comparing explanation preferences and the effectiveness of culturally adapted probabilistic models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the computational complexity of RDDL affect the scalability of the explanation planning system in real-world applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The related work section discusses computational challenges of probabilistic planning, and the discussion mentions complexity as a potential barrier to practitioners.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide complexity analysis or performance benchmarks for the proposed RDDL-based system.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies measuring planning time, memory usage, and scalability across different problem sizes and real-world scenarios.

## Limitations

- The paper relies on assumed or simulated user preference distributions rather than empirically validated data
- Computational complexity of RDDL-based probabilistic planning is acknowledged but not thoroughly evaluated
- No empirical validation of the approach through user studies or real-world testing

## Confidence

- High confidence in the technical feasibility of modeling preferences as probabilistic variables in RDDL
- Medium confidence in the assumed benefits for user trust and understanding (lacks empirical support)
- Medium confidence in the framework's adaptability across domains (conceptual only)

## Next Checks

1. Conduct user studies to empirically validate the assumed probability distributions for explanation preferences across different user demographics
2. Benchmark computational performance of the RDDL planner with varying numbers of explanation attributes and preference variables
3. Implement and test the framework in a physical robot navigation scenario with real users to evaluate actual impact on transparency and trust
