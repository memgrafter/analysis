# Federated Learning with Relative Fairness

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.01161
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01161
- Reference count: 11
- Primary result: Introduces a federated learning framework achieving relative fairness among client subgroups through a novel minimax optimization approach

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses fairness in federated learning by introducing a framework that optimizes relative fairness among client subgroups rather than just ensuring minimum performance guarantees. Traditional federated learning approaches focus on absolute fairness, ensuring no subgroup falls below a certain performance threshold, but they don't address performance disparities between subgroups. The proposed framework introduces a novel fairness index based on the ratio between large and small losses among clients, and uses a minimax optimization approach to minimize relative unfairness while maintaining model performance.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework extends distributionally robust optimization (DRO) techniques to federated learning by formulating fairness as a minimax problem. The key innovation is a relative fairness index that measures the ratio between maximum and minimum losses across client subgroups, capturing disparities that absolute fairness metrics miss. The Scaff-PD-IA algorithm implements this approach through a combination of stochastic optimization and periodic averaging, achieving both computational and communication efficiency. The method theoretically guarantees convergence to solutions that reduce relative unfairness while maintaining model performance across all clients.

## Key Results
- The Scaff-PD-IA algorithm achieves the smallest relative unfairness indices compared to baseline methods
- The framework maintains the best average accuracy across all clients while improving fairness
- Theoretical guarantees demonstrate consistent reduction in unfairness under the proposed optimization framework
- Empirical evaluations on real-world datasets confirm effectiveness in reducing performance disparities between subgroups

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by reframing fairness as a relative concept rather than an absolute one. Instead of simply ensuring all clients achieve minimum performance, it actively minimizes the ratio between the worst-performing and best-performing subgroups. This is achieved through a minimax optimization problem where the objective is to minimize the maximum loss ratio across all possible data distributions. The stochastic optimization algorithm efficiently navigates this non-convex landscape while maintaining convergence guarantees, allowing the model to balance overall performance with relative fairness.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO)**
   - Why needed: Provides the theoretical foundation for handling uncertainty in client data distributions
   - Quick check: Verify that the minimax formulation correctly captures distribution uncertainty

2. **Relative Fairness Metrics**
   - Why needed: Traditional absolute fairness metrics don't capture performance disparities between subgroups
   - Quick check: Confirm the ratio-based metric appropriately quantifies unfairness

3. **Federated Learning Convergence Theory**
   - Why needed: Ensures the proposed algorithm maintains convergence properties while optimizing for fairness
   - Quick check: Validate that convergence rates meet theoretical bounds

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Client Devices -> Local Training -> Server Aggregation -> Fairness Optimization -> Model Update -> Client Devices

**Critical Path:**
The critical path involves local model training on client devices, server-side aggregation and fairness optimization, followed by model distribution back to clients. The Scaff-PD-IA algorithm coordinates this cycle while maintaining minimax-optimal convergence rates.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The framework trades some communication efficiency for fairness optimization, requiring additional rounds for relative fairness assessment. However, the algorithm balances this by maintaining computational efficiency through stochastic optimization techniques.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Increased variance in client losses indicates convergence issues
- Disproportionate communication overhead suggests optimization imbalance
- Persistent performance gaps between subgroups indicate algorithmic limitations

**First Experiments:**
1. Verify relative fairness index computation on synthetic heterogeneous data
2. Test convergence behavior on controlled federated learning scenarios
3. Evaluate communication efficiency under varying client participation rates

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Theoretical analysis relies on assumptions about client data distributions that may not hold in real-world scenarios
- Evaluation is limited to specific datasets without comprehensive testing across diverse domains
- Computational overhead characterization is incomplete, particularly regarding communication rounds
- The relative fairness metric may not capture all aspects of fairness relevant to different application contexts

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |

| Theoretical convergence guarantees | High |
| Algorithm effectiveness in reducing relative unfairness | High |
| Practical applicability across diverse federated learning scenarios | Medium |
| Trade-off between fairness and accuracy | High |

## Next Checks

1. Test the framework on additional real-world federated datasets with varying levels of data heterogeneity and client participation patterns
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the impact of different components of the Scaff-PD-IA algorithm on both fairness and performance
3. Evaluate the framework under realistic communication constraints and compare its performance against other federated learning algorithms in terms of both convergence speed and resource utilization
