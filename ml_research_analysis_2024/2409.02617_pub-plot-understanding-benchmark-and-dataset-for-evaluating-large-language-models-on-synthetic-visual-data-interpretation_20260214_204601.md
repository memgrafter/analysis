- Synthetic benchmark dataset to evaluate LLM visual data interpretation capabilities

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces PUB, a synthetic benchmark dataset designed to evaluate large language models' ability to interpret visual data visualizations including time series, histograms, violin plots, boxplots, and clusters. The dataset is generated using controlled parameters to ensure comprehensive coverage and eliminate data contamination issues common in existing benchmarks. The authors employ multimodal prompts with structured JSON-formatted responses and introduce quantitative metrics to assess model performance.

Benchmarking several state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4, Gemini, Claude) reveals varying degrees of success across different visualization types, with Claude-3-5-Sonnet showing the strongest overall performance (0.682 on clustering tasks) and GPT-4o-mini consistently underperforming. The results highlight specific strengths and weaknesses in visual data interpretation capabilities, providing valuable insights for future improvements in multimodal LLMs.

## Method Summary
The authors developed PUB as a synthetic benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate LLM capabilities in visual data interpretation. The dataset consists of five visualization types: time series, histograms, violin plots, boxplots, and clusters. Each visualization is generated with controlled parameters to ensure comprehensive coverage of different data patterns and distributions. The evaluation methodology employs multimodal prompts that include both the visual data and structured questions, with responses expected in JSON format to facilitate quantitative assessment. The authors introduce specific metrics to measure model performance across different visualization types, enabling direct comparison between various state-of-the-art LLMs.

## Key Results
- Claude-3-5-Sonnet achieved the highest overall performance with 0.682 on clustering tasks
- GPT-4o-mini consistently underperformed across all visualization types
- Performance varied significantly across visualization types, with clustering tasks showing the strongest results
- The synthetic nature of the dataset successfully eliminated data contamination issues present in other benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The PUB benchmark works by providing controlled synthetic visualizations that allow for systematic evaluation of LLM visual interpretation capabilities. By generating data with known parameters and distributions, the benchmark can assess whether models correctly identify patterns, trends, and statistical properties without the confounding factors present in real-world data. The structured JSON response format enables quantitative measurement of model accuracy, while the variety of visualization types tests different aspects of visual comprehension.

## Foundational Learning
- **Synthetic data generation** - Why needed: To create controlled test scenarios with known ground truth; Quick check: Verify parameter ranges produce meaningful variations in visualizations
- **Multimodal prompt engineering** - Why needed: To effectively present visual data alongside analytical questions; Quick check: Test prompt variations for optimal model comprehension
- **JSON response formatting** - Why needed: To enable quantitative evaluation of model outputs; Quick check: Validate parsing accuracy and consistency across different model responses
- **Visualization type classification** - Why needed: To organize benchmark tasks by complexity and required interpretation skills; Quick check: Confirm task categorization aligns with human expert expectations
- **Quantitative performance metrics** - Why needed: To provide objective comparison between models; Quick check: Test metric sensitivity to different types of interpretation errors
- **Model comparison methodology** - Why needed: To establish relative strengths and weaknesses across different LLMs; Quick check: Verify statistical significance of performance differences

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Data Generation -> Visualization Creation -> Prompt Construction -> Model Evaluation -> Performance Analysis

### Critical Path
The critical path follows: parameter selection → synthetic data generation → visualization rendering → multimodal prompt assembly → model inference → JSON response parsing → quantitative scoring → comparative analysis

### Design Tradeoffs
The synthetic approach trades ecological validity for control and reproducibility. While real-world visualizations contain noise and complexity, synthetic data ensures consistent ground truth and eliminates contamination concerns. The JSON response format enables precise quantitative evaluation but may not reflect natural language capabilities needed for broader applications.

### Failure Signatures
Models may fail by: misinterpreting statistical properties in synthetic data that differ from real-world patterns; struggling with structured JSON output requirements despite correct visual interpretation; showing bias toward certain visualization types due to training data exposure; or failing to generalize from synthetic patterns to real-world scenarios.

### 3 First Experiments
1. Test model performance on visualizations with known parameter values to establish baseline accuracy
2. Evaluate model ability to handle mixed visualization types within single prompts
3. Compare synthetic benchmark results with human expert performance on the same visualizations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Synthetic visualizations may not fully capture real-world data complexity and noise
- Dataset coverage excludes other common chart formats like scatter plots with regression lines, heatmaps, or geographical visualizations
- JSON-formatted responses introduce structured output bias that may not reflect natural language capabilities

## Confidence
- High: Dataset construction methodology and comparative performance rankings
- Medium: Interpretation of model strengths and weaknesses based on synthetic data representation
- Low: Benchmark's ability to predict real-world performance given controlled synthetic nature

## Next Checks
1. Validate PUB's synthetic data generation against real-world visualization datasets to assess ecological validity
2. Test model performance on mixed visualization types within single prompts to evaluate cross-chart comprehension
3. Compare PUB results with human evaluation studies to establish baseline performance expectations and identify potential gaps in synthetic dataset design
