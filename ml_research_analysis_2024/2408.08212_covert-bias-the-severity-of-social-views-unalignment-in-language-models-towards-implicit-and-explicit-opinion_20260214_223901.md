# Covert Bias: The Severity of Social Views' Unalignment in Language Models Towards Implicit and Explicit Opinion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.08212
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08212
- Authors: Abeer Aldayel; Areej Alokaili; Rehab Alahmadi
- Reference count: 39
- Key outcome: This paper examines how implicit and explicit opinions affect bias amplification in large language models (LLMs)

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates bias amplification in large language models when processing implicit versus explicit opinions about sensitive social topics. The authors evaluate biased models across downstream tasks including hate speech detection and stance detection, using edge cases of extreme bias toward target groups such as women and religious communities. The study compares zero-shot, persona-biased, and fine-tuned biased models to understand how different approaches handle socially nuanced content.

The findings reveal that fine-tuned biased models exhibit higher false positive rates for opposing classes and tend to use more uncertainty phrases compared to zero-shot models, which respond more directly. Models generally perform better on explicit opinions than implicit ones, particularly in hate speech detection. The research suggests that incorporating uncertainty markers could improve LLM reliability when dealing with socially sensitive topics.

## Method Summary
The authors evaluated biased language models using downstream tasks of hate speech detection and stance detection. They tested models under three conditions: zero-shot prompting, persona-biased prompting, and fine-tuning with biased data. The experiments focused on extreme bias cases toward specific target groups (women and religious groups) and compared model performance on implicit versus explicit opinion expressions. The evaluation measured false positive rates, response directness, and usage of uncertainty markers across different model configurations.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned biased models showed higher false positive rates for opposing classes compared to zero-shot models
- Fine-tuned models used more uncertainty phrases than zero-shot models, which responded more directly
- Models generally performed better on explicit opinions than implicit ones, particularly in hate speech detection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study demonstrates that bias amplification in LLMs is significantly influenced by how opinions are expressed - explicitly or implicitly. Fine-tuned models amplify biases more severely than zero-shot approaches, leading to increased false positives and uncertainty markers. This suggests that training approaches that incorporate uncertainty markers could help models better handle socially nuanced topics by acknowledging ambiguity rather than making definitive judgments.

## Foundational Learning
- **Bias amplification in LLMs**: Understanding how pre-existing biases in training data affect model outputs, particularly on sensitive topics
- **Implicit vs explicit opinion handling**: Recognizing how different expression styles impact model performance and error patterns
- **Uncertainty markers in model responses**: Identifying linguistic patterns that signal model uncertainty and their potential role in improving reliability
- **False positive patterns in bias detection**: Understanding how biased models generate errors when encountering opposing viewpoints
- **Persona injection techniques**: Methods for incorporating specific viewpoints or biases into model responses through prompting
- **Fine-tuning for bias studies**: Approaches for deliberately creating biased models to study amplification effects

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Data preprocessing -> Model training (zero-shot/persona/biased fine-tuning) -> Downstream task evaluation (hate speech/stance detection) -> Error analysis (false positives/uncertainty markers)
- **Critical path**: Bias injection method → Opinion expression type → Model response pattern → Evaluation metric
- **Design tradeoffs**: Zero-shot models offer directness but less nuance; fine-tuned models show more uncertainty but higher error rates; implicit opinions are harder to detect but may reflect real-world complexity
- **Failure signatures**: High false positive rates for opposing classes, overuse of uncertainty markers, poor performance on implicit opinions
- **3 first experiments**: 1) Compare false positive rates across model types on explicit opinions only, 2) Analyze uncertainty marker frequency in zero-shot vs fine-tuned models, 3) Test model performance on a neutral opinion dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Experimental scope limited to two target groups (women and religious groups) and two downstream tasks
- Definition of "extreme bias" may be subjective and could influence results
- Uncertainty markers as improvement mechanism is speculative without empirical validation

## Confidence
- **High** confidence: Fine-tuned biased models produce more false positives and uncertainty markers compared to zero-shot approaches
- **Medium** confidence: Models perform better on explicit opinions than implicit ones, though the distinction may not always be clear-cut
- **Low** confidence: Incorporating uncertainty markers could improve LLM reliability on socially nuanced topics

## Next Checks
1. Replicate experiments across broader range of demographic groups and social issues to test generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies removing uncertainty markers to determine correlation with improved detection accuracy
3. Implement human evaluation component to assess whether uncertainty markers improve or confuse interpretation of model outputs
