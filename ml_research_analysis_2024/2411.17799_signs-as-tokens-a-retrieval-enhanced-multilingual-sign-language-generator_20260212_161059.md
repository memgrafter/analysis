# Signs as Tokens: A Retrieval-Enhanced Multilingual Sign Language Generator

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.17799
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17799
- Authors: Ronglai Zuo; Rolandos Alexandros Potamias; Evangelos Ververas; Jiankang Deng; Stefanos Zafeiriou
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: SOKE achieves state-of-the-art DTW errors of 2.35, 1.71, and 1.38 on How2Sign, CSL-Daily, and Phoenix-2014T respectively, with 66% reduction in decoding steps compared to sequential decoding

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SOKE, a multilingual sign language generation model that discretizes sign motions into part-wise tokens for the upper body, left hand, and right hand, then generates them in parallel using a multi-head decoding strategy. Unlike previous approaches that flatten tokens or use diffusion models, SOKE leverages a decoupled tokenizer with three parallel VQ-VAEs and incorporates retrieval-augmented generation using word-level sign dictionaries to improve precision. Trained on a unified dataset of ASL, CSL, and DGS, SOKE achieves state-of-the-art results with significantly lower DTW errors and faster inference speeds.

## Method Summary
SOKE uses a decoupled tokenizer with three parallel VQ-VAEs to encode upper body, left hand, and right hand motions into discrete tokens, which are then mapped into the LM's vocabulary alongside text tokens. The model employs a multi-head decoding strategy where three language modeling heads predict body, left hand, and right hand tokens simultaneously, reducing decoding steps by 66%. A retrieval-enhanced approach incorporates word-level signs from external dictionaries as auxiliary conditions during generation. The system is trained on a unified multilingual dataset combining How2Sign (35K ASL), CSL-Daily (20K CSL), and Phoenix-2014T (8K DGS), achieving state-of-the-art DTW errors across all datasets.

## Key Results
- Achieves DTW errors of 2.35, 1.71, and 1.38 on How2Sign, CSL-Daily, and Phoenix-2014T respectively
- Reduces decoding steps by 66% compared to sequential decoding while maintaining quality
- Improves BLEU-4 scores from 8.23 to 16.32 on How2Sign through retrieval-enhanced generation
- Outperforms baseline methods (Wav2Lip and GLOS) across all evaluation metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Discretizing continuous sign motions into body-part-specific tokens enables autoregressive modeling aligned with pretrained language models. A VQ-VAE tokenizer independently encodes upper body, left hand, and right hand motions into discrete token sequences, which are mapped into the LM's vocabulary alongside text tokens. Core assumption: Sign language semantics can be effectively captured through discrete tokens for individual body parts rather than holistic continuous representations.

### Mechanism 2
Multi-head decoding reduces inference latency by predicting multiple tokens per step while maintaining information fusion across body parts. Instead of flattening tokens into a single sequence, three language modeling heads predict body, left hand, and right hand tokens simultaneously. Core assumption: Simultaneous token prediction per body part preserves sufficient temporal coherence while enabling parallelization.

### Mechanism 3
Retrieval-augmented generation with word-level sign dictionaries improves sign generation precision by providing accurate auxiliary conditions. External sign dictionaries are built from isolated sign recognition datasets, and retrieved motion tokens for words in the input text are appended to the prompt, serving as additional conditions for the LM encoder. Core assumption: Word-level sign dictionaries provide accurate representations that can guide sentence-level generation without introducing unnatural transitions.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE)
  - Why needed here: Enables discretization of continuous sign motions into discrete tokens that can be modeled autoregressively
  - Quick check question: What role does the codebook play in VQ-VAE, and how does it differ from traditional autoencoder latent spaces?

- Concept: Autoregressive Language Modeling
  - Why needed here: Provides the framework for generating sequences of sign motion tokens conditioned on text inputs
  - Quick check question: How does the autoregressive assumption enable generation of coherent sequences, and what are the computational trade-offs?

- Concept: Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
  - Why needed here: Measures sequence-level similarity between generated and ground truth sign motions despite temporal misalignments
  - Quick check question: Why is DTW preferred over simple Euclidean distance for comparing sign motion sequences, and what are its limitations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Text prompt → Three parallel VQ-VAEs (body, left hand, right hand) → Discrete tokens → mBART-large-cc25 LM (with retrieved signs) → Multi-head decoder (weighted embedding fusion) → VQ-VAE decoders → 3D sign avatars

- Critical path: Text → Tokenizer → LM (with retrieved signs) → Multi-head Decoder → VQ-VAE Decoders → Motion Output

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Decoupled vs. unified tokenization: Better capture of body part semantics vs. potential loss of cross-part coordination
  - Sequential vs. multi-head decoding: Full temporal coherence vs. 66% reduction in decoding steps
  - Retrieval-augmented vs. pure LM generation: Improved precision vs. dependency on dictionary coverage

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor reconstruction quality: Check VQ-VAE codebook size and training
  - Inconsistent hand-body coordination: Verify multi-head decoding weighting (λ)
  - Vocabulary mismatch: Ensure retrieved signs align with text tokens
  - Slow inference: Profile multi-head decoding vs. sequential baseline

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation study: Replace multi-head decoding with sequential decoding to quantify latency vs. quality trade-off
  2. Retrieval impact: Compare generations with and without retrieved sign tokens to measure precision improvement
  3. Codebook analysis: Vary VQ-VAE codebook sizes to find optimal token granularity for sign semantics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What is the optimal architecture for the decoupled tokenizer when scaling to more sign languages with distinct morphological features? The paper only tests three sign languages with relatively similar structural properties, but different sign languages may have varying reliance on facial expressions, body movements, or hand configurations that could benefit from different tokenization strategies.

### Open Question 2
How does the quality of retrieved dictionary signs impact generation quality across different sign languages? The paper doesn't analyze how dictionary quality affects generation performance differently across languages, and some sign languages may have better dictionary resources than others, potentially creating performance disparities.

### Open Question 3
What is the impact of the multi-head decoding weighting parameter λ on sign language comprehension by native signers? The paper only evaluates λ through DTW and JPE metrics, not through perceptual studies with native signers, so the optimal weighting for objective reconstruction metrics may differ from what produces most comprehensible signs for human observers.

## Limitations
- Decoupled tokenizer approach may not capture complex inter-part dependencies crucial for natural sign language expressions
- Retrieval-enhanced mechanism depends heavily on dictionary coverage, which was only 53-65% across datasets
- Evaluation focuses primarily on DTW metrics, which may not fully capture semantic fidelity or naturalness of generated signs
- Requires extensive preprocessing to convert videos into SMPL-X poses, adding complexity and potential error propagation

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Technical implementation of decoupled tokenizer with three parallel VQ-VAEs is well-described and follows established methods; DTW error reductions are substantial with strong ablation study evidence.

**Medium Confidence**: "State-of-the-art" claim is supported by comparisons to two baselines but lacks comparisons to other recent approaches; BLEU-4 improvement is significant but backtranslation has limitations.

**Low Confidence**: Scalability to languages beyond three tested is not demonstrated; claim about 66% step reduction assumes weighted averaging effectively captures cross-part dependencies without rigorous validation.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-linguistic Generalization Test**: Evaluate SOKE on a fourth sign language dataset to verify multilingual generalization claims and assess performance when dictionary coverage drops below 50%.

2. **Semantic Fidelity Assessment**: Conduct human evaluation studies where fluent signers rate semantic accuracy and naturalness of generated signs, comparing SOKE outputs to ground truth videos and baseline methods.

3. **Dictionary Coverage Impact Analysis**: Systematically vary dictionary coverage by using subsets of retrieval data (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) to quantify relationship between coverage and generation quality, identifying minimum threshold for meaningful improvement.
