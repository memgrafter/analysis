# How Vision-Language Tasks Benefit from Large Pre-trained Models: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.08158
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08158
- Reference count: 40
- Large pre-trained models address vision-language task challenges including data scarcity, reasoning complexity, and generalization

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically examines how large pre-trained models address classic challenges in vision-language tasks. The authors categorize methods by the challenges they address: data scarcity, escalating reasoning complexity, generalization to novel samples, and task diversity. The survey introduces various paradigms including direct inference on test samples, learning from unlabeled uni-modal data, generating pseudo paired data, divide-and-conquer approaches, chain-of-thought reasoning, extracting semantic context from LLMs, distilling teacher knowledge from VLMs, continual learning, and planning with natural language or code statements.

## Method Summary
The survey provides a comprehensive taxonomy of approaches that leverage large pre-trained models to address vision-language task challenges. It categorizes methods into five main paradigms: direct inference on test samples, learning from unlabeled uni-modal data, generating pseudo paired data, divide-and-conquer strategies, and chain-of-thought reasoning. The authors systematically review how these approaches address specific challenges including data scarcity through zero/few-shot learning, reasoning complexity through decomposition and intermediate reasoning steps, generalization through external knowledge extraction and knowledge distillation, and task diversity through specialized adaptation techniques.

## Key Results
- Performance improvements in image captioning tasks with metrics like BLEU4, METEOR, CIDEr, and SPICE showing superior results
- Open-vocabulary object detection benefits from approaches achieving higher Novel AP and Apr scores
- Pre-trained models outperform traditional approaches across vision-language tasks through zero/few-shot inference capabilities
- Methods leveraging external knowledge from LLMs and VLMs show enhanced generalization to novel samples

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Pre-trained models address data scarcity by leveraging massive scale training to provide strong zero/few-shot inference capabilities.
- Mechanism: Pre-trained models (LLMs and VLMs) have learned rich representations from large-scale data, enabling them to perform tasks without task-specific annotated data through direct inference or by generating pseudo data.
- Core assumption: The knowledge and representations learned during pre-training are transferable to downstream vision-language tasks, even with minimal or no task-specific data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Thanks to the massive scale of training data and model parameters, pre-trained models have exhibited excellent performance in numerous downstream tasks."
  - [section V-A]: Describes methods like ZeroCap and CLIP-based approaches that perform zero-shot image captioning without paired training data.
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - the corpus neighbors focus on surveys of VLMs but don't directly support the mechanism of zero-shot inference.
- Break condition: If the pre-training data does not cover the domain or concepts needed for the target task, the zero/few-shot performance will degrade significantly.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Pre-trained models address escalating reasoning complexity by decomposing complex questions into simpler sub-questions and using chain-of-thought reasoning.
- Mechanism: LLMs and VLMs can be used to break down complex visual-language reasoning tasks into a series of simpler sub-questions (divide-and-conquer) or intermediate reasoning steps (chain-of-thought), which are easier to answer and can be integrated to solve the original problem.
- Core assumption: Complex reasoning tasks can be effectively decomposed into simpler components that pre-trained models can handle, and the integration of these components leads to accurate final answers.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Inspired by the powerful capabilities of pre-trained models, new paradigms have emerged to solve the classic challenges."
  - [section V-B]: Describes divide-and-conquer and chain-of-thought methods like IPVR and mm-CoT that decompose questions and reasoning processes for complex visual reasoning tasks.
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - the corpus neighbors discuss VLMs but don't specifically address the mechanism of decomposing complex reasoning.
- Break condition: If the decomposition process fails to capture the essential relationships between sub-questions or if the integration of answers is flawed, the final reasoning accuracy will suffer.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Pre-trained models address generalization to novel samples by providing external knowledge and semantic context.
- Mechanism: LLMs and VLMs contain extensive world knowledge that can be used to enrich the understanding of novel visual samples. This can be achieved by extracting semantic context from LLMs or distilling knowledge from VLMs to close-set models.
- Core assumption: The knowledge stored in pre-trained models is relevant and accurate enough to provide meaningful context for novel samples that the models haven't seen during training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "When encountering new samples that exceed the model's capabilities in real-world scenarios, the limited cross-modal knowledge in the training set is not sufficient to effectively handle these samples."
  - [section V-C]: Describes methods like VCD and ViLD that use LLMs and VLMs to provide semantic context and teacher knowledge for novel samples in image classification and object detection.
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - the corpus neighbors focus on VLMs but don't specifically address the mechanism of using external knowledge for novel samples.
- Break condition: If the pre-trained models' knowledge is outdated, irrelevant, or insufficient for the specific novel samples, the generalization performance will be poor.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Transfer Learning
  - Why needed here: Understanding how knowledge learned during pre-training can be applied to new, related tasks without extensive task-specific training.
  - Quick check question: How does the knowledge learned by CLIP on image-text pairs help it perform zero-shot image classification on unseen categories?

- Concept: Multimodal Representation Learning
  - Why needed here: Grasping how models learn to represent and align information from different modalities (vision and language) in a shared semantic space.
  - Quick check question: How does the shared semantic space learned by CLIP enable it to calculate similarities between images and text?

- Concept: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
  - Why needed here: Understanding the paradigm of breaking down complex reasoning into intermediate steps to improve accuracy and interpretability.
  - Quick check question: How does the chain-of-thought approach used in mm-CoT improve the reasoning performance on complex visual questions compared to direct prediction?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Vision Encoder -> Language Encoder -> Multimodal Fusion Module -> Task-Specific Decoder/Head
- Critical path: Input processing (vision and language) -> Feature extraction and alignment in shared space -> Multimodal fusion and reasoning -> Task-specific output generation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model size vs. inference speed
  - Pre-training data coverage vs. task-specific fine-tuning
  - Generalization vs. task-specific accuracy
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on out-of-distribution samples
  - Hallucinations or factual errors in generated outputs
  - Inability to handle compositional concepts or fine-grained details
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a zero-shot image captioning system using CLIP and an LLM to verify the data scarcity mechanism.
  2. Implement a divide-and-conquer VQA system using an LLM to decompose questions and a VLM to answer sub-questions to test the reasoning complexity mechanism.
  3. Implement a knowledge distillation approach to adapt a VLM for open-vocabulary object detection to validate the generalization mechanism.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we mitigate concept association bias in VLMs while maintaining their visual-textual similarity calculation capabilities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses how VLMs tend to treat sentences as bags of concepts, leading to concept association bias, especially in methods that rely on visual-textual similarity scores for tasks like image captioning and VQA.
- Why unresolved: While the paper suggests improving VLMs by adding deeper modality interaction or using fine-tuning with augmented data, it doesn't provide a definitive solution for balancing bias mitigation with similarity calculation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing the performance of VLMs with and without concept association bias mitigation techniques on tasks like image captioning and VQA, while also evaluating their ability to calculate visual-textual similarities.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we effectively extract fine-grained semantic context from LLMs to enhance VLMs' generalization to novel samples, especially for distinguishing visually similar but different categories?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses using LLMs to provide semantic context for novel samples, but notes that fine-grained contexts may still be ambiguous to VLMs due to their confusion on compositional concepts.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't provide a clear solution for extracting and utilizing fine-grained semantic context effectively, and how to address the compositional concept confusion issue in VLMs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Research demonstrating methods for extracting and integrating fine-grained semantic context from LLMs into VLMs, along with experiments showing improved performance on tasks requiring distinction between visually similar categories.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we design a unified system that combines multiple pre-trained models and specialized detectors to address the confusion on compositional concepts in VLMs, while maintaining efficiency and scalability?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper suggests using a unified system with multiple models and detectors, but doesn't provide a concrete design or evaluate its efficiency and scalability.
- Why unresolved: Designing such a system requires addressing challenges like information overload, model integration, and computational efficiency, which are not fully explored in the paper.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of a unified system that integrates multiple pre-trained models and specialized detectors, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing compositional concept confusion while maintaining efficiency and scalability on various vision-language tasks.

## Limitations

- The survey focuses on conceptual frameworks rather than providing quantitative performance comparisons across methods, making it difficult to assess which approaches work best in practice
- Many claims rely on cited papers rather than direct experimental validation within this survey
- The scope is limited to English-language literature, potentially missing relevant work in other languages
- No discussion of computational costs or practical deployment considerations for these approaches

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The categorization of challenges (data scarcity, reasoning complexity, generalization, task diversity) is well-supported by multiple references and represents established problems in the field
- **Medium Confidence**: The proposed mechanisms for how pre-trained models address these challenges are plausible but would benefit from more direct empirical validation
- **Low Confidence**: Specific performance claims and benchmark results are not directly verified in this survey paper

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of pre-trained model components versus task-specific training for each challenge category
2. Perform systematic evaluation of hallucination and bias issues across different pre-trained model architectures and datasets
3. Benchmark computational efficiency and memory requirements for deploying these approaches in resource-constrained environments
