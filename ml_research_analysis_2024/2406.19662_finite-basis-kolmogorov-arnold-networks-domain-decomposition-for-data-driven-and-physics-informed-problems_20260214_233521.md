# Finite basis Kolmogorov-Arnold networks: domain decomposition for data-driven and physics-informed problems

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19662
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Domain decomposition method for KANs using partition of unity functions improves accuracy for noisy data and multiscale problems

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces finite basis KANs (FBKANs), a domain decomposition approach that divides the problem domain into overlapping subdomains, each with its own KAN. The method uses partition of unity functions to combine outputs from individual KANs, enabling parallel training and improved accuracy for challenging problems. The approach is tested on both data-driven and physics-informed problems, showing significant error reduction compared to single KANs, particularly for noisy data with up to 18.1% relative noise.

## Method Summary
FBKANs decompose the problem domain into L overlapping subdomains, each with its own KAN trained to approximate the solution in that subdomain. The outputs are combined using partition of unity functions ωj(x) that satisfy ∑j ωj(x) = 1 and have compact support. The overall solution is PL j=1 ωj(x)Kj(x;θj) where Kj represents the j-th KAN with parameters θj. The method is trained by minimizing a combined loss function that includes data fitting terms and physics-informed terms, using the ADAM optimizer with learning rates between 0.01-0.04.

## Key Results
- For 18.1% noisy data, FBKAN reduced relative ℓ² error from 0.1404 to 0.0646
- FBKANs achieved first-order convergence of relative ℓ² error with increasing subdomains
- Improved performance on physics problems like Helmholtz and wave equations compared to single KANs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Domain decomposition with partition of unity functions allows multiple small KANs to be trained in parallel, reducing computational burden and improving accuracy for multiscale problems
- Mechanism: The domain is decomposed into overlapping subdomains, each with its own KAN. Partition of unity functions ensure smooth transitions between subdomains and allow the outputs of individual KANs to be combined into a single solution
- Core assumption: The partition of unity functions can effectively combine the outputs of individual KANs without introducing significant errors at subdomain boundaries
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The approach uses partition of unity functions to combine outputs from individual KANs trained on overlapping subdomains"
  - [section 2.3] "Each overlapping subdomain Ωj is the interior of the support of a corresponding function ωj, and all functions ωj form a partition of unity"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: FBKANs can improve accuracy for noisy data and multiscale oscillations by using multiple smaller KANs, each specialized for a specific region of the domain
- Mechanism: Smaller KANs are less prone to overfitting noisy data and can be trained with higher resolution grids in regions with fine-scale features, leading to improved accuracy
- Core assumption: The local KANs can effectively capture the local features of the solution without being overly influenced by noise or the need to represent global features
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Testing on data-driven and physics-informed problems shows that finite basis KANs (FBKANs) provide more accurate results than single KANs, particularly for noisy data and multiscale oscillations"
  - [section 3.1.2] "In the noisiest case, with relative noise of 18.1% added to the training set, the KAN yields a relative ℓ2 error of 0.1404, whereas the FBKAN yields a relative error of 0.0646"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: FBKANs can improve the training of KANs for challenging cases by providing a scalable architecture that can be combined with existing techniques to improve training
- Mechanism: The domain decomposition approach allows for the use of smaller KANs, which are less expensive to train. Additionally, the partition of unity functions provide a mechanism for combining the outputs of individual KANs without the need for enforcing transmission conditions
- Core assumption: The domain decomposition approach can effectively reduce the computational cost of training KANs while maintaining or improving accuracy
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The method also improved performance on physics problems like the Helmholtz equation and wave equation, with FBKANs achieving lower relative errors compared to single KANs"
  - [section 2.4] "FBKANs are trained to minimize the loss function...composed of...terms for physics-informed training...In this way, FBKANs are adaptable to given problem characteristics"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Kolmogorov-Arnold Theorem
  - Why needed here: The KAN architecture is based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, which states that any multivariate continuous function can be represented as a superposition of continuous functions of one variable
  - Quick check question: What is the key insight of the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem that is exploited by KANs?

- Concept: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
  - Why needed here: FBKANs are an extension of PINNs that use KANs instead of traditional neural networks. Understanding PINNs is crucial for understanding the motivation and implementation of FBKANs
  - Quick check question: How do PINNs incorporate physical laws into the training of neural networks?

- Concept: Domain Decomposition Methods
  - Why needed here: FBKANs use domain decomposition to break down the problem domain into smaller subdomains, each with its own KAN. Understanding domain decomposition methods is essential for understanding the architecture and implementation of FBKANs
  - Quick check question: What are the key advantages of using domain decomposition methods for solving partial differential equations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Domain decomposition -> Partition of unity functions -> Multiple KANs -> Combined solution
- Critical path: 1. Decompose the domain into subdomains. 2. Initialize KANs for each subdomain. 3. Train each KAN on its respective subdomain. 4. Combine the outputs of individual KANs using partition of unity functions
- Design tradeoffs: Using smaller KANs reduces computational cost but may require more subdomains to achieve the same accuracy. The choice of partition of unity functions can affect the smoothness of the final solution
- Failure signatures: If the subdomains are not chosen appropriately, the local KANs may not be able to capture the relevant features of the solution. If the partition of unity functions are not smooth, the final solution may have discontinuities at subdomain boundaries
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test FBKANs on a simple 1D function with known solution to verify that the architecture can accurately approximate the solution
  2. Compare the performance of FBKANs with a single KAN on a noisy dataset to demonstrate the benefits of the domain decomposition approach
  3. Apply FBKANs to a physics-informed problem, such as the Helmholtz equation, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach for solving partial differential equations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of FBKANs scale with the number of subdomains compared to theoretical predictions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows FBKANs achieving "approximately first order convergence of the relative ℓ2 error for a large number of subdomains" but doesn't provide theoretical justification for this scaling
- Why unresolved: The authors observe empirical scaling but don't provide rigorous mathematical analysis of why first-order convergence occurs or what the theoretical limits might be
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical analysis of the approximation properties of FBKANs with multiple subdomains, potentially using tools from domain decomposition theory and spline approximation theory

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal overlap ratio δ for FBKANs across different problem types?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses a fixed overlap ratio δ = 1.9 for all experiments but doesn't explore how varying this parameter affects performance
- Why unresolved: The choice of overlap ratio significantly impacts both accuracy and computational cost, but the paper doesn't systematically study this trade-off
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive sensitivity analysis showing how different overlap ratios affect accuracy and training time across various problem classes

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do FBKANs compare to other domain decomposition methods like XPINNs in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions XPINNs as an alternative domain decomposition method but doesn't provide direct comparisons between the two approaches
- Why unresolved: While FBKANs avoid the need for boundary condition enforcement between subdomains, the paper doesn't quantify whether this advantage translates to better performance in practice
- What evidence would resolve it: Direct numerical comparisons of FBKANs and XPINNs on identical problems, measuring both accuracy and computational resources required

## Limitations
- Limited theoretical analysis of convergence rates and error bounds for the domain decomposition approach
- Computational efficiency gains are not explicitly quantified or benchmarked against alternatives
- Validation primarily on specific test cases without systematic exploration of problem characteristics or dimensions

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The core mechanism of domain decomposition with partition of unity functions is well-established in the numerical analysis literature and the implementation appears sound based on the provided equations and methodology.

**Medium Confidence:** The performance improvements on specific test cases are demonstrated convincingly, but the generalizability to more complex, higher-dimensional problems remains uncertain. The 18.1% noise reduction example is compelling, but the noise model and its relevance to real-world applications should be further examined.

**Medium Confidence:** The physics-informed applications show improvements, but the comparison is primarily against single KANs rather than established PINN methods, making it difficult to assess the relative contribution of the domain decomposition approach versus other architectural improvements.

## Next Checks
1. **Convergence Analysis:** Perform a systematic study of how the number of subdomains (L) affects convergence rates and final accuracy. Test whether increasing L beyond 4 continues to improve results or if there's a point of diminishing returns.

2. **Computational Cost Benchmarking:** Measure and compare the total training time (including partition of unity function optimization) against single KANs and traditional PINNs across multiple problem sizes. This should include GPU/CPU utilization metrics to quantify the claimed parallelization benefits.

3. **Generalization Testing:** Apply FBKANs to problems with different characteristics - such as discontinuous solutions, higher-dimensional inputs (3D+), and problems with different types of physics constraints - to assess the robustness and limitations of the approach beyond the specific cases presented.
