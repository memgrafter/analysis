# Application of Multimodal Large Language Models in Autonomous Driving

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.16410
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16410
- Authors: Md Robiul Islam
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: MLLM-based approach achieves zero failure rates in intersection/roundabout scenarios with lower inefficiency rates (2.0-5.0%) compared to RL/MPC baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses limitations in autonomous driving systems by integrating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for improved decision-making in complex driving scenarios. The authors construct a Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset and fine-tune CogVLM2, incorporating Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning to break down AD tasks into scene understanding, prediction, and decision-making. Experiments in the Highway-env simulation environment show the MLLM-based approach achieves superior performance compared to reinforcement learning (RL) and model predictive control (MPC) baselines, with zero failure rates in intersection and roundabout scenarios, and lower inefficiency rates (2.0-5.0%) across all tested scenarios.

## Method Summary
The study constructs a VQA dataset from BDD100k and Kitti images, then fine-tunes CogVLM2 to specialize it for autonomous driving tasks. Chain of Thought reasoning is implemented to decompose the decision-making process into three sequential phases: scene understanding, prediction, and decision-making. The approach is evaluated in the Highway-env simulation environment across intersection, roundabout, highway, and merge scenarios, comparing performance metrics against RL and MPC baselines.

## Key Results
- MLLM-based approach achieves zero failure rates in intersection and roundabout scenarios
- Lower inefficiency rates (2.0-5.0%) compared to RL and MPC baselines across all tested scenarios
- Superior performance in complex traffic scenarios through multimodal reasoning capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: MLLM-based approach achieves superior performance by breaking down AD tasks into scene understanding, prediction, and decision-making using Chain of Thought reasoning.
- Mechanism: The Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning splits the decision-making process into three phases: scene understanding, prediction, and choice. This structured approach allows the MLLM to process complex driving scenarios systematically rather than attempting holistic reasoning.
- Core assumption: The AD task can be effectively decomposed into three distinct phases that follow a logical sequence and can be individually validated.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We then break down the AD decision-making process by scene understanding, prediction, and decision-making. Chain of Thought has been used to make the decision more perfectly."
  - [section] "The CoT splits the decision-making process into three phases: scene understanding, prediction, and choice."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - the corpus shows related papers mention similar decomposition approaches but lacks direct experimental validation of this specific three-phase CoT structure.
- Break condition: The mechanism breaks when scenarios require simultaneous processing of multiple phases that cannot be separated, or when temporal dependencies between phases create feedback loops that the linear CoT approach cannot handle.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Fine-tuning CogVLM2 on a custom VQA dataset improves performance on AD-specific tasks compared to generic MLLMs.
- Mechanism: The authors created a Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset using images from BDD100k and Kitti, then fine-tuned CogVLM2 on this dataset to specialize it for AD tasks. This domain-specific fine-tuning addresses the "poor performance of MLLM on AD" mentioned in the abstract.
- Core assumption: The performance limitations of generic MLLMs on AD tasks can be overcome through domain-specific fine-tuning on carefully constructed datasets.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We constructed a Virtual Question Answering (VQA) dataset to fine-tune the model and address problems with the poor performance of MLLM on AD."
  - [section] "To address the scarcity of relevant datasets, we created a VQA dataset using common instances from BDD100k [35] and Kitti [36]."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - while related papers mention domain adaptation, there's limited corpus evidence specifically about VQA-based fine-tuning for AD tasks.
- Break condition: The mechanism breaks when the fine-tuning dataset doesn't adequately represent the diversity of real-world driving scenarios, or when the fine-tuning process causes catastrophic forgetting of general MLLM capabilities.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: MLLM-based approach shows zero failure rates in intersection and roundabout scenarios while maintaining low inefficiency rates.
- Mechanism: The MLLM framework outperforms traditional approaches (RL and MPC) by better predicting and responding to complex traffic scenarios through its multimodal reasoning capabilities and structured decision process.
- Core assumption: The superior performance metrics (zero failure rates, lower inefficiency) are directly attributable to the MLLM architecture rather than simulation-specific factors or simplified scenarios.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Experiments in the Highway-env simulation environment show the MLLM-based approach achieves superior performance compared to reinforcement learning (RL) and model predictive control (MPC) baselines, with zero failure rates in intersection and roundabout scenarios, and lower inefficiency rates (2.0-5.0%) across all tested scenarios."
  - [section] "Table I displays the findings of measuring failure probability, ineffective decision likelihood, and average job completion time."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - the corpus contains no direct evidence about failure rates or comparison with RL/MPC baselines.
- Break condition: The mechanism breaks when tested on more complex or realistic scenarios not captured in the Highway-env simulation, or when computational constraints prevent real-time processing in actual deployment.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Chain of Thought reasoning
  - Why needed here: AD tasks require complex multi-step reasoning that benefits from explicit decomposition into scene understanding, prediction, and decision phases
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how breaking down AD tasks into three sequential phases helps manage the complexity of autonomous driving decision-making?

- Concept: Multimodal learning integration
  - Why needed here: Autonomous driving requires processing both visual inputs (camera images) and textual reasoning (navigation instructions, traffic rules)
  - Quick check question: How does combining visual and textual processing capabilities enable better AD decision-making compared to single-modality approaches?

- Concept: Fine-tuning for domain adaptation
  - Why needed here: Generic MLLMs trained on web-scale data lack the specialized knowledge needed for safe and effective AD performance
  - Quick check question: What are the key considerations when creating a VQA dataset for fine-tuning an MLLM for autonomous driving applications?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Perception input pipeline (cameras, sensors)
  - VQA dataset and fine-tuning module
  - Chain of Thought reasoning engine
  - Scene understanding module
  - Prediction module
  - Decision-making module
  - Action decoder for vehicle control
  - Highway-env simulation environment for testing

- Critical path: Sensor input → Scene understanding → Prediction → Decision-making → Action output
  The Chain of Thought reasoning creates dependencies where each phase must complete before the next begins, making this the critical sequential path.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Performance vs. interpretability: CoT provides better interpretability but may introduce latency
  - Fine-tuning vs. generalization: Domain-specific fine-tuning improves AD performance but may reduce general reasoning capabilities
  - Zero-shot vs. few-shot learning: The approach requires some fine-tuning data rather than pure zero-shot inference

- Failure signatures:
  - High inefficiency rates (>5%) indicate poor decision quality even when no failures occur
  - Increased failure rates in specific scenario types (e.g., roundabouts) suggest architectural limitations
  - Degradation in performance with unseen weather conditions points to fine-tuning dataset limitations

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement the three-phase CoT reasoning structure and test on simple intersection scenarios to verify the decomposition approach works as intended
  2. Fine-tune CogVLM2 on the custom VQA dataset and evaluate scene understanding performance on BDD100k images to validate the fine-tuning process
  3. Compare the complete MLLM-based approach against RL and MPC baselines in the Highway-env simulation to establish baseline performance metrics

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset Diversity Validation**: Test the fine-tuned MLLM on a broader set of driving scenarios including adverse weather conditions, night driving, and edge cases not represented in the current VQA dataset to assess generalization capabilities.

2. **Real-World Simulation Testing**: Deploy the MLLM-based approach in more complex simulation environments like CARLA or LGSVL that better represent real-world driving complexity, including dynamic obstacles and sensor noise.

3. **Computational Feasibility Assessment**: Measure inference latency across different hardware configurations and compare against real-time requirements for AD systems, including analysis of worst-case decision times under heavy computational load.
