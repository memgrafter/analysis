# A Path Towards Legal Autonomy: An interoperable and explainable approach to extracting, transforming, loading and computing legal information using large language models, expert systems and Bayesian networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.18537
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18537
- Reference count: 0
- This paper proposes a method for enabling AIS to autonomously interpret and comply with existing legal regulations through ETLC (Extract, Transform, Load, Compute) systems

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of legal autonomy for artificial intelligence systems by proposing a method to automatically extract, transform, and compute legal information using large language models (LLMs), expert systems, and Bayesian networks. The approach enables AIS to interpret legal regulations and make legally compliant decisions while maintaining interoperability across different jurisdictions and providing explainable reasoning. The authors demonstrate their method using California Vehicle Code article 38750 b) to determine whether an autonomous car should start its engine based on compliance with legal requirements.

## Method Summary
The proposed ETLC system combines LLMs for extracting decision paths from legal text, expert legal systems for formal rule representation, and Bayesian networks for reasoning under uncertainty. The method transforms legal rules into decision paths using an ontology of evidence, criteria, and consequences, with LLMs automating the transformation from unstructured legal text. Bayesian networks then enable probabilistic reasoning about uncertain evidence while maintaining explainable decision-making processes. The system aims to achieve both interoperability across jurisdictions and explainability for human oversight.

## Key Results
- Proposes a formal decision path ontology for representing legal rules as evidence→criterion→consequence chains
- Demonstrates integration of LLMs, expert systems, and Bayesian networks for legal compliance reasoning
- Shows potential for enabling AIS to autonomously interpret and comply with existing legal regulations
- Addresses both interoperability (cross-jurisdiction deployment) and explainability (human-interpretable decisions)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Legal decision paths provide a formal, human-interpretable structure for representing legal rules that can be processed by AIS. Decision paths break legal rules into evidence, criteria, and consequence nodes following propositional logic (material implication), allowing deterministic reasoning through modus ponens. Core assumption: Legal rules can be adequately represented as implication chains without losing essential meaning. Evidence anchors: [abstract] "decision paths provide an ontology that arguably applies to any set of rules" and [section 3.1] "Any rule boils down to the implication relation between a criterion and its consequence."

### Mechanism 2
Large Language Models can automatically transform unstructured legal text into structured decision paths. LLMs parse natural language legal text and output the evidence, criteria, and consequence components in a format compatible with decision path systems. Core assumption: LLMs can reliably extract the logical structure of legal rules from natural language without human intervention. Evidence anchors: [abstract] "we suggest using an approach similar to the one presented in Janatian et al. [5]" and [section 3.2] "the system will create a decision path that can serve as the basis for the formal structure."

### Mechanism 3
Bayesian networks enable probabilistic reasoning under uncertainty while maintaining explainability in legal decision-making. Bayesian networks model the conditional probabilities between evidence and criteria, allowing AIS to compute posterior probabilities for uncertain legal criteria while preserving traceable reasoning paths. Core assumption: Legal criteria can be modeled as probabilistic relationships between observable evidence and legal outcomes. Evidence anchors: [abstract] "The Bayesian network enables us to translate the expert system into computable paths to decisions" and [section 3.3] "Bayesian networks are used to enable the AIS to infer the legally permissible action."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Propositional logic and modus ponens
  - Why needed here: Decision paths are fundamentally based on material implication and modus ponens reasoning
  - Quick check question: If evidence E supports criterion C, and C implies consequence S, what can be concluded about S when E is true?

- Concept: Conditional probability and Bayes' theorem
  - Why needed here: Bayesian networks use conditional probabilities to update beliefs about legal criteria based on observed evidence
  - Quick check question: How do you compute P(Criteria|Evidence) given P(Criteria), P(Evidence|Criteria), and P(Evidence)?

- Concept: Natural language processing for legal text
  - Why needed here: LLMs must extract structured legal components from unstructured text
  - Quick check question: What are the three components (evidence, criterion, consequence) that must be identified in a legal rule?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: LLM module -> Decision path engine -> Bayesian network engine -> Evidence input interface -> Explanation generator
- Critical path: Legal text → LLM transformation → Decision path creation → Bayesian inference → Action decision → Explanation generation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. explainability: More complex probabilistic models may reduce transparency
  - Speed vs. thoroughness: Real-time decisions may require simplified reasoning
  - LLM accuracy vs. human review: Fully automated vs. expert-validated decision paths
- Failure signatures:
  - LLM misidentifies rule components → incorrect decision paths
  - Bayesian priors poorly calibrated → unreliable probability estimates
  - Sensor data quality issues → evidence uncertainty propagation
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test LLM on simple legal rules (California Vehicle Code section) to verify decision path extraction accuracy
  2. Implement Bayesian network for single criterion with synthetic evidence to validate probability calculations
  3. Combine LLM-extracted decision path with Bayesian network to make simple yes/no decisions on mock autonomous vehicle scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can legal autonomy be effectively implemented for artificial intelligence systems to autonomously interpret and comply with existing legal regulations? Basis: [explicit] The paper proposes a method for enabling AIS to autonomously interpret and comply with existing legal regulations. Why unresolved: While the paper outlines this approach, it does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies demonstrating successful implementation in various legal domains and jurisdictions.

### Open Question 2
What are the ethical implications of granting legal autonomy to artificial intelligence systems? Basis: [inferred] The paper mentions the need for explainability and accountability in AIS decision-making processes. Why unresolved: The paper addresses technical aspects but does not delve into ethical implications. What evidence would resolve it: Philosophical and ethical analyses exploring implications including accountability, responsibility, and impact on human rights.

### Open Question 3
How can the interoperability of artificial intelligence systems be ensured across different jurisdictions with varying legal frameworks? Basis: [explicit] The paper discusses the challenge of legal interoperability and the need for AIS to conform to laws in their jurisdiction of operation. Why unresolved: While the paper proposes a method for extracting and computing legal information, it does not provide a comprehensive solution for cross-jurisdictional interoperability. What evidence would resolve it: Comparative legal studies examining feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method across diverse legal systems.

## Limitations

- Scalability to complex legal domains with overlapping requirements remains uncertain
- Reliability of LLM-extracted decision paths across different legal writing styles and jurisdictions is unproven
- System's handling of conflicts between different legal rules or priorities is not specified

## Confidence

- High confidence: The decision path ontology provides a sound conceptual framework for representing legal rules
- Medium confidence: LLM capability to extract decision paths from legal text based on demonstrated success in related work
- Low confidence: Bayesian network implementation details and their integration with LLM-extracted paths for real-world scenarios

## Next Checks

1. Test the LLM decision path extraction on 10+ diverse legal rules from different jurisdictions (e.g., EU GDPR, US federal regulations) to assess generalizability and accuracy across legal domains
2. Implement a complete end-to-end system using the California Vehicle Code example, feeding synthetic sensor data through the Bayesian network to verify the system produces correct legal compliance decisions
3. Conduct a formal expert review comparing LLM-extracted decision paths against manually created paths for complex multi-criteria legal rules to quantify accuracy and identify systematic error patterns
