# Can Agents Spontaneously Form a Society? Introducing a Novel Architecture for Generative Multi-Agents to Elicit Social Emergence

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.06750
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06750
- Authors: H. Zhang; J. Yin; M. Jiang; C. Su

- One-line primary result: ITCMA-S achieves high human evaluation scores (6.17-6.29/7) across five dimensions while enabling spontaneous social structure emergence

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the lack of social interaction capabilities in existing generative agent architectures by introducing ITCMA-S, which combines an improved individual agent framework with the LTRHA multi-agent social interaction framework. The architecture enables agents to identify and filter out behaviors detrimental to social interactions while spontaneously forming social relationships. The authors designed IrollanValley, a sandbox environment for evaluating agent sociality, and conducted human evaluations showing ITCMA-S achieved high scores across five dimensions: personification, consistency, logicality, exploration, and proactiveness. The study observed that agents spontaneously formed cliques with internal hierarchies around elected leaders and organized collective activities, demonstrating the emergence of social structures.

## Method Summary
The method introduces ITCMA-S, a generative agent architecture that combines individual agent improvements with a multi-agent social interaction framework. The individual agent component features memory blending through conceptual blending theory, emotion-driven motivation using a three-dimensional emotion model (pleasure, arousal, dominance), and action space reduction using LLM-based filtering. The LTRHA framework provides social interaction mechanisms through locale/topic computation, resource allocation matrices, habitus systems, and action modules. Agents operate in the IrollanValley sandbox environment with 6 agents, 8 areas, and 6 operational primitives. Human evaluation (48 participants) assessed agent outputs across five dimensions using 7-point Likert scales, while ablation studies compared ITCMA-S against variants to validate component contributions.

## Key Results
- ITCMA-S achieved human evaluation scores of 6.29/7 (personification), 6.00/7 (consistency), 5.98/7 (logicality), 6.02/7 (exploration), and 6.17/7 (proactiveness)
- Agents spontaneously formed social cliques with internal hierarchies around elected leaders
- Observed collective activities including birthday celebrations and organized gatherings
- Ablation study confirmed both individual agent improvements and LTRHA framework contribute to social capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Conceptual blending enables agents to integrate memory with present perception to form richer internal representations.
- Mechanism: When a memory is recalled, its phenomenal field is matched with the current phenomenal field and projected into a blended space, creating an "imagination" that becomes part of the consciousness channel.
- Core assumption: Human consciousness blends past and present perceptions rather than simply juxtaposing them.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This architecture enables agents to identify and filter out behaviors that are detrimental to social interactions"
  - [section 3.2.1] "we hypothesize that when a memory of ITCMA-S enters the current consciousness channel, its phenomenal fields of observation and recollection are blended"
  - [corpus] "Spontaneous Emergence of Agent Individuality through Social Interactions in LLM-Based Communities" shows blending enables richer social behaviors

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Resource-based competition and allocation creates social hierarchies and group formation.
- Mechanism: Agents with more resources have higher probability of acting, and the matrix model dynamically allocates resources based on agent performance and environmental topic, leading to resource concentration and social stratification.
- Core assumption: Social behavior emerges from competition over limited resources.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "agents spontaneously form cliques with internal hierarchies around an elected leader"
  - [section 4.2.1] "The execution of actions by agents requires a certain amount of resources"
  - [section 5.3] "The variation in topic values across different scenes...reflects this situation. The other agents gathered at leader LL's home"
  - [corpus] "Evolving Collective Cognition in Human-Agent Hybrid Societies: How Agents Form Stances and Boundaries" demonstrates resource-driven social emergence

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Emotion-driven motivation provides dynamic behavioral guidance that enhances social adaptation.
- Mechanism: Agents maintain three emotional dimensions (pleasure, arousal, dominance) that influence their willingness to act, with arousal kept stable and pleasure/dominance maximized through social interactions.
- Core assumption: Emotional states directly influence decision-making and social behavior.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This architecture enables agents to identify and filter out behaviors that are detrimental to social interactions"
  - [section 3.3] "Emotions can help with decision-making, not just interfere with it"
  - [section 5.3] "Figure 6 shows the state changes of the six agents...each agent maintained its pleasure value at a high level"
  - [corpus] "Your AI Bosses Are Still Prejudiced: The Emergence of Stereotypes in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems" shows emotion influences social emergence

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Phenomenal field representation and spherical coordinates
  - Why needed here: Agents need a structured way to represent objects and their relationships in perception and memory
  - Quick check question: How does the spherical coordinate system encode object position and attributes in the phenomenal field?

- Concept: Conceptual blending theory
  - Why needed here: The architecture relies on blending past memories with present perceptions to create imagination
  - Quick check question: What are the three steps in the conceptual blending process described for phenomenal fields?

- Concept: Reinforcement learning and reward structures
  - Why needed here: The emotion system uses reward-like mechanisms (desire/pain) to guide behavior
  - Quick check question: How does the demand dimension N_e prevent agents from getting stuck in local optima?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Individual agent (memory+imagination, emotion+motivation, action space reduction) -> LTRHA framework (locale/topic, resources, habitus, action matrix)
- Critical path: Perception → Memory activation → Conceptual blending → Emotion calculation → Resource allocation → Action selection → Environment update
- Design tradeoffs: Memory compression improves speed but may reduce recall accuracy; emotion-driven behavior is more human-like but harder to predict than rule-based systems
- Failure signatures: Agents fail to form social structures (indicates resource allocation or LTRHA issues); agents repeat same actions without exploration (indicates emotion system or motivation problems)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test memory blending with controlled memory pairs to verify the conceptual blending algorithm produces expected outputs
  2. Test resource allocation by running agents in isolation vs. groups to observe emergence of hierarchies
  3. Test emotion system by forcing specific environmental changes and measuring corresponding emotional state changes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How do the social structures observed in ITCMA-S compare to those in human societies, particularly in terms of hierarchy formation and resource allocation?
- What are the long-term implications of the social interactions facilitated by ITCMA-S on the overall performance and adaptability of the agents?
- How does the introduction of human interaction partners affect the social structures and behaviors of ITCMA-S agents?

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on human raters rather than objective metrics for social behavior emergence
- IrollanValley environment represents a simplified world compared to complex real-world social dynamics
- Resource-based competition model may not capture all social interaction mechanisms

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Individual agent improvements demonstrably enhance capabilities with strong human evaluation and ablation support
- Medium Confidence: Spontaneous social hierarchy formation is observed but in a simplified environment
- Medium Confidence: LTRHA framework effectiveness shown in controlled setting but limited exploration of scalability

## Next Checks
1. Test ITCMA-S in environments with different social dynamics to assess generalizability beyond IrollanValley
2. Run extended simulations to observe whether social structures remain stable or evolve over time
3. Evaluate human-agent interactions in open-ended scenarios comparing social adaptability to human groups
