# Recommender Algorithm for Supporting Self-Management of CVD Risk Factors in an Adult Population at Home

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.11967
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11967
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: CVD-Risk-Prevent generates correct, useful recommendations with 0.89 user satisfaction and 0.79 Cronbach's alpha

## Executive Summary
CVD-Risk-Prevent is a knowledge-based recommendation algorithm that combines rule-based logic with ChatGPT-4 to support self-management of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors at home. The algorithm evaluates 13 CVD risk factors and generates structured recommendations with targeted, informational, explanatory, and planning components based on the 2021 ESC Guidelines. Expert evaluation and user satisfaction studies with 15 participants demonstrated the algorithm produces complete, individualized recommendations that explain the importance of managing each risk factor, addressing key limitations of existing health recommendation systems.

## Method Summary
The algorithm uses a rule-based framework to identify 13 CVD risk factors from 17 CV health indicators, assigns risk classes using SCORE/SCORE2-OP models, and generates multidimensional recommendations. A key innovation is the integration of ChatGPT-4 to create explanatory items that make recommendations understandable and motivating. The system combines descriptive assessments of current risk factor states with predictive 10-year CVD risk calculations to create personalized recommendations. Evaluation included expert review of recommendation correctness and usefulness, plus user satisfaction testing with 15 participants.

## Key Results
- Algorithm generates correct and useful recommendations with 0.89 user satisfaction degree
- Cronbach's alpha of 0.79 indicates good consistency in evaluation results
- Successfully addresses limitations of existing HRS by providing complete, individualized recommendations with explanations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The algorithm generates multidimensional recommendations that match the structure of clinical CVD prevention counseling.
- Mechanism: Uses a formal model with four recommendation dimensions (targeted, informational, explanatory, planned) and maps each user's CVD risk factors to items in all four dimensions.
- Core assumption: The structure of clinical recommendations can be formalized into a consistent four-dimensional model that covers all necessary aspects of CVD prevention counseling.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The algorithm evaluates 13 CVD risk factors and creates structured recommendations including targeted, informational, explanatory, and planning components"
  - [section 3] "Recommendation items are the main components of knowledge-based recommender algorithms...a recommendation model will be understood as a text, the content of which combines recommendation items of different dimensions of meaning"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The combination of rule-based logic with LLM-generated explanations creates both accuracy and explainability in recommendations.
- Mechanism: Rules handle the deterministic aspects (risk factor identification, class assignment, recommendation structure) while ChatGPT-4 generates natural language explanations that make the recommendations understandable and motivating.
- Core assumption: LLM can reliably generate accurate, non-redundant explanations for CVD risk factors when given appropriate constraints and parameters.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 6] "ChatGPT produces correct and consistent explanations of CVD risk factors" based on analysis of 30 different prompts
  - [abstract] "The main feature of the proposed algorithm is the combination of rule-based logic with the capabilities of a large language model in generating human-like text for explanatory component"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using both descriptive and predictive CVD risk assessments in the user profile enables more personalized and forward-looking recommendations.
- Mechanism: The algorithm calculates current risk factor states (descriptive) and 10-year CVD risk probability (predictive), then uses both to generate recommendations that address both immediate and long-term health goals.
- Core assumption: Predictive risk assessment adds meaningful value to recommendation generation beyond what descriptive assessment alone provides.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4] "A user profile is proposed containing descriptive assessments of CVD risk factors and predictive ones of 10-year risk of CVD events"
  - [abstract] "The novelty of the proposed algorithm lies in...the original model of user profile including predictive assessments of CVD risk"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Rule-based recommendation systems and their advantages over other approaches
  - Why needed here: Understanding why knowledge-based systems were chosen over collaborative or content-based filtering is crucial for maintaining the algorithm's design integrity
  - Quick check question: What are the key limitations of collaborative filtering and content-based filtering that make them unsuitable for CVD risk management?

- Concept: Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompt engineering
  - Why needed here: The algorithm uses ChatGPT-4 for generating explanatory content, so understanding how to craft effective prompts and evaluate LLM output is essential
  - Quick check question: What are the three components of the prompts used to generate explanatory items, and how do they influence the output?

- Concept: Clinical risk assessment models (SCORE/SCORE2-OP)
  - Why needed here: The algorithm uses these models to calculate 10-year CVD risk, so understanding their inputs, outputs, and limitations is critical for proper implementation
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between the SCORE and SCORE2-OP models in terms of the risk factors they consider?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - 17 CV health indicators (input) -> CV risk factor model (13 factors) -> User profile builder (Factor vector + C score) -> Rule engine (3 rule types) -> ChatGPT-4 integration -> Structured multidimensional recommendations (output)

- Critical path:
  1. User inputs CV health indicators
  2. Algorithm calculates Factor vector using rules 1-5
  3. Algorithm assigns user class using rules 6-10
  4. Algorithm calculates 10-year CVD risk using SCORE2/SCORE2-OP
  5. Algorithm generates recommendation items using rules 11-13 and ChatGPT
  6. Items are ranked and concatenated into final recommendation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Rule-based vs. ML: Rules provide transparency and safety but less flexibility than learned models
  - LLM integration: Improves explainability but introduces potential for hallucination
  - Comprehensive vs. focused: 13 risk factors provide completeness but increase complexity

- Failure signatures:
  - Empty Factor vector (all zeros): User didn't provide any CV health indicators
  - Class 5 assignment: User has angina symptoms requiring urgent medical attention
  - ChatGPT timeouts or errors: LLM service unavailable or prompt issues
  - SCORE calculation failures: Missing required input values

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test with complete user profile (all 17 indicators) to verify all recommendation items are generated
  2. Test with minimal profile (only essential indicators) to verify graceful degradation
  3. Test with varying combinations of risk factors to verify correct class assignment and recommendation content

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the integration of ChatGPT-4 impact the long-term effectiveness and user engagement of CVD-Risk-Prevent compared to rule-based systems alone?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "the capabilities of ChatGPT have been examined and successfully used to create explanatory items" and notes that "explainable items in the recommendations created using ChatGPT-4 received good marks expressed in degree of user satisfaction."
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions user satisfaction and expert evaluation but does not provide long-term studies on user engagement or effectiveness compared to purely rule-based systems.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies comparing user retention, engagement metrics, and health outcomes between CVD-Risk-Prevent and traditional rule-based systems over 6-12 months.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the specific limitations of using SCORE2/SCORE2-OP models for diverse ethnic populations outside of Europe?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the SCORE2/SCORE2-OP model is applicable to individuals in Europe and notes that "CVD-Risk-Prevent algorithm does not consider such risk modifiers as psychological stress, ethnicity, imaging data and comorbidity."
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the use of European-specific models but doesn't address their applicability to other ethnic groups or global populations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies using SCORE2/SCORE2-OP models across different ethnic populations with validation against local cardiovascular risk data.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the CVD-Risk-Prevent algorithm be optimized to incorporate real-time physiological data from wearable devices while maintaining accuracy and user privacy?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the potential integration with "smart digital medical gadgets" and mentions that "future research will be focused to the developing recommendation system for supporting adults in self-management of CVD risk factors at home and its experimental studies."
- Why unresolved: While the paper suggests future integration with digital gadgets, it doesn't provide specific methods for real-time data incorporation, accuracy maintenance, or privacy protection.
- What evidence would resolve it: Technical specifications and validation studies showing the algorithm's performance with real-time data streams, privacy-preserving mechanisms, and accuracy metrics compared to static input methods.

## Limitations

- Algorithm's performance relies heavily on SCORE/SCORE2-OP models, which are based on European population data and may not generalize well to other populations
- Evaluation conducted with only 15 participants, limiting generalizability of user satisfaction results
- Effectiveness depends on user honesty and accuracy when self-reporting health indicators

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The algorithm's structural design and rule-based framework are well-specified and theoretically sound, with clear implementation pathways
- **Medium Confidence**: The integration of ChatGPT-4 for explanatory components shows promise but may face challenges with consistency and accuracy across diverse user scenarios
- **Medium Confidence**: The evaluation methodology and results are adequately described, but the small sample size limits strong conclusions about real-world effectiveness

## Next Checks

1. **Population Generalization Test**: Validate the algorithm with non-European populations to assess whether SCORE/SCORE2-OP calculations remain accurate and whether recommendations are culturally appropriate

2. **Long-term Effectiveness Study**: Conduct a longitudinal study with a larger sample (n>100) to evaluate whether the algorithm leads to sustained behavior change and improved CVD risk factor management over 6-12 months

3. **LLM Output Quality Assessment**: Implement a systematic evaluation of ChatGPT-4 generated explanations across diverse risk factor combinations to ensure consistency, accuracy, and absence of medical misinformation
