# Learning with Alignments: Tackling the Inter- and Intra-domain Shifts for Cross-multidomain Facial Expression Recognition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.05688
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05688
- Reference count: 40
- Average accuracy of 69.32%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the cross-multidomain facial expression recognition (CMFER) task, which is challenging due to inter-domain shifts across multiple domains and intra-domain shifts within the target domain. The authors propose a Learning with Alignments framework for CMFER (LA-CMFER) that uses a dual-branch architecture with global and local feature extraction. LA-CMFER tackles inter-domain shifts through a dual-level alignment method that prioritizes hard-to-align samples and clusters based on class attributes. It addresses intra-domain shifts using a multi-view clustering consistency constraint and voting scheme to refine pseudo labels. Experiments on six benchmark FER datasets show that LA-CMFER achieves superior performance, with an average accuracy of 69.32%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

## Method Summary
The Learning with Alignments framework for CMFER (LA-CMFER) employs a dual-branch architecture with global and local feature extraction. It addresses inter-domain shifts through a dual-level alignment method that prioritizes hard-to-align samples and clusters based on class attributes. For intra-domain shifts, LA-CMFER uses a multi-view clustering consistency constraint and voting scheme to refine pseudo labels. The framework demonstrates superior performance on six benchmark FER datasets, achieving an average accuracy of 69.32%.

## Key Results
- LA-CMFER achieves an average accuracy of 69.32% on six benchmark FER datasets
- The framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-multidomain facial expression recognition
- The dual-branch architecture with global and local feature extraction effectively addresses inter- and intra-domain shifts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The LA-CMFER framework effectively tackles the challenges of cross-multidomain facial expression recognition by addressing both inter-domain and intra-domain shifts. The dual-branch architecture with global and local feature extraction allows for comprehensive representation learning. The dual-level alignment method prioritizes hard-to-align samples and clusters based on class attributes, mitigating inter-domain shifts. The multi-view clustering consistency constraint and voting scheme refine pseudo labels, addressing intra-domain shifts within the target domain.

## Foundational Learning
- Cross-multidomain facial expression recognition (CMFER): Recognizing facial expressions across multiple domains, addressing inter-domain and intra-domain shifts.
  - Why needed: CMFER is challenging due to the differences in facial expressions across domains and within the target domain.
  - Quick check: Evaluate the framework's performance on benchmark datasets with varying degrees of domain shifts.

- Dual-branch architecture: A neural network architecture with separate branches for global and local feature extraction.
  - Why needed: Global and local features capture different aspects of facial expressions, enhancing the model's representational power.
  - Quick check: Compare the performance of LA-CMFER with and without the dual-branch architecture.

- Dual-level alignment: A method that prioritizes hard-to-align samples and clusters based on class attributes to address inter-domain shifts.
  - Why needed: Inter-domain shifts can lead to misalignment of features across domains, hindering accurate expression recognition.
  - Quick check: Assess the effectiveness of the dual-level alignment method in reducing inter-domain shifts.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
LA-CMFER -> Dual-branch architecture -> Global feature extraction -> Local feature extraction -> Dual-level alignment -> Multi-view clustering consistency constraint -> Voting scheme

### Critical Path
1. Dual-branch architecture extracts global and local features from input images.
2. Dual-level alignment addresses inter-domain shifts by prioritizing hard-to-align samples and clustering based on class attributes.
3. Multi-view clustering consistency constraint and voting scheme refine pseudo labels to address intra-domain shifts.
4. The refined features are used for facial expression recognition across multiple domains.

### Design Tradeoffs
- Global vs. local feature extraction: Balancing the importance of global and local features for comprehensive representation learning.
- Hard-to-align sample prioritization: Focusing on challenging samples to improve the model's robustness to inter-domain shifts.
- Multi-view consistency vs. single-view refinement: Leveraging multiple views to refine pseudo labels and mitigate intra-domain shifts.

### Failure Signatures
- Poor performance on domains with significant inter-domain shifts, indicating ineffective alignment.
- Inaccurate pseudo label refinement, suggesting limitations in addressing intra-domain shifts.
- Overfitting to specific domains, highlighting the need for better generalization across multiple domains.

### First Experiments to Run
1. Evaluate LA-CMFER's performance on benchmark datasets with varying degrees of domain shifts.
2. Conduct ablation studies to assess the contribution of each component in LA-CMFER.
3. Compare LA-CMFER with state-of-the-art methods in cross-multidomain facial expression recognition.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Limitations
1. The effectiveness of the dual-level alignment method in prioritizing hard-to-align samples and clustering based on class attributes is not thoroughly validated.
2. The multi-view clustering consistency constraint and voting scheme for refining pseudo labels could be further explained and evaluated.
3. The impact of different hyperparameter settings on the performance of LA-CMFER is not extensively explored.
