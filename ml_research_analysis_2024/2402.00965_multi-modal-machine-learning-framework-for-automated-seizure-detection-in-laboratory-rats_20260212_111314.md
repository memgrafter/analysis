# Multi-Modal Machine Learning Framework for Automated Seizure Detection in Laboratory Rats

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2402.00965
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00965
- **Reference count**: 35
- **Primary result**: Multi-modal system achieves 82% recall and 17% precision by combining ECoG, piezoelectric motion sensor data, and video recordings, reducing false positives from 1002 to 32

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a multi-modal machine learning framework for automated seizure detection in laboratory rats, combining electrocorticography (ECoG), piezoelectric motion sensor data, and video recordings. The core method involves training separate models on each data source and combining their predictions through postprocessing techniques to improve overall accuracy. The results show that the multi-modal system outperforms individual models, achieving 82% recall and 17% precision when combining all three data sources. Specifically, the system correctly identified all 10 seizure events in the test set while reducing false positives from 1002 to 32 when incorporating video data. The framework demonstrates the value of multi-modality in handling imbalanced datasets and improving detection accuracy in seizure monitoring applications.

## Method Summary
The method trains separate models on each data source (RNN and Time Series Forest for ECoG/Piezo, VideoMAE for video), combines predictions through postprocessing, and filters false positives. ECoG and piezoelectric motion sensor data are preprocessed using sliding windows and FFT transformation to reduce noise and highlight frequency components. The time series forest model, which calculates features like mean, standard deviation, and slope for each subset of time series data, outperforms RNNs for both ECoG and Piezo data. Video data is processed using the VideoMAE model. Model predictions are combined through thresholding and filtering of isolated positive predictions to reduce false positives.

## Key Results
- Multi-modal system achieves 82% recall and 17% precision when combining all three data sources
- System correctly identified all 10 seizure events in the test set
- False positives reduced from 1002 to 32 when incorporating video data
- Time series forest model outperformed RNN model for both ECoG and Piezo data sources

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multi-modal integration reduces false positives by leveraging complementary strengths of different data sources
- Mechanism: Each data source captures different aspects of seizure events - ECoG captures electrical brain activity, Piezo captures physical motion, and video captures visual manifestations. When combined, a positive prediction from one modality can be confirmed by others, reducing isolated false positives.
- Core assumption: Different modalities provide orthogonal information about seizure events
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "While each data signal works adequately on its own for prediction purposes, the significant imbalance in class labels leads to increased numbers of false positives, which can be filtered and removed by utilizing all data sources"
  - [section] "The Piezo individual performance is quite poor, but it serves as a useful complement to the stronger, primary ECoG data"
- Break condition: If modalities become correlated in their false positive patterns, the filtering benefit disappears

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Time series forest models are more effective than RNNs for this specific multi-modal seizure detection task
- Mechanism: Time series forest models handle the minute-long windowed data segments well by calculating features like mean, standard deviation, and slope for each subset, which is particularly effective for seizure detection patterns
- Core assumption: Seizure patterns have distinct statistical features that time series forest can capture better than RNNs
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The time series forest model outperformed the RNN model for both data sources"
  - [section] "The time series forest method is similar to a random forest classifier, fitting separate decision trees on different subsets of the time series and calculating features such as mean, standard deviation, and slope of each subset"
- Break condition: If seizure patterns become more complex and sequential, RNNs might outperform time series forests

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: FFT preprocessing is essential for reducing noise in ECoG signals and improving classification
- Mechanism: FFT transforms time-domain signals to frequency domain, highlighting important frequency components while discarding noise, making seizure patterns more distinguishable
- Core assumption: Seizure events manifest as distinct frequency patterns rather than just time-domain amplitude changes
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "FFT helps refine the data to focus on the most important frequency components, discarding much of the noise"
  - [section] "Table III shows that the model solely predicts the negative class when FFT is not applied"
- Break condition: If seizure patterns are primarily time-domain phenomena rather than frequency-based, FFT preprocessing could remove important information

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Class imbalance handling in machine learning
  - Why needed here: The dataset has extreme class imbalance (0.2-0.8% positive samples), which would cause models to predict only the majority class
  - Quick check question: What are three techniques for handling class imbalance besides undersampling?

- Concept: Time series classification methods
  - Why needed here: The ECoG and Piezo data are processed as time series windows, requiring specialized classification approaches
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between sliding window approaches and subsequence methods in time series classification?

- Concept: Multi-modal fusion strategies
  - Why needed here: The system combines predictions from three different modalities, requiring appropriate weighting and combination methods
  - Quick check question: What are the tradeoffs between early fusion (combining data before model training) versus late fusion (combining model predictions)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing (FFT, sliding window) → Model training (Time Series Forest for ECoG/Piezo, VideoMAE for video) → Prediction generation → Postprocessing (thresholding, isolated prediction removal) → Multi-modal fusion → Final output generation
- Critical path: Data preprocessing → Model inference → Postprocessing → Multi-modal combination → Final results
- Design tradeoffs: Using separate models per modality allows specialized processing but requires complex fusion logic; using balanced training data improves model performance but creates unrealistic expectations for inference
- Failure signatures: High false positive rates despite multi-modal combination; poor recall on any individual modality; inference times exceeding real-time requirements
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test individual model performance on balanced vs. imbalanced test sets to quantify the class imbalance problem
  2. Experiment with different threshold values for each modality to optimize the precision-recall tradeoff
  3. Test different fusion strategies (weighted average vs. voting vs. stacking) to determine optimal multi-modal combination approach

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would the system perform with additional data sources beyond ECoG, Piezo, and video?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest that the system can be generalized and modified for different environments and data types.
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates the performance of three specific data sources and does not explore the potential benefits of incorporating additional modalities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the system with additional data sources (e.g., infrared sensors, heart rate monitors) and comparing the performance improvements to the current three-source setup.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal threshold value for classifying seizures, and how does it vary across different animals or seizure types?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that the highest threshold value that identifies all seizures also detects 32 false positives, but do not explore optimal threshold values for different scenarios.
- Why unresolved: The paper uses a single threshold value for all results and does not investigate the impact of varying thresholds on precision and recall for different animals or seizure types.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with different threshold values for each animal or seizure type and analyzing the resulting precision and recall metrics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How would the system perform in real-time seizure detection scenarios, considering the inference times of each model?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors provide inference times for each model and suggest that real-time processing and classification would be possible.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not evaluate the system's performance in a real-time setting, which could be affected by factors such as data latency, model drift, or hardware limitations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing the system in a real-time seizure detection setup and measuring its performance in terms of detection accuracy, latency, and false positive rate.

## Limitations

- Small dataset size (approximately 45 hours of data from 3 rats) constrains generalizability
- Evaluation on only 10 seizure events in the test set provides limited statistical power
- Postprocessing methods for combining modalities are described but not fully specified
- Absence of comparative baselines from other seizure detection approaches limits context

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core finding that multi-modal integration reduces false positives is well-supported by the presented results (reducing false positives from 1002 to 32 when adding video data). The class imbalance problem and its impact on model performance is clearly demonstrated.
- **Medium Confidence**: The superiority of time series forest models over RNNs is demonstrated but based on limited comparison. The effectiveness of FFT preprocessing is well-demonstrated within this study but lacks external validation.
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about the generalizability of the approach to other seizure detection contexts are not supported given the limited dataset and single laboratory setting.

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset Expansion Validation**: Test the multi-modal framework on a larger, more diverse dataset with seizures from multiple laboratories and different rat strains to assess generalizability. Measure whether the false positive reduction effect persists across different seizure types and conditions.

2. **Real-time Performance Evaluation**: Implement the system in a real-time processing pipeline to measure inference latency and resource requirements. Verify that the postprocessing steps (thresholding, isolated prediction removal) can be performed within the required time constraints for clinical or research applications.

3. **Comparative Baseline Testing**: Implement and compare against established seizure detection methods (e.g., traditional EEG-based algorithms, deep learning approaches) using the same dataset. Quantify whether the multi-modal approach provides statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art single-modality methods.
