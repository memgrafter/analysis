- Introduces SAE-Track method that accelerates SAE convergence 20x while maintaining feature consistency during LLM training

## Executive Summary
This paper presents SAE-Track, a novel method for efficiently tracking feature evolution in large language models during training using a sequence of sparse autoencoders (SAEs). By leveraging recurrent initialization and activation continuity, the method dramatically accelerates SAE convergence, requiring less than 1/20 of the initial training tokens for subsequent SAEs. The study reveals that feature formation is a gradual process rather than a phase transition, with token-level features existing initially and concept-level features learning progressively. Decoder vector analysis shows that feature directions undergo significant three-phase drift even after semantic stabilization, with full directional stabilization only occurring late in training.

## Method Summary
SAE-Track introduces a continual SAE framework that tracks feature evolution throughout LLM training. The method employs recurrent initialization, where subsequent SAEs reuse parameters from previous checkpoints, and activation continuity, leveraging activation consistency across consecutive checkpoints. This approach dramatically reduces computational requirements - subsequent SAEs require less than 1/20 of the initial training tokens for convergence. The framework is validated across multiple model scales (124M to 1.4B parameters) and layers, demonstrating consistent performance improvements. By maintaining feature consistency through the training process, SAE-Track enables detailed analysis of how features evolve, including token-level to concept-level transitions and decoder vector directional drift patterns.

## Key Results
- SAE-Track achieves 20x acceleration in SAE convergence by reusing parameters from previous checkpoints
- Feature formation is gradual rather than a phase transition, with token-level features existing initially and concept-level features learning progressively
- Decoder vectors undergo three-phase directional drift (initial drift, semantic stabilization, final stabilization) even after semantic content stabilizes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SAE-Track works by exploiting the continuity in feature representation across training checkpoints. The recurrent initialization allows SAEs to start from a good prior rather than random initialization, while activation continuity ensures that the optimization landscape remains similar between consecutive checkpoints. This continuity assumption is validated by the observation that features exhibit smooth evolution rather than discontinuous jumps. The three-phase drift pattern in decoder vectors suggests that directional changes occur in distinct phases: initial rapid drift as features form, slower semantic stabilization, and finally directional convergence. This mechanism explains why features can be semantically stable while still undergoing directional changes, and why SAE-Track's continuity assumption holds despite these changes.

## Foundational Learning
- Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs): Decompose activations into interpretable features by learning sparse codes; needed for feature-level analysis of model internals; quick check: verify reconstruction loss and sparsity constraints
- Feature Continuity Assumption: Assumes features evolve smoothly between training checkpoints; needed for recurrent initialization to work; quick check: measure feature matching accuracy between consecutive SAEs
- Decoder Vector Analysis: Tracks how feature directions change during training; needed to understand feature evolution beyond activation patterns; quick check: compute angular drift between decoder vectors across checkpoints
- Token-Level vs Concept-Level Features: Distinguishes between features responding to specific tokens versus abstract concepts; needed to understand feature hierarchy development; quick check: analyze feature activation patterns across semantically related inputs
- Three-Phase Drift Pattern: Characterizes directional evolution as initial drift, semantic stabilization, and final stabilization; needed to understand when features become directionally stable; quick check: plot angular drift curves across training timeline

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Input Activations -> SAE Encoder -> Sparse Features -> SAE Decoder -> Reconstructed Activations -> Feature Analysis

**Critical Path:**
SAE initialization → Feature extraction → Decoder vector tracking → Directional drift analysis → Convergence validation

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Speed vs accuracy: Recurrent initialization accelerates convergence but may bias subsequent SAEs
- Continuity assumption: Enables efficient tracking but may miss discontinuous feature emergence
- Layer selection: Focusing on specific layers provides detail but may miss cross-layer dynamics

**Failure Signatures:**
- High reconstruction error indicating poor feature extraction
- Low feature matching accuracy suggesting feature discontinuity
- Unstable decoder vectors indicating training instability

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Measure convergence speed improvement when using recurrent initialization versus random initialization
2. Track feature matching accuracy between consecutive SAE checkpoints to validate continuity assumption
3. Analyze decoder vector angular drift patterns across different training phases to identify three-phase structure

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Results primarily demonstrated on relatively small models (124M-1.4B parameters), limiting generalizability to larger models
- SAE-Track assumes continuity between consecutive SAEs, which may not hold if training introduces discontinuous changes
- Study focuses on SAE-based feature tracking, potentially missing features that SAEs cannot capture effectively

## Confidence

**SAE-Track methodology and convergence improvements:** High - well-validated through controlled experiments with clear quantitative metrics
**Gradual feature formation versus phase transition:** Medium - supported by SAE analysis but dependent on SAE capability to capture all relevant features
**Three-phase decoder vector drift pattern:** Medium - consistent across experiments but architecture-specific; may not generalize to all model types
**Late-stage directional stabilization:** Medium - observed trends but final convergence timing may vary with model scale and training duration

## Next Checks

1. Test SAE-Track on models beyond 1.4B parameters (e.g., 7B-70B range) to verify scalability of the three-phase drift pattern and convergence properties
2. Compare SAE-Track feature tracking with alternative methods (e.g., direct feature matching, gradient-based attribution) to validate that SAE-identified features capture the true underlying dynamics
3. Extend analysis to non-LLM architectures (vision transformers, multimodal models) to determine if the gradual feature formation and late stabilization patterns are universal across different neural network types
