# Efficient PAC Learnability of Dynamical Systems Over Multilayer Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.06884
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06884
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: PAC learning algorithm efficiently infers unknown threshold functions in multilayer networks with sample complexity O(σk log(σk))

## Executive Summary
This paper studies the problem of learning interaction functions in networked dynamical systems over multilayer networks. The authors develop a PAC learning algorithm that efficiently infers unknown threshold functions with provable guarantees. They prove that only O(σk log(σk)) training examples are needed for an error rate of at most ε, where σ is the number of vertices with unknown functions and k is the number of layers. The paper also provides a tight analysis of the Natarajan dimension, proving that for almost all multilayer graphs, it is exactly kσ, which matches the upper bound and characterizes the model complexity.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a PAC learning algorithm for multilayer dynamical systems where vertices have threshold interaction functions. The algorithm infers thresholds by analyzing training examples of configuration pairs, computing scores for each vertex in each layer, and applying a max-or-min rule depending on the master function (OR or AND). The method extends to the PMAC setting where approximate predictions are allowed, reducing sample complexity by a factor of σβ. The approach is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world multilayer network datasets.

## Key Results
- Sample complexity of O(σk log(σk)) training examples suffices for PAC learning with error rate ε
- Natarajan dimension of the hypothesis class is exactly kσ for almost all multilayer graphs
- PMAC extension reduces sample size by factor of σβ while maintaining theoretical guarantees
- Experiments validate theoretical bounds and show effectiveness on real and synthetic networks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The learner only requires O(σk log(σk)) training examples to infer unknown threshold functions with provable PAC guarantees.
- Mechanism: The algorithm infers thresholds by taking the maximum score from training examples where the successor state is 0, plus one. This guarantees zero empirical risk and bounds the probability of "bad" hypotheses.
- Core assumption: The training set is sufficiently large to capture the distribution of scores needed for accurate threshold inference.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "only O(σk log(σk)) training examples are needed for an error rate of at most ε"
  - [section 3.2] "with a training set of size q = ⌈1/ϵ⋅σk⋅log(σk/δ)⌉, the proposed algorithm learns a hypothesis h∈H such that with probability at least1−δ (over T ∼Dq), PrC∼D[h(C) ≠h∗(C)]< ϵ"
  - [corpus] "Average neighbor FMR=0.507" - Weak signal, not directly related to sample complexity.
- Break condition: If the training distribution is highly skewed or sparse, the maximum score might not capture the true threshold, leading to incorrect inference.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Natarajan dimension Ndim(H) is exactly kσ for almost all multilayer graphs, characterizing model complexity.
- Mechanism: The tight analysis of Natarajan dimension uses combinatorial structures and probabilistic arguments to show that the dimension grows linearly with the number of layers and vertices with unknown thresholds.
- Core assumption: The multilayer graph structure allows for shatterable sets of size kσ.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Asymptotically, our bound on the Nararajan dimension is tight for almost all multilayer graphs"
  - [section 4.3] "for almost all graphs (i.e., almost surely) with n vertices and k ≥2 layers, Ndim(H) of the corresponding hypothesis class H is exactly σk"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence, but related papers suggest learning complexity is a key concern.
- Break condition: If the graph has a special structure (e.g., independent set or complete graph in all layers), the Natarajan dimension might be lower than kσ.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The algorithm can be extended to the PMAC setting, reducing sample size by a factor of σβ.
- Mechanism: In PMAC, approximate predictions are allowed, so the algorithm only needs to correctly predict the majority of vertices, not all.
- Core assumption: The approximation factor β is small enough that incorrect predictions on a fraction β of vertices are acceptable.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The algorithm extends to the PMAC setting, allowing approximate predictions and reducing the sample size by a factor of σβ"
  - [section 3.3] "with a training set T of size q = ⌈1/ϵ⋅1/β⋅k⋅log(σk/δ)⌉, the proposed algorithm learns anh∈H such that with probability at least1−δ over T ∼Dq, h satisfies that Pr C∼D[W(h(C), h∗(C)) ≥βσ] ≤ϵ"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence, but related papers suggest PMAC is a valid learning framework.
- Break condition: If β is too large, the approximation might not be acceptable for the application, making the PMAC extension unsuitable.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: PAC learning framework
  - Why needed here: The paper uses PAC learning to establish theoretical guarantees on the learnability of multilayer dynamical systems.
  - Quick check question: What are the two parameters that define the PAC learning guarantee, and what do they represent?

- Concept: Natarajan dimension
  - Why needed here: The Natarajan dimension is used to measure the model complexity and characterize the sample complexity of learning.
  - Quick check question: How does the Natarajan dimension generalize the VC dimension, and why is it appropriate for this multiclass learning problem?

- Concept: Multilayer networks
  - Why needed here: The paper studies dynamical systems over multilayer networks, which are more realistic and challenging than single-layer networks.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between multilayer networks and single-layer networks, and how do these differences affect the learning problem?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Training set T -> Threshold inference algorithm -> Learned hypothesis h ∈ H -> Empirical loss ℓ on test set

- Critical path:
  1. Parse input training set
  2. For each vertex v with unknown thresholds and each layer i:
     a. Compute scores Γi[C, v] for all configurations C in training set
     b. Infer threshold τh i (v) using max or min rule depending on master function
  3. Return learned system h ∈ H
  4. Evaluate h on test set to compute empirical loss ℓ

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. sample complexity: Allowing approximate predictions (PMAC) reduces sample size but increases error.
  - Computational complexity vs. theoretical guarantees: The algorithm has polynomial time complexity but relies on certain assumptions about the training distribution.
  - Generality vs. specificity: The framework handles various master functions (OR, AND) but assumes threshold interaction functions.

- Failure signatures:
  - High empirical loss ℓ: Indicates the learned hypothesis h is not a good approximation of the true system h*.
  - Slow convergence: Suggests the training set size is insufficient for the desired accuracy.
  - Unstable results: Might indicate sensitivity to the training distribution or network structure.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Vary training set size ∣T∣ for a fixed network and observe how empirical loss ℓ decreases.
  2. Fix training set size and vary the number of vertices with unknown thresholds σ; observe how ℓ increases.
  3. Fix training set size and vary the number of layers k; observe how ℓ increases with k.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the sample complexity bound change when the master function is AND instead of OR?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper proves results for OR master functions and mentions results for AND functions follow by duality.
- Why unresolved: The paper only provides detailed proofs and bounds for OR master functions, while only stating that AND results follow by duality without proving them.
- What evidence would resolve it: A complete proof of the sample complexity bound for AND master functions, showing whether the bound remains O(1/ε · σk · log(σk/δ)) or changes.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of network topology (e.g., scale-free, small-world) on the Natarajan dimension?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that real-world networks have special structures and suggests understanding Ndim on such graphs is important, but does not provide analysis for specific network topologies.
- Why unresolved: The paper only provides general bounds for Ndim and analyzes it for random graphs, but does not examine how specific network structures affect Ndim.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of Ndim for multilayer scale-free, small-world, and expander graphs, comparing these values to the bounds given in the paper.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal sample complexity for learning multilayer threshold systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper provides both lower and upper bounds on sample complexity, with a gap between them, and mentions that determining the optimal sample complexity is a well-known open problem.
- Why unresolved: The paper only provides bounds on the sample complexity but does not determine the exact optimal value.
- What evidence would resolve it: A proof showing that the sample complexity is exactly Θ(σk log(σk/δ)/ε), or a counterexample demonstrating that the lower bound is not tight.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does the presence of noisy labels in the training set affect the PAC learning algorithm's performance?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that a future direction is to consider a noisy setting where labels in the training set may be incorrect with small probability.
- Why unresolved: The paper only analyzes the noise-free case and does not provide any results or bounds for the noisy setting.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of the algorithm's performance under various noise levels, including bounds on the prediction error as a function of the noise rate.

## Limitations

- Theoretical analysis relies on specific assumptions about threshold function structures that may not hold in all real-world scenarios
- Experimental validation is limited to synthetic and small real-world datasets, leaving scalability questions open
- The extension to PMAC requires careful tuning of the approximation parameter β for practical applications

## Confidence

- Sample complexity bounds (O(σk log(σk))): High confidence - directly proven from Natarajan dimension analysis
- Natarajan dimension characterization (kσ): High confidence - combinatorial proof provided with probabilistic arguments
- PMAC extension effectiveness: Medium confidence - theoretical derivation is sound but limited empirical validation
- Real-world applicability: Medium confidence - synthetic experiments show promise but real-world performance needs further study

## Next Checks

1. **Stress test the threshold inference**: Generate training sets with varying degrees of sparsity and skewness in the score distribution. Measure how the inferred thresholds deviate from true values as the distribution becomes more imbalanced.

2. **Validate Natarajan dimension bound empirically**: For synthetic multilayer graphs of increasing size and complexity, compute the empirical Natarajan dimension by finding the largest shatterable set. Compare this to the theoretical bound kσ.

3. **Scale up PMAC experiments**: Implement the PMAC extension on larger multilayer networks (n > 100 vertices, k > 5 layers). Systematically vary β and measure the trade-off between sample size reduction and prediction accuracy on a held-out test set.
