# LCEN: A Nonlinear, Interpretable Feature Selection and Machine Learning Algorithm

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.17120
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17120
- Reference count: 37
- Primary result: LCEN achieves lower RMSE than sparse and dense methods, including neural networks, while using significantly fewer features

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LCEN (LASSO-Clip-EN), a nonlinear feature selection and machine learning algorithm that extends elastic net by incorporating basis expansion, LASSO regularization, clipping of small coefficients, and elastic net refinement. The algorithm was tested across diverse artificial and empirical datasets, demonstrating robust performance in discovering known physical laws and achieving superior accuracy with fewer features compared to both sparse and dense methods. LCEN successfully rediscovered physical laws like Stefan-Boltzmann and Kepler's Third Law with coefficient errors under 2%, while using 8-11x fewer features than competing methods.

## Method Summary
LCEN extends the elastic net method by incorporating a basis expansion step to enable nonlinear modeling, followed by LASSO regularization, a clipping step to remove small coefficients, and a final elastic net step for model refinement. The algorithm processes data through a four-stage pipeline: first expanding the feature space with nonlinear transformations, then applying LASSO for initial feature selection, clipping coefficients below a threshold to enhance sparsity, and finally refining the model with elastic net regularization. This approach allows LCEN to capture nonlinear relationships while maintaining interpretability and computational efficiency.

## Key Results
- LCEN rediscovered known physical laws (Stefan-Boltzmann, Kepler's Third Law, Newton's Law of Cooling) with coefficient errors under 2%
- On empirical datasets, LCEN achieved lower RMSEs than sparse and dense methods, including neural networks
- LCEN used significantly fewer features than competing methods (10.8x fewer than dense methods, 8.1x fewer than EN)
- LCEN demonstrated superior feature selection capabilities compared to ALVEN

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Assumption: The algorithm's effectiveness stems from its staged approach that first captures nonlinear relationships through basis expansion, then progressively refines feature selection through LASSO regularization and coefficient clipping, before final model optimization with elastic net. This multi-stage process allows LCEN to balance between model complexity and interpretability while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Foundational Learning
Assumption: LCEN builds upon established principles from elastic net regularization, LASSO feature selection, and basis expansion techniques. The algorithm leverages the sparsity-inducing properties of LASSO combined with the stability of elastic net, while the clipping mechanism enhances interpretability by forcing additional sparsity. The basis expansion component enables nonlinear modeling capabilities similar to kernel methods.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map:** Original features -> Basis Expansion -> LASSO -> Clipping -> Elastic Net Refinement
- **Critical path:** The four-stage pipeline (basis expansion → LASSO → clipping → elastic net) forms the core workflow
- **Design tradeoffs:** Balances model complexity (through basis expansion) against interpretability (through feature selection) and computational efficiency
- **Failure signatures:** Performance degradation when basis expansion is inappropriate for the data structure, or when clipping threshold is set too high/low
- **3 first experiments:**
  1. Test LCEN on simple synthetic datasets with known nonlinear relationships
  2. Compare LCEN performance with varying basis expansion complexity levels
  3. Evaluate sensitivity of clipping threshold on feature selection sparsity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
Unknown: The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions, but implicit questions include: How does LCEN scale with very high-dimensional data? What is the optimal basis expansion strategy for different problem domains? How robust is the algorithm to noisy data and outliers?

## Limitations
- Neural network comparison lacks architectural details, making direct performance assessment difficult
- Claims are primarily based on author's own implementation without independent replication
- Limited comparison to recent deep learning approaches for tabular data
- Unknown: Potential overfitting risks with aggressive basis expansion
- Assumption: Performance may degrade on datasets where linear relationships dominate

## Confidence
- High confidence in LCEN's algorithmic correctness and basic functionality
- Medium confidence in the claimed performance improvements over elastic net and sparse methods
- Low confidence in the comparison claims against neural networks due to lack of architectural details

## Next Checks
1. Implement and test LCEN on standard benchmark datasets (e.g., UCI repository) with established baselines including modern neural network approaches for tabular data
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each LCEN component (basis expansion, clipping, elastic net refinement) to overall performance
3. Test LCEN's robustness to hyperparameter sensitivity, particularly the basis expansion parameters and clipping threshold, across diverse dataset types and sizes
