# BhashaVerse : Translation Ecosystem for Indian Subcontinent Languages

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.04351
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04351
- Reference count: 6
- Primary result: 2-billion-parameter multilingual model achieving BLEU score of 25.45 for translation across 36 Indian languages

## Executive Summary
This work presents BhashaVerse, a comprehensive translation ecosystem for 36 Indian languages, addressing the challenge of linguistic diversity through a multi-task learning approach. The system employs a 2-billion-parameter multilingual sequence-to-sequence model trained on 10 billion parallel corpora and synthetic data techniques to handle translation, grammar correction, post-editing, quality estimation, and error identification across 36×36 language pairs. The model demonstrates effectiveness in handling low-resource languages and domain-specific requirements, achieving strong performance across multiple tasks.

## Method Summary
BhashaVerse utilizes a 2-billion-parameter multilingual sequence-to-sequence model based on transformer architecture with 18 encoder and 18 decoder layers. The system employs multi-task learning to handle translation, grammar correction, post-editing, quality estimation, and error identification tasks across 36 Indian languages. A custom SentencePiece tokenizer with 48,000 tokens is trained on mixed parallel corpora to capture morphological and orthographic variations. The model leverages 10 billion parallel corpora and synthetic data generation techniques including pivoted translation, back-translation, and forward translation to address data scarcity for low-resource language pairs. Training is conducted in two stages on 32 A100 GPUs using fairseq framework.

## Key Results
- Achieved BLEU score of 25.45 for translation across 36 Indian languages
- Grammar correction task achieved 90.55 accuracy
- Post-editing task achieved 84.26 accuracy with CHRF3 score of 95.47
- Quality estimation task achieved Spearman correlation of 0.47482

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Multi-task learning leverages shared representations across translation, grammar correction, post-editing, and quality estimation tasks to improve overall model performance. The model is trained on diverse task corpora with a unified JSON structure that specifies the task, domain, input, and output, allowing it to learn task-specific and domain-specific patterns while sharing underlying linguistic representations. The core assumption is that the tasks are sufficiently related that learning one task improves performance on others.

### Mechanism 2
Synthetic data generation techniques (pivoted translation, back-translation, forward translation) effectively address the scarcity of parallel corpora for low-resource Indian language pairs. Existing corpora for well-represented languages are used as pivots to generate synthetic parallel data for underrepresented language pairs. Quality is ensured through filtering using COMET-QE scores. The core assumption is that pivot-based translation can generate high-quality parallel corpora when direct corpora are scarce.

### Mechanism 3
Custom tokenizer with 48,000 tokens trained on mixed parallel corpora captures morphological and orthographic variations across Indian languages while maintaining computational efficiency. SentencePiece-based subword model trained on 10 million randomly mixed parallel sentences from each language, covering 99.99% of characters across languages. The core assumption is that a shared vocabulary can effectively represent the diverse morphological and orthographic features of Indian languages.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Multi-task learning
  - Why needed here: The model needs to handle multiple related tasks (translation, grammar correction, post-editing, quality estimation, error identification) efficiently.
  - Quick check question: What is the primary advantage of multi-task learning over training separate models for each task?

- **Concept**: Synthetic data generation
  - Why needed here: Many Indian language pairs lack sufficient parallel corpora, making synthetic data essential for training robust models.
  - Quick check question: What are the three main synthetic data techniques used in this work?

- **Concept**: Script normalization and language identification
  - Why needed here: Indian languages use multiple scripts and some languages share scripts, requiring proper handling for accurate processing.
  - Quick check question: Why is script normalization particularly important for languages like Kashmiri and Sindhi?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input layer (JSON-structured data) -> Encoder (18-layer transformer) -> Decoder (18-layer transformer) -> Output layer (JSON-structured output) -> Tokenizer (SentencePiece with 48,000 tokens)

- **Critical path**: Data preparation → Tokenizer training → Multi-task model training → Task-specific fine-tuning → Evaluation

- **Design tradeoffs**: Medium-range parameters (2 billion) for efficiency vs. potential performance gains from larger models; shared vocabulary for computational efficiency vs. potential loss of language-specific nuances; multi-task learning for efficiency vs. potential interference between tasks

- **Failure signatures**: Poor translation quality (check tokenizer vocabulary coverage and parallel corpus quality); Grammar correction errors (verify training data quality and task-specific fine-tuning); Post-editing failures (examine machine translation output quality and post-editing training data); Quality estimation misalignment (review evaluation metrics and training data diversity)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Test tokenizer coverage on a diverse sample of Indian language text to ensure it captures all scripts and morphological variations; 2) Validate synthetic data quality by comparing pivot-based translations against any available direct parallel corpora; 3) Evaluate multi-task learning benefits by comparing model performance with and without multi-task training on a subset of tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific perturbation techniques are used to generate synthetic grammar correction corpora, and how do these techniques ensure realistic error patterns across diverse Indian languages?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 7 describes perturbation techniques like Add/Delete/Replace Random Token, Change Pronoun, Change Prepositions or Postpositions, Change connectives, Change Verb Forms, Change Lexical Cohesion, Change Punctuation, Grammar, Masking, and Spelling.
- Why unresolved: The paper outlines the types of perturbations but does not detail the implementation or evaluation of these techniques for generating realistic errors.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed description of the perturbation algorithms and an evaluation of the synthetic corpora's effectiveness in improving grammar correction performance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the model handle the unique challenges of code-mixing in Indian languages, and what specific strategies are employed to improve translation quality for code-mixed inputs?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions code-mixing as a common phenomenon in India but does not provide specific strategies for handling it.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the challenge but lacks detailed methods for addressing code-mixing in translation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation details of code-mixing handling strategies and evaluation results demonstrating improved translation quality for code-mixed inputs.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the limitations of the current evaluation framework for machine translation, and how could it be expanded to better assess discourse-level translation quality?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5 discusses the evaluation framework, including reference-based and reference-free methods, but does not address discourse-level evaluation limitations.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on sentence-level evaluation and does not explore the complexities of discourse-level translation assessment.
- What evidence would resolve it: A discussion of discourse-level evaluation challenges and proposed methods for expanding the evaluation framework to include discourse-level metrics.

## Limitations

- Synthetic data quality and filtering mechanisms remain underspecified, potentially affecting model performance
- The 2-billion-parameter model size represents a trade-off that may limit performance compared to larger models
- Multi-task learning effectiveness across diverse Indian language pairs requires more rigorous empirical validation

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: BLEU and CHRF3 score achievements (25.45 and 53.81 respectively) - standard, reproducible metrics with clear evaluation protocols
- **Medium Confidence**: Multi-task learning effectiveness - theoretically sound but specific task relationships need more testing
- **Medium Confidence**: Synthetic data generation impact - methodology described but validation against direct parallel corpora is limited

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies comparing model performance with and without multi-task learning across different language pairs, particularly focusing on low-resource language combinations
2. Perform quality assessment of synthetic data by comparing pivoted translations against any available direct parallel corpora for the same language pairs
3. Evaluate tokenizer coverage and effectiveness by testing on a diverse corpus of unseen Indian language text, particularly for languages with complex morphological structures like Kashmiri and Sindhi
