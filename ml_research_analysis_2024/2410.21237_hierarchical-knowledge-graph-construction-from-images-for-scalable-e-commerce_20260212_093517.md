# Hierarchical Knowledge Graph Construction from Images for Scalable E-Commerce

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.21237
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21237
- Reference count: 40
- Proposed method uses VLMs and LLMs to construct hierarchical KGs from product images, achieving accuracy of 82.86% for primary package color, 77.14% for package shape, 86.67% for package material, 97.14% for category, and 73.91% accuracy@0.05 for weight prediction

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of constructing knowledge graphs (KGs) from product images in e-commerce settings. The proposed method uses vision-language models (VLMs) to extract detailed product information from images, then employs large language models (LLMs) to format this information according to a predefined schema and infer missing properties. The approach includes hierarchical expansion to add intermediate nodes between product categories and products, improving graph depth. A human-annotated e-commerce product image dataset with 105 images was created for benchmarking. The method significantly outperforms a baseline modified from previous work across multiple metrics: accuracy of 82.86% for primary package color, 77.14% for package shape, 86.67% for package material, 97.14% for category, and

## Method Summary
The method uses a two-stage pipeline: first, VLMs extract detailed product information from images including attributes like color, shape, material, and weight; second, LLMs format this information according to a predefined schema and infer missing properties. The approach includes hierarchical expansion to add intermediate nodes between product categories and products, improving graph depth. A human-annotated e-commerce product image dataset with 105 images was created for benchmarking.

## Key Results
The proposed method achieves accuracy of 82.86% for primary package color, 77.14% for package shape, 86.67% for package material, 97.14% for category, and 73.91% accuracy@0.05 for weight prediction. The method significantly outperforms a baseline modified from previous work across these metrics.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging VLMs to extract detailed product information from images, capturing visual features that are difficult to obtain through text alone. LLMs then structure this information according to a predefined schema, ensuring consistency and completeness. The hierarchical expansion approach adds intermediate nodes between product categories and products, creating a more comprehensive and navigable knowledge graph structure.

## Foundational Learning
The method builds on existing approaches for knowledge graph construction from text and images, incorporating recent advances in vision-language models and large language models. The hierarchical expansion technique draws inspiration from tree-based knowledge organization methods used in e-commerce.

## Architecture Onboarding
The architecture consists of a VLM for image analysis, an LLM for information structuring, and a hierarchical expansion module. The VLM extracts visual attributes and relationships from product images. The LLM formats this information according to a predefined schema and infers missing properties. The hierarchical expansion module adds intermediate nodes to create a multi-level knowledge graph structure.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper calls out several open questions: how to handle products with ambiguous or missing visual features, how to scale the method to handle large e-commerce catalogs, and how to incorporate user feedback to improve the knowledge graph over time.

## Limitations
The method relies on human-annotated datasets for evaluation, which may not fully represent the diversity of real-world e-commerce products. The performance metrics show some variability across different product attributes, with lower accuracy for weight prediction (73.91%) compared to category identification (97.14%). The method may struggle with products that have complex or unusual visual features that are difficult for VLMs to interpret.

## Confidence
The results demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods, but the evaluation is based on a relatively small dataset of 105 images. The confidence in the method's generalizability to larger e-commerce catalogs is moderate, and further validation with larger, more diverse datasets would strengthen the conclusions.

## Next Checks
Future work should validate the method on larger, more diverse e-commerce datasets to assess scalability and robustness. Investigating methods to incorporate user feedback and continuous learning would improve the knowledge graph's accuracy over time. Exploring alternative hierarchical expansion strategies and their impact on graph structure and performance would provide insights into optimizing the approach.
