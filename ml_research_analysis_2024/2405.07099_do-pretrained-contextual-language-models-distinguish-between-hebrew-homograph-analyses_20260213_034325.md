## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.07099
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07099

- Primary result: Contemporary Hebrew contextualized embeddings significantly outperform non-contextualized embeddings for homograph disambiguation, especially for morphosyntactic and segmentation ambiguities

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether pretrained contextual language models can effectively distinguish between multiple possible analyses of Hebrew homographs, which are words with identical surface forms but different meanings and pronunciations due to the language's complex morphology and vowel omission. The authors create a novel dataset of 75 Hebrew homographs with over 150,000 sentences and evaluate existing PLMs (mBERT, HeBERT, AlephBERT) on this task. They find that contextualized PLMs significantly outperform non-contextualized models, with HeBERT and AlephBERT achieving state-of-the-art results. The models are most effective for disambiguating segmentation and morphosyntactic features, but less so for pure word-sense disambiguation.

## Method Summary
The authors employ a "word expert" approach, training dedicated MLP classifiers for each of the 75 Hebrew homographs using contextualized embeddings from pretrained language models. They gather a large corpus of over 150,000 sentences containing the homographs from diverse sources (newspapers, Wikipedia, literature, social media) and annotate them with correct analyses using the Hebrew Treebank. The models are evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation, with performance measured by F1 score for each homograph analysis. They compare contextualized embeddings (mBERT, HeBERT, AlephBERT) against non-contextualized baselines and test various scenarios including masked vs. unmasked input and few-shot learning capabilities.

## Key Results
- Contemporary Hebrew contextualized embeddings significantly outperform non-contextualized embeddings for homograph disambiguation
- AlephBERT achieves state-of-the-art results, effectively disambiguating between all possible analyses in 2-way and 3-way cases, and performing well even with 4-5 possible analyses
- Contextualized models are most effective for disambiguating segmentation and morphosyntactic features, less so for pure word-sense disambiguation
- Word-piece tokenization negatively impacts performance when homographs are split into multiple pieces
- AlephBERT demonstrates strong few-shot learning capability, maintaining high accuracy with only 5-10 training examples per analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Contextualized PLMs can effectively distinguish between analyses of Hebrew homographs by leveraging surrounding context, especially for morphosyntactic and segmentation ambiguities.
- Mechanism: The model uses the full sentence context to generate embeddings that cluster according to the homograph's morphosyntactic and segmentation properties, enabling the MLP to classify the correct analysis.
- Core assumption: The context provides sufficient discriminative information about the homograph's role in the sentence, particularly for morphosyntactic features and segmentation cues.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "contemporary Hebrew contextualized embeddings outperform non-contextualized embeddings; and that they are most effective for disambiguating segmentation and morphosyntactic features"
  - [section 4] "AlephBERT performs equally well on cases of segmentation ambiguity and morphosyntactic ambiguity"
  - [corpus] The corpus shows that morphosyntactic and segmentation cues are often explicitly signaled by surrounding words and syntactic structure in Hebrew sentences.
- Break condition: If the context does not provide clear morphosyntactic or segmentation cues (e.g., in highly ambiguous or context-poor sentences), the model's performance on disambiguation degrades.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: PLMs struggle more with pure word-sense disambiguation compared to morphosyntactic disambiguation because sense distinctions often lack explicit morphological markers.
- Mechanism: When different senses of a homograph share the same morphological form, the model must rely on semantic context alone, which is harder to capture than morphological differences.
- Core assumption: Semantic distinctions without morphological variation are less salient in the embedding space and harder for the model to separate.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "they are most effective for disambiguating segmentation and morphosyntactic features, less so regarding pure word-sense disambiguation"
  - [section 4] "when it comes to ambiguities that are purely semantic, the scores are noticeably lower"
  - [corpus] The corpus contains many homographs where different senses share identical morphological forms, requiring pure semantic disambiguation.
- Break condition: If the semantic distinction is strongly signaled by context (e.g., through highly specific collocations or topic indicators), the model can still perform well on sense disambiguation.

- Claim: Word-piece tokenization negatively impacts disambiguation performance when homographs are split into multiple pieces, as it disrupts the model's ability to capture the internal morphological structure.
- Mechanism: Splitting a homograph into multiple word-pieces fragments the information about its internal structure, making it harder for the model to associate the pieces with a coherent analysis.
- Core assumption: The integrity of the homograph as a single token is important for capturing its full morphological and semantic properties.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4] "The splitting of a homograph into three word-pieces appears to have a negative impact on the ability of the resulting embedding to differentiate between homograph analyses"
  - [section 2] "Previous research on MRLs claimed that standardly trained pre-trained language models (PLMs) based on word-pieces may not sufficiently capture the internal structure of such tokens"
  - [corpus] The corpus shows that mBERT, with its smaller vocabulary, often splits homographs into multiple pieces, while HeBERT and AlephBERT treat them as single tokens.
- Break condition: If the word-piece splits are minimal (e.g., only two pieces) or if the model uses aggregation methods (e.g., summing or averaging embeddings) that effectively reconstruct the full token representation, the negative impact is reduced.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Morphology and segmentation in morphologically rich languages
  - Why needed here: Understanding how Hebrew words can be segmented into multiple units (e.g., prepositions, conjunctions, pronouns attached to nouns) is crucial for interpreting the disambiguation results.
  - Quick check question: How does the segmentation of a Hebrew word like "האיש" (the man) into "ה" (the) and "איש" (man) affect its analysis and translation?

- Concept: Word-sense disambiguation vs. morphosyntactic disambiguation
  - Why needed here: Recognizing the difference between disambiguating different senses of a word (e.g., "bank" as a financial institution vs. a river bank) and disambiguating different morphological analyses (e.g., different segmentation or grammatical properties) is essential for understanding the paper's findings.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between disambiguating the sense of the English word "bank" and disambiguating the morphological analysis of a Hebrew homograph?

- Concept: Contextualized vs. non-contextualized embeddings
  - Why needed here: Understanding how contextual embeddings (e.g., BERT) use surrounding context to generate word representations, compared to non-contextualized embeddings (e.g., word2vec) which generate static representations, is fundamental to grasping the paper's methodology and results.
  - Quick check question: How does the embedding of the word "bank" differ when generated by a contextual model like BERT in the sentences "I deposited money at the bank" vs. "The river bank was eroded"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Raw text corpus (150K sentences) -> Pretrained language models (mBERT, HeBERT, AlephBERT) -> MLP classifiers (word expert approach) -> Evaluation metrics (F1 score, macro-average)
- Critical path:
  1. Gather and annotate a large dataset of Hebrew homographs.
  2. Preprocess the text and prepare it for the language models.
  3. Run the sentences through the pretrained language models to obtain embeddings for the target homographs.
  4. Train an MLP classifier for each homograph using the embeddings and the annotated labels.
  5. Evaluate the classifiers using cross-validation and calculate the F1 score.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using contextualized vs. non-contextualized embeddings: Contextualized embeddings capture more nuanced information but require more computational resources.
  - Using word expert approach vs. joint training: Word expert approach allows for more specialized classifiers but requires training a separate model for each homograph.
  - Masked vs. unmasked scenario: Masking the target homograph can prevent bias from skewed distributions but may also remove useful information.
- Failure signatures:
  - Low F1 scores on pure sense disambiguation tasks.
  - Decreased performance when homographs are split into multiple word-pieces.
  - Difficulty handling homographs with a large number of possible analyses (4-way or 5-way ambiguity).
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare the performance of mBERT, HeBERT, and AlephBERT on a simple binary homograph disambiguation task.
  2. Evaluate the impact of word-piece tokenization by comparing the performance of mBERT on homographs treated as single tokens vs. multiple pieces.
  3. Test the few-shot learning capability of AlephBERT by training the MLP classifier with only 5 examples of each homograph analysis.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of Hebrew homograph disambiguation models change when considering homographs with more than 5 possible analyses?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper tested models on homographs with 2-5 possible analyses and found accuracy declined with 4-5-way classification, suggesting a limit.
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluated homographs with up to 5 analyses, leaving the performance on more complex cases unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the models on a dataset containing homographs with 6 or more possible analyses and comparing the results to the current findings.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the proposed methods for Hebrew homograph disambiguation be effectively applied to other Semitic languages like Arabic or Aramaic?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests that Hebrew is a case study for Semitic languages but does not test the methods on other Semitic languages.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses solely on Hebrew and does not provide evidence of the methods' applicability to other Semitic languages.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing and evaluating the methods on datasets of Arabic or Aramaic homographs and comparing the results to the Hebrew findings.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do the proposed models handle homographs that are not in their training vocabulary?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions using a trainable UNK parameter for out-of-vocabulary words, but does not discuss the models' performance on unseen homographs.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide information on how well the models generalize to homographs not encountered during training.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the models on a dataset containing homographs that were not part of the training vocabulary and evaluating their performance on these unseen cases.

## Limitations

- Data Quality and Representativeness: The selection process for the 75 Hebrew homographs is not fully transparent, raising concerns about whether they are representative of the full spectrum of Hebrew homography.
- Morphological Analysis Granularity: The study uses pre-existing morphological analyses from the Hebrew Treebank, but the granularity and consistency of these annotations across different sources is not addressed.
- Cross-Lingual Generalization: The paper does not test whether the observed patterns would hold for other morphologically rich languages, limiting the broader applicability of the findings.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**:
- Contextualized PLMs significantly outperform non-contextualized models on Hebrew homograph disambiguation
- HeBERT and AlephBERT show superior performance compared to mBERT
- Performance is highest for morphosyntactic and segmentation ambiguities, lower for pure sense disambiguation
- Word-piece tokenization negatively impacts performance when homographs are split into multiple pieces

**Medium Confidence**:
- The "word expert" approach with dedicated classifiers per homograph is the optimal methodology
- Limited training data (5-10 examples) is sufficient for good performance
- AlephBERT's few-shot learning capability represents a significant practical advantage

**Low Confidence**:
- The exact mechanisms by which contextual embeddings capture morphosyntactic information
- The relative importance of different contextual cues (syntactic vs. semantic) for disambiguation
- The generalizability of findings to other morphologically rich languages

## Next Checks

1. **Robustness to Annotation Variability**: Conduct an inter-annotator agreement study on a subset of the homographs to quantify the consistency of morphological analyses. Then, measure how model performance changes when trained on differently annotated versions of the same sentences.

2. **Cross-Lingual Transfer Experiment**: Apply the same experimental protocol to a parallel dataset of homographs in another morphologically rich language (e.g., Arabic or Turkish) to test whether the observed patterns of contextualized model superiority hold across languages with different morphological structures.

3. **Fine-grained Context Ablation Study**: Systematically remove different types of contextual information (e.g., neighboring words, syntactic dependencies, topical indicators) from the input sentences and measure the impact on disambiguation performance for each type of ambiguity (segmentation, morphosyntactic, sense).
