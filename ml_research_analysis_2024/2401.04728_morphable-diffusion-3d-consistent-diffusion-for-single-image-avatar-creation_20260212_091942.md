# Morphable Diffusion: 3D-Consistent Diffusion for Single-image Avatar Creation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.04728
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04728
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: First diffusion model enabling creation of fully 3D-consistent, animatable, photorealistic human avatars from a single image

## Executive Summary
Morphable Diffusion introduces a novel method for creating controllable, photorealistic human avatars from a single image by integrating 3D morphable models (3DMM) into a state-of-the-art multi-view-consistent diffusion approach. The core innovation lies in conditioning the generative pipeline on articulated 3D models, enabling accurate novel view synthesis and seamless control over facial expressions and body poses. This framework achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art avatar creation models, as demonstrated through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations. The code is publicly available, making this work accessible for further research and applications.

## Method Summary
The Morphable Diffusion method integrates 3D morphable models (SMPL for body, FLAME for face, or a bilinear model) into a multi-view-consistent diffusion framework. The key components include a 3DMM-aware feature volume that encodes both geometry and appearance, a SparseConvNet-based U-Net architecture for efficient 3D feature processing, and a shuffled training scheme that enhances expression control and data augmentation. The model is trained on datasets like FaceScape and THuman 2.0, and it enables novel view synthesis and facial expression control while maintaining 3D consistency. The approach builds on prior work like StyleNeRF and StableDreamFusion but introduces 3DMM conditioning for improved accuracy and control.

## Key Results
- First diffusion model to enable creation of fully 3D-consistent, animatable, photorealistic human avatars from a single image
- Superior performance on novel view synthesis and facial expression synthesis compared to state-of-the-art methods
- Extensive quantitative evaluation using metrics like SSIM, LPIPS, FID, PCK, and Re-ID accuracy, along with qualitative assessments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by integrating 3D morphable models into a diffusion framework, allowing the model to leverage explicit 3D geometry and articulated pose information. This conditioning ensures that the generated avatars maintain 3D consistency across different views and can be animated with precise control over facial expressions and body poses. The shuffled training scheme further improves efficiency and generalization by serving as a data augmentation technique, reducing overfitting on small datasets.

## Foundational Learning
- **3D Morphable Models (3DMM):** Statistical models that represent human geometry and appearance using a low-dimensional subspace. Why needed: Provides explicit 3D geometry for conditioning the diffusion model. Quick check: Verify that the 3DMM can accurately reconstruct the input image's geometry.
- **Multi-view-consistent Diffusion:** Diffusion models that ensure consistency across different views of the same subject. Why needed: Enables novel view synthesis while maintaining 3D consistency. Quick check: Evaluate multi-view consistency using metrics like PCK.
- **SparseConvNet:** A convolutional neural network architecture designed for efficient 3D feature processing. Why needed: Processes the 3DMM-aware feature volume efficiently. Quick check: Compare the performance of SparseConvNet with standard 3D CNNs.
- **Shuffled Training Scheme:** A training strategy that randomly samples novel facial expressions from the dataset during training. Why needed: Improves training efficiency and serves as data augmentation. Quick check: Analyze the impact of shuffled training on model performance.
- **Feature Volume Interpolation:** A technique for interpolating 3DMM features to handle unseen expressions or poses. Why needed: Enables smooth transitions between different expressions or poses. Quick check: Verify that interpolated features produce realistic results.
- **Finetuning Strategy:** A method for adapting the pre-trained diffusion model to specific tasks or datasets. Why needed: Improves the model's performance on novel view and expression synthesis tasks. Quick check: Compare the performance of the finetuned model with the pre-trained model.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
3DMM Encoder -> Feature Volume -> SparseConvNet U-Net -> Diffusion Decoder -> Generated Image

**Critical Path:**
The critical path involves encoding the input image and 3DMM into a feature volume, processing it through the SparseConvNet U-Net, and decoding it using the diffusion model to generate the final avatar image.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- **Resolution Limitation:** The model is limited to 256×256 resolution, which may affect the quality of full-body images. Alternative: Higher resolution models could provide more details but may require more computational resources.
- **3DMM Accuracy:** The accuracy of the 3DMM estimator impacts the quality of the generated avatars. Alternative: Using more accurate 3DMM estimators could improve results but may increase computational complexity.
- **Training Data:** The quality and diversity of the training data affect the model's generalization. Alternative: Using larger and more diverse datasets could improve performance but may require more computational resources.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor reconstruction quality due to insufficient training data or improper conditioning
- Identity loss or facial expression distortion in generated images
- Multi-view inconsistency in generated images

**3 First Experiments:**
1. **Reconstruction Quality:** Evaluate the model's ability to reconstruct the input image accurately.
2. **Novel View Synthesis:** Test the model's performance on generating novel views of the input subject.
3. **Expression Control:** Assess the model's ability to control facial expressions while maintaining identity.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the resolution limitation of the model impact the quality of generated full-body images?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "The resolution of our model is limited at 256×256 as we inherit this limitation from the components proposed in the previous works [47, 48]. Rendering full bodies under such a low resolution provides a limited amount of details."
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions the resolution limitation but does not provide specific data on how this limitation affects the quality of full-body image generation compared to higher resolution models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Quantitative comparisons of full-body image quality between the 256×256 model and higher resolution models, or qualitative examples showing the difference in detail and realism.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of mesh accuracy on the quality of generated face images?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Additionally, we find that having an accurate mesh estimator can lead to better preservation of the facial expression and better resemblance, as shown in Fig. F.3."
- Why unresolved: The paper provides an example of how mesh accuracy affects image quality but does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between mesh accuracy and image quality across different scenarios or subjects.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study varying mesh accuracy and measuring its impact on image quality metrics (e.g., LPIPS, SSIM, FID) across a diverse set of subjects and expressions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed shuffled training scheme compare to other data augmentation techniques in terms of improving model performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "At every training step, given an input image of a subject, we randomly sample a novel facial expression from the dataset that does not align with the expression of the input image. This cross-expression training, besides allowing explicit control of generated images, further improves the training efficiency as it serves as a data augmentation procedure and reduces potential overfitting on small datasets."
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions the benefits of the shuffled training scheme but does not compare it to other data augmentation techniques or provide a detailed analysis of its effectiveness.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of the shuffled training scheme against other data augmentation methods, measuring improvements in image quality, facial expression accuracy, and model generalization across different datasets.

## Limitations
