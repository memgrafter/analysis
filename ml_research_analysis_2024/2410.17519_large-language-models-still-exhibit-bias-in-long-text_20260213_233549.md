# Large Language Models Still Exhibit Bias in Long Text

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.17519
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17519
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: LTF-TEST framework reveals persistent demographic biases in LLMs during long-text generation tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Long Text Fairness Test (LTF-TEST), a novel framework for evaluating demographic biases in large language models (LLMs) during long-text generation tasks. LTF-TEST uses paired prompts to systematically assess bias across 14 topics and 10 demographic axes, resulting in 11,948 samples, and evaluates both model responses and the reasoning behind them. The authors evaluate five recent LLMs, including GPT-4o and LLaMa3, finding that models frequently exhibit favoritism toward certain demographic groups while showing excessive sensitivity toward traditionally disadvantaged groups. To mitigate these biases, the authors propose REGARD-FT, a finetuning approach that pairs biased prompts with neutral responses. REGARD-FT reduces gender bias by 34.6% and improves performance by 1.4 percentage points on the BBQ benchmark, demonstrating a promising approach to addressing biases in long-text generation tasks.

## Method Summary
The LTF-TEST framework evaluates LLM bias through essay-style prompts comparing demographic groups across 14 topics and 10 axes, generating 11,948 paired samples. Responses are evaluated on Title & Introduction, Reasons, and Conclusions using a -1 to 2 scoring scale. The framework calculates Degree of Bias (DoB) as variance of Groupwise Favoritism scores, Pairwise Favoritism as average score differences, and Absolute Discrimination as proportion of extreme responses. REGARD-FT finetunes models by pairing biased prompts with neutral responses, reducing gender bias by 34.6% while improving BBQ benchmark accuracy by 1.4 percentage points.

## Key Results
- GPT-4o and LLaMa3 models show systematic favoritism toward certain demographic groups while displaying excessive sensitivity toward disadvantaged groups
- REGARD-FT reduces gender bias by 34.6% while improving BBQ benchmark accuracy by 1.4 percentage points
- Finetuned LLaMA achieves 90.6% agreement with human annotations for bias evaluation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The LTF-TEST framework effectively uncovers subtle demographic biases in LLMs that are not detectable by existing benchmarks focused on simple tasks.
- Mechanism: By using paired prompts that ask models to explain why one demographic group is better than another, and then evaluating both the response and the reasoning behind it, the framework captures nuanced bias patterns in long-text generation.
- Core assumption: Long-text generation tasks expose biases that short-answer or multiple-choice benchmarks miss.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "LTF-TEST covers 14 topics and 10 demographic axes, including gender and race, resulting in 11,948 samples. By assessing both model responses and the reasoning behind them, LTF-TEST uncovers subtle biases that are difficult to detect in simple responses."
  - [section] "Unlike previous research, this approach assesses not only the model's claim, but also the reasoning behind the claim across different demographics."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct mention of LTF-TEST or similar paired-prompt frameworks in neighbor papers.
- Break condition: If models are able to detect and correct for the paired-prompt structure during evaluation, or if the evaluator fails to distinguish subtle bias in reasoning.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: REGARD-FT reduces bias by finetuning models with paired disrespectful questions and respectful answers, preventing negative bias against specific groups.
- Mechanism: By exposing the model to biased prompts paired with neutral responses during finetuning, the model learns to generate fairer outputs when encountering similar biased prompts in deployment.
- Core assumption: Models can learn to override learned biases through exposure to corrective examples during finetuning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "REGARD-FT reduces gender bias by 34.6% and improves performance by 1.4 percentage points on the BBQ benchmark, offering a promising approach to addressing biases in long-text generation tasks."
  - [section] "This method improves performance on our LTF-TEST by 34.6% in gender bias and shows a 1.4 percent points improvement on the established benchmark BBQ (Parrish et al., 2021)."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in neighbor papers - this appears to be a novel approach.
- Break condition: If the finetuning dataset is too small or not representative, or if the model learns to generate neutral responses without truly addressing underlying biases.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using LLMs as evaluators for long-text bias detection is more effective than traditional methods because they can understand context and reasoning.
- Mechanism: By finetuning an open-source LLM (LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct) using GPT-4o evaluations as reference, the framework creates a transparent and reproducible evaluation system.
- Core assumption: LLMs can serve as reliable evaluators for bias detection in long-text generation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "To overcome these challenges, we finetune LLaMA (3-8B-Instruct), which serves as a more open and accessible evaluation model. Using GPT-4o evaluations as a reference, we finetune LLaMA (3-8B-Instruct). As a result, LLaMA achieves 90.6% agreement with the human annotations."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct mention of using LLMs as bias evaluators in neighbor papers.
- Break condition: If the evaluator LLM itself contains biases that affect its evaluation, or if the finetuning process fails to capture the nuances of human evaluation.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Bias measurement in LLMs
  - Why needed here: Understanding how bias is quantified and evaluated is crucial for interpreting LTF-TEST results and developing mitigation strategies.
  - Quick check question: What are the three scoring levels used in LTF-TEST to evaluate bias, and what does each represent?

- Concept: Paired comparison methodology
  - Why needed here: The paired prompts approach is central to LTF-TEST's ability to detect bias, so understanding this methodology is essential.
  - Quick check question: How does the Pairwise Favoritism metric work, and why is it more informative than simple bias scores?

- Concept: Finetuning for bias mitigation
  - Why needed here: REGARD-FT relies on finetuning principles, so understanding how this process works is necessary for implementing and improving the approach.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between REGARD-FT's finetuning approach and traditional prompt engineering for bias mitigation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Prompt Generator -> Testing LLM -> Bias Evaluator -> Metrics Calculator -> REGARD-FT Trainer
- Critical path: Prompt Generation → LLM Response Generation → Bias Evaluation → Metrics Calculation → Bias Mitigation (if needed)
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using proprietary models (GPT-4o) vs. open-source alternatives for evaluation
  - Comprehensive coverage (56 templates, 11,948 samples) vs. computational efficiency
  - Detailed bias scoring (4-point scale) vs. simplicity and interpretability
- Failure signatures:
  - High Absolute Discrimination values indicate models frequently produce extreme biased outputs
  - Low evaluator agreement with human annotations suggests evaluator bias or poor finetuning
  - Inconsistent results across different demographic axes indicate systematic bias patterns
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run LTF-TEST on a baseline model to establish bias metrics before any mitigation
  2. Apply abstract fairness prompts to measure their effectiveness in reducing bias
  3. Implement REGARD-FT finetuning and evaluate the reduction in gender bias compared to baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the LTF-TEST framework's bias detection performance compare when using human evaluators versus the finetuned LLaMA evaluator across different demographic axes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper describes using GPT-4o for initial evaluation, then finetuning LLaMA to achieve 90.6% agreement with human annotations, while human-to-human correspondence was 91.7%.
- Why unresolved: The paper only reports overall agreement percentages but doesn't provide detailed comparative performance metrics (precision, recall, F1 scores) for different demographic categories or bias types.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive evaluation matrix showing evaluator performance (accuracy, false positive/negative rates) for each demographic axis and bias severity level, plus qualitative analysis of cases where evaluators disagree.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does REGARD-FT's effectiveness in reducing bias generalize beyond the specific prompts used in training (gender-related questions) to other demographic axes like race, religion, and sexual orientation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper reports REGARD-FT reduces gender bias by 34.6% and improves BBQ accuracy by 1.4 percentage points, but doesn't test effectiveness across other demographic categories.
- Why unresolved: The training data was limited to 2,000 examples focusing on gender (1,000 each for women and men), leaving uncertainty about cross-demographic generalization.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments testing REGARD-FT on prompts across all 10 demographic axes with before/after bias measurements, plus ablation studies varying training data diversity.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the long-term impact of prompt engineering (abstract vs detailed fairness prompts) on model behavior across repeated interactions, and does it create any unintended biases over time?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper observes that prompt engineering sometimes increases bias in specific categories (e.g., LLaMA in religion and politics) and shows inconsistent results across models.
- Why unresolved: The paper only reports immediate effects of single prompt applications without longitudinal analysis of how repeated prompt exposure affects model behavior or whether it creates new biases.
- What evidence would resolve it: Multi-turn conversation experiments tracking bias evolution across extended interactions, plus analysis of any emergent patterns in how models compensate for fairness instructions.

## Limitations

- The framework relies heavily on GPT-4o for bias evaluation, introducing potential circularity when testing models from the same family
- REGARD-FT's effectiveness in reducing bias may not generalize across all demographic axes, particularly for complex intersectional identities
- The 11,948-sample evaluation may not capture the full diversity of real-world biased prompts that users might generate

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The framework's systematic approach to bias detection through paired prompts and the observed reduction in gender bias through REGARD-FT finetuning
- **Medium Confidence**: The generalizability of LTF-TEST across different LLM architectures and the effectiveness of finetuning in addressing intersectional biases
- **Low Confidence**: The long-term stability of bias reduction achieved through finetuning and the framework's ability to detect subtle biases in specialized domains

## Next Checks

1. **Evaluator Independence Test**: Re-run LTF-TEST evaluations using multiple independent bias evaluators (including human annotators) to verify the consistency and reliability of GPT-4o-based evaluations

2. **Cross-Demographic Validation**: Test REGARD-FT's effectiveness across additional demographic axes beyond gender, particularly for intersectional identities, to assess the generalizability of the finetuning approach

3. **Temporal Stability Assessment**: Evaluate the stability of bias reduction over multiple finetuning iterations and across different model versions to ensure the longevity of the mitigation effects
