core_contribution: This paper tackles the problem of federated graph learning where
  missing inter-client topology information leads to insufficient feature aggregation
  in multi-hop neighbor clients, causing degraded performance in semi-supervised classification

## Executive Summary
SpreadFGL addresses the challenge of federated graph learning where missing inter-client topology information leads to insufficient feature aggregation and degraded performance in semi-supervised classification. The framework introduces an adaptive graph imputation generator that explores potential links between subgraphs without sharing raw data, combined with a versatile assessor and negative sampling mechanism to extract more refined information. By extending to a distributed multi-edge collaborative scenario, SpreadFGL balances training costs and achieves faster convergence while maintaining high accuracy.

## Method Summary
SpreadFGL is a federated graph learning framework that enables collaborative training across clients without sharing raw data. The method uses an adaptive graph imputation generator at edge servers to recover potential cross-subgraph links by fusing processed client embeddings into globally-shared information. A versatile assessor evaluates reconstruction quality while negative sampling focuses the model on relevant features. The framework extends to distributed multi-edge collaborative training for load balancing, with clients training local GraphSAGE models, uploading embeddings to edge servers, and downloading updated subgraphs with potential links.

## Key Results
- Achieves 84.49% accuracy on Cora dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
- Improves F1-score by 14.71% compared to FedSage+ baseline
- Demonstrates faster convergence in distributed multi-edge collaborative training scenario
- Shows robust performance across Cora, Citeseer, WikiCS, and CoauthorCS datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The adaptive graph imputation generator recovers cross-subgraph links using globally-shared information from the edge server.
- Mechanism: Clients upload processed embeddings to the edge server, which fuses them into globally-shared information Hj. The generator computes a topology graph A = Hj Hj^T and selects k most similar nodes as potential cross-subgraph links.
- Core assumption: Nodes close in embedding space are likely to have missing inter-client links.
- Break condition: If Hj lacks sufficient global information due to few contributing clients or poor embedding quality, similarity measures may not reflect true missing links.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The versatile assessor and negative sampling mechanism refine features extracted by the autoencoder.
- Mechanism: The autoencoder reconstructs Hj from noisy inputs while the assessor evaluates reconstruction quality. Negative sampling masks low-scoring attributes, forcing focus on features meaningful for classification.
- Core assumption: The assessor can distinguish between original and reconstructed global data, guiding the autoencoder to produce discriminative features.
- Break condition: If the assessor fails to differentiate original from reconstructed data due to insufficient training, negative sampling may not effectively prune irrelevant features.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Distributed multi-edge collaborative training balances load and accelerates convergence.
- Mechanism: Multiple edge servers collaborate by exchanging model parameters with neighbors. Each server aggregates neighbor parameters and broadcasts to clients, enabling faster global information flow.
- Core assumption: Edge servers can efficiently communicate with neighbors and parameter exchange improves global model quality without excessive overhead.
- Break condition: If communication overhead between edge servers is too high in large-scale deployments, benefits of distributed training may be offset by latency.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
  - Why needed here: GNNs serve as local node classifiers in clients for semi-supervised classification tasks. Understanding their propagation mechanism is essential for grasping feature aggregation.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between the AGG function in GCN and GAT?

- Concept: Federated Learning
  - Why needed here: The framework relies on federated learning principles to enable collaborative training without sharing raw data. Knowledge of FedAvg and its limitations is important.
  - Quick check question: How does FedAvg aggregate model parameters from multiple clients?

- Concept: Autoencoders
  - Why needed here: The graph imputation generator uses an autoencoder to explore underlying representations from globally-shared information. Understanding their reconstruction loss and training process is crucial.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the encoder and decoder in an autoencoder?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Clients -> Edge servers (Graph imputation generator, Versatile assessor, Autoencoder) -> Clients
- Critical path: Clients train locally → upload embeddings → edge server fuses embeddings → generates potential links → clients download subgraphs → repeat
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. communication overhead: More frequent uploads improve link recovery but increase bandwidth usage
  - Model complexity vs. convergence speed: Deeper GNNs or autoencoders may improve performance but slow training
- Failure signatures:
  - Slow convergence: May indicate insufficient edge-edge communication or poor graph imputation quality
  - Low accuracy: Could result from inadequate negative sampling or poor global information fusion
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify graph imputation generator correctly identifies potential links by comparing with ground truth on synthetic dataset
  2. Test versatile assessor's ability to distinguish original vs. reconstructed data by measuring output scores
  3. Measure convergence speed and accuracy with 2 edge servers vs. 1 to validate distributed training benefits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does the proposed SpreadFGL framework perform under varying network conditions and communication delays between edge servers and clients?
- What is the impact of the negative sampling threshold θ on the performance of the SpreadFGL framework?
- How does the proposed SpreadFGL framework handle dynamic graph structures where nodes and edges can be added or removed over time?

## Limitations
- Scalability concerns exist regarding communication overhead in large-scale deployments with many edge servers
- Generalizability is limited as evaluation focuses primarily on academic citation networks rather than diverse graph types
- Distributed training benefits demonstrated only on small-scale testbed experiments, real-world performance in large deployments is uncertain

## Confidence
- High confidence: Core mechanism of adaptive graph imputation using embedding similarity is well-supported mathematically and aligns with established GNN principles
- Medium confidence: Effectiveness of versatile assessor and negative sampling relies on assumption that assessor can reliably distinguish original from reconstructed data
- Low confidence: Distributed training benefits demonstrated only on small-scale testbed experiments; real-world performance in large-scale deployments is uncertain

## Next Checks
1. Measure total data transferred per training round in distributed vs. single-edge mode across different network sizes to quantify scalability tradeoff
2. Test SpreadFGL on non-academic graph datasets (social networks, biological networks) to verify performance generalization beyond citation graphs
3. Conduct experiments disabling the negative sampling mechanism to isolate its contribution to accuracy improvements and validate its necessity
