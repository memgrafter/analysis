# Inductive Gradient Adjustment For Spectral Bias In Implicit Neural Representations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.13271
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13271
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: IGA method improves spectral bias in INRs, achieving up to 1.2dB PSNR gains over vanilla training

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the fundamental spectral bias problem in implicit neural representations (INRs), where multi-layer perceptrons struggle to capture high-frequency details in signals. The authors propose an Inductive Gradient Adjustment (IGA) method that leverages the empirical Neural Tangent Kernel (eNTK) matrix to adjust training dynamics and mitigate this bias. By constructing a transformation matrix based on the eNTK spectrum, IGA enables tailored improvements in spectral bias without requiring explicit eNTK computation for large datasets. The method is validated across 2D image approximation, 3D shape representation, and 5D neural radiance fields, demonstrating consistent improvements over existing training techniques.

## Method Summary
The IGA method works by first computing the empirical Neural Tangent Kernel (eNTK) matrix on a sampled subset of data points, then using its eigenvalue decomposition to construct a transformation matrix that adjusts the training gradients. The key insight is that the eNTK spectrum determines the convergence rates of different frequency components in the target signal. By balancing specific ranges of eigenvalues, the method can accelerate learning of high-frequency components while maintaining low-frequency accuracy. To handle large datasets, the authors partition data into groups and sample representative points from each group, using inductive generalization to estimate training dynamics without computing the full eNTK matrix. This approach is theoretically justified by showing that eNTK-based adjustments converge to NTK-based adjustments as network width increases.

## Key Results
- IGA achieves up to 1.2dB PSNR improvement over vanilla training on standard INR benchmarks
- The method consistently outperforms existing training techniques including Fourier reparameterization and batch normalization
- IGA demonstrates better high-frequency detail preservation across 2D, 3D, and 5D representation tasks
- The approach maintains computational efficiency through sampling-based eNTK approximation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Adjusting the eNTK matrix spectrum via gradient transformation directly controls the convergence rate of frequency components in the target signal
- Mechanism: The empirical Neural Tangent Kernel (eNTK) matrix eigenvalues determine how quickly the MLP learns different frequency components. By constructing a transformation matrix that re-scales these eigenvalues, high-frequency components can be accelerated in learning
- Core assumption: The empirical NTK matrix provides a reliable proxy for the theoretical NTK matrix, and their eigenvalue spectra are sufficiently similar to enable practical gradient adjustments
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we propose an Inductive Gradient Adjustment (IGA) method that adjusts training dynamics via the empirical Neural Tangent Kernel (eNTK) matrix"
  - [section 3.1] "training dynamics of rt could be estimated via inductive generalization of the linear dynamics model of sampled data points"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct mention of NTK or spectral bias in neighboring papers
- Break condition: If the empirical NTK matrix eigenvalues diverge significantly from the theoretical NTK matrix, the gradient adjustment will not effectively target the intended frequency components

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Inductive generalization from sampled data points allows gradient adjustment to work with millions of data points without explicit eNTK matrix computation
- Mechanism: The training dynamics can be estimated by computing the eNTK matrix on a small subset of data points (sampled groups), then generalizing these adjustments to the entire dataset through inductive bias
- Core assumption: Data points within groups are sufficiently similar that their training dynamics are representative of the entire group
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "training dynamics of rt could be estimated via inductive generalization of the linear dynamics model of sampled data points"
  - [section 3.3] "we partition each image into non-overlapping 32 × 32 patches as groups and points with the largest residuals are sampled"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct mention of inductive generalization or group sampling strategies
- Break condition: If data points within groups are too diverse, the estimated training dynamics will not generalize effectively to the full group

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Balancing eigenvalues in the eNTK spectrum allows tailored improvement of spectral bias based on target signal characteristics
- Mechanism: By constructing a transformation matrix that balances specific ranges of eigenvalues, the method can be adapted to different signal types and frequency content
- Core assumption: The desired spectrum can be effectively approximated by balancing eigenvalues within specific ranges
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Based on this insight, we propose a practical Inductive Gradient Adjustment (IGA) method, which could purposefully improve the spectral bias via inductive generalization of eNTK-based gradient transformation matrix"
  - [section 3.3] "To purposefully improve the spectral bias, we balance the eigenvalues of different eigenvectors; impacts are tailored by managing the number of balanced eigenvalues"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct mention of eigenvalue balancing or tailored spectral improvements
- Break condition: If the target signal has very complex frequency content that cannot be approximated by eigenvalue balancing, the method may not achieve optimal results

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) and its relationship to spectral bias
  - Why needed here: Understanding how NTK eigenvalues control convergence rates of different frequency components is fundamental to grasping why gradient adjustment works
  - Quick check question: How does the eigenvalue distribution of the NTK matrix relate to the spectral bias observed in MLPs?

- Concept: Empirical NTK (eNTK) matrix computation and properties
  - Why needed here: The eNTK matrix is the practical substitute for NTK, and understanding its computation and relationship to NTK is crucial for implementing IGA
  - Quick check question: What is the theoretical relationship between the empirical NTK matrix and the true NTK matrix as network width increases?

- Concept: Linear dynamics model of neural network training
  - Why needed here: The training dynamics approximation using the NTK matrix forms the theoretical foundation for gradient adjustment methods
  - Quick check question: How does the linear dynamics model approximate the training behavior of wide neural networks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input sampling and grouping module -> eNTK matrix computation module -> Eigenvalue decomposition module -> Transformation matrix construction module -> Gradient adjustment application module

- Critical path:
  1. Data partitioning and sampling
  2. eNTK matrix computation on samples
  3. Eigenvalue decomposition and transformation matrix construction
  4. Gradient adjustment application during training

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Sampling strategy vs. accuracy: Larger sample groups provide better estimates but increase computation
  - Eigenvalue balancing range vs. frequency coverage: Wider balancing ranges improve high-frequency learning but may slow low-frequency convergence
  - Network width vs. eNTK approximation quality: Wider networks provide better NTK approximations but increase computational cost

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor high-frequency reconstruction: May indicate insufficient eigenvalue balancing or poor sampling strategy
  - Unstable training: Could suggest over-aggressive gradient adjustments or inappropriate transformation matrix construction
  - No improvement over baseline: Might indicate sampling groups are too diverse or eNTK approximation is poor

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement basic IGA on 1D function approximation with varying eigenvalue balancing ranges
  2. Test different sampling strategies (random vs. largest residual) on 2D image approximation
  3. Compare IGA performance across different INR architectures (ReLU vs. SIREN) on standard benchmarks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the Inductive Gradient Adjustment (IGA) method scale with extremely large datasets where the number of data points exceeds billions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the eNTK matrix size grows quadratically with the number of data points, making decomposition and multiplication infeasible for Kodak image fitting tasks with approximately 10^11 entries. The IGA method addresses this by sampling from groups, but the analysis focuses on datasets with millions of points
- Why unresolved: The theoretical analysis in Theorem 4.2 provides error bounds for the inductive generalization approach, but these bounds may not hold or may become impractical for extremely large datasets. The paper doesn't explore the limits of the group sampling strategy when dealing with billions of data points
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing IGA performance on datasets with billions of points, analysis of how group sampling strategies need to be adapted for such scales, and updated theoretical bounds for the error introduced by inductive generalization at extreme scales

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the theoretical framework connecting spectral bias to training dynamics be extended to networks with modern activation functions beyond ReLU and Sine, such as Swish or GELU?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper's theoretical analysis focuses on two-layer networks with activation functions satisfying specific regularity conditions (bounded derivatives, etc.). The empirical experiments use ReLU and Sine activations. The connection between NTK/eNTK and spectral bias is derived under these specific conditions
- Why unresolved: The analysis framework relies on properties of the activation function that may not hold for newer activation functions. The paper doesn't investigate whether the NTK-based adjustment strategy generalizes to networks using activation functions that are now standard in deep learning
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical analysis showing how the NTK spectrum changes for networks with Swish, GELU, or other modern activations, and empirical validation that IGA provides similar benefits for these architectures

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the relationship between the spectral bias adjustment achieved by IGA and the generalization performance of the resulting implicit neural representations?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on improving PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics as measures of representation accuracy, which are tied to fitting the training data. The theoretical analysis connects spectral bias adjustment to training dynamics but doesn't explicitly address how these adjustments affect the model's ability to generalize to unseen data
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates that IGA improves representation accuracy on training data across multiple tasks, it doesn't investigate whether these improvements translate to better generalization. The focus on spectral bias adjustment may improve fitting but could potentially lead to overfitting if the high-frequency components being captured are noise rather than signal
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing IGA-trained models against baselines on held-out test sets, analysis of how the adjusted NTK spectrum affects the model's inductive biases, and theoretical work connecting the modified training dynamics to generalization bounds

## Limitations

- Computational overhead: eNTK matrix computation and eigenvalue decomposition introduce additional computational cost, particularly for large-scale problems
- Sampling strategy assumptions: The method assumes sufficient data similarity within groups, which may not hold for highly heterogeneous datasets
- Hyperparameter sensitivity: The paper doesn't thoroughly explore sensitivity to transformation matrix construction parameters and balancing ranges

## Confidence

- High confidence in the theoretical foundation connecting eNTK to NTK and the convergence properties as network width increases
- Medium confidence in the practical effectiveness of the sampling and inductive generalization strategy, as the paper provides limited ablation studies on different sampling approaches
- Medium confidence in the claimed computational efficiency, as the paper doesn't provide detailed runtime comparisons with baseline methods

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies comparing different sampling strategies (random vs. largest residual vs. stratified sampling) to quantify the impact on final reconstruction quality
2. Measure and report wall-clock training time for IGA versus baseline methods across all experimental setups to validate the claimed practical efficiency
3. Test IGA on datasets with known challenging frequency distributions (e.g., natural textures, sharp edges) to evaluate robustness across different spectral characteristics
