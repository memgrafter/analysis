# Residual-based Attention Physics-informed Neural Networks for Spatio-Temporal Ageing Assessment of Transformers Operated in Renewable Power Plants

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.06443
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06443
- Reference count: 9
- Primary result: RBA-PINN achieves 2.7°C max error for HST estimation vs 5.3°C for vanilla PINN, with 4.2% error vs 9.98% for IEC-based ageing methods

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of accurately estimating transformer hotspot temperature (HST) and ageing in renewable power plants, where existing space-agnostic models lead to inaccurate lifetime predictions. The authors propose a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) enhanced with Residual-Based Attention (RBA) to create a spatio-temporal model for transformer oil temperature, winding temperature, and ageing. The RBA mechanism improves convergence and accuracy by adaptively weighting collocation points based on historical residual magnitudes, while the spatio-temporal approach captures localized thermal effects along the winding height. The model is validated against fiber optic sensor data and demonstrates superior performance compared to both vanilla PINN and traditional IEC-based methods.

## Method Summary
The method employs a PINN architecture with RBA to solve the 1D heat diffusion PDE for transformer oil and winding temperatures. The model takes time and vertical position as inputs, with the neural network approximating oil temperature, ambient temperature, and load losses. Automatic differentiation computes spatial and temporal derivatives for the residual function, while the loss function combines boundary condition errors, load/ambient errors, and weighted residual error. Training uses Adam optimizer for 20,000 iterations followed by L-BFGS-B for fine-tuning. The RBA scheme assigns higher weights to collocation points where PDE residuals have historically been large, implemented via exponentially weighted moving averages. The model is validated against PDE numerical solutions and fiber optic sensor measurements at three winding heights.

## Key Results
- RBA-PINN achieves maximum oil temperature error of 2.7°C compared to 5.3°C for vanilla PINN
- HST prediction error of 4.2% compared to fiber optic sensor ground truth measurements
- Spatio-temporal ageing model accuracy of 4.2% error versus 9.98% for traditional IEC-based methods
- Model converges faster than vanilla PINN due to adaptive collocation point weighting

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Residual-Based Attention (RBA) improves PINN convergence and accuracy by adaptively weighting collocation points based on historical residual magnitudes. RBA assigns higher weights to collocation points where the PDE residual has been large in past iterations, preventing those points from being overlooked during stochastic sampling. This is implemented via an exponentially weighted moving average of residuals, adjusted with a learning rate. Core assumption: Residuals are indicative of where physics constraints are violated, and these violations are stable enough over iterations to guide weighting. Evidence: RBA description and adaptation of weights with cumulative residuals. Break condition: If PDE residual distribution changes rapidly, moving average may become stale.

### Mechanism 2
The spatio-temporal modeling of transformer winding temperature via PDE-based heat diffusion captures localized ageing phenomena better than space-agnostic models. By discretizing transformer height and solving 1D heat diffusion PDE with spatially varying oil temperature as input, the model infers local winding temperatures. These local temperatures are used to compute spatial ageing acceleration factors, enabling location-specific lifetime estimation. Core assumption: HST is not uniform along winding height and can move vertically, so single worst-case estimate is insufficient. Evidence: Spatio-temporal ageing model description and focus on modeling HST at different heights. Break condition: If HST is truly uniformly distributed or doesn't vary significantly in space, added complexity yields negligible improvement.

### Mechanism 3
Using measured fiber optic sensor data at multiple winding heights validates PINN-based spatio-temporal winding temperature estimates and improves confidence in ageing predictions. Fiber optic sensors provide ground truth local temperature readings. By comparing these readings to PINN predictions at same spatial coordinates, model's accuracy is quantified. Maximum of these local temperatures is used as HST estimate, improving upon single-point or worst-case IEC estimates. Core assumption: Fiber optic sensors are accurately placed at true HST location and provide reliable temperature measurements. Evidence: FOS deployment at three winding heights and validation against FOS measurements. Break condition: If fiber optic sensor readings are noisy, mislocated, or don't coincide with true HST, validation and subsequent ageing estimates will be unreliable.

## Foundational Learning

- Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
  - Why needed here: PINNs embed governing PDE directly into loss function, enabling model to respect physical laws while learning from data. Crucial for transformer thermal modeling where underlying heat diffusion process must be honored.
  - Quick check question: How does residual term in PINN loss function enforce PDE constraint?

- Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) for Heat Diffusion
  - Why needed here: 1D heat diffusion PDE describes how temperature evolves in space and time inside transformer oil and winding. Accurate PDE modeling is necessary to capture spatio-temporal temperature profile.
  - Quick check question: What are boundary conditions for oil temperature PDE in transformer model?

- Residual-Based Attention (RBA) and Adaptive Weighting
  - Why needed here: RBA addresses stochastic nature of PINN training by giving more importance to collocation points where PDE residual has historically been large, improving convergence and accuracy.
  - Quick check question: How is weighting factor for each collocation point updated during training in RBA scheme?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Time(t) + Position(x) -> NN -> Oil Temp Θ̂O, Ambient Temp Θ̂A, Load Losses P̂K -> Automatic Differentiation -> Residual Calculation -> Loss Function -> Optimizer
- Critical path: NN forward pass → automatic differentiation → residual calculation → loss aggregation → parameter update
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Number of collocation points vs. training speed: More points improve accuracy but slow training
  - Activation function choice: Tanh used here; ReLU may cause gradient issues with derivatives
  - RBA decay parameter (γ) and learning rate (η): Balance between responsiveness and stability
- Failure signatures:
  - Oscillating or diverging loss during training: Likely insufficient collocation points or poor RBA tuning
  - High residual at boundaries: Incorrect boundary condition implementation or insufficient boundary data points
  - Overfitting to training data: Too many network parameters relative to data size
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train vanilla PINN with 3 hidden layers, 50 neurons, 75% boundary points, 10x collocation points; record convergence and error
  2. Apply RBA with γ=0.99, η=0.001; compare convergence speed and final error to vanilla PINN
  3. Validate trained model against PDE numerical solution and fiber optic sensor data; compute L2 error and maximum temperature error

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the proposed spatio-temporal transformer ageing model perform under varying ambient temperature conditions? Basis: Paper discusses impact of ambient temperature on transformer's oil temperature and ageing but doesn't explicitly evaluate model's performance under varying ambient temperature conditions. Why unresolved: Paper focuses on specific case study with relatively stable ambient temperature profile. What evidence would resolve it: Experimental validation of model's performance under different ambient temperature scenarios, such as extreme cold or heat.

### Open Question 2
What is the computational cost of the RBA-PINN model compared to traditional methods for transformer lifetime assessment? Basis: Paper highlights improved convergence and accuracy of RBA-PINN model but doesn't provide detailed comparison of computational costs with traditional methods. Why unresolved: Paper focuses on model's accuracy and performance but doesn't delve into computational efficiency aspect. What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of computational time and resources required by RBA-PINN model and traditional methods for transformer lifetime assessment.

### Open Question 3
How sensitive is the proposed model to variations in transformer parameters, such as thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity? Basis: Paper discusses impact of transformer parameters on model's performance but doesn't provide sensitivity analysis. Why unresolved: Paper focuses on overall model performance but doesn't investigate sensitivity to individual parameters. What evidence would resolve it: Sensitivity analysis that quantifies impact of variations in transformer parameters on model's predictions and accuracy.

## Limitations

- The optimal tuning of RBA hyperparameters (γ, η) is not specified, which is critical for claimed convergence and accuracy improvements
- Validation is limited to a single transformer case study; generalization to different transformer designs and operating profiles is untested
- Comparison to IEC methods uses different data and operational profiles, raising questions about fairness of error comparisons

## Confidence

- High: PINN architecture and PDE formulation are well-grounded and reproducible
- Medium: RBA mechanism and its impact on convergence are plausible but lack direct comparative evidence
- Low: Generalization of spatio-temporal ageing model and its superiority over IEC methods is not yet established

## Next Checks

1. Perform ablation studies comparing RBA-PINN with vanilla PINN and alternative attention mechanisms on multiple transformer datasets
2. Test the model on transformers with different geometries, cooling systems, and renewable integration profiles to assess robustness
3. Conduct statistical significance tests on error comparisons between proposed model and IEC-based methods using paired datasets and operational conditions
