# Hybrid Spiking Neural Network -- Transformer Video Classification Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.00237
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00237
- Authors: Aaron Bateni
- Reference count: 15
- Primary result: Hybrid SNN-transformer architecture achieves promising video classification accuracy on small datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel hybrid architecture combining spiking neural networks (SNNs) with transformer models for video classification tasks. Inspired by cortical columns in the human brain, the model leverages spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) for learning while addressing the temporal dimension challenge through multiple video encoding methods. The approach demonstrates effectiveness in learning from small datasets, though computational costs increase significantly with larger datasets due to STDP-based training.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a hybrid architecture that integrates spiking neural networks with transformer models, utilizing STDP as the primary learning mechanism. Video data is converted into spike trains through multiple encoding methods to capture temporal information effectively. The model structure mimics cortical columns, combining the temporal processing capabilities of SNNs with the attention mechanisms of transformers. Training involves iterative weight updates based on spike timing correlations, enabling the network to learn temporal patterns in video sequences.

## Key Results
- Demonstrates effective learning from small video datasets using the hybrid SNN-transformer architecture
- Achieves promising classification accuracy while addressing temporal dimension challenges
- Shows successful integration of STDP learning with transformer attention mechanisms
- Complete implementation made publicly available on GitHub for reproducibility

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The hybrid architecture leverages the complementary strengths of SNNs and transformers. SNNs naturally process temporal information through spike timing, while transformers provide robust feature extraction through attention mechanisms. STDP enables biologically plausible learning by strengthening synaptic connections based on spike timing correlations. The multiple encoding methods preserve temporal information during the conversion from video frames to spike trains, allowing the model to capture both spatial and temporal patterns effectively.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Video Input -> Multiple Encoders -> SNN Layer -> Transformer Layer -> Classification Output

Critical Path: The sequence from video encoding through SNN processing to transformer attention and final classification represents the core information flow. STDP updates occur primarily at the SNN layer based on spike timing correlations.

Design Tradeoffs: The hybrid approach balances biological plausibility with computational efficiency. SNNs provide temporal processing but require careful encoding methods. Transformers offer powerful feature extraction but add computational overhead. STDP learning is biologically inspired but computationally intensive for large datasets.

Failure Signatures: Poor classification accuracy may indicate inadequate spike encoding, insufficient STDP learning rates, or transformer attention misalignment. Computational bottlenecks typically occur during STDP weight updates on larger datasets.

First Experiments:
1. Test spike encoding methods with synthetic temporal patterns to validate temporal information preservation
2. Evaluate STDP learning rates on simple temporal classification tasks before full video processing
3. Compare transformer attention outputs with and without SNN pre-processing on benchmark video datasets
