# HybridFC: A Hybrid Fact-Checking Approach for Knowledge Graphs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.06692
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06692
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: HybridFC achieves an average AUROC score of 0.86 on FactBench, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art fact-checking approaches for knowledge graphs.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of predicting the veracity of assertions in knowledge graphs, which is crucial for their adoption at Web scale. Existing fact-checking approaches for knowledge graphs are limited by manual feature engineering, exclusive use of knowledge graphs as background knowledge, and low accuracy scores. The authors propose HybridFC, a hybrid approach that combines text-based, path-based, and KG embedding-based fact-checking approaches within an ensemble learning setting. The approach uses pre-trained KG embedding and sentence transformer models and leverages transfer learning. HybridFC is evaluated on two recent fact-checking datasets, FactBench and BirthPlace/DeathPlace, and compared to seven state-of-the-art fact-checking approaches.

## Method Summary
HybridFC is a hybrid fact-checking approach for knowledge graphs that combines text-based, path-based, and KG embedding-based methods within an ensemble learning setting. The approach leverages pre-trained KG embedding and sentence transformer models and employs transfer learning to improve fact-checking accuracy. HybridFC uses a voting mechanism to combine the predictions from different fact-checking components, including text-based methods, path-based methods, and KG embedding-based methods. The approach is designed to be modular, allowing for the integration of rule-based approaches and exploration of other evidence sentence selection methods.

## Key Results
- HybridFC significantly outperforms competing approaches on the FactBench dataset, achieving an average AUROC score of 0.86.
- HybridFC is ranked 3rd on the smaller BirthPlace/DeathPlace (BD) dataset.
- The approach is modular, allowing for the integration of rule-based approaches and exploration of other evidence sentence selection methods.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
HybridFC works by combining multiple fact-checking approaches within an ensemble learning setting. The approach leverages pre-trained KG embedding and sentence transformer models to extract relevant features from knowledge graphs and text data. By combining text-based, path-based, and KG embedding-based methods, HybridFC can capture different aspects of fact-checking, such as semantic similarity, structural patterns, and embedding-based representations. The voting mechanism in the ensemble setting allows for robust and accurate predictions by aggregating the outputs of individual components.

## Foundational Learning
- Knowledge Graph Embeddings: Used to represent entities and relations in a continuous vector space, capturing semantic and structural information. Quick check: Verify that pre-trained KG embedding models are properly loaded and integrated into the ensemble.
- Sentence Transformers: Employed for text-based fact-checking, capturing semantic similarity between claims and evidence sentences. Quick check: Ensure that the sentence transformer model is fine-tuned or adapted for the specific fact-checking task.
- Ensemble Learning: Combines multiple fact-checking approaches to improve overall accuracy and robustness. Quick check: Evaluate the performance of individual components and the ensemble to assess the contribution of each approach.

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component Map: Text-based FC -> Path-based FC -> KG embedding-based FC -> Ensemble Voting
- Critical Path: Evidence sentence selection -> Fact-checking component execution -> Ensemble prediction
- Design Tradeoffs: Balancing accuracy and computational efficiency by selecting appropriate pre-trained models and ensemble configurations
- Failure Signatures: Poor performance on complex or domain-specific knowledge graphs, potential biases inherited from pre-trained models
- First Experiments: 1) Evaluate individual fact-checking components on a subset of the FactBench dataset, 2) Assess the impact of different ensemble voting mechanisms, 3) Test the modularity by integrating a rule-based approach

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The evaluation is conducted on only two datasets, which may not fully represent the diversity of real-world fact-checking scenarios.
- The approach's performance on more complex or domain-specific knowledge graphs remains unknown.
- The computational overhead of combining multiple fact-checking approaches within an ensemble setting is not discussed, which could impact scalability.

## Confidence
- HybridFC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the FactBench dataset (High)
- The approach is ranked 3rd on the smaller BirthPlace/DeathPlace dataset (Medium)
- Limited dataset scope and lack of comprehensive ablation studies (Medium)

## Next Checks
1. Test HybridFC on additional diverse knowledge graph datasets to assess generalizability
2. Conduct an ablation study to quantify the impact of each fact-checking component on overall performance
3. Evaluate the computational efficiency and scalability of the approach on large-scale knowledge graphs
