# Progressive Knowledge Graph Completion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.09897
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09897
- Reference count: 31
- Primary result: UniBi model achieves MOAR of 0.934 and CR@200 of 0.995 on FB15k in Progressive Knowledge Graph Completion

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Progressive Knowledge Graph Completion (PKGC), a novel task that simulates the gradual completion of knowledge graphs in real-world scenarios by integrating verification, mining, and training processes. Unlike traditional link prediction and triple classification, PKGC addresses the limitations of human verifiers and the need for efficient candidate selection. The authors propose two key acceleration modules - Optimized Top-k algorithm and Semantic Validity Filter (SVF) - that significantly reduce time and space complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that PKGC performance cannot be accurately reflected by traditional link prediction metrics, with the proposed UniBi model achieving state-of-the-art results.

## Method Summary
PKGC is formulated as a three-phase process: hyperparameter optimization with train/validation split, full training on all known triples, and incremental updates with retraining and fine-tuning. The framework employs two acceleration modules to handle the computational complexity: Optimized Top-k algorithm with root filter and warm-up scheduling, and Semantic Validity Filter (SVF) based on entity class information. The training process uses a combination of standard knowledge graph completion losses (F2 and DURA regularization) with specific formulations for both the initial training and incremental learning phases. Dataset partitioning follows a ρ ratio to create Kknown and Kun sets while maintaining all entities and relations in Kknown.

## Key Results
- UniBi model with relation normalization achieves MOAR of 0.934 and CR@200 of 0.995 on FB15k
- PKGC performance metrics (MOAR, CR@k) differ significantly from traditional link prediction metrics (MRR, Hits@10)
- SVF filtering reduces candidate triples from 533M to 26.3M (95.1% reduction) while maintaining high coverage (98.8%)
- PKGC demonstrates effectiveness in low-resource scenarios with reasonable completion rates even at reduced ρ values

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
PKGC works by simulating realistic knowledge graph completion scenarios where human verifiers gradually validate facts. The framework's effectiveness stems from its three-phase training approach that balances exploration and exploitation, combined with computational acceleration modules that make large-scale mining feasible. The Optimized Top-k algorithm prioritizes high-quality candidates through root filtering and warm-up scheduling, while SVF leverages semantic constraints to eliminate invalid triples early in the pipeline. This progressive approach allows models to adapt to newly verified knowledge through incremental learning, preventing catastrophic forgetting while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Foundational Learning
- Knowledge Graph Structure and Triple Format: Understanding entities, relations, and triple representations is essential for implementing the PKGC framework and designing appropriate loss functions
- Quick check: Verify dataset statistics (entities, relations, triples) match expected values for FB15k and WN18

- Top-k Algorithm Optimization: The Optimized Top-k algorithm requires understanding heap operations and candidate filtering strategies to implement the root filter and warm-up scheduling effectively
- Quick check: Confirm candidate reduction from 533M to 26.3M with SVF coverage above 98%

- Incremental Learning in KGC: Familiarity with retraining and fine-tuning strategies is crucial for the three-phase training pipeline and understanding how models adapt to new knowledge
- Quick check: Validate CR@k improvements across incremental learning stages

- Semantic Filtering Techniques: SVF relies on entity class information for filtering, requiring knowledge of semantic constraints and their application in candidate generation
- Quick check: Ensure entity class information is properly utilized for SVF coverage calculation

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Dataset Partitioning -> Training Pipeline (Phase 1,2,3) -> Mining Acceleration (Optimized Top-k + SVF) -> Evaluation Metrics

Critical Path: Kknown creation → Initial model training → Candidate generation with acceleration → Verification simulation → Incremental model updates → Performance evaluation

Design Tradeoffs: The framework balances computational efficiency (through acceleration modules) against model accuracy (through incremental learning). Using SVF sacrifices some recall for significant speedup, while the three-phase training ensures thorough exploration but increases training time. The ρ ratio determines the trade-off between initial knowledge availability and completion challenge.

Failure Signatures: Without acceleration modules, mining becomes computationally infeasible (candidate explosion). Poor performance in low-resource scenarios indicates insufficient entity/relation coverage in Kknown. Degraded incremental learning results suggest catastrophic forgetting or ineffective knowledge integration.

First Experiments:
1. Implement dataset partitioning with ρ=0.9 and verify entity/relation coverage in Kknown
2. Test Optimized Top-k algorithm with root filter on small candidate set (verify 95% reduction claim)
3. Evaluate SVF filtering effectiveness by comparing coverage metrics before/after filtering

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of PKGC models vary when using different data partition ratios (ρ) and how does this affect the efficiency of the completion process?
- Basis in paper: The paper explores low-resource PKGC by reducing ρ, which results in training the model on a smaller Kknown while exploring knowledge within a larger Fun. The results show that even in a low-resource scenario, UniBi attains reasonably satisfactory completion rates.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides results for specific values of ρ but does not extensively explore the impact of different ρ values on model performance and efficiency. Further investigation is needed to understand the optimal ρ for various scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with a wider range of ρ values and analyzing the corresponding model performance and completion efficiency would provide insights into the optimal data partition ratio for PKGC.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the key factors that influence the performance of PKGC models, and how can these factors be leveraged to improve model accuracy and efficiency?
- Basis in paper: The paper discusses the introduction of two acceleration modules, Optimized Top-k and Semantic Validity Filter (SVF), which significantly enhance the efficiency of the mining process. It also mentions the importance of relation normalization in PKGC.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies certain factors like acceleration modules and relation normalization, it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of all the key factors influencing PKGC performance. Further research is needed to identify and leverage additional factors for model improvement.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting ablation studies and comparative analyses of different PKGC models with varying configurations and hyperparameters would help identify the key factors influencing performance. Additionally, exploring novel techniques and architectures specifically designed for PKGC could lead to improved accuracy and efficiency.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can incremental learning techniques be effectively integrated into the PKGC framework to leverage newly verified knowledge and improve model performance?
- Basis in paper: The paper introduces the concept of incremental learning in PKGC, where newly verified knowledge is incorporated into the training process through retraining and fine-tuning. However, the results show that fine-tuning may have adverse consequences.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides initial insights into the effectiveness of incremental learning in PKGC but does not extensively explore different strategies and their impact on model performance. Further research is needed to optimize the integration of incremental learning techniques into PKGC.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with various incremental learning approaches, such as different update frequencies, data sampling strategies, and regularization techniques, would help identify the most effective methods for integrating newly verified knowledge into PKGC models. Additionally, exploring advanced techniques like meta-learning and transfer learning could further enhance the model's ability to leverage incremental knowledge.

## Limitations
- The framework assumes access to entity class information for SVF, which may not be available in all real-world KG scenarios
- Three-phase training pipeline increases computational complexity compared to traditional single-phase approaches
- Performance heavily depends on the quality of acceleration modules, making the framework sensitive to their implementation details
- Limited exploration of different ρ values restricts understanding of low-resource performance boundaries

## Confidence
- MOAR and CR@k metric validity: Medium - new metrics introduced but experimental validation shows clear differentiation from traditional metrics
- Computational efficiency claims: Medium - acceleration modules show significant improvements but implementation complexity is high
- Low-resource scenario effectiveness: Medium - results demonstrate reasonable performance but limited ρ value exploration
- Incremental learning effectiveness: Low - fine-tuning shows adverse effects but alternative strategies not thoroughly explored

## Next Checks
1. Test the SVF filtering effectiveness on datasets without entity class information to evaluate the framework's robustness in low-resource scenarios
2. Compare the time and space complexity improvements claimed by the Optimized Top-k algorithm against standard top-k approaches across different dataset sizes
3. Validate the low-resource performance claims by systematically varying the ρ ratio (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7) and measuring the corresponding CR@k values for each configuration
