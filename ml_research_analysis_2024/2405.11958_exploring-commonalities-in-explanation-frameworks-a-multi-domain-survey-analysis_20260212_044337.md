# Exploring Commonalities in Explanation Frameworks: A Multi-Domain Survey Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.11958
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11958
- Reference count: 5
- Key outcome: Study identified feature importance graphs and counterfactual explanations as critical components for explainable AI frameworks across medical, retail, and energy domains

## Executive Summary
This study explores commonalities in explanation frameworks across three domains—medical, retail, and energy—through surveys and interviews with domain experts and non-experts. The research identifies feature importance graphs and counterfactual explanations as universally valued components of explainable AI systems. Participants consistently preferred sacrificing some accuracy to gain greater explainability, highlighting the importance of transparency in AI decision-making. Based on these findings, the study proposes a two-module framework consisting of a Counterfactual Module for "What-if" scenarios and a Global Importance Module for visualizing influential features, designed to balance accuracy with interpretability across diverse use cases.

## Method Summary
The study employed surveys and interviews across medical, retail, and energy domains to gather user preferences for AI explanations. Domain experts (medical doctors, retail decision-makers, energy operational managers) and non-experts participated in the study. Genetic Programming (GP) algorithms were utilized to create interpretable models, with insights from the surveys incorporated into a software tool design. The framework consists of two modules: a Counterfactual Module to explore minimal changes needed for different model outcomes, and a Global Importance Module to visualize influential features in predictions.

## Key Results
- Feature importance graphs and counterfactual explanations emerged as critical components across all three domains
- Universal preference for sacrificing some accuracy in favor of greater explainability
- Proposed framework includes Counterfactual and Global Importance modules applicable across diverse use cases
- Insights incorporated into a software tool utilizing GP algorithms for model interpretability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Feature importance graphs and counterfactual explanations are effective across diverse domains for explainable AI.
- Mechanism: The study found that across medical, retail, and energy domains, participants consistently valued feature importance graphs and counterfactual explanations as critical components of an explanation framework.
- Core assumption: The needs for understanding model decisions are sufficiently similar across medical, retail, and energy domains.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] highlights the significance of feature importance and counterfactual explanations as critical components of such a framework.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: A trade-off exists between accuracy and explainability, with users willing to sacrifice some accuracy for greater transparency.
- Mechanism: The study found that participants across all three domains showed a universal preference for sacrificing a degree of accuracy in favor of greater explainability.
- Core assumption: The perceived value of understanding model decisions outweighs the value of maximum predictive accuracy.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] indicates a universal preference for sacrificing a degree of accuracy in favor of greater explainability.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Genetic Programming (GP) algorithms are effective for creating interpretable models that can be used across diverse domains.
- Mechanism: The study incorporated GP algorithms into a software tool for explanation, leveraging their known interpretability and ability to generate symbolic expressions easily understood by non-experts.
- Core assumption: GP algorithms can generate models that are both sufficiently accurate for practical use and interpretable enough to provide meaningful explanations across diverse domains.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] mentions the insights are incorporated into a software tool that utilizes GP algorithms, known for their interpretability.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Feature Importance Visualization
  - Why needed here: Feature importance graphs were identified as one of the most favored explanation formats across all domains in the study.
  - Quick check question: What does a feature importance graph show, and why is it valuable for explainable AI?

- Concept: Counterfactual Explanations
  - Why needed here: Counterfactual explanations were highlighted as critical components of the framework.
  - Quick check question: How do counterfactual explanations differ from feature importance explanations, and in what scenarios are they most useful?

- Concept: Accuracy-Explainability Trade-off
  - Why needed here: The study found a universal preference for sacrificing some accuracy for greater explainability.
  - Quick check question: In what situations might a user prefer explainability over accuracy, and how can this trade-off be quantified?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Counterfactual Module -> Global Importance Module -> User Interface -> Model Integration Layer -> Configuration Manager
- Critical path: User query → Explanation module selection → Data extraction → Explanation generation → Visualization rendering → User presentation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. Explainability: Balance model performance with interpretability
  - Domain specificity vs. Universality: Create general modules that can be customized for specific use cases
  - Technical depth vs. Accessibility: Provide explanations that serve both experts and non-experts
  - Real-time performance vs. Explanation quality: Optimize explanation generation speed without sacrificing quality
- Failure signatures:
  - Users cannot understand generated explanations
  - Explanations take too long to generate
  - Model accuracy drops below acceptable thresholds
  - Different domains cannot be adequately served by the same framework
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple feature importance visualization for a diabetes prediction model and gather user feedback on interpretability
  2. Create a counterfactual explanation generator for a retail pricing model and test with decision-makers
  3. Build a prototype that combines both modules for an energy consumption forecasting model and evaluate across user types

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal trade-off between accuracy and explainability in different domains?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The study found a universal preference for sacrificing a degree of accuracy in favor of greater explainability.
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions a preference for explainability but does not specify the optimal trade-off point or how it varies across different domains.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies measuring user performance and trust with varying levels of accuracy and explainability across different domains.

### Open Question 2

## Limitations

- Findings are based on a limited set of three domains (medical, retail, and energy) which may not generalize to all potential use cases for explainable AI
- The paper does not provide specific details about survey methodology, including exact questions asked or sample sizes for each domain
- Effectiveness relies on the assumption that GP algorithms can consistently generate models that are both accurate and interpretable across diverse domains

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The identification of feature importance graphs and counterfactual explanations as valued explanation types across domains is well-supported by the evidence presented
- Medium Confidence: The universal preference for sacrificing accuracy for explainability is reported consistently but may be context-dependent
- Medium Confidence: The effectiveness of GP algorithms for creating interpretable models is theoretically sound but not empirically validated in this paper

## Next Checks

1. Conduct user studies in additional domains (e.g., finance, education, manufacturing) to test the generalizability of feature importance and counterfactual explanations
2. Perform controlled experiments comparing model performance with and without the proposed explanation modules to quantify the actual accuracy-explainability trade-off
3. Test the framework with both technical and non-technical users to evaluate accessibility and identify potential gaps in the explanation modules
