# When factorization meets argumentation: towards argumentative explanations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.08131
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08131
- Authors: Jinfeng Zhong; Elsa Negre
- Reference count: 15
- Primary result: CA-FATA achieves RMSE of 1.1033 and MAE of 0.8519 on Yelp dataset, and RMSE of 0.5154 and MAE of 0.3910 on Frappé dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CA-FATA, a novel recommender system that combines matrix factorization with argumentation frameworks to provide model-intrinsic explanations. The key innovation is treating item features as arguments in a tripolar argumentation framework (TAF), where users' ratings toward features determine the strength and polarity of these arguments. The model incorporates user context to generate context-aware recommendations and explanations, achieving competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while providing interpretable explanations.

## Method Summary
CA-FATA implements a four-step process: (1) computes user representation adapted to the target contextual situation by aggregating user vectors with contextual situation vectors weighted by learned importance scores, (2) calculates feature type importance per user per context, (3) computes users' ratings toward individual features, and (4) aggregates these ratings weighted by feature type importance to produce recommendations with explanations. The model satisfies weak balance and weak monotonicity properties, enabling intuitive contrastive explanations about why certain features support or attack recommendations.

## Key Results
- CA-FATA outperforms existing argumentation-based methods and matches state-of-the-art context-free and context-aware methods
- Achieves RMSE of 1.1033 and MAE of 0.8519 on Yelp dataset (904,648 observations)
- Achieves RMSE of 0.5154 and MAE of 0.3910 on Frappé dataset (96,303 logs from 957 users)
- Provides three practical applications: explanation templates, interactive explanations, and contrastive explanations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: CA-FATA produces model-intrinsic explanations by mapping item features to arguments in a tripolar argumentation framework (TAF).
- Mechanism: Item features are treated as arguments that can support, attack, or neutralize the recommendation, with polarity determined by users' ratings toward features. The strength function aligns with weak balance and weak monotonicity properties.
- Core assumption: User preferences toward item features can be directly mapped to argument strength in a TAF without losing predictive accuracy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "features of items are considered as arguments, and the users' ratings towards these features determine the strength and polarity of these arguments"
  - [section] "The key idea of CA-FATA is that users' ratings towards items depend on items' attributes... these arguments may support, attack or neutralize users' ratings towards items depending on users' ratings"
  - [corpus] Weak - only indirect evidence from related argumentation papers, no direct evidence this specific mechanism works
- Break condition: If user ratings toward features cannot be reliably estimated or if the argument polarity mapping loses critical information about user preferences.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Context-aware modeling improves prediction accuracy by adapting feature importance and user representation to contextual situations.
- Mechanism: User representation is computed by aggregating user vector with contextual situation vector weighted by learned importance scores of contextual factors. Feature type importance is similarly learned per user per context.
- Core assumption: User preferences vary meaningfully across contexts, and this variation can be captured by learned importance weights.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Additionally, our framework seamlessly incorporates side information, such as user contexts, leading to more accurate predictions"
  - [section] "CA-FATA further extends this idea by noting that users' preferences also vary across contexts... we compute the representation of users that is adapted to the target contextual situation"
  - [corpus] Weak - related context-aware recommendation papers exist but no direct evidence this specific approach works
- Break condition: If contextual factors do not meaningfully influence user preferences or if the learned importance weights overfit to noise.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Weak balance and weak monotonicity properties enable intuitive contrastive explanations.
- Mechanism: The strength function for arguments satisfies these properties, meaning isolated supporting arguments increase recommendation strength while isolated attacking arguments decrease it. This enables counterfactual reasoning for explanations.
- Core assumption: Users can understand recommendations through contrastive reasoning about why certain features support or attack a recommendation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Theoretical analyses indicate that the strength function of arguments under the AF for each user-item interaction satisfies two desired properties Weak balance and Weak monotonicity"
  - [section] "Propositions 1 and 2 guarantee that the fourth objective—the formulation of a strength function that complies with weak balance and weak monotonicity—is accomplished"
  - [corpus] Weak - related argumentation papers discuss these properties but no direct evidence this specific application works
- Break condition: If users find the contrastive explanations confusing or if the properties do not actually produce intuitive explanations in practice.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Tripolar Argumentation Framework (TAF)
  - Why needed here: Provides the theoretical foundation for mapping item features to arguments with support, attack, and neutral relations
  - Quick check question: What are the three types of relations in a TAF and how do they map to recommendation features?

- Concept: Matrix Factorization
  - Why needed here: Forms the base predictive model that CA-FATA builds upon and explains
  - Quick check question: How does standard matrix factorization represent user-item interactions, and what limitation does CA-FATA address?

- Concept: Context-aware recommendation
  - Why needed here: Explains why incorporating contextual factors is important for modeling user preferences
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between context-free and context-aware recommendation approaches?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: User context → User representation → Feature type importance → Feature ratings → Aggregation → Recommendation with explanations

- Critical path: User context → User representation → Feature type importance → Feature ratings → Aggregation → Recommendation with explanations

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Interpretability vs. predictive accuracy: Adding argumentation scaffolding may reduce model capacity
  - Context granularity: Finer context distinctions increase model complexity but may improve accuracy
  - Feature type selection: More feature types increase expressiveness but also computational cost

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor RMSE/MAE on test sets: likely issues with factorization or context modeling
  - Explanations that don't make intuitive sense: likely problems with TAF mapping or property satisfaction
  - Extremely slow inference: likely issues with argumentation scaffolding complexity

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare CA-FATA RMSE/MAE vs. vanilla matrix factorization on a small dataset
  2. Test context sensitivity by training with and without context features
  3. Validate explanation quality by checking if weak balance/weak monotonicity properties hold on sample data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the integration of argumentation frameworks with neural networks (e.g., in Neuro-Argumentative Learning) impact the performance and interpretability of recommender systems compared to CA-FATA?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper suggests that CA-FATA treats features as arguments and explores the potential of integrating argumentation with neural networks, but does not empirically compare this approach to CA-FATA.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the integration of argumentation frameworks with matrix factorization methods and does not explore the integration with neural networks.
- What evidence would resolve it: An empirical study comparing the performance and interpretability of recommender systems using argumentation frameworks with neural networks versus CA-FATA.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the choice of dimension reduction technique (e.g., PCA, t-SNE, UMAP) affect the visualization and interpretation of user clustering based on contextual factor importance in CA-FATA?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses UMAP for visualization and mentions that other techniques could be used, but does not explore the impact of different techniques on the results.
- Why unresolved: The paper only presents results using UMAP and does not compare the effects of different dimension reduction techniques.
- What evidence would resolve it: An empirical comparison of user clustering and visualization results using different dimension reduction techniques.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do the three proposed explanation applications (toy templates, interactive explanations, and contrastive explanations) impact user satisfaction and trust in the recommender system?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper anticipates at least three practical applications for CA-FATA but does not empirically evaluate their impact on user satisfaction and trust.
- Why unresolved: The paper presents the potential applications of CA-FATA but does not conduct user studies to assess their effectiveness.
- What evidence would resolve it: User studies evaluating the impact of the three explanation applications on user satisfaction and trust in the recommender system.

## Limitations

- The paper lacks ablation studies showing how much each component (argumentation scaffolding, context modeling, dialectical relations) contributes to the final performance.
- Explanation quality is evaluated only through satisfaction of weak balance and weak monotonicity properties, not through human studies measuring if users actually find explanations helpful.
- Implementation details for the argumentation framework are sparse, making exact reproduction difficult.

## Confidence

- High confidence: RMSE/MAE results on Yelp and Frappé datasets are verifiable through reported metrics and comparison with baselines.
- Medium confidence: Claim that CA-FATA satisfies weak balance and weak monotonicity properties appears theoretically sound but requires implementation verification.
- Low confidence: Practical utility of three explanation applications is asserted but not empirically validated with user studies or systematic evaluations.

## Next Checks

1. Implement a minimal CA-FATA version and verify that the argumentation scaffolding actually produces meaningful polarity assignments for features by checking if isolated supporting/attacking features change predictions as expected under weak balance/weak monotonicity.

2. Conduct a user study where participants rate the helpfulness and clarity of CA-FATA explanations versus baseline explanations (feature importance, counterfactuals) on a held-out test set.

3. Perform an ablation study removing the argumentation scaffolding while keeping the context-aware components to quantify the specific contribution of explainability to overall model performance.
