# Simple Augmentations of Logical Rules for Neuro-Symbolic Knowledge Graph Completion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.01994
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01994
- Reference count: 22
- Key outcome: Rule augmentations (abductive, inverse, random walk + PCA + pruning) yield up to 7.1 pt MRR and 8.5 pt Hits@1 gains over baselines on four KGC datasets, with consistent gains on ExpressGNN

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a simple yet effective approach to improve neuro-symbolic knowledge graph completion (KGC) by augmenting rule sets with abductive rules, inverse rules, and PCA-filtered random walk rules, followed by pruning low-quality rules. The method addresses the challenge of sparse rule coverage in KGs by generating additional rules that can be used for reasoning. Experiments on four standard KGC datasets show consistent improvements over existing baselines, with up to 7.1 percentage points increase in MRR and 8.5 percentage points in Hits@1. The approach is also validated on ExpressGNN, demonstrating its applicability beyond the primary framework.

## Method Summary
The method starts with a base set of logical rules mined from the KG, then systematically augments this set with three types of additional rules: abductive rules generated using abduction principles, inverse rules that reverse the direction of existing rules, and random walk rules filtered by PCA to reduce noise. A pruning step removes low-quality rules based on confidence scores. The augmented and pruned rule set is then used in a neuro-symbolic KGC framework, where the rules provide symbolic guidance to a neural model. The approach is designed to be general and can be integrated with various neural-symbolic KGC methods.

## Key Results
- Up to 7.1 percentage points improvement in MRR over baselines
- Up to 8.5 percentage points improvement in Hits@1 over baselines
- Consistent gains across four different KGC datasets
- Validated on ExpressGNN, showing broad applicability beyond the primary framework

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method improves KGC by expanding the coverage of logical rules available for reasoning. Abductive rules capture plausible inferences not directly present in the KG, inverse rules allow bidirectional reasoning, and random walk rules with PCA filtering capture complex relational patterns while reducing noise. Pruning ensures that only high-quality rules are retained, preventing dilution of the rule set. By providing more and better rules, the neuro-symbolic model can make more accurate predictions, especially for entities and relations with limited direct evidence.

## Foundational Learning
- Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC): Predicting missing links in knowledge graphs using logical rules or neural models. **Why needed:** Core task addressed by the paper. **Quick check:** Can you explain the difference between transductive and inductive KGC?
- Neuro-Symbolic Integration: Combining neural networks with symbolic reasoning (e.g., logical rules) for improved performance. **Why needed:** The framework used to evaluate the augmented rules. **Quick check:** What are the benefits and challenges of neuro-symbolic approaches?
- Abduction in Logic: Inferring the most likely explanation for an observation using logical rules. **Why needed:** Basis for generating abductive rules. **Quick check:** How does abduction differ from deduction and induction?
- Random Walks on Graphs: Generating paths by randomly traversing edges, used here to discover relational patterns. **Why needed:** Source of random walk rules. **Quick check:** What is the relationship between random walks and graph embeddings?
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Dimensionality reduction technique used here to filter noisy random walk rules. **Why needed:** Reduces rule set size while retaining important patterns. **Quick check:** How does PCA determine which dimensions to keep?
- Rule Mining from KGs: Extracting logical rules directly from knowledge graph structure. **Why needed:** Provides the initial rule set to be augmented. **Quick check:** What are common algorithms for rule mining in KGs?

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** KG -> Rule Miner -> Base Rules -> Augmentations (Abductive, Inverse, Random Walk + PCA) -> Pruning -> Augmented Rules -> Neuro-Symbolic KGC Model -> Predictions
**Critical Path:** Rule generation and augmentation is the bottleneck; pruning and integration with neural model are relatively lightweight.
**Design Tradeoffs:** More rules can improve coverage but risk noise; PCA filtering balances complexity and quality. Rule pruning prevents dilution but may remove potentially useful rules.
**Failure Signatures:** If rule mining produces low-quality or overly specific rules, augmentation may not help. If PCA filtering is too aggressive, useful patterns may be lost. If pruning is too lenient, noise may dominate.
**3 First Experiments:** 1) Validate rule augmentation improves MRR on a simple dataset with few initial rules. 2) Test the impact of each augmentation type (abductive, inverse, random walk) individually. 3) Measure the effect of pruning threshold on final performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Focuses on static KGs; does not address temporal or dynamic aspects.
- Performance depends on quality of initial rule mining; no analysis of different mining algorithms.
- Pruning effectiveness depends on quality of confidence scores, which is not thoroughly analyzed.

## Confidence
- Rule augmentation effectiveness: **High** - Supported by consistent improvements across multiple datasets and baselines
- Broad applicability claim: **Medium** - Validated on ExpressGNN but limited to other neural-symbolic frameworks
- Pruning strategy effectiveness: **Medium** - Depends on quality of confidence scores which is not thoroughly analyzed

## Next Checks
1. Test the rule augmentation approach on temporal knowledge graphs to evaluate its effectiveness beyond static KGs
2. Analyze the impact of different rule mining algorithms on the final performance to understand the dependency on initial rule quality
3. Conduct ablation studies on the pruning strategy to quantify its contribution versus the raw augmented rule set performance
