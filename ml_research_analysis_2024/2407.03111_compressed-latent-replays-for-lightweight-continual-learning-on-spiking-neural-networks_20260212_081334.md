# Compressed Latent Replays for Lightweight Continual Learning on Spiking Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.03111
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03111
- Reference count: 25
- Primary result: Memory-efficient continual learning for SNNs achieving 92.5% Top-1 accuracy on Heidelberg SHD dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses catastrophic forgetting in continual learning scenarios for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices. The authors propose a memory-efficient Latent Replay (LR) approach that combines newly acquired data with compressed latent representations of previously learned data, stored as compressed spike sequences. This technique achieves significant memory savings while maintaining high accuracy on continual learning tasks.

## Method Summary
The method combines newly acquired data with latent representations of previously learned data, stored as compressed spike sequences. A novel time-domain compression technique reduces memory requirements by two orders of magnitude compared to naive rehearsal setups. The approach was evaluated on the Heidelberg SHD dataset using Sample-Incremental and Class-Incremental tasks, achieving Top-1 accuracies of 92.5% and 92% respectively, without forgetting previously learned information.

## Key Results
- Achieved 92.5% Top-1 accuracy on Heidelberg SHD dataset with Sample-Incremental task
- 2-orders-of-magnitude memory reduction compared to naive rehearsal setups
- Maximum accuracy drop of 4% with significant compression
- 78.4% Top-1 accuracy on Multi-Class-Incremental task learning 10 new classes from initial 10

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by storing compressed latent representations of previously learned data rather than full replay buffers. This allows the network to rehearse on compressed spike sequences that capture essential temporal information while dramatically reducing memory footprint. The time-domain compression technique specifically targets the spike timing patterns that are critical for SNN functionality.

## Foundational Learning
- Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs): Biological-inspired neural networks that process information through discrete spikes; needed for understanding the unique challenges of continual learning in event-based systems
- Catastrophic Forgetting: Phenomenon where neural networks forget previously learned information when trained on new tasks; quick check: occurs when fine-tuning on new data without rehearsal mechanisms
- Latent Replay: Technique storing compressed representations rather than full data; quick check: reduces memory requirements while maintaining learning capability
- Time-domain Compression: Method compressing temporal spike sequences; quick check: preserves spike timing information critical for SNN operation

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Input Data -> SNN Encoder -> Compressed Latent Storage -> Replay Buffer -> SNN Decoder -> Output Layer

**Critical Path:**
Data acquisition → SNN forward pass → Latent encoding → Compression → Storage → Replay during training → Fine-tuning

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Memory vs. accuracy: Higher compression ratios reduce memory but increase accuracy degradation (up to 4%)
- Computational overhead: Compression/decompression adds processing steps during training
- Storage efficiency: Spike sequence compression exploits temporal sparsity

**Failure Signatures:**
- Accuracy degradation beyond 4% with aggressive compression
- Increased forgetting when compressed representations lose temporal precision
- Scalability issues when task count exceeds 20 classes

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Evaluate baseline SNN performance on Heidelberg SHD without any continual learning mechanism
2. Test uncompressed latent replay to establish upper bound on accuracy
3. Implement varying compression ratios to find optimal memory-accuracy tradeoff

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the paper.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to Heidelberg SHD dataset, limiting generalizability to other domains
- Notable performance gap (78.4% Top-1) in Multi-Class-Incremental tasks with 20 classes
- No analysis of computational overhead during inference on edge devices
- Missing energy efficiency metrics crucial for edge deployment

## Confidence
- **High**: Memory reduction claims (2 orders of magnitude)
- **Medium**: Accuracy results on Heidelberg SHD dataset
- **Low**: Generalizability to other datasets and tasks

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the approach on multiple benchmark datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, ImageNet) to assess generalizability
2. Conduct extensive ablation studies on compression parameters to optimize the accuracy-memory trade-off
3. Measure and report inference latency and energy consumption on target edge hardware platforms
