# Accent Conversion in Text-To-Speech Using Multi-Level VAE and Adversarial Training

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.01018
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01018
- Reference count: 13
- This paper proposes a Multi-Level VAE with adversarial training for accent conversion in TTS, showing improved accent conversion but reduced speaker similarity compared to baseline models.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the need for more inclusive speech technology by focusing on accent conversion in text-to-speech (TTS) systems. The authors propose a novel approach using a Multi-Level Variational Autoencoder (MLVAE) combined with adversarial training to disentangle speaker identity from accent information. This method aims to improve accent conversion ability while preserving speaker identity. The model is trained using a two-step procedure involving a generator step and a discriminator step. Objective evaluations show improved mel-cepstral distortion compared to baseline models, but slightly higher word error rates. Subjective listening tests indicate better accent conversion performance but reduced speaker similarity and voice quality compared to the baseline MLVAE model. The results demonstrate the potential of adversarial training in enhancing accent conversion in TTS systems, though further refinement is needed to balance accent conversion with speaker identity preservation.

## Method Summary
The proposed method combines a Multi-Level VAE with adversarial training to convert accented speech while preserving speaker identity. The MLVAE uses two separate latent variables: zg_a for accent and zs for speaker. The model employs a two-step training procedure: a Generator step that updates all parameters except the accent classifier using reconstruction, KL, and adversarial losses, and a Discriminator step that updates only the accent classifier. The adversarial loss forces speaker embeddings to minimize accent-specific features, enabling accent conversion during inference by swapping accent embeddings while keeping speaker embeddings fixed.

## Key Results
- Objective evaluation shows improved mel-cepstral distortion (MCD) compared to baseline models
- Word error rate (WER) is slightly higher than baseline models, indicating potential intelligibility issues
- Subjective listening tests demonstrate better accent conversion but reduced speaker similarity and voice quality compared to baseline MLVAE

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Adversarial loss on accent classifier forces speaker embeddings to lose accent information. The accent classifier is trained to predict accent from speaker embeddings, but during the generator step the adversarial loss penalizes the classifier for correct predictions, forcing the speaker embeddings to minimize accent-specific features. Core assumption: Accent information can be effectively separated from speaker identity in the embedding space through adversarial training.

### Mechanism 2
Multi-Level VAE architecture enables hierarchical disentanglement of accent and speaker characteristics. The MLVAE uses two separate latent variables (zg_a for accent, zs for speaker) that are learned through group-level evidence lower bound optimization, allowing accent and speaker information to be captured in separate embedding spaces. Core assumption: Accent and speaker characteristics can be meaningfully represented as separate factors of variation in the data.

### Mechanism 3
Two-step training procedure with separate generator and discriminator steps enables stable adversarial training. The model alternates between G-Step (updating all parameters except accent classifier using reconstruction, KL, and adversarial losses) and D-Step (updating only the accent classifier using cross-entropy loss), creating a minimax game that stabilizes the adversarial training process. Core assumption: Alternating optimization between generator and discriminator steps can achieve better convergence than joint optimization.

## Foundational Learning

- **Variational Autoencoder (VAE) theory and evidence lower bound (ELBO) optimization**
  - Why needed here: The MLVAE builds on standard VAE principles but extends them to group-level optimization and hierarchical latent variables
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between the ELBO and the true marginal log-likelihood in a VAE?

- **Adversarial training and minimax optimization**
  - Why needed here: The adversarial loss component requires understanding of how to train generator and discriminator networks in opposition to each other
  - Quick check question: In a standard GAN, what happens to the generator loss when the discriminator becomes too strong?

- **Speaker and accent representation in speech signals**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how accent and speaker identity manifest in acoustic features is crucial for designing appropriate loss functions and evaluating results
  - Quick check question: What acoustic features typically distinguish different accents in the same language?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Phoneme Encoder → Phoneme Embeddings → MLVAE Encoder → Speaker Embeddings (zs) & Accent Embeddings (zg_a) → Mel Decoder → Generated Mel-Spectrogram → HiFiGAN Vocoder → Final Speech Output

- **Critical path**: Phoneme Embeddings + Reference Mel-Spectrogram + MLVAE → Speaker & Accent Embeddings → Mel Decoder → Generated Mel-Spectrogram → HiFiGAN Vocoder → Speech Output

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Embedding size (128 for both speaker and accent) vs. representation capacity
  - Adversarial loss weight (γ) vs. accent conversion strength vs. speaker quality
  - Group size in MLVAE vs. statistical efficiency vs. accent generalization

- **Failure signatures**:
  - High WER with low MCD suggests good reconstruction but poor intelligibility
  - Chaotic speaker embeddings (Fig. 3b) indicate γ is too high
  - Poor accent conversion despite good speaker similarity suggests insufficient adversarial training

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Train baseline MLVAE without adversarial loss to establish performance floor
  2. Add adversarial loss with low γ (10^-4) to verify training stability
  3. Gradually increase γ while monitoring accent conversion and speaker quality metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Optimal balance between accent conversion strength and speaker identity preservation**: The authors note that increasing accent conversion strength through adversarial training led to reduced speaker similarity and voice quality, suggesting a trade-off that needs to be optimized.

- **Impact of dataset size and speaker diversity**: The authors mention that their dataset includes only 4 speakers per accent, which may contribute to the trade-off between accent conversion and speaker identity preservation.

- **Alternative disentanglement methods beyond adversarial training**: While adversarial training shows promise, it introduces a trade-off that may not be ideal. Other disentanglement methods, such as information bottleneck approaches or contrastive learning, might offer better performance.

## Limitations
- Limited dataset size with only 4 speakers per accent, which may affect generalization
- Trade-off between accent conversion quality and speaker identity preservation remains unresolved
- Subjective evaluation methodology lacks detailed participant information and sample size

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The fundamental MLVAE architecture and its ability to disentangle speaker and accent information
- **Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of adversarial training for accent conversion
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability of results to other accent datasets and the optimal balance between accent conversion and speaker preservation

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a systematic grid search over γ values (10^-4 to 10^-2) to identify the optimal trade-off point between accent conversion quality, speaker similarity, and overall intelligibility.

2. Test the trained model on an independent accent dataset to evaluate generalization performance and determine if the learned disentanglement generalizes beyond the training distribution.

3. Compare the two-step adversarial training procedure against alternative approaches such as joint optimization with gradient penalties or curriculum learning strategies to validate whether the proposed training methodology is optimal for this task.
