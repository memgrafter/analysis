# Freeplane: Unlocking Free Lunch in Triplane-Based Sparse-View Reconstruction Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.00750
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00750
- Authors: Wenqiang Sun; Zhengyi Wang; Shuo Chen; Yikai Wang; Zilong Chen; Jun Zhu; Jun Zhang
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Freeplane improves mesh smoothness and geometric details in triplane-based sparse-view reconstruction models without additional training or computational overhead.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of inconsistent multi-view images degrading 3D mesh quality in triplane-based sparse-view reconstruction models. The authors observe that such inconsistencies introduce high-frequency artifacts on triplanes, leading to rough and uneven meshes. To solve this, they propose Freeplane, a method that strategically filters triplane features using bilateral filtering and combines triplanes before and after filtering to produce high-quality textured meshes. This approach incurs no additional training or computational overhead and can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained models. Experiments show that Freeplane improves the smoothness and geometric details of generated meshes.

## Method Summary
Freeplane strategically filters triplane features using bilateral filtering to remove high-frequency artifacts caused by inconsistent multi-view images. The method combines triplanes before and after filtering to produce high-quality textured meshes. Specifically, it uses the original triplanes for texture mapping and the filtered triplanes for geometry prediction. This approach requires no additional training or fine-tuning and can be integrated into pre-trained triplane-based sparse-view reconstruction models like CRM and InstantMesh.

## Key Results
- Volume IoU improved from 0.422 to 0.434 for CRM and 0.429 to 0.448 for InstantMesh
- Chamfer Distance reduced from 16.06 to 16.12 for CRM and 16.34 to 14.73 for InstantMesh
- Normal Consistency Score improved from 67.01% to 67.30% for CRM and 68.20% to 69.37% for InstantMesh

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Inconsistent multi-view images introduce high-frequency artifacts into triplanes, which degrade mesh quality.
- Mechanism: The multi-view diffusion model produces images with local inconsistencies. These inconsistencies manifest as high-frequency noise in the triplane feature maps because triplanes encode geometry from multiple orthographic projections. The SDF and texture extraction stages amplify these artifacts, producing rough, uneven meshes.
- Core assumption: The artifacts are localized high-frequency components, not global low-frequency distortions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...the inconsistent multi-view images introduce high-frequency artifacts on triplanes, leading to low-quality 3D meshes."
  - [section] "Specifically, despite the global consistency of these multi-view images, there are significant conflicts and inconsistencies in certain local areas, resulting in high-frequency artifacts on the triplanes."
- Break condition: If multi-view consistency is perfect or triplanes are not used as the geometry prior, the mechanism fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Bilateral filtering selectively smooths high-frequency artifacts while preserving edge geometry in triplanes.
- Mechanism: A bilateral filter applies a spatially weighted average based on both pixel distance and intensity difference. This removes high-frequency conflicts locally while keeping sharp transitions (edges) intact, thus preserving geometric detail in the resulting mesh.
- Core assumption: High-frequency conflicts in triplanes are spatially localized and have distinct intensity differences from surrounding regions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "To preserve the edge geometric details, we introduce another low-pass kernel filter, denoted as Kr..."
  - [section] "The bilateral filter ensures local smoothing while preserving the triplane boundaries."
- Break condition: If artifacts span large connected regions or are indistinguishable from true geometry, bilateral filtering may oversmooth or fail to remove them.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Combining triplanes before and after filtering decouples texture and geometry extraction.
- Mechanism: Pre-filtered triplanes retain full texture fidelity for color mapping, while post-filtered triplanes provide cleaner geometry signals for SDF prediction. This separation improves both smoothness and detail preservation.
- Core assumption: Texture features in triplanes are more robust to local high-frequency noise than geometry features.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "we propose using the triplanes before filtering to query color and the triplanes after filtering to predict geometry, ensuring fully utilize the texture priors in the pre-trained model."
- Break condition: If texture and geometry are too tightly coupled in the triplane encoding, separating them may degrade overall reconstruction quality.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Bilateral filtering in image processing
  - Why needed here: It is the core technique for removing local high-frequency artifacts without losing edge information in triplanes.
  - Quick check question: What are the two weighting factors in a bilateral filter and how do they differ from a simple Gaussian blur?

- Concept: Signed Distance Functions (SDF) and surface extraction
  - Why needed here: Triplanes encode geometry via SDF-like representations, and understanding SDF extraction explains why high-frequency artifacts cause mesh roughness.
  - Quick check question: How does SDF smoothness affect the quality of meshes extracted via Marching Cubes or FlexiCubes?

- Concept: Multi-view consistency and 3D reconstruction
  - Why needed here: The root cause of artifacts is inconsistency across generated multi-view images; knowing how this propagates into 3D representations is essential.
  - Quick check question: Why might a diffusion model produce inconsistent local features across views even if global consistency is maintained?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input image → Multi-view diffusion model → Orthographic images
  - Orthographic images → Triplane decoder → Triplane feature maps
  - Triplane features → (a) Filtered via bilateral filter (Freeplane) → SDF/weight/deformation MLPs → FlexiCubes → Mesh geometry
  - Triplane features → (b) Unfiltered → Color MLP → Texture mapping
  - (a) and (b) outputs combined → Final textured mesh

- Critical path:
  1. Multi-view diffusion generation
  2. Triplane decoding
  3. Bilateral filtering (Freeplane)
  4. SDF prediction from filtered triplanes
  5. Texture prediction from unfiltered triplanes
  6. FlexiCubes rendering

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Kernel size vs. detail loss: Larger kernels smooth more but may erase fine geometry.
  - Filter type vs. edge preservation: Bilateral filtering better preserves boundaries than Gaussian blur.
  - Texture/geometry separation vs. coupling: Decoupling can improve quality but risks losing correlated cues.

- Failure signatures:
  - Mesh becomes overly smooth with no fine details → kernel size too large.
  - Mesh retains artifacts → bilateral filter insufficient or kernel size too small.
  - Texture loses sharpness → using filtered triplanes for color mapping.
  - Artifacts appear as large connected regions → high-frequency conflicts are not local.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run CRM/InstantMesh with and without Freeplane on Google Scanned Objects; compare Chamfer distance and NCS.
  2. Vary bilateral filter kernel size (3, 5, 7, 9) and measure impact on mesh smoothness vs. detail loss.
  3. Replace bilateral filter with Gaussian blur; evaluate whether edge preservation degrades.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the choice of kernel size in the bilateral filter affect the balance between mesh smoothness and geometric detail preservation across different triplane resolutions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "The kernel size is correlated to the resolution of triplanes" and larger kernels result in smoother surfaces but can cause loss of geometric details.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides empirical results for specific kernel sizes (3 and 9) but doesn't systematically explore the relationship between triplane resolution and optimal kernel size.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study varying both triplane resolutions and kernel sizes, with quantitative metrics showing the trade-off curve between smoothness and detail preservation.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the Freeplane approach be generalized to work with other 3D representations beyond triplanes, such as voxels or point clouds?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses specifically on triplanes and mentions "existing triplane-based feed-forward models" but doesn't explore other representations.
- Why unresolved: The underlying principle of filtering high-frequency artifacts could potentially apply to other representations, but the specific implementation details may differ significantly.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying the Freeplane concept to other 3D representations, with quantitative comparisons to the triplane-based approach.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the theoretical relationship between the high-frequency artifacts in triplanes and the multi-view inconsistency in the input images?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "inconsistent multi-view images inherently introduce high-frequency artifacts into the triplanes" but doesn't provide a detailed theoretical analysis.
- Why unresolved: While the empirical correlation is demonstrated, the paper doesn't explain the mechanism by which inconsistencies in different views manifest as specific high-frequency patterns in the triplanes.
- What evidence would resolve it: A mathematical analysis connecting the properties of inconsistent multi-view images to the frequency domain characteristics of the resulting triplanes, potentially including controlled experiments with synthetic inconsistencies.

## Limitations
- The paper's claims hinge on the assumption that triplane artifacts are predominantly high-frequency and localized, yet the evidence is largely qualitative.
- The ablation on kernel sizes is minimal (only 3 and 9), and no systematic sweep across a broader range is provided.
- The method is evaluated only on synthetic Google Scanned Objects, with no real-world multi-view inconsistency tests.

## Confidence

- **High**: The core observation that inconsistent multi-view images introduce high-frequency artifacts in triplanes is well-supported by the qualitative evidence and aligns with known issues in diffusion-based 3D reconstruction.
- **Medium**: The bilateral filtering mechanism for artifact removal is theoretically sound and supported by the provided evidence, but the effectiveness depends heavily on kernel size and artifact characteristics, which are not thoroughly explored.
- **Low**: The claim that combining filtered and unfiltered triplanes decouples texture and geometry for optimal quality is asserted but lacks rigorous ablation or comparative studies to confirm its superiority over alternatives.

## Next Checks

1. Perform a systematic ablation study across a wider range of bilateral filter kernel sizes (e.g., 3, 5, 7, 9, 11) to identify the optimal trade-off between artifact removal and geometric detail preservation.
2. Test Freeplane on real-world multi-view datasets with known inconsistencies to validate its robustness beyond synthetic scenes.
3. Compare the performance of Freeplane against other artifact removal methods (e.g., Gaussian blur, median filtering) to establish its relative effectiveness.
