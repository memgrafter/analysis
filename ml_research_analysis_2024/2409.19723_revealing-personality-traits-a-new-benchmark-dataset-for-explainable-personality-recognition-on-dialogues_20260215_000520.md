# Revealing Personality Traits: A New Benchmark Dataset for Explainable Personality Recognition on Dialogues

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.19723
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19723
- Authors: Lei Sun; Jinming Zhao; Qin Jin

- Primary result: Introduces Chain-of-Personality-Evidence (CoPE) framework and PersonalityEvd dataset for explainable personality recognition on dialogues

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Chain-of-Personality-Evidence (CoPE), a novel framework for explainable personality recognition from dialogues based on personality theories suggesting traits emerge from stable patterns of short-term personality states. The framework decomposes personality recognition into two sequential tasks: first identifying personality states from specific dialogue contexts, then aggregating these states across multiple dialogues to infer stable personality traits. The authors construct PersonalityEvd, a high-quality dataset with 72 speakers and 2000 dialogues annotated with personality state and trait labels plus reasoning evidence. Experiments with large language models show these tasks are highly challenging, with performance far below human level, highlighting the difficulty of explainable personality recognition and providing a benchmark for future research.

## Method Summary
The Chain-of-Personality-Evidence (CoPE) framework is based on the psychological theory that personality traits emerge from stable patterns of short-term personality states. The method decomposes personality recognition into two tasks: Evidence grounded Personality State Recognition (EPR-S) and Evidence grounded Personality Trait Recognition (EPR-T). EPR-S identifies personality states from specific dialogue contexts, while EPR-T aggregates state predictions across multiple dialogues to infer stable personality traits. The authors construct the PersonalityEvd dataset with 72 speakers and 1,924 dialogues from Chinese TV series, annotated with personality states (using Big Five model) and traits at both dialogue and speaker levels, plus supporting evidence. They fine-tune large language models (GLM-32k, Qwen-32k) using LoRA on these tasks, with the trait recognition task requiring handling long contexts of approximately 30 dialogues per speaker.

## Key Results
- Introducing supporting evidence improves personality recognition performance
- Analyzing state evidence as an intermediate result contributes to trait recognition performance
- Both EPR-S and EPR-T tasks are highly challenging, with model performance far below human level
- Using ground-truth state evidence significantly improves trait recognition compared to predicted evidence

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Personality traits emerge from stable patterns of short-term personality states. The framework decomposes personality recognition into two sequential tasks - first identifying personality states from specific dialogue contexts, then aggregating these states across multiple dialogues to infer stable personality traits. Core assumption: Personality states in specific situations are observable and labelable, and these states form stable patterns that define traits.

### Mechanism 2
Providing evidence improves personality recognition performance. The CoPE framework requires models to generate natural language reasoning for both state and trait predictions, which forces the model to engage in deeper reasoning about the connection between observable behaviors and underlying personality characteristics. Core assumption: The process of generating evidence requires the model to make explicit the implicit reasoning that would otherwise remain hidden in a pure classification task.

### Mechanism 3
The two-stage pipeline (state recognition followed by trait recognition) is more effective than direct trait recognition. State recognition simplifies the complex trait recognition task by breaking it into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks with clearer evidence signals. Core assumption: The intermediate state labels provide useful inductive biases that guide the more complex trait-level reasoning.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Big Five Personality Model
  - Why needed here: The framework is built specifically around this psychological model, which defines personality along five dimensions (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism)
  - Quick check question: What are the five dimensions of the Big Five model and what does each measure?

- Concept: Chain-of-Thought prompting
  - Why needed here: The evidence generation task uses CoT-style reasoning templates to structure the explanation of how dialogue content supports personality judgments
  - Quick check question: How does CoT prompting differ from direct answer generation in terms of model behavior and output structure?

- Concept: Long context handling in LLMs
  - Why needed here: The trait recognition task requires analyzing personality across ~30 dialogues per speaker, necessitating models that can handle long input contexts
  - Quick check question: What are the main challenges of processing long context windows in transformer-based models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Dataset construction → State annotation → Trait annotation → EPR-S task → EPR-T task → Evaluation pipeline
- Critical path: Data annotation (state and trait evidence) → Model fine-tuning on EPR-S → Model fine-tuning on EPR-T → Human evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: High-quality annotations require significant human effort but enable more meaningful evaluation; two-stage pipeline increases complexity but improves reasoning
- Failure signatures: Low state recognition accuracy → poor trait recognition performance; inconsistent annotations across annotators → evaluation noise
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Fine-tune baseline LLM on EPR-S task only (dialogue → state label + evidence)
  2. Fine-tune baseline LLM on EPR-T task only (multiple dialogues → trait label + evidence)
  3. Implement two-stage pipeline: EPR-S predictions as input to EPR-T model

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What specific aspects of the Chain-of-Personality-Evidence framework contribute most to improving personality recognition accuracy? The paper presents a framework and shows improvements but does not isolate which specific components (e.g., the chain structure, evidence generation, intermediate reasoning steps) are responsible for performance gains.

### Open Question 2
How does the quality and comprehensiveness of personality evidence affect the accuracy of personality trait recognition? The paper shows that using ground-truth state evidence significantly improves trait recognition compared to predicted evidence, suggesting evidence quality matters, but does not quantify this relationship.

### Open Question 3
Can the Chain-of-Personality-Evidence framework be effectively adapted to languages other than Chinese, and what modifications would be necessary? The paper acknowledges the dataset is in Chinese and mentions the translated English version, but does not test the framework on non-Chinese data or provide guidelines for cross-linguistic adaptation.

## Limitations

- Dataset size (72 speakers, 1,924 dialogues) may be insufficient for robust training and evaluation of large language models
- Reliance on GPT-4 for initial personality state annotations introduces potential bias despite human validation
- Evaluation metrics for natural language evidence quality may not fully capture semantic correctness and relevance of explanations

## Confidence

- High: Dataset construction methodology and annotation process are well-documented and follow established practices for personality annotation
- Medium: Claim that providing evidence improves personality recognition performance is supported by experimental results but may be influenced by specific evaluation setup
- Low: Scalability of the approach to larger, more diverse datasets and generalizability to personality recognition in non-dialogue contexts remain untested

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset Size Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically evaluate model performance as a function of training data size to determine minimum viable dataset size for each task and identify potential overfitting or underfitting patterns.

2. **Cross-Annotation Reliability Test**: Conduct a second round of human annotation on a subset of the dataset by different annotators to measure inter-rater reliability and assess consistency of personality state and trait labels.

3. **Evidence Quality Validation**: Design a targeted evaluation protocol where human judges assess whether generated evidence actually supports personality predictions, distinguishing between plausible-sounding explanations and genuinely relevant supporting evidence.
