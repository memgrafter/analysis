# Evaluating Text-to-Image Generative Models: An Empirical Study on Human Image Synthesis

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2403.05125
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05125
- **Authors**: Muxi Chen; Yi Liu; Jian Yi; Changran Xu; Qiuxia Lai; Hongliang Wang; Tsung-Yi Ho; Qiang Xu
- **Reference count**: 36
- **Primary result**: Comprehensive evaluation framework for T2I models focusing on human image synthesis, revealing significant fairness biases and varying performance across models

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework for text-to-image generative models, specifically focusing on human image synthesis. The framework categorizes evaluations into image quality (aesthetics and realism) and text conditions (concept coverage and fairness). The authors propose novel metrics including a CLIP-based aesthetic score prediction model (CAN) and a dataset annotated with defective areas in generated human images. When applied to models like SDXL, SD2.1, SD1.5, and Midjourney, the framework demonstrates alignment with human assessments while revealing significant fairness biases across gender, race, and age dimensions.

## Method Summary
The evaluation framework employs a CLIP-based aesthetic score prediction model (CAN) trained on the AVA dataset, incorporating style and generic aesthetic modules with distortion prediction. For realism assessment, the authors create a novel dataset of defective human images, annotating defective areas component-wise (face, body parts) and using a ViT-based defect classification model. Concept coverage is evaluated using VQA-based metrics (covclosed, covopen) with ChatGPT for semantic clustering and semantic entropy calculation for fairness analysis across gender, race, and age. The framework is validated through human evaluation and applied to multiple T2I models including SDXL, SD2.1, SD1.5, and Midjourney.

## Key Results
- Midjourney outperforms other models in aesthetic quality while SDXL shows superior concept coverage
- Significant fairness biases exist across all evaluated models, with fairness decreasing in many cases as image quality improves
- The proposed metrics align well with human assessments, validating the framework's effectiveness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by decomposing the complex task of T2I model evaluation into measurable components: aesthetic quality through CLIP-based scoring, realism through defect detection in human images, concept coverage through semantic analysis of generated content, and fairness through bias detection across demographic attributes. This multi-dimensional approach captures both the visual quality and the ethical implications of T2I generation, providing a more complete assessment than single-metric evaluations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Aesthetic scoring with CLIP**: Understanding how CLIP embeddings can be used to predict aesthetic scores by training on human-rated datasets like AVA. Why needed: To provide automated, consistent aesthetic evaluation that correlates with human judgment.
- **Defect detection in human images**: Learning to identify and classify defective areas in generated human images using component-wise annotation. Why needed: To quantify the realism and quality of human depictions in T2I outputs.
- **Semantic clustering with ChatGPT**: Using large language models to group semantically similar concepts for coverage evaluation. Why needed: To handle the semantic complexity of evaluating whether generated images capture intended concepts.
- **Semantic entropy for fairness**: Calculating information entropy across gender, race, and age categories to detect bias. Why needed: To quantify fairness issues that might be invisible in aggregate quality metrics.
- **VQA-based concept coverage**: Applying Visual Question Answering techniques to evaluate whether generated images contain intended concepts. Why needed: To move beyond binary presence/absence to nuanced coverage assessment.
- **Component-wise evaluation**: Breaking down human image quality into specific parts (face, body, etc.) for detailed analysis. Why needed: To identify specific failure modes rather than just overall quality scores.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
AVA dataset -> CAN model (CLIP-based aesthetic scoring) -> Aesthetic quality assessment
Generated images + annotated defects -> ViT defect classifier -> Realism assessment
Prompts + generated images -> ChatGPT semantic clustering -> Concept coverage metrics
Generated images + prompts -> Semantic entropy calculation -> Fairness analysis

### Critical Path
Prompt generation → Image generation → Aesthetic scoring (CAN) → Defect detection → Concept coverage analysis → Fairness evaluation → Human validation

### Design Tradeoffs
- Automated metrics vs. human evaluation: The framework prioritizes scalable automated metrics while validating against human judgment, trading some nuance for reproducibility
- Component-wise vs. holistic defect detection: Granular defect analysis provides detailed insights but increases annotation complexity
- ChatGPT-based clustering vs. traditional NLP: Leverages advanced semantic understanding but introduces API dependency and potential variability

### Failure Signatures
- CAN model underperformance: If aesthetic scores don't correlate with human judgments, likely due to insufficient training data diversity or poor generalization
- Defect detection inconsistency: If defect identification varies significantly across annotators, suggests unclear defect definitions or subjective judgment requirements
- Semantic entropy instability: If fairness metrics fluctuate across runs, indicates sensitivity to clustering parameters or prompt variations

### First Experiments
1. Train CAN model on AVA dataset and validate correlation with human aesthetic scores on a held-out test set
2. Generate a small set of human images with diverse prompts and manually annotate defective areas to test annotation protocols
3. Apply semantic clustering to a subset of prompts and evaluate consistency of concept grouping across multiple runs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can the defect identification model be improved to achieve higher accuracy and better generalization across different T2I models?
- How can concept coverage evaluation be extended to handle prompts containing multiple interrelated concepts simultaneously?
- What is the relationship between image quality improvements and fairness in T2I generative models?

## Limitations
- The framework relies heavily on ChatGPT-based semantic clustering, which may introduce consistency and reproducibility issues
- Fairness analysis depends on prompt selection and clustering quality, making results somewhat exploratory
- Defect identification model achieves only 86-88% accuracy, falling short of perfect performance

## Confidence
- **Aesthetic metrics**: High - Strong correlation with human assessments demonstrated
- **Defect detection**: Medium-High - Good performance but room for improvement in accuracy
- **Fairness analysis**: Medium - Depends heavily on semantic clustering quality and prompt selection

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce semantic clustering results by testing ChatGPT-based clustering approach with different prompts and evaluating consistency of semantic entropy calculations across multiple runs
2. Apply fairness metrics to additional T2I models beyond SDXL, SD2.1, SD1.5, and Midjourney to assess generalizability of bias findings
3. Conduct independent human assessments of the defective area annotations to verify inter-rater reliability and identify potential systematic biases in the annotation process
