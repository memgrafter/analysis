# Ontology Completion with Natural Language Inference and Natural Language Inference and Concept Embeddings: An Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.17216
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17216
- Reference count: 38
- Primary result: NLI-based and concept embedding-based approaches both effective for ontology completion, with hybrid strategies achieving best results

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of ontology completion using two complementary approaches: NLI-based methods that leverage language models to infer missing rules, and concept embedding-based methods that utilize graph neural networks with pre-trained concept embeddings. The authors introduce a new benchmark with manually validated hard negatives and compare multiple models across seven ontologies. Their findings show that both approaches have distinct strengths, with hybrid strategies combining both methods achieving superior performance. The study establishes new baselines and provides insights into the complementary nature of different ontology completion techniques.

## Method Summary
The paper analyzes two complementary approaches for ontology completion: NLI-based methods that rely on language models to infer missing rules from natural language descriptions, and concept embedding-based methods that use graph neural networks with pre-trained concept embeddings to capture semantic relationships. The authors introduce a new benchmark with manually validated hard negatives across seven ontologies and evaluate multiple models including fine-tuned RoBERTa-large for NLI and GCN with unary templates for concept embeddings. They also explore hybrid strategies that combine both approaches to leverage their complementary strengths.

## Key Results
- GCN with unary templates combined with Llama2-13B achieved the best average F1 score of 81.0%
- Fine-tuned RoBERTa-large outperformed all other NLI-based approaches in the task
- Hybrid strategies that combine NLI and concept embedding methods achieved superior results compared to either approach alone

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of combining NLI and concept embedding approaches stems from their complementary nature. NLI methods excel at capturing semantic relationships through natural language understanding, while concept embedding methods effectively model structural relationships in the ontology graph. The GCN with unary templates approach works well because it can learn meaningful representations from the ontology structure while the pre-trained concept embeddings provide semantic grounding. Fine-tuned RoBERTa-large performs strongly because it can leverage its pre-trained language understanding capabilities while being adapted to the specific task of ontology rule inference. The hybrid approach benefits from both semantic and structural information, leading to more robust predictions.

## Foundational Learning
- Description Logic (DL) formalism: The ontology language used for representing knowledge, essential for understanding the task domain and evaluation criteria. Quick check: Verify that the ontology uses DL constructs like subclass relationships and property restrictions.
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): Neural network architectures designed to operate on graph-structured data, crucial for capturing relationships in ontology structures. Quick check: Ensure the graph representation preserves the hierarchical nature of ontologies.
- Natural Language Inference (NLI): The task of determining logical relationships between text pairs, fundamental for the NLI-based approach. Quick check: Validate that the NLI model can correctly identify entailment relationships between ontology statements.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Pre-trained concept embeddings -> Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) -> Rule Classification
Critical path: Input ontology concepts -> Concept embedding lookup -> GCN processing -> Rule prediction
Design tradeoffs: NLI methods trade structural information for semantic understanding, while concept embedding methods trade language flexibility for graph-based reasoning
Failure signatures: NLI methods may fail on highly technical domain-specific concepts; concept embedding methods may struggle with rare concepts not well-represented in pre-trained embeddings
First experiments:
1. Test GCN with unary templates on a simple ontology to verify basic functionality
2. Evaluate fine-tuned RoBERTa-large on a small set of manually crafted NLI examples
3. Compare the performance of NLI and concept embedding approaches on a subset of the benchmark to identify their respective strengths and weaknesses

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The evaluation focuses exclusively on ontologies in Description Logic (DL) formalism, particularly in the EL++ fragment, which may not generalize to other ontology formalisms or more expressive logics
- The benchmark covers seven ontologies, which provides reasonable diversity but may not capture all edge cases and challenges in real-world ontology completion tasks
- The study does not fully explore the theoretical reasons for the complementary strengths of NLI and concept embedding approaches

## Confidence
High confidence: The relative performance rankings between different model architectures (GCN with unary templates outperforming other embedding-based approaches, fine-tuned RoBERTa-large outperforming other NLI-based approaches)
Medium confidence: The absolute performance numbers (F1 scores), as these depend heavily on the specific benchmark construction and evaluation methodology
Medium confidence: The conclusion that hybrid approaches work best, as this is demonstrated but the underlying reasons are not fully explored

## Next Checks
1. Test the best-performing models (GCN with unary templates and Llama2-13B) on additional ontologies outside the EL++ fragment to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of concept embeddings versus structural information in the GCN models
3. Evaluate whether the manually validated hard negatives in the benchmark systematically favor certain model types over others, potentially biasing the results
