# Towards Environmentally Equitable AI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.16539
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16539
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: Proposed eGLB algorithm reduces peak-to-average ratio of regional environmental costs (water/carbon footprint) compared to traditional GLB approaches, while keeping total energy costs reasonably low.

## Executive Summary
This paper advocates environmental equity as a priority for future AI systems, addressing the problem of uneven environmental impacts across regions. The authors propose leveraging geographical load balancing (GLB) algorithms that incorporate an equity regularizer to fairly redistribute AI workloads and their associated environmental costs (e.g., water and carbon footprint) across data centers worldwide. The approach aims to prevent certain regions from bearing disproportionate environmental burdens while maintaining cost efficiency. The paper also identifies key algorithmic challenges due to incomplete future information and proposes future directions for research in this area.

## Method Summary
The core method is an equity-aware geographical load balancing (eGLB) algorithm that redistributes AI workloads to minimize both total energy cost and regional environmental inequity. The algorithm uses an objective function that combines traditional cost minimization with an equity regularizer term that penalizes the maximum regional environmental footprint. This approach is tested through simulation using BLOOM model inference traces across 10 global data centers, comparing performance against baseline GLB algorithms. The paper also discusses challenges in implementing such algorithms in practice due to incomplete future information and proposes balancing traditional competitive algorithms with ML-based optimizers.

## Key Results
- eGLB reduces peak-to-average ratio (PAR) of regional environmental costs compared to traditional GLB approaches
- The algorithm maintains reasonable total energy costs while improving environmental equity
- Simulation results demonstrate effectiveness using BLOOM model inference traces across 10 global data centers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Using an equity regularizer in the objective function redistributes AI workloads so that no single region bears a disproportionately high environmental cost.
- Mechanism: The objective `∑regions ∑time slots cost(r,t) + λ·max_region ∑time slots footprint(r,t)` explicitly penalizes the maximum regional footprint. Minimizing this pushes workload distribution toward more balanced regional impacts while still reducing total cost.
- Core assumption: Regional environmental footprints can be accurately estimated per workload unit and are additive over time.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The paper advocates environmental equity via equity-aware geographical load balancing to fairly redistribute environmental cost across regions.
  - [section 2.1] The eGLB algorithm reduces peak-to-average ratio of regional environmental costs compared to traditional GLB.
  - [corpus] Related work (e.g., "Towards Socially and Environmentally Responsible AI") supports the feasibility of fairness-aware workload distribution.
- Break condition: If footprint estimates are inaccurate or highly volatile, the equity term may misguide load balancing, potentially worsening inequity.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Spatial workload flexibility in AI systems allows routing tasks to lower-impact regions without sacrificing latency or accuracy.
- Mechanism: AI inference tasks can be distributed across globally deployed data centers; the algorithm exploits this flexibility to place workloads in regions with lower water or carbon footprint, guided by the equity regularizer.
- Core assumption: Latency and accuracy constraints are met even when tasks are routed to non-local data centers.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.1] The paper lists "Spatial: AI training and inference tasks can be distributed across multiple data centers with minimal impact on latency."
  - [abstract] Emphasizes geographical load balancing as a lever to redistribute environmental cost.
  - [corpus] The corpus neighbor "Radio Resource Management and Path Planning in Intelligent Transportation Systems via Reinforcement Learning for Environmental Sustainability" implies RL can exploit spatial flexibility for sustainability goals.
- Break condition: If network latency or regulatory restrictions prevent global distribution, the mechanism fails.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Online learning-augmented algorithms can balance environmental equity and performance in the absence of complete future information.
- Mechanism: By combining traditional competitive algorithms (worst-case robustness) with ML-based optimizers (average-case improvement), the system can make adaptive routing decisions that reduce peak regional footprint while keeping total cost low.
- Core assumption: Historical data and predictions are sufficiently accurate to inform online decisions without overfitting.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.2] Discusses challenges of unknown future information and proposes balancing competitive algorithms with ML-based optimizers.
  - [abstract] Mentions algorithmic challenges due to incomplete future information and proposes future directions.
  - [corpus] The corpus neighbor "Federated Learning in Mobile Networks" suggests ML can exploit statistical information for resource allocation, supporting this mechanism.
- Break condition: If predictions are consistently poor or distributional shifts are large, the learning component may degrade performance and equity outcomes.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Minimax fairness and equity regularizers
  - Why needed here: The core of the paper's contribution is framing environmental equity as a minimax problem, penalizing the maximum regional footprint to avoid disproportionate burden.
  - Quick check question: What does the term `max_region ∑time slots footprint(r,t)` accomplish in the objective function?

- Concept: Geographical load balancing (GLB) in distributed systems
  - Why needed here: GLB is the operational mechanism by which the paper proposes to redistribute workloads; understanding its constraints (latency, cost, capacity) is essential to evaluate the approach.
  - Quick check question: Why does minimizing total cost alone not guarantee environmental equity?

- Concept: Online optimization under uncertainty
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly addresses incomplete future information and proposes learning-augmented online algorithms; understanding this area is critical to grasp the algorithmic challenges and solutions.
  - Quick check question: How does the lack of complete future information affect the design of equitable load balancing algorithms?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Workload router -> Footprint estimator -> GLB optimizer -> Data center pool -> Monitoring system

- Critical path:
  1. Inference request arrives.
  2. Footprint estimator queries current regional metrics.
  3. GLB optimizer evaluates candidate routing options using equity-aware objective.
  4. Router dispatches request to selected data center.
  5. Monitoring system logs actual footprint and cost for learning updates.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. latency: More precise footprint estimates improve equity but may increase decision time.
  - Cost vs. equity: Higher λ in the objective improves equity but may increase total cost.
  - Centralization vs. scalability: A global optimizer can better balance equity but may become a bottleneck; decentralized approaches trade some equity for scalability.

- Failure signatures:
  - Inequity spikes: If regional footprint estimates are stale or incorrect, certain regions may see sudden cost increases.
  - Cost overruns: Over-penalizing equity may cause routing to expensive data centers, raising total cost.
  - System slowdown: Overly complex optimization or data fetching may increase request latency.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Simulate eGLB with synthetic workload traces and known footprints; verify reduction in peak-to-average ratio versus baseline GLB.
  2. Test online eGLB with partial future information and noisy footprint estimates; measure robustness and equity outcomes.
  3. Evaluate sensitivity to λ (equity weight) by sweeping across values and recording tradeoffs between total cost and peak regional footprint.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can environmental equity-aware GLB algorithms be made robust to imperfect future predictions of workload patterns and regional environmental conditions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the challenge of algorithmic design due to incomplete future information and the untrusted nature of predictions.
- Why unresolved: Traditional online competitive algorithms are conservative for worst-case scenarios, while ML-based approaches lack robustness to distributional shifts and adversarial inputs. Balancing these approaches for real-time GLB is an open problem.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical evaluation of GLB algorithms under various prediction error scenarios, showing how different prediction accuracy levels affect environmental equity and total cost metrics compared to ground truth.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between traditional competitive algorithms and ML-based optimizers for online environmental equity-aware GLB?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies challenges in balancing traditional competitive algorithms and ML-based optimizers for online GLB.
- Why unresolved: There is a fundamental tension between the robustness of traditional algorithms and the average-case performance of ML-based approaches, requiring new learning-augmented online algorithms.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of different hybrid algorithm approaches under various workload distributions and grid conditions, measuring both environmental equity (PAR metrics) and total cost performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can coordinated scheduling of AI training and inference tasks be designed to fairly distribute overall environmental costs across regions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies this as a future direction, noting that training has temporal flexibility while inference has spatial flexibility.
- Why unresolved: The interaction between training and inference scheduling decisions across multiple regions creates a complex optimization problem that hasn't been explored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Simulation or real-world deployment results showing how coordinated scheduling affects regional environmental cost distribution compared to independent scheduling approaches.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What theoretical foundations are needed to capture the conflicts between traditional performance metrics and environmental equity in planet-scale AI systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper calls for building new theoretical foundations to support environmentally equitable AI design.
- Why unresolved: Existing fair resource allocation theory focuses on CPU/memory fairness, not environmental equity across regions with different grid conditions and water resources.
- What evidence would resolve it: New mathematical frameworks or algorithms that provably guarantee both environmental equity and other performance metrics under realistic constraints.

## Limitations
- The eGLB algorithm is primarily evaluated through simulation using BLOOM model inference traces; real-world validation with live AI workloads and actual environmental data is not provided.
- The sensitivity and robustness of the equity regularizer to inaccurate or volatile footprint estimates is not fully characterized.
- The scalability and generalizability of the approach to other AI workloads (e.g., training, edge inference) or to a larger number of data centers is not demonstrated.

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the theoretical framing of environmental inequity and the justification for an equity-aware load balancing approach.
- **Medium confidence** in the simulation results showing eGLB reduces PAR metrics compared to baseline GLB algorithms, but with the caveat that real-world factors may affect performance.
- **Medium confidence** in the proposed algorithmic solutions (e.g., online learning-augmented eGLB), but with uncertainty about their robustness and practicality without further empirical validation.

## Next Checks
1. Validate eGLB with live AI workloads and actual environmental footprint data across multiple data centers, measuring both equity and total cost outcomes under realistic conditions (network delays, regulatory constraints, data center failures).
2. Conduct sensitivity analysis on the equity regularizer by introducing noise or volatility into footprint estimates and measuring the algorithm's robustness to these perturbations.
3. Test the scalability and generalizability of eGLB to other AI workloads (e.g., training, edge inference) and a larger number of data centers, comparing performance to baseline GLB algorithms in terms of both equity and total cost.
