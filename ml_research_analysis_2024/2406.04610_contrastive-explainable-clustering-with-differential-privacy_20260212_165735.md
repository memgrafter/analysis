# Contrastive Explainable Clustering with Differential Privacy

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.04610
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04610
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Differentially private contrastive explanations achieve essentially the same utility bounds as non-private explanations for k-means and k-median clustering

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to explainable AI that integrates differential privacy with contrastive explanations for clustering algorithms, specifically focusing on k-median and k-means problems. The core method calculates contrastive explanations as the utility difference between the original clustering and a modified clustering with a centroid fixed at a specific data point, providing personalized insights into centroid placement. The key contribution is demonstrating that these differentially private explanations achieve essentially the same utility bounds as non-private explanations, with rigorous approximation factor analysis. Experiments across various datasets show that the approach offers meaningful, privacy-preserving, and individually relevant explanations without significantly compromising clustering utility.

## Method Summary
The method combines differential privacy with contrastive explanations by first constructing a private coreset using dimension reduction and Ghazi et al.'s technique, then applying non-private clustering algorithms to this coreset. For each data point, the algorithm computes contrastive explanations by fixing that point as a centroid and recalculating the clustering cost. The dimension reduction uses Johnson-Lindenstrauss transforms to reduce computational complexity, while the private coreset preserves clustering costs within bounded factors. The approach maintains privacy guarantees through careful budget allocation between coreset construction and dimension reversal, ensuring that post-processing steps do not incur additional privacy costs.

## Key Results
- Private explanations achieve the same utility bounds as non-private explanations (8-approximation for k-median, 25+γ for k-means)
- Performance remains stable across different privacy budgets (ϵ) and dimensional reductions
- The method provides meaningful, privacy-preserving explanations without significant utility loss
- Consistent performance across various real-world datasets (Heart Disease, Breast Cancer, Charlottesville, Albemarle)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The algorithm achieves the same utility bounds for private explanations as for private clustering by leveraging a differentially private coreset.
- Mechanism: The algorithm first applies dimension reduction to make the coreset computation tractable, then constructs a private coreset using Ghazi et al.'s method with privacy budget ϵ/2. This coreset preserves the clustering cost within a (1+0.1α) factor plus an additive term. Since the coreset is already private, any non-private clustering algorithm can be applied to it without additional privacy loss (post-processing property).
- Core assumption: The private coreset sufficiently approximates the original data's clustering cost, and the approximation factor of the non-private clustering algorithm on the coreset transfers to the original space after dimension reversal.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our key contribution is demonstrating that these differentially private explanations achieve essentially the same utility bounds as non-private explanations."
  - [section]: "We use the private coreset technique of Ghazi et al. [2020], which is an intermediate private data structure that preserves similar clustering costs as the original data."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence about coreset-based approaches for private explanations.
- Break condition: If the coreset approximation factor is too loose or the dimension reduction introduces excessive distortion, the utility bounds cannot be preserved.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The fixed-centroid clustering algorithms maintain the same approximation factors as their standard counterparts (8 for k-median, 25+γ for k-means).
- Mechanism: For k-median, the algorithm modifies Charikar et al.'s LP relaxation by adding a constraint that fixes one center, then follows the same grouping and rounding steps. For k-means, the algorithm adapts Kanungo et al.'s single-swap heuristic by preventing swaps of the fixed center while maintaining the 1-stable property.
- Core assumption: The modifications to fix one centroid do not introduce additional approximation factors beyond the original algorithms.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "We then present modifications to well-known k-median and k-means algorithms, adapting them for fixed-centroid clustering scenarios. We will then demonstrate that these modified algorithms achieve the same tight approximation factors."
  - [section]: "We have developed a non-private fixed centroid clustering algorithm, which we callNonPrivateApproxFC. This algorithm is an adaptation of Charikar et al. [1999]. In the following section, we will prove that our modified algorithm, which works with a fixed centroid (referred to as z), achieves an 8-approximation factor."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence about fixed-centroid clustering approximation factors.
- Break condition: If the fixed-centroid constraint fundamentally changes the problem structure such that the original approximation analysis no longer applies.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The dimension reduction and reversal process preserves the cost relationship between original and reduced spaces within a bounded factor.
- Mechanism: The algorithm uses Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma-based dimension reduction to project data to logarithmic dimensions, then scales the clustering cost by a factor of (log(n/β)/0.01)^(p/2) to reverse the dimension effect. The reversal factor is derived from Makarychev et al.'s analysis of JL transform performance for k-means and k-medians.
- Core assumption: The dimension reduction preserves pairwise distances within the required bounds, and the cost scaling factor accurately compensates for the dimensional transformation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "By multiplying by RevertDimV alue= (log(n/β)/0.01)^p/2 we scale the clustering cost back to the original dimension."
  - [section]: "This reversal is necessary because while we computed costs in reduced dimensions for efficiency, we need the final cost in the original dimensions for accuracy."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence about cost scaling in dimension reduction for clustering.
- Break condition: If the dimension reduction introduces too much distortion or the cost scaling factor is inaccurate for the specific clustering objective.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Differential Privacy and its composition properties
  - Why needed here: The entire approach relies on maintaining differential privacy while providing explanations to each agent, requiring understanding of how privacy budgets compose and how post-processing affects privacy guarantees.
  - Quick check question: If a mechanism is (ϵ,δ)-DP and you apply a post-processing function to its output, what is the privacy guarantee of the resulting mechanism?

- Concept: Coreset construction and approximation guarantees
  - Why needed here: The private coreset is the key intermediate data structure that enables both private clustering and private explanations, requiring understanding of how coresets approximate original data clustering costs.
  - Quick check question: What property must a (p,k,γ,t)-coreset satisfy to guarantee that clustering costs on the coreset approximate clustering costs on the original data?

- Concept: Approximation algorithms for k-median and k-means
  - Why needed here: The fixed-centroid versions of these algorithms must maintain the same approximation factors as their standard versions, requiring deep understanding of the original algorithms' approximation analyses.
  - Quick check question: What is the key property of a 1-stable set in the context of the k-means single-swap heuristic, and why is it important for approximation guarantees?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing -> Private coreset construction -> Non-private clustering -> Fixed-centroid clustering -> Cost scaling and explanation generation
- Critical path:
  1. Input data normalization and dimension reduction
  2. Private coreset construction (consumes ϵ/2)
  3. Non-private clustering on coreset (no privacy cost)
  4. Dimension reversal for centroids (consumes ϵ/2)
  5. Fixed-centroid clustering for each agent's explanation
  6. Cost scaling and explanation output
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Higher dimension reduction leads to faster computation but potentially looser approximation
  - Larger coreset size improves approximation but increases computation
  - More aggressive privacy budget allocation to coreset vs. dimension reversal affects utility
  - Fixed-centroid clustering must balance explanation quality with computational feasibility
- Failure signatures:
  - If private coreset approximation is too loose: High clustering costs, poor explanations
  - If dimension reduction is too aggressive: Distorted distances, invalid clustering
  - If privacy budget is misallocated: Either privacy violations or poor utility
  - If fixed-centroid algorithm fails to maintain approximation: Invalid explanations
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run the full pipeline on a small synthetic dataset with known optimal clustering to verify approximation bounds
  2. Test dimension reduction with varying target dimensions to find the sweet spot between accuracy and efficiency
  3. Validate privacy composition by checking that total privacy cost equals claimed ϵ budget

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper mentions that the approach can be adapted to other clustering algorithms but does not explore this extension, and does not provide experimental results or theoretical analysis for clustering methods other than k-means and k-median.

## Limitations
- The approach requires careful privacy budget allocation and may not scale well to extremely high-dimensional data
- Performance is sensitive to the quality of private coreset construction and dimension reduction
- The method assumes existing approximation analyses transfer to fixed-centroid scenarios without rigorous validation
- Limited exploration of alternative dimension reduction techniques and their impact on explanation quality

## Confidence
- Utility preservation claim: High confidence (based on rigorous approximation analysis)
- Fixed-centroid approximation factors: Medium confidence (proofs rely on extending existing analyses)
- Dimension reduction and reversal mechanism: Medium-Low confidence (limited empirical validation)

## Next Checks
1. Implement the full pipeline on synthetic datasets with known optimal solutions to empirically verify the claimed approximation bounds for private explanations
2. Conduct sensitivity analysis by varying the coreset size and dimension reduction parameters to identify their impact on utility bounds and computational efficiency
3. Perform controlled experiments to test the robustness of the fixed-centroid clustering algorithms across different data distributions and cluster configurations, specifically checking if the 8-approximation for k-median and 25+γ for k-means are maintained under the fixed-centroid constraint
