# Pruning neural network models for gene regulatory dynamics using data and domain knowledge

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.04805
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04805
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: DASH achieves up to 94.6% sparsity while maintaining 90.7% balanced accuracy in recovering gene regulatory networks

## Executive Summary
DASH introduces a novel domain-informed pruning approach that combines data-driven neural network weights with prior biological knowledge to improve interpretability and structure learning in gene regulatory network modeling. By balancing learned parameters with motif maps and protein-protein interactions, DASH guides iterative pruning to yield sparse, biologically meaningful architectures. The method significantly outperforms standard pruning approaches on both synthetic and real-world gene expression data, achieving superior sparsity while maintaining high accuracy in recovering ground-truth regulatory networks.

## Method Summary
DASH extends iterative magnitude pruning by incorporating domain-specific structural priors into the pruning score computation. The method computes non-negative pruning scores that combine absolute weight values with a prior knowledge matrix, weighted by parameter λ. This allows flexible balancing between data-driven and prior-knowledge-driven pruning. DASH is applied as a wrapper around PHOENIX, a Neural ODE model for gene regulatory dynamics, using motif maps and protein-protein interactions as structural priors. The framework automatically finds optimal sparsity levels through iterative pruning guided by validation performance.

## Key Results
- Achieved up to 94.6% sparsity while maintaining 90.7% balanced accuracy in recovering ground-truth regulatory networks
- Outperformed standard pruning methods by identifying disease-relevant pathways in breast cancer and blood differentiation data
- Demonstrated effectiveness across synthetic SIM350 data and real-world datasets including yeast cell cycle and human bone marrow

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
DASH improves pruning performance by balancing data-driven weight magnitude with domain-specific structural priors. During iterative pruning, DASH computes a pruning score Ω that combines the absolute value of learned weights with a prior knowledge matrix P, weighted by λ. This guides pruning toward parameters aligned with known gene interactions.

### Mechanism 2
DASH extends structured pruning beyond neuron/channel groups to reflect task-specific knowledge. Instead of only pruning entire neurons or channels, DASH prunes individual weights based on their alignment with prior biological knowledge, preserving task-relevant sparse structure.

### Mechanism 3
DASH automatically finds an optimal sparsity level aligned with both prior and data. Through iterative pruning with a flexible λ parameter, DASH balances prior knowledge and data-driven learning, stopping when validation performance plateaus at an optimal sparsity.

## Foundational Learning

- **Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and their biological interpretation**
  - Why needed here: The method applies to GRN inference, so understanding biological context is crucial for interpreting results and designing priors
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a gene's expression and its regulatory dynamics?

- **Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs)**
  - Why needed here: PHOENIX, the base model, uses Neural ODEs to model gene expression dynamics; understanding this architecture is key to applying DASH
  - Quick check question: How does a Neural ODE differ from a standard feed-forward neural network in modeling temporal dynamics?

- **Iterative magnitude pruning and its limitations**
  - Why needed here: DASH builds on iterative pruning concepts but improves them; understanding standard approaches helps identify DASH's advantages
  - Quick check question: What is the main limitation of post-hoc magnitude pruning when interpretability is important?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data → PHOENIX training → DASH pruning (iterative) → Prior-informed scoring → Validation → Interpretation
- **Critical path**: Data flows through PHOENIX training, then undergoes DASH pruning with domain-aware scoring, followed by validation and biological interpretation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Flexibility vs. complexity (DASH adds λ parameters but provides more control), Prior quality vs. data reliance (DASH can work with incomplete priors but performance depends on prior accuracy), Interpretability vs. predictive performance (DASH prioritizes sparse, interpretable models which may slightly reduce prediction accuracy)
- **Failure signatures**: Poor validation performance despite high sparsity (prior knowledge may be inaccurate or λ poorly tuned), Very low sparsity with minimal improvement (validation set may be too small or not representative), Inconsistent results across runs (random initialization in early pruning steps may need more stability)
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Apply DASH to PHOENIX on synthetic SIM350 data with 5% noise, compare sparsity and balanced accuracy to IMP
  2. Test DASH with corrupted priors (20%, 40% noise) on SIM350 to assess sensitivity to prior quality
  3. Apply DASH to yeast cell cycle data, validate against ChIP-seq gold standard, analyze pathway enrichment

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does DASH perform when prior knowledge is noisy or incomplete, and what is the optimal trade-off between data-driven and prior-informed pruning? The paper discusses sensitivity analyses with varying levels of prior corruption but does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of performance degradation with incomplete or erroneous priors.

### Open Question 2
Can DASH be extended to architectures beyond fully connected layers, such as convolutional or attention-based models, while maintaining its domain-informed pruning benefits? The paper suggests DASH could theoretically extend to larger networks but focuses on L=2 architectures and gene regulatory dynamics without exploring non-fully connected architectures.

### Open Question 3
What is the computational overhead of DASH compared to standard pruning methods, and how does it scale with network size and dataset complexity? The paper mentions DASH adds <2% runtime overhead but does not provide detailed scaling analysis or comparisons across larger models and datasets.

## Limitations

- Method performance heavily depends on the quality of domain priors, which are not publicly available for all tested datasets
- The λ hyperparameter requires cross-validation, which may be computationally expensive for large networks
- DASH's advantage over general pruning methods is demonstrated primarily on gene regulatory network tasks, with limited testing on other domains

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: DASH achieves significantly higher sparsity (up to 94.6%) than standard pruning while maintaining balanced accuracy above 90%
- **Medium confidence**: The interpretability gains are demonstrated through pathway enrichment analysis, but the biological significance of discovered connections could be more thoroughly validated
- **Medium confidence**: The computational efficiency claim (2% runtime increase) is based on synthetic experiments and may vary with different hardware and implementation details

## Next Checks

1. Test DASH on non-biological datasets to evaluate its generalization beyond gene regulatory networks
2. Conduct ablation studies removing domain priors to quantify their contribution to performance
3. Compare DASH's pathway enrichment results with established biological databases to validate interpretability claims
