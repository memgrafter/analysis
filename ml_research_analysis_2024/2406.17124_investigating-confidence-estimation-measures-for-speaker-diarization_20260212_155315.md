# Investigating Confidence Estimation Measures for Speaker Diarization

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2406.17124
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17124
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: Confidence estimation methods can isolate ~30% of diarization errors within segments with lowest 10% of confidence scores

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates methods for estimating confidence scores at the segment level for speaker diarization systems. The authors propose several methods including cosine similarity score, local confidence score, silhouette score, and spectral clustering score to assign confidence scores to diarization outputs. Experiments across multiple datasets and diarization systems demonstrate that the proposed methods can effectively identify low-confidence segments, with the silhouette score method performing best overall by achieving an average relative reduction of 57% in covered diarization error rate at 80% coverage compared to the baseline spectral clustering method.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes multiple confidence assessment methods for speaker diarization systems. These include cosine similarity score (mean cosine similarity between segment embeddings and speaker centroid), local confidence score (iterative refinement by removing outliers beyond two standard deviations), silhouette score (clustering validation metric comparing embeddings to own and other speaker centroids), and spectral clustering score (using eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix). The methods are evaluated on AMI and DoPaCo datasets using various diarization systems including xVector+SC, ECAPA-TDNN+SC, PyAnnote2.0 (E2E), and DOVER-Lap systems.

## Key Results
- Proposed confidence score methods can isolate approximately 30% of diarization errors within segments with the lowest 10% of confidence scores
- Silhouette score method performs best overall, achieving 57% relative reduction in covered diarization error rate at 80% coverage
- Most overlapping speech segments are assigned low confidence scores, indicating potential limitation for overlap-aware systems
- White-box confidence estimation (using same embedding model as diarization) generally outperforms black-box approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Silhouette score identifies segments that are distant from their own speaker centroid but close to another speaker's centroid
- Mechanism: The silhouette score computes (b(x) - a(x)) / max(a(x), b(x)), where a(x) is the cosine distance to the assigned speaker centroid and b(x) is the cosine distance to the nearest other speaker centroid
- Core assumption: The diarization output contains coherent speaker clusters where most segments are correctly assigned to their true speaker
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] demonstrates that competitive methods isolate ~30% of errors in lowest 10% confidence scores

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Local confidence score improves segment-level confidence by iteratively refining speaker centroids
- Mechanism: Computes initial cosine similarity scores, removes embeddings more than two standard deviations from centroid, recomputes centroids until convergence
- Core assumption: Outliers in speaker clusters significantly degrade centroid accuracy, and iterative refinement can isolate them
- Evidence anchors: [section] describes the iterative outlier removal and centroid re-estimation process

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Cosine similarity score provides a direct measure of how well a segment fits its assigned speaker
- Mechanism: Computes mean cosine similarity between a segment's speaker embeddings and the speaker's centroid
- Core assumption: Speaker embeddings that are close to their assigned centroid are likely correctly diarized
- Evidence anchors: [section] describes the basic confidence computation using cosine similarity

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Speaker embeddings and their role in diarization
  - Why needed here: Confidence scores are computed from speaker embeddings, so understanding their properties is crucial for interpreting confidence assessment results
  - Quick check question: What is the dimensionality of ECAPA-TDNN embeddings typically used in speaker diarization systems?

- Concept: Clustering validation metrics (silhouette score)
  - Why needed here: The silhouette score is a key confidence assessment method that compares segment embeddings to their own and other speaker centroids
  - Quick check question: What range of values does the silhouette score take, and what do extreme values indicate?

- Concept: Coverage vs. cDER tradeoff
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates confidence methods based on their ability to reduce cDER at specific coverage levels, requiring understanding of this tradeoff
  - Quick check question: If confidence scores were random, what relationship would you expect between cDER and overall DER?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: SAD (Speech Activity Detection) → Diarization System → Speaker Embeddings → Confidence Assessment → cDER/Coverage Metrics
- Critical path: SAD → Diarization → Confidence Assessment → cDER/Coverage evaluation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - White-box vs. black-box confidence estimation: White-box uses the same embedding model as diarization, while black-box uses a separate model
  - Coverage threshold selection: Fixed (70%, 90%) vs. global thresholding for optimal data selection
  - Embedding space vs. spectral basis: Methods T3-T5 use embedding space while T2 uses spectral basis

- Failure signatures:
  - Skewed confidence score distributions (as seen with spectral method T2) indicate poor discriminability
  - Low improvement in cDER despite high coverage suggests confidence scores are not informative
  - Systematic underestimation of confidence for overlapping speech indicates model limitations

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement silhouette score confidence assessment and evaluate cDER reduction at 70% and 90% coverage
  2. Compare white-box (same embedding model) vs. black-box (different embedding model) confidence estimation performance
  3. Analyze confidence score distributions to identify potential discriminability issues before evaluating cDER metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the impact of using different embedding models (e.g., ECAPA-TDNN vs. xVector) on the performance of confidence assessment methods in speaker diarization?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares the performance of confidence assessment methods using embeddings generated by ECAPA-TDNN and xVector models
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of the impact of different embedding models on the confidence assessment performance
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments using different embedding models and comparing the performance of confidence assessment methods with each model would provide evidence to resolve this question

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do the proposed confidence assessment methods perform on datasets with varying levels of background noise and overlapping speech?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that speaker diarization systems can misclassify speakers due to background noise and overlapping speech, but does not specifically test the confidence assessment methods on datasets with varying levels of these challenges
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide experimental results on datasets with different levels of background noise and overlapping speech to evaluate the robustness of the proposed methods
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the confidence assessment methods on datasets with controlled variations in background noise and overlapping speech levels would provide evidence to resolve this question

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the proposed confidence assessment methods be adapted to improve the performance of overlap-aware speaker diarization systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that the proposed method assigns lower confidence to most overlapping speech segments, which could be a limitation for overlap-aware systems
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore how the confidence assessment methods could be adapted or combined with overlap-aware diarization techniques to improve overall performance
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing an integrated approach that combines the confidence assessment methods with overlap-aware diarization techniques would provide evidence to resolve this question

## Limitations
- Evaluated only on English conversation datasets (AMI and DoPaCo), limiting generalizability to other languages or domains
- Performance gap between white-box and black-box confidence estimation methods not thoroughly analyzed
- Does not explore confidence estimation in scenarios with unknown and poorly estimated number of speakers

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Confidence scores can isolate ~30% of diarization errors within lowest 10% confidence scores
- **Medium Confidence**: Silhouette score method's superiority over other approaches demonstrated but not fully explained
- **Medium Confidence**: Most overlapping speech segments receive low confidence scores but underlying mechanism unclear

## Next Checks
1. Cross-linguistic validation: Apply confidence assessment methods to non-English datasets to verify generalization across languages and domains
2. Overlapping speech analysis: Conduct detailed error analysis on overlapping segments to understand why they consistently receive low confidence scores
3. Real-time implementation study: Evaluate computational overhead of each confidence assessment method in streaming diarization scenario to assess practical applicability
