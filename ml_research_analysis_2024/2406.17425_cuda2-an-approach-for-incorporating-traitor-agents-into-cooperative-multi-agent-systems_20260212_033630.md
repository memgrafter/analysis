- Introduces Curiosity-Driven Adversarial Attack (CuDA2) framework for traitor agents in CMARL

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach to adversarial attacks in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning by incorporating traitor agents into the system. Unlike previous methods requiring direct access to victim agents, this approach enables traitors to influence victim agents' formation and positioning through collisions. The authors model this problem as a Traitor Markov Decision Process (TMDP) and propose the Curiosity-Driven Adversarial Attack (CuDA2) framework to enhance attack efficiency and aggressiveness. CuDA2 employs a pre-trained Random Network Distillation (RND) module to encourage exploration of unencountered states and uses dynamic potential-based reward shaping to ensure optimal policy invariance.

## Method Summary
The CuDA2 framework addresses adversarial attacks in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning by introducing traitor agents that can influence victim agents through collisions rather than direct parameter access. The approach models the problem as a Traitor Markov Decision Process (TMDP) and employs curiosity-driven exploration via a pre-trained Random Network Distillation module. Dynamic potential-based reward shaping ensures the invariance of the traitors' optimal policy. The framework encourages traitors to explore states unencountered by victim agents, enhancing the efficiency and aggressiveness of attacks while maintaining theoretical guarantees through potential-based shaping.

## Key Results
- CuDA2 achieves comparable or superior adversarial attack capabilities compared to baselines
- Effectively reduces win rate of victim agents in various StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge scenarios
- Demonstrates efficient exploration of unencountered states through curiosity-driven approach

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by introducing traitor agents that can physically interact with victim agents through collisions, creating a new attack vector not requiring direct access to victim parameters. The curiosity-driven exploration mechanism encourages traitors to seek out novel states that victim agents haven't encountered, maximizing disruption potential. Dynamic potential-based reward shaping maintains optimal policy invariance while providing the necessary incentives for effective adversarial behavior.

## Foundational Learning

**Traitor Markov Decision Process (TMDP)**: Models the interaction between traitor and victim agents as a sequential decision-making problem. Needed to formalize the problem and derive optimal strategies. Quick check: Verify that the TMDP formulation captures all relevant state transitions and reward structures.

**Random Network Distillation (RND)**: Provides an intrinsic reward signal based on prediction error of a target network. Needed to encourage exploration of novel states. Quick check: Ensure RND module is properly pre-trained and maintains stability during training.

**Potential-based Reward Shaping**: Modifies reward functions while preserving optimal policies. Needed to guide traitor behavior without changing the fundamental solution. Quick check: Validate that shaped rewards maintain policy invariance through formal proofs.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: RND Module -> Reward Shaping -> TMDP Solver -> Traitor Agent

**Critical Path**: Pre-trained RND module generates intrinsic rewards → Dynamic potential-based shaping combines with extrinsic rewards → TMDP solver computes optimal traitor policy → Traitor agents execute adversarial actions

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach trades direct parameter access for physical interaction capabilities, requiring more sophisticated modeling but offering stealthier attacks. Uses curiosity-driven exploration which is computationally efficient but may require careful tuning of intrinsic reward weights.

**Failure Signatures**: Ineffective attacks when victim agents employ strong defensive positioning; performance degradation when physical interactions are restricted; potential instability if RND module predictions become unreliable.

**First Experiments**: 1) Validate TMDP formulation on simple two-agent scenarios; 2) Test RND module exploration capabilities in controlled environments; 3) Evaluate basic collision-based attacks before implementing full CuDA2 framework.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Assumes traitor agents can freely interact with victim agents through collisions without detection
- Effectiveness may be limited when victim agents employ defensive strategies
- Reliance on pre-trained modules may not generalize well to all CMARL environments

## Confidence
- Major claims: Medium
- Experimental results support effectiveness in tested scenarios
- Limited scope of experiments and specific attack vector warrant caution in generalization

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate CuDA2 performance in environments with diverse and complex dynamics, including continuous action spaces and partial observability
2. Investigate victim agent adaptability by implementing defensive strategies and observing their impact on CuDA2 effectiveness
3. Assess generalizability by testing CuDA2 in scenarios beyond StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge, such as cooperative navigation or traffic management tasks
