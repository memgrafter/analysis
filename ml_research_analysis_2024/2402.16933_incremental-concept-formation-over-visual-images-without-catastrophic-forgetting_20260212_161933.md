# Incremental Concept Formation over Visual Images Without Catastrophic Forgetting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.16933
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16933
- Authors: Nicki Barari; Xin Lian; Christopher J. MacLellan
- Reference count: 7
- Key outcome: Cobweb4V achieves comparable MNIST accuracy to neural networks with far fewer examples and resists catastrophic forgetting without rehearsal.

## Executive Summary
Cobweb4V is a visual concept formation approach that builds on the Cobweb algorithm to incrementally learn visual concepts without catastrophic forgetting. It represents images as tensors storing pixel statistics, uses mutual information-based category utility to guide tree growth, and combines predictions from multiple concept nodes via best-first search. Experiments show Cobweb4V learns faster than neural network baselines on MNIST and maintains high accuracy on previously learned concepts even when trained on new data without rehearsal.

## Method Summary
Cobweb4V incrementally builds a hierarchical concept tree where each node stores mean and standard deviation tensors for pixel intensities and label counts. New instances are categorized down the tree, updating count tables of visited nodes without altering previously learned structures. The tree grows by adding, merging, splitting, or creating nodes based on mutual information gain. Prediction uses best-first search to expand up to Nmax nodes with highest collocation scores and combines their probability estimates via softmax weighting. The method was tested on MNIST using 10 sequential training splits of 10 examples each, comparing performance to a fully connected neural network baseline.

## Key Results
- Cobweb4V learns MNIST faster than neural network baselines, achieving comparable performance with significantly fewer training examples.
- Cobweb4V demonstrates robust resistance to catastrophic forgetting, maintaining high accuracy on previously learned concepts when trained on new data without rehearsal.
- Cobweb4V outperforms neural networks with and without replay mechanisms in maintaining accuracy on previously learned concepts during continual learning.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Cobweb4V avoids catastrophic forgetting by incrementally building a hierarchical concept tree rather than updating fixed network weights.
- Mechanism: Each new visual instance is categorized down the tree and updates the count tables of visited nodes without altering previously learned structures. The tree grows by adding, merging, splitting, or creating nodes based on mutual information gain, preserving old knowledge as part of the static structure.
- Core assumption: The hierarchical structure remains stable enough that old concepts are not overwritten or pruned when new data arrives.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "...builds on Cobweb, a human like learning system that is inspired by the way humans incrementally learn new concepts over time."
  - [section] "During learning, Cobweb categorizes new instances down its tree recursively and updates the count tables of concepts along the categorization path to reflect the attribute values of the instances."
  - [corpus] Weak - neighbors mention concept formation and catastrophic forgetting but no direct evidence Cobweb4V preserves structure in continual learning.
- Break condition: If the tree grows too deep or imbalanced, categorization paths for old instances may shift, reducing accuracy on previously learned concepts.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Prediction combines evidence from multiple concept nodes using best-first search weighted by collocation, reducing reliance on any single leaf concept.
- Mechanism: Instead of greedy descent to one leaf, Cobweb4V expands up to Nmax nodes with highest collocation scores and combines their probability estimates via softmax weighting. This smooths predictions and mitigates interference at branch points.
- Core assumption: Expanding multiple nodes captures relevant context even if some concepts are partially corrupted by interference.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Given an instance...Cobweb begins categorization at the root...uses best-first search...combines predictions from all expanded nodes, weighted by their collocation."
  - [abstract] "...a combination of multiple concepts during prediction."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence neighbors use multi-node prediction; weak external support.
- Break condition: If Nmax is too small relative to tree size, predictions revert to single-concept reliance, increasing vulnerability to interference.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Tensor-based storage of pixel statistics enables efficient, exact updates without gradient-based forgetting.
- Mechanism: Each concept stores mean and standard deviation tensors for pixel intensities; new images update these statistics incrementally. This avoids weight updates that drift old parameters, unlike neural networks.
- Core assumption: Pixel-wise statistics fully capture visual concepts so that incremental updates preserve discriminative information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Each node stores the means and standard deviations of the pixel features...uses a tensor representation to store this statistics, which enables more efficient inference and updating."
  - [abstract] "...tensor-based representation of images and a combination of multiple concepts during prediction."
  - [corpus] Weak - neighbors mention deep nets and replay but no evidence tensor-based exact updates prevent forgetting.
- Break condition: If concept granularity is too coarse, fine visual distinctions may be lost, degrading old-concept accuracy.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Incremental concept formation
  - Why needed here: Cobweb4V builds visual categories one instance at a time without retraining on full datasets.
  - Quick check question: What operation does Cobweb perform when a new instance does not fit existing children well?

- Concept: Mutual information as category utility
  - Why needed here: Measures how much knowing a child concept reduces uncertainty about attribute values versus the parent.
  - Quick check question: How does mutual information category utility differ from probability-theoretic category utility?

- Concept: Best-first search in prediction
  - Why needed here: Expands multiple candidate concepts instead of greedy descent, combining their predictions to reduce interference.
  - Quick check question: What heuristic guides node expansion during prediction in Cobweb4V?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Instance tensor → Cobweb tree with concept nodes (mean/std tensors + label tables) → Best-first search → Weighted prediction → Output
- Critical path: New image → Categorize down tree (update stats) → Store in node → Prediction uses Nmax top collocation nodes → Combine predictions
- Design tradeoffs: Static hierarchical structure resists forgetting but may grow unwieldy; tensor stats are exact but memory-heavy; best-first search improves robustness but increases prediction cost.
- Failure signatures: Accuracy drop on old classes after new training splits (interference); tree depth explosion (scalability); slow predictions if Nmax too large (efficiency).
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train on small MNIST splits sequentially; measure accuracy vs. neural nets.
  2. Fix chosen digit; train on splits that exclude it; measure forgetting resistance.
  3. Vary Nmax during prediction; find optimal balance between robustness and speed.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does Cobweb4V's performance compare to neural networks when learning from sequential tasks with different class distributions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that Cobweb4V outperforms neural network baselines with and without replay mechanisms in maintaining accuracy on previously learned concepts when trained on new data without rehearsal.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tested Cobweb4V on the MNIST dataset with specific task compositions. It's unclear how Cobweb4V would perform on other datasets or with different class distributions in the sequential tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments on other benchmark datasets like CIFAR-10 or ImageNet with varying class distributions in the sequential tasks and comparing Cobweb4V's performance to neural network baselines.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can Cobweb4V be extended to handle more complex visual tasks beyond image classification, such as object detection or segmentation?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on Cobweb4V's performance on image classification tasks using the MNIST dataset. It mentions that Cobweb4V uses a tensor-based representation of images, but doesn't explore its potential for more complex visual tasks.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't provide any evidence or discussion on how Cobweb4V could be adapted for tasks beyond image classification, such as object detection or segmentation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing and evaluating Cobweb4V on object detection or segmentation tasks using appropriate benchmark datasets, and comparing its performance to state-of-the-art neural network approaches.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does Cobweb4V's computational efficiency compare to neural networks when learning from large-scale visual datasets?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that Cobweb4V is more data-efficient and achieves asymptotic performance with fewer examples compared to neural networks. However, it doesn't discuss the computational efficiency of Cobweb4V when dealing with large-scale visual datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates Cobweb4V on the MNIST dataset, which is relatively small compared to modern large-scale visual datasets. It's unclear how Cobweb4V's computational efficiency scales with larger datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments to measure the training and inference time of Cobweb4V on large-scale visual datasets like ImageNet, and comparing its computational efficiency to neural network baselines.

## Limitations
- The approach has only been validated on MNIST, a relatively simple dataset, raising questions about generalization to more complex visual domains.
- The static hierarchical structure may become unwieldy or inefficient as the number of concepts grows, potentially limiting scalability.
- The claim that tensor-based pixel statistics alone can capture complex visual concepts lacks strong empirical validation beyond the MNIST experiments.

## Confidence

- Mechanism 1 (hierarchical tree structure resists forgetting): Medium
- Mechanism 2 (best-first search prediction): Low
- Mechanism 3 (tensor-based pixel statistics): Low

## Next Checks

1. Test Cobweb4V on CIFAR-10 or CIFAR-100 to assess generalization to color images and more classes, measuring forgetting across sequential task blocks.
2. Implement a controlled ablation removing best-first search prediction to isolate its contribution to forgetting resistance versus the hierarchical structure alone.
3. Conduct a scalability analysis varying tree depth and Nmax parameters to determine when computational costs outweigh forgetting benefits.
