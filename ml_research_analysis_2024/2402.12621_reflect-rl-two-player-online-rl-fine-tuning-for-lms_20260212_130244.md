# Reflect-RL: Two-Player Online RL Fine-Tuning for LMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.12621
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12621
- Authors: Runlong Zhou; Simon S. Du; Beibin Li
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: GPT-2 XL fine-tuned with Reflect-RL achieves 74% success rate on benchmarks, outperforming Mistral 7B's 34%.

## Executive Summary
Reflect-RL introduces a two-player reinforcement learning fine-tuning framework for language models to handle multi-step decision-making tasks. The method employs a frozen reflection model to assist a trainable policy model, enabling improved reasoning and planning capabilities. Key innovations include negative example generation to balance training data, single-prompt action enumeration to handle large action spaces efficiently, and curriculum learning to accelerate training on complex tasks. Experiments show that GPT-2 XL fine-tuned with Reflect-RL outperforms larger open-source models like Mistral 7B on benchmarks including file system exploration, navigation, and household tasks.

## Method Summary
Reflect-RL addresses the challenge of fine-tuning language models for multi-step decision-making tasks through a two-stage process. First, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is performed using reflection data generated by GPT-4. This data includes both positive examples (optimal trajectories) and negative examples (
