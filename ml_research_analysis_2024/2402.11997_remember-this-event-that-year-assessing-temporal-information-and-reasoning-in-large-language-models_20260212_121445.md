# Remember This Event That Year? Assessing Temporal Information and Reasoning in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.11997
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11997
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: State-of-the-art LLMs struggle with temporal retention and reasoning, especially in zero-shot settings, with fine-tuning improving unavailable data handling but reducing correct responses.

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates how well large language models retain and reason about temporal information using a novel dataset spanning 10,000 BCE to 2100 CE. Testing 12 state-of-the-art models across eight UN-focused categories reveals significant limitations in temporal understanding, particularly for open-source models that generate more incorrect responses. The research introduces six multiple-choice question categories to assess different aspects of temporal reasoning and tests three fine-tuning paradigms to improve performance.

The findings show that while fine-tuning approaches reduce incorrect outputs and improve acknowledgment of unavailable information, they also decrease the rate of correct responses. This suggests current training methods for temporal data may need refinement. The study highlights the need for better numerical-temporal learning strategies and demonstrates that even advanced LLMs struggle with fundamental temporal reasoning tasks that humans handle easily.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates 12 LLMs on a novel numerical-temporal dataset called TempUN, which contains over 9.4 million samples spanning from 10,000 BCE to 2100 CE. The dataset covers eight United Nations-focused categories curated from Our World in Data. Researchers create six multiple-choice question categories (date, comparative, window, range, min/max, and trend) to assess temporal reasoning capabilities. Three fine-tuning paradigms are tested: yearwise (sequential), continual learning, and random fine-tuning using QLoRA. Performance is measured through exact match evaluation between generated and ground truth answers.

## Key Results
- LLMs perform poorly on temporal reasoning tasks in zero-shot settings, with open-source models generating more incorrect responses than closed-source models
- Fine-tuning approaches reduce incorrect outputs but also decrease correct response rates, indicating current methods may not be optimal
- Open-source models show slightly better average performance but fail to recognize knowledge gaps as effectively as closed-source models
- Models struggle particularly with trend-based questions and identifying temporal ranges

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The introduction of a novel numerical-temporal dataset (TempUN) spanning a broad time range (10,000 BCE to 2100 CE) enables evaluation of LLMs' ability to retain and reason about temporal information.
- Mechanism: By curating data from the Our World in Data (OWD) website covering eight United Nations-focused categories with over 9.4M samples, the dataset provides a rich source of temporal information for assessing LLM performance.
- Core assumption: The OWD website contains accurate and reliable data that can be effectively used to evaluate LLM temporal understanding.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our study experiments with 12 state-of-the-art models (ranging from 2B to 70B+ parameters) on a novel numerical-temporal dataset, TempUN, spanning from 10,000 BCE to 2100 CE, to uncover significant temporal retention and comprehension limitations."
  - [section] "In this paper, we introduce the largest temporal dataset constructed by curating temporal information from Our World in Data (OWD) website1."
  - [corpus] "Found 25 related papers (using 8). Average neighbor FMR=0.431, average citations=0.0."
- Break condition: If the OWD data is not comprehensive or reliable, the dataset's effectiveness in evaluating LLM temporal understanding would be compromised.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The six MCQ-based metrics (date, comparative, window, range, min/max, and trend) effectively assess different aspects of LLM temporal reasoning capabilities.
- Mechanism: Each MCQ category targets a specific aspect of temporal reasoning, such as recalling specific values, comparing values across time, or identifying trends. This allows for a comprehensive evaluation of LLM performance.
- Core assumption: The MCQ categories are well-designed to capture the nuances of temporal reasoning and provide meaningful insights into LLM capabilities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We propose six metrics to assess three learning paradigms to enhance temporal knowledge acquisition."
  - [section] "We create six MCQ-based questions to evaluate LLMs' memorization and reasoning capabilities for MCQA."
  - [corpus] "Found 25 related papers (using 8). Average neighbor FMR=0.431, average citations=0.0."
- Break condition: If the MCQ categories do not accurately represent the complexity of temporal reasoning tasks, the evaluation results may not be meaningful.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Fine-tuning approaches (yearwise, continual, and random) improve LLM performance on temporal tasks by reducing incorrect outputs and increasing acknowledgment of unavailable data.
- Mechanism: By exposing LLMs to temporal data through different fine-tuning strategies, they learn to better handle numerical information and recognize knowledge gaps, leading to improved performance.
- Core assumption: Fine-tuning LLMs on temporal data can effectively enhance their ability to process and reason about temporal information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Additionally, various fine-tuning approaches significantly improved performance, reducing incorrect outputs and impacting the identification of 'information not available' in the generations."
  - [section] "We experimented with three distinct training paradigms: (1) yearwise fine-tuning, (2) continual learning, and (3) random fine-tuning."
  - [corpus] "Found 25 related papers (using 8). Average neighbor FMR=0.431, average citations=0.0."
- Break condition: If the fine-tuning approaches do not effectively transfer to unseen temporal data, the improvements in performance may not generalize.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Understanding the sequential nature of events and their relationships.
  - Why needed here: Temporal reasoning requires understanding how events unfold over time and how they relate to each other.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how the event "France's GDP in 2011" relates to the events "France's GDP in 2010" and "France's GDP in 2012"?

- Concept: Handling numerical data and performing calculations.
  - Why needed here: The TempUN dataset contains numerical data, and the MCQ categories require numerical reasoning, such as comparing values or identifying trends.
  - Quick check question: Given the GDP values for France in 2010 ($2.5 trillion), 2011 ($2.6 trillion), and 2012 ($2.7 trillion), can you calculate the percentage increase in GDP from 2010 to 2011?

- Concept: Recognizing knowledge gaps and acknowledging uncertainty.
  - Why needed here: LLMs should be able to identify when they lack information to answer a question accurately and avoid generating incorrect responses.
  - Quick check question: If asked about France's GDP in 2025, how would you respond if you don't have access to that information?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: TempUN dataset -> Six MCQ categories -> Fine-tuning paradigms (yearwise, continual, random) -> LLM evaluation
- Critical path: Curate temporal data from OWD -> Create MCQ questions -> Evaluate zero-shot performance -> Apply fine-tuning paradigms -> Re-evaluate performance
- Design tradeoffs: Dataset comprehensiveness vs. computational resources; MCQ complexity vs. evaluation clarity; fine-tuning approach vs. generalization ability
- Failure signatures: Generating incorrect numerical outputs; failing to recognize unavailable information; overfitting to training periods; poor trend identification
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate a pre-trained LLM on the TempUN dataset using the six MCQ categories to establish a baseline performance
  2. Fine-tune the LLM using the yearwise fine-tuning approach and re-evaluate its performance on the TempUN dataset
  3. Compare the performance of the fine-tuned LLM with the baseline to assess the impact of the yearwise fine-tuning approach

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- The paper identifies the need for better fine-tuning strategies that can improve both correct responses and acknowledgment of unavailable information without reducing overall accuracy
- Future work should explore non-numerical temporal data modalities and their impact on LLM temporal reasoning capabilities
- The study suggests investigating how LLMs represent and process numerical information across extended time spans

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses on memorization and simple reasoning tasks with exact answers in training data, limiting assessment of genuine temporal reasoning
- Single dataset source (Our World in Data) may not represent full diversity of temporal information encountered in real-world applications
- Fine-tuning results show improved handling of unavailable information but at cost of correct responses, suggesting current approaches may not be optimal

## Confidence
- High confidence: Models struggle with temporal retention and reasoning across all tested categories
- Medium confidence: Fine-tuning paradigms improve handling of unavailable information but reduce correct responses
- Medium confidence: Open-source models show slightly better average performance but with higher variance

## Next Checks
1. Test model performance on temporal questions with no exact training data matches to assess genuine reasoning capabilities
2. Evaluate model generalization across temporal ranges by testing on time periods not seen during fine-tuning
3. Compare performance on synthetic temporal data versus real-world temporal reasoning tasks to identify capability gaps
