## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Narration and dialogue in literary novels express largely disparate emotions, with character dialogue showing higher valence and dominance than narration

## Executive Summary
This study examines the emotional dynamics of characters in 28 English literary novels, distinguishing between emotions expressed in narration and character dialogue. Using the Project Dialogism Novel Corpus and the NRC Valence, Arousal, and Dominance Lexicon, the research reveals that narration and dialogue carry distinct emotional signatures, with near-zero correlations between their emotional arcs. The findings highlight significant variation in character emotional trajectories within and across novels, and reveal systematic differences in emotional dynamics based on character and author gender.

## Method Summary
The research analyzes 28 English novels from the Project Dialogism Novel Corpus, using the NRC Valence, Arousal, and Dominance Lexicon to score emotional content. Text is processed through rolling windows (500 words, moving by 1 word) to generate emotion state sequences. Utterance Emotion Dynamics (UED) metrics are computed for each speaker, including mean values, variability, displacement lengths, and rise/recovery rates. Temporal alignment enables correlation analysis between emotion arcs, while statistical tests examine gender-based differences in emotional patterns.

## Key Results
- Narration and dialogue exhibit near-zero correlations in emotional arcs (0.06 for arousal/dominance, 0.09 for valence)
- Character dialogue shows higher valence and dominance compared to narration
- Significant variation exists in character emotional diversity within and across novels
- Gender differences emerge: female characters show higher valence, male characters show higher arousal; female authors' characters show higher valence and dominance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Character dialogue carries more positive valence and dominance than narration.
- Mechanism: When mapping utterances to speaker roles, dialogue windows are scored higher on valence and dominance lexicons than narration windows.
- Core assumption: The NRC Valence, Arousal, and Dominance Lexicon scores words identically regardless of narrative context.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Character dialogue, on the other hand, has a higher level of valence and dominance compared to narration — the third quartile for narration is close to the first quartile for dialogue"
  - [abstract]: "Character dialogue exhibits higher valence and dominance compared to narration."
- Break condition: If the lexicon is context-sensitive and scores narrator descriptions differently from character speech, the mechanism fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The emotional arc of a novel is not captured by averaging over all text.
- Mechanism: By aligning emotion arcs temporally and computing pairwise Spearman correlations, narration and dialogue are shown to have near-zero correlations.
- Core assumption: Temporal alignment via word-based binning preserves emotional continuity without distorting peak/valley patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "On average, we see near-zero correlations across all dimensions (0.06 for arousal and dominance, 0.09 for valence), with most correlation scores falling between −0.1 and 0.35"
  - [abstract]: "Our findings show that the narration and the dialogue largely express disparate emotions through the course of a novel"
- Break condition: If the binning resolution is too coarse, emotional peaks could be averaged out, falsely lowering correlations.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Male and female characters show systematic valence/arousal differences across authors.
- Mechanism: Aggregating UED metrics by gender labels and testing with two-sided t-tests reveals statistically significant differences in mean valence and arousal.
- Core assumption: The gender labels assigned to characters and authors are reliable and correspond to societal presentation rather than internal identity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "mean valence is higher for female characters compared to male characters (0.68 vs 0.66); mean arousal is higher for male characters (0.39 vs 0.37)"
  - [section]: "mean valence (0.69 vs 0.65), lower mean arousal (0.36 vs 0.38), and higher mean dominance (0.55 vs 0.52)"
- Break condition: If gender labels are inaccurate or too binary, the observed differences may reflect labeling artifacts rather than true emotional dynamics.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Temporal alignment of emotion arcs using rolling windows.
  - Why needed here: Ensures that arcs from speakers with different utterance counts are comparable on the same normalized timeline.
  - Quick check question: If one speaker has 1000 words and another has 500, how many time bins will each arc be reduced to after alignment?
- Concept: Spearman correlation for shape similarity.
  - Why needed here: Captures monotonic relationships in emotional trajectories without assuming linearity.
  - Quick check question: What is the correlation between two identical arcs where one is scaled by a constant factor?
- Concept: Outlier detection using box-and-whisker rules.
  - Why needed here: Identifies characters with extreme emotional profiles for qualitative literary analysis.
  - Quick check question: If Q1=0.5, Q3=0.7, and IQR=0.2, what is the lower fence for outlier detection?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: PDNC Corpus -> NRC VAD Lexicon -> Rolling Window Processor -> Emotion State Sequence -> UED Metrics -> Temporal Alignment -> Correlation Matrix -> Gender Comparison
- Critical path: Corpus → Lexicon lookup → Windowed emotion states → UED metrics → Correlation analysis → Gender/group comparison
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Window size (500 words) vs. resolution: Larger windows smooth arcs but risk losing fine emotional shifts.
  - Alignment method (word-based vs. utterance-based): Word-based gives finer temporal resolution but requires more memory.
  - Gender categorization (binary vs. spectrum): Binary simplifies analysis but may misclassify non-binary identities.
- Failure signatures:
  - Zero variance in emotion scores → lexicon coverage issue.
  - All correlations near zero → misalignment or insufficient data per speaker.
  - t-test p-values all above 0.05 → small sample size or weak effect size.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run alignment with [0,0.001] vs [0,0.01] bin sizes; compare correlation distributions.
  2. Drop minor characters (≤35 utterances) and recompute UED metrics; check for stability.
  3. Swap NRC VAD lexicon with an alternative (e.g., VADER); verify if pattern differences persist.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do character emotion arcs vary across different literary genres beyond the limited selection in the current dataset?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses a small, curated corpus of 28 English novels across various genres but acknowledges this selection bias limits generalizability. It explicitly states that expanding to a less-curated dataset would enable more comprehensive analysis.
- Why unresolved: The current study is restricted to a small set of critically acclaimed novels, which may not represent broader literary trends or genre-specific patterns in character emotion dynamics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of character emotion dynamics across a larger, more diverse corpus of novels spanning multiple genres and time periods, using automated methods for speaker identification and emotion arc computation.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the effects of narrative perspective (first-person vs. third-person) on the relationship between narration and character emotion arcs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that 5 out of 28 novels are written in first-person and observes that correlations between narration and narrator dialogue vary significantly, but does not systematically investigate this relationship across narrative perspectives.
- Why unresolved: The study only briefly mentions first-person narratives as outliers without exploring how narrative perspective systematically influences the emotional alignment between narration and character dialogue.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of emotion arc correlations between first-person and third-person narratives across a large corpus, controlling for other variables like author gender and genre.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do character emotion arcs change when considering chronological time versus narrative time ordering?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly states that chronological time analysis is a separate research problem and focuses on narrative time ordering, leaving this question for future work.
- Why unresolved: The study deliberately avoids chronological analysis, noting that determining chronological time in narrative text is challenging, but acknowledges this could provide valuable insights into character emotion dynamics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of computational methods to accurately determine chronological ordering in novels, followed by comparison of character emotion arcs using both chronological and narrative time ordering.

## Limitations
- Binary gender categorization may not capture full spectrum of character identities and may conflate presentation with identity
- Lexicon-based emotion scoring assumes words carry same emotional weight regardless of narrative context
- 500-word rolling windows may smooth over rapid emotional shifts critical to understanding character dynamics

## Confidence
- Narration/dialogue emotional disparity: High
- Gender differences in emotional dynamics: Medium
- Lexicon-based emotion scoring mechanism: Low to Medium

## Next Checks
1. Replicate analysis using context-sensitive emotion model (e.g., BERT-based classification) to verify valence/dominance differences persist
2. Conduct sensitivity analysis by varying rolling window size (200, 500, 1000 words) and recomputing UED metrics
3. Perform ablation study by removing characters with most extreme UED outlier scores and re-evaluating gender-based differences
