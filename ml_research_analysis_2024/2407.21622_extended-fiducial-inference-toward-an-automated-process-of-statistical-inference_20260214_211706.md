# Extended Fiducial Inference: Toward an Automated Process of Statistical Inference

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.21622
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21622
- Reference count: 40
- Extended fiducial inference (EFI) framework for automated statistical inference with higher fidelity and semi-supervised learning capabilities

## Executive Summary
Extended Fiducial Inference (EFI) is a novel statistical inference framework that addresses key limitations of traditional frequentist and Bayesian methods. The method combines stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo with sparse deep neural networks to jointly impute latent variables and estimate inverse functions for model parameters, ensuring proper uncertainty propagation. EFI eliminates the need for theoretical reference distributions in hypothesis testing and provides an innovative approach to semi-supervised learning, demonstrating robust performance across multiple domains.

## Method Summary
EFI uses a joint imputation approach where latent variables are imputed using sparse deep neural networks, while inverse functions for model parameters are estimated using stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The framework automatically propagates uncertainty from observations to model parameters through a differentiable data augmentation process. The EFI-DNN algorithm implements this approach, creating a differentiable mapping between latent variables and model parameters that allows for efficient sampling and inference without requiring analytical derivations of reference distributions.

## Key Results
- Achieves type-I error rates close to nominal 0.05 level in complex hypothesis testing scenarios
- Outperforms existing methods in semi-supervised learning tasks across multiple domains
- Provides higher fidelity parameter estimation compared to maximum likelihood methods, particularly in presence of outliers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
EFI works by creating a differentiable data augmentation framework that allows for joint imputation of latent variables and estimation of model parameters. The sparse deep neural networks learn the inverse relationship between parameters and data, while stochastic gradient MCMC provides efficient sampling from the posterior distribution. This approach automatically handles uncertainty propagation and eliminates the need for analytical derivations of reference distributions, making the inference process fully automated.

## Foundational Learning

**Stochastic Gradient MCMC**: A scalable Bayesian inference method using gradient information to approximate posterior distributions. Needed for efficient sampling in high-dimensional parameter spaces. Quick check: Verify convergence diagnostics on trace plots.

**Sparse Deep Neural Networks**: Neural networks with built-in sparsity constraints for learning inverse mappings. Needed for efficient representation of complex inverse relationships. Quick check: Monitor weight sparsity levels during training.

**Differentiable Data Augmentation**: Making the data augmentation process differentiable for end-to-end training. Needed for automatic uncertainty propagation. Quick check: Verify gradient flow through augmentation layers.

**Joint Imputation Framework**: Simultaneously imputing latent variables and estimating parameters. Needed for coherent uncertainty quantification. Quick check: Compare marginal and joint posterior distributions.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data -> Sparse DNN -> Latent Variables -> SG-MCMC -> Parameter Samples -> Inference

**Critical Path**: The core computational path involves forward propagation through the sparse DNN to generate latent variables, followed by SG-MCMC sampling to obtain parameter estimates, with gradients flowing backward through both components.

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Sparsity vs. expressiveness in neural network architecture
- Sampling efficiency vs. accuracy in MCMC approximation
- Computational cost vs. fidelity in uncertainty quantification

**Failure Signatures**:
- Poor mixing in MCMC chains indicates model misspecification
- Degraded performance on simple problems suggests overcomplexity
- Inconsistent uncertainty estimates may indicate insufficient network capacity

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify basic inference on a simple linear model with known solution
2. Test scalability by increasing dimensionality gradually
3. Compare uncertainty quantification against analytical solutions
