# TabKANet: Tabular Data Modeling with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network and Transformer

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.08806
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08806
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Neural network architecture combining KAN with Transformers achieves performance comparable to or better than GBDT methods on tabular data tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TabKANet, a neural network architecture that addresses limitations in processing numerical features in tabular data by combining Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with Transformer architectures. The key innovation is a KAN-based Numerical Embedding Module that handles continuous numerical features, paired with a Transformer architecture for unified processing of both numerical and categorical features. TabKANet demonstrates competitive performance with established methods like XGBoost and CatBoost across 12 benchmark datasets spanning binary classification, multi-class classification, and regression tasks, while showing particular robustness to noisy data.

## Method Summary
TabKANet processes tabular data by first encoding numerical features through a KAN-based Numerical Embedding Module, which uses learnable B-spline functions to capture complex nonlinear relationships in continuous variables. Categorical features are processed through standard embedding layers. Both feature types are then mapped to unified dimensions and processed through a Transformer encoder that enables cross-feature learning through self-attention mechanisms. The architecture uses Batch Normalization instead of Layer Normalization for numerical features, which the authors demonstrate provides better performance for skewed or heavy-tailed data distributions. The model is trained using standard optimization techniques with 5-fold cross-validation across diverse tabular datasets.

## Key Results
- TabKANet achieves competitive performance with GBDT methods (XGBoost, CatBoost) on 12 benchmark datasets
- The model demonstrates strong robustness to noisy data compared to baseline neural networks
- Batch Normalization outperforms Layer Normalization for numerical feature processing in this architecture

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: KAN-based numerical embedding better captures continuous numerical feature interactions than MLP
- Mechanism: KAN replaces fixed activation functions with learnable edge functions, allowing flexible modeling of arbitrary function complexity through inner and outer function decomposition
- Core assumption: Numerical features contain complex nonlinear relationships that benefit from KAN's flexible function approximation
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "A vital feature of the KAN is its ability to approximate functions of arbitrary complexity by selecting appropriate activation functions and parameters"
  - [section]: "KAN shows a natural affinity of continuous numerical values, making it possible to become a significant component in processing the numerical features in tabular data"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - only mentions "TabKAN: Advancing Tabular Data Analysis using Kolmogorov-Arnold Network" without detailed mechanism

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Batch Normalization (BN) outperforms Layer Normalization (LN) for numerical feature preprocessing
- Mechanism: BN captures intrinsic feature differences within each numerical feature earlier in learning, amplifying subtle distinctions in skewed or heavy-tailed data distributions
- Core assumption: Numerical features often exhibit skewed or heavy-tailed distributions requiring careful normalization
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Previous work used LN to normalize numerical features [14]. This is a subconscious best solution... However, this may not be true"
  - [section]: "We have demonstrated the robust adaptability of BN through experiments in the 4.7 section, especially when combined with KAN"
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence in corpus - weak support

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Unified Transformer architecture with matched dimensions enables better cross-feature learning
- Mechanism: By mapping both feature types to matrices of unified dimension, self-attention can model all data equally, avoiding unequal weighting of column items
- Core assumption: Categorical and numerical features contain complementary information that benefits from joint attention-based learning
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Employing a consistent Transformer architecture for learning after encoding the column features also offers a highly scalable framework for tabular data modeling"
  - [section]: "Since we cannot pre-determine the contribution weights of each column in tabular data, a pragmatic solution is to construct uniform representations for each column's features"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus mentions TabKAN but lacks detailed architectural justification

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem
  - Why needed here: Forms theoretical foundation for KAN architecture that replaces MLP
  - Quick check question: How does the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem represent multivariate continuous functions using sums of univariate functions?

- Concept: B-splines and their role in KAN
  - Why needed here: Used to construct learnable inner and outer functions in KAN architecture
  - Quick check question: What properties make B-splines suitable for approximating complex function shapes in KAN?

- Concept: Self-attention mechanism in Transformers
  - Why needed here: Enables cross-feature interaction learning between numerical and categorical features
  - Quick check question: How does self-attention compute weighted representations of features based on their mutual relevance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input → KAN-based Numerical Embedding Module → Categorical Embedding → Concatenation → Transformer Encoder → MLP Head → Output
- Critical path: Numerical features → KAN → BN → Resize → Transformer; Categorical features → Embedding → Resize → Transformer
- Design tradeoffs: KAN provides better numerical feature extraction but increases computational complexity; BN requires batch-aware training but improves numerical sensitivity
- Failure signatures: Poor numerical feature performance with LN instead of BN; degraded performance when numerical features dominate but KAN is omitted
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare TabKANet performance with and without KAN module on a dataset with significant numerical features
  2. Test TabKANet with LN vs BN normalization on a skewed numerical feature dataset
  3. Evaluate TabKANet performance with different batch sizes to find optimal BN configuration

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does TabKANet's performance scale with increasing dataset size and complexity?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates effectiveness on datasets from 1,000 to 581,012 samples but doesn't explore extreme scalability limits
- Why unresolved: Experiments cover moderate range of dataset sizes without testing massive industrial-scale datasets
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking on datasets with millions of samples and thousands of features, comparing training times and memory usage against GBDT methods

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the theoretical relationship between KAN's function approximation capabilities and its effectiveness in tabular data modeling?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions KAN's ability to approximate functions of arbitrary complexity but lacks formal connection to tabular performance
- Why unresolved: While empirical success is demonstrated, theoretical analysis of why KAN excels at numerical feature extraction is missing
- What evidence would resolve it: Mathematical proofs or theoretical bounds showing how KAN's Kolmogorov-Arnold representation relates to functions in tabular data

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does TabKANet's performance compare when using different normalization techniques for numerical features?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares Batch Normalization to Layer Normalization but doesn't explore other normalization methods
- Why unresolved: Ablation study only considers two normalization approaches, leaving uncertainty about other techniques
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic comparison of TabKANet using various normalization schemes (Group Norm, Instance Norm, etc.) across benchmark datasets

### Open Question 4
- Question: What is the impact of varying KAN network depth on TabKANet's performance and computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses a single-layer KAN configuration but doesn't explore deeper architectures or their trade-offs
- Why unresolved: All experiments use fixed KAN architecture with one hidden layer without investigating deeper networks
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance comparison of TabKANet variants with different KAN depths (0, 1, 2, 3+ layers) on the same datasets, measuring both accuracy and computational costs

## Limitations
- Experimental validation relies on 12 datasets with unclear selection criteria and representativeness for real-world applications
- KAN-based numerical embedding's effectiveness depends on specific parameter choices (B-spline configurations, neuron counts) that are not fully specified
- Claimed robustness to noisy data needs more rigorous testing across different noise types and levels

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: TabKANet achieves competitive performance with established tabular learning methods (XGBoost, CatBoost) across multiple benchmarks
- **Medium Confidence**: The specific architectural choices (KAN + Transformer + BN) contribute to performance improvements, though exact contribution weights are difficult to isolate
- **Medium Confidence**: Batch Normalization provides benefits over Layer Normalization for numerical features, though the magnitude varies by dataset

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies systematically varying KAN depth, B-spline parameters, and embedding dimensions to quantify architectural contributions
2. Test TabKANet's robustness to different noise types (Gaussian, missing values, outliers) across the full dataset spectrum
3. Evaluate scaling behavior on larger tabular datasets (10K+ samples, 100+ features) to assess practical deployment limits
