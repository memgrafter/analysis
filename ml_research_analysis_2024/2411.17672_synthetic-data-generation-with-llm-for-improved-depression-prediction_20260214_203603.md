# Synthetic Data Generation with LLM for Improved Depression Prediction

- Synthetic data generation pipeline using LLMs improved BERT depression prediction model performance

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a pipeline for generating synthetic data using Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve depression prediction models. Starting from unstructured clinical interview transcripts, the method generates synthetic synopses and sentiment analyses by prompting an LLM with chain-of-thought prompting. The pipeline first creates a synopsis and sentiment analysis from the original transcript, then generates a synthetic version with a new depression score, ensuring privacy by avoiding direct replication. Evaluated on the DAIC-WOZ dataset, the approach improved BERT model performance in predicting depression severity, achieving an RMSE of 4.64 and MAE of 3.66 when combining synthetic and real data, outperforming state-of-the-art models.

## Method Summary
The synthetic data generation pipeline consists of three main stages: (1) initial LLM prompting to generate synopses and sentiment analyses from original clinical transcripts using chain-of-thought prompting, (2) synthetic data generation with new depression scores while maintaining privacy constraints, and (3) model training using the augmented dataset. The approach leverages LLM capabilities to transform unstructured interview data into structured synthetic representations that preserve the essential characteristics of depression symptoms while creating privacy-preserving variations. The pipeline specifically addresses data scarcity in mental health research by expanding limited clinical datasets through controlled synthetic generation.

## Key Results
- Achieved RMSE of 4.64 and MAE of 3.66 for depression severity prediction using combined synthetic and real data
- Outperformed state-of-the-art models on the DAIC-WOZ dataset
- Successfully balanced the distribution of depression severity in synthetic data
- Maintained data fidelity while protecting privacy through non-direct replication

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method leverages LLMs' natural language understanding and generation capabilities to transform unstructured clinical interview transcripts into structured, privacy-preserving synthetic data. Chain-of-thought prompting enables the LLM to reason through the generation process, creating more coherent and clinically relevant synthetic representations. By generating new depression scores alongside synthetic transcripts, the approach creates a more balanced dataset that addresses the typical class imbalance in depression severity data. The LLM's inherent ability to abstract and generalize from input data provides a natural privacy mechanism without requiring explicit de-identification processes.

## Foundational Learning
- Chain-of-thought prompting: Enables LLMs to perform step-by-step reasoning for better output quality and consistency. Needed to ensure coherent synopsis and sentiment generation from clinical transcripts. Quick check: Compare outputs with and without chain-of-thought prompting.
- Data augmentation through synthetic generation: Creates additional training samples to address class imbalance and data scarcity. Needed to improve model generalization and performance on underrepresented depression severity levels. Quick check: Analyze class distribution before and after augmentation.
- Privacy-preserving synthetic data: Generates data that avoids direct replication of original records while maintaining statistical properties. Needed to comply with privacy regulations while expanding dataset size. Quick check: Conduct membership inference tests on synthetic vs. real data.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Clinical Transcripts -> LLM Chain-of-Thought Prompting -> Synopsis + Sentiment Analysis -> Synthetic Data Generation -> Augmented Dataset -> BERT Depression Prediction Model

**Critical Path:**
Clinical Transcripts → LLM Processing → Synthetic Data → Model Training

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- LLM size vs. generation speed: Larger models produce better quality but slower generation
- Synthetic data diversity vs. fidelity: More diverse generation risks losing original data characteristics
- Privacy protection vs. data utility: Stronger privacy constraints may reduce synthetic data usefulness

**Failure Signatures:**
- Poor model performance despite augmentation indicates synthetic data quality issues
- Privacy breaches despite safeguards suggest insufficient abstraction in generation
- Class imbalance persists after augmentation indicates generation bias

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Evaluate synthetic data quality by comparing statistical distributions with real data
2. Test model performance with varying ratios of synthetic to real data
3. Assess privacy protection by attempting to recover original transcripts from synthetic data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to single dataset (DAIC-WOZ), limiting generalizability
- Privacy protection relies on LLM properties without formal privacy metrics validation
- Performance improvements are modest, suggesting potential ceiling effects

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** Technical pipeline description and data generation methodology are well-documented and reproducible. Performance metrics (RMSE 4.64, MAE 3.66) are specific and verifiable.

**Medium Confidence:** Claims about improved model performance and balanced depression severity distribution are supported by results but need validation on independent datasets.

**Low Confidence:** Privacy protection assertions and uniqueness claims lack sufficient empirical backing or comparative analysis.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the pipeline on at least two additional depression datasets to assess generalizability beyond DAIC-WOZ
2. Conduct formal privacy analysis using established metrics (e.g., membership inference attacks) to quantify privacy protection claims
3. Perform ablation studies to determine relative contribution of each pipeline component to overall performance improvements
