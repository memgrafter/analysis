## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of translating culture-specific items (CSIs) in Chinese restaurant menus to English, focusing on figurative language and cultural nuances that traditional machine translation systems often miss. The authors introduce a novel dataset called ChineseMenuCSI, consisting of 4,275 bilingual menu entries annotated with CSI vs. Non-CSI labels and a fine-grained test set with three levels of CSI figurativeness. They propose new techniques for CSI identification that outperform existing GPT-based methods and integrate human translation theories into LLM-driven translation processes. The results show significant improvements in translation accuracy, with COMET scores increasing by up to 7 points across CSI categories. The study also demonstrates the effectiveness of using recipe information as external knowledge to enhance CSI translation performance.

## Method Summary
The authors tackle CSI translation by first creating a novel ChineseMenuCSI dataset through web scraping of restaurant menus and manual annotation. They develop a combined CSI identification method using Round-trip Translation, Cultural Uniqueness, and Historical Significance criteria that outperforms GPT-based approaches. For translation, they integrate human translation theories into LLM prompting strategies, including recipe-based translation (with optional recipe information) and translation studies-inspired approaches (equivalents and neutralisation strategies). The translation pipeline incorporates recipe information from the Xiachufang database as external knowledge when available, using BM25 ranking to retrieve the most relevant recipes for each dish.

## Key Results
- ChineseMenuCSI dataset contains 4,275 bilingual entries with fine-grained CSI categorization
- Combined CSI identification method outperforms GPT-based methods in accuracy
- Translation strategies integrating human translation theories show 3-7 point COMET score improvements
- Recipe-based knowledge retrieval enhances translation quality when relevant recipes are found
- Performance varies significantly across CSI categories, with abstract figurativeness being most challenging

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Recipe-based external knowledge improves translation of culturally nuanced CSIs by providing concrete ingredient and method details that ground abstract figurative language.
- Mechanism: When LLMs receive the recipe text alongside the dish name, they can map figurative CSI terms (e.g., "蚂蚁上树") to actual cooking steps and ingredients, enabling more accurate and descriptive translations rather than literal ones.
- Core assumption: Recipe instructions contain explicit references to CSI terms that can disambiguate their meaning in context.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "show how recipes can be optionally leveraged as a source of external knowledge to enhance CSI translation performance further"
  - [section]: "We explore using recipe information to improve the translation of CSI dish names... incorporating the most relevant recipe as external knowledge"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus shows related work on cultural adaptation but no direct evidence of recipe-based translation effectiveness
- Break condition: If recipes lack explicit mention of CSI terms or provide ambiguous instructions, the grounding benefit disappears.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Translation Studies-inspired prompting strategies (equivalents and neutralisation) outperform generic LLM prompting for CSI translation by explicitly guiding the model toward culturally appropriate rendering.
- Mechanism: By prompting the LLM to produce multiple translation strategies (cultural, functional, descriptive equivalents or neutralisation) and select the best one, the model leverages human translation theory to handle cultural gaps that standard translation would miss.
- Core assumption: LLMs can effectively reason about and apply human translation strategies when prompted with clear definitions and examples.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we are the first to integrate human translation theories into LLM-driven translation processes, significantly improving translation accuracy"
  - [section]: "we provide the prompt template for both of these strategies... incorporate human translation strategies, inspired by the rich literature in Translation Studies"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus shows related work on cultural awareness but no direct evidence of translation theory prompting effectiveness
- Break condition: If the LLM fails to understand the distinction between translation strategies or the prompt is not clear enough to trigger appropriate reasoning.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Fine-grained CSI categorization (concrete, creative, abstract) enables more targeted evaluation and adaptation strategies by revealing that translation difficulty and appropriate methods vary significantly across figurative levels.
- Mechanism: By classifying CSIs into three levels of figurativeness, the system can apply different translation strategies to each category and measure their effectiveness, revealing that complex figurative CSIs benefit most from specialized approaches.
- Core assumption: The degree of figurativeness in CSIs correlates with translation difficulty and the effectiveness of different adaptation strategies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We define three levels of CSI figurativeness for a more nuanced analysis"
  - [section]: "Our initial data inspection revealed that CSIs within these dish names contribute varying degrees of complexity to the translation process"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus shows related work on cultural translation but no direct evidence of categorization effectiveness
- Break condition: If the categorization proves too subjective or fails to capture meaningful differences in translation difficulty.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cultural equivalence in translation
  - Why needed here: Understanding how to translate culture-specific concepts requires knowing different approaches (cultural, functional, descriptive equivalents) rather than literal translation
  - Quick check question: What's the difference between translating "粽子" as "tamale" (cultural equivalent) versus "rice dumpling" (functional equivalent)?

- Concept: Figurative language identification
  - Why needed here: The system must distinguish between literal and figurative CSI terms to apply appropriate translation strategies
  - Quick check question: How would you classify "佛跳墙" (Buddha Jumps Over the Wall) in terms of figurativeness compared to "咕噜猪肉" (sweet and sour pork)?

- Concept: External knowledge integration
  - Why needed here: Using recipe information as context requires understanding how to retrieve, filter, and incorporate relevant external knowledge into the translation process
  - Quick check question: What information from a recipe would be most useful for translating a dish name like "水煮鱼"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Web scraping -> OCR extraction -> Text alignment -> Manual verification -> CSI identification (RTT + CU + HS) -> Recipe retrieval (BM25) -> Translation (LLM with prompting) -> Evaluation (COMET + human)
- Critical path: Data collection → CSI identification → Recipe retrieval → Translation with prompting → Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Manual annotation vs. automated identification (accuracy vs. scalability)
  - Recipe-based vs. theory-based prompting (contextual richness vs. explicit guidance)
  - Fine-grained categorization vs. simpler binary classification (nuanced analysis vs. broader applicability)
- Failure signatures:
  - Low COMET scores across all categories indicate fundamental translation issues
  - High scores for non-CSIs but low for CSIs suggest cultural awareness gap
  - Inconsistent performance across CSI categories indicates strategy mismatch
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare RTT-only vs. combined CSI identification method on a held-out sample to measure improvement
  2. Test each individual translation strategy (cultural, functional, descriptive) against the combined equivalents strategy
  3. Evaluate recipe-based prompting with and without the explain-then-translate component to isolate its contribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the proposed CSI identification method compare to other state-of-the-art methods beyond GPT-based prompts, such as those using entity linking or knowledge graphs?
- Basis in paper: [inferred]
- Why unresolved: The paper only compares the proposed method to GPT-based prompts and does not explore other potential approaches for CSI identification.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments comparing the proposed method to other CSI identification techniques, such as those using entity linking or knowledge graphs, on the same dataset.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the proposed translation strategies be effectively applied to other language pairs beyond Chinese-English, and how would their performance vary across different cultural contexts?
- Basis in paper: [inferred]
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on Chinese-English translation and does not explore the generalizability of the proposed strategies to other language pairs or cultural contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the proposed translation strategies to other language pairs and evaluating their performance across different cultural contexts using appropriate datasets and evaluation metrics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of the proposed methods change when using different types of external knowledge beyond recipes, such as cultural databases or domain-specific corpora?
- Basis in paper: [explicit]
- Why unresolved: The paper only explores the use of recipes as external knowledge and does not investigate the impact of other types of external knowledge on translation performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments using different types of external knowledge, such as cultural databases or domain-specific corpora, and comparing their impact on translation performance across CSI categories.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What are the specific challenges and limitations of applying the proposed methods to translate CSIs in spoken language, such as in dialogues or oral narratives, compared to written text?
- Basis in paper: [inferred]
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on translating CSIs in written text, such as restaurant menus, and does not address the unique challenges of translating CSIs in spoken language.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments on translating CSIs in spoken language datasets and analyzing the specific challenges and limitations compared to written text translation.

## Limitations
- Manual annotation approach may not scale to larger datasets or other language pairs
- Translation effectiveness heavily depends on quality and relevance of retrieved recipe information
- Study focuses specifically on Chinese restaurant menus, limiting generalizability to other cultural contexts
- Combined CSI identification method may have lower recall for certain CSI categories with historical significance

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The dataset creation methodology and the general framework for CSI identification are well-documented and reproducible. The improvements in COMET scores over baseline methods are clearly demonstrated.
- **Medium Confidence**: The translation strategies incorporating human translation theories show promising results, but the exact prompt formulations and their relative effectiveness across different CSI categories could benefit from more detailed analysis.
- **Low Confidence**: The scalability of the combined CSI identification method to other languages and cultural contexts remains untested, and the dependency on recipe information as external knowledge may not generalize well beyond food-related CSIs.

## Next Checks
1. Test the combined CSI identification method on a sample of English menus translated to Chinese to evaluate its bidirectional effectiveness and potential language-pair dependencies.
2. Conduct an ablation study isolating the impact of recipe-based knowledge from the translation strategies themselves to quantify their individual contributions to performance gains.
3. Evaluate the translation quality using human judges specifically focused on cultural appropriateness and naturalness rather than just semantic similarity metrics like COMET.
