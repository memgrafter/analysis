# The Reasons that Agents Act: Intention and Instrumental Goals

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.07221
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07221

- One-line primary result: The paper introduces a formal definition of intention for AI agents using structural causal influence models, establishing that their notion of intention corresponds to instrumental goals widely discussed in AI safety literature.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a formal definition of intention for AI agents using structural causal influence models. The key idea is that an agent intends to cause an outcome if guaranteeing that another action would also cause that outcome would make that action equally good for the agent. The authors show that their definition captures intuitive notions of intent, satisfies philosophical desiderata, and relates to concepts like actual causality and instrumental goals. They demonstrate how their behavioral definition of intent enables inferring intentions from reinforcement learning agents and language models by observing their adaptations to interventions.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a formal definition of intention using counterfactuals and structural causal influence models. They define that an agent intends to cause an outcome if there exists another action that would be equally good if it were guaranteed to cause that outcome. The framework uses counterfactual reasoning about what would happen under different interventions to determine intent. They demonstrate how this definition can be used to infer intentions from observed agent behavior, showing applications to reinforcement learning agents and language models.

## Key Results
- The paper proves soundness and completeness for graphical criteria of intention, which are identical to criteria for instrumental control incentives
- Their behavioral definition of intent enables inferring intentions from reinforcement learning agents and language models by observing adaptations to interventions
- The formal definition captures intuitive notions of intent and satisfies philosophical desiderata

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by using counterfactual reasoning to determine whether an agent's choice of action was intentional. If another action would become equally preferable if it were guaranteed to cause the outcome, then the agent is considered to intend that outcome. This formalizes the intuition that intentional actions are those where the agent would be equally satisfied with alternative means to achieve the same end.

## Foundational Learning
- Structural Causal Models: Mathematical framework for representing causal relationships
  - Why needed: Provides the formal foundation for reasoning about counterfactuals and intentions
  - Quick check: Can model simple causal relationships between variables
- Counterfactual Reasoning: Evaluating what would happen under hypothetical interventions
  - Why needed: Essential for determining if alternative actions would satisfy the agent equally
  - Quick check: Can correctly evaluate simple "what if" scenarios
- Instrumental Control Incentives: Situations where agents have reason to control certain variables
  - Why needed: Shows connection between intentions and established AI safety concepts
  - Quick check: Can identify when an agent has incentive to control specific variables

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Agent -> Actions -> Outcomes -> Counterfactuals -> Intention
Critical path: Observation of agent behavior → Construction of causal model → Application of counterfactual analysis → Determination of intention
Design tradeoffs: Formal precision vs. practical applicability in complex real-world scenarios
Failure signatures: Inability to capture intentions in cases where optimal actions change between contexts
First experiments:
1. Apply framework to a simple grid-world RL agent to validate basic functionality
2. Test on a language model completion task to assess cross-domain applicability
3. Examine a multi-agent scenario where agents can influence each other's intentions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper acknowledges that in cases where an agent's optimal action changes between decision contexts, the intention framework may fail to capture intuitive notions of intent. This raises questions about whether the framework can adequately handle all scenarios where agents exhibit goal-directed behavior.

## Limitations
- The framework may fail when an agent's optimal action changes between decision contexts
- Relies heavily on structural causal models and assumes ability to observe or infer counterfactuals
- Demonstrations use simplified settings compared to real-world deployment scenarios

## Confidence
- High confidence: The formal definition of intention using counterfactuals and structural causal influence models is mathematically sound and internally consistent
- Medium confidence: The equivalence between the intention definition and instrumental control incentives requires further empirical validation in diverse settings
- Medium confidence: The behavioral definition's ability to infer intentions from observed agent behavior needs broader testing across different agent architectures

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on multi-agent systems where agents can influence each other's intentions
2. Validate the behavioral definition against human-annotated intentions in complex decision-making scenarios
3. Examine cases where the optimal action changes across decision contexts to determine if modifications to the framework are needed
