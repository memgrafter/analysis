# MINT: a Multi-modal Image and Narrative Text Dubbing Dataset for Foley Audio Content Planning and Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.10591
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10591
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces MINT dataset and CPGA framework for Foley audio dubbing using multi-modal prompts (images and narrative text), achieving state-of-the-art results with a lightweight GPT-2 model.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the MINT dataset, the first multi-modal Foley audio dubbing dataset that combines images and narrative text. The dataset addresses limitations of existing text-to-audio datasets by providing complex multi-modal prompts. The authors propose the CPGA framework, which uses large language models for content planning and reinforcement learning for optimization, to generate high-quality Foley audio from these prompts. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in audio generation quality compared to existing methods.

## Method Summary
The MINT dataset was constructed by expanding the AudioCaps dataset with images from YouTube videos and generating long narrative texts using LLMs. The CPGA framework consists of three modules: Content Planning (using GPT-2 to generate audio captions from multi-modal prompts), Generation (using a modified Tango diffusion model), and Alignment (using PPO-based reinforcement learning to optimize audio quality). The model was trained in two stages: a warm-up phase on high-quality data pairs, followed by reinforcement learning fine-tuning using acoustic similarity rewards.

## Key Results
- MINT dataset significantly improves multi-modal dubbing tasks compared to existing datasets
- CPGA framework outperforms open-source multimodal large models like LLaVA, DeepSeek-VL, and Moondream2
- Lightweight GPT-2 model achieves state-of-the-art results, demonstrating efficiency of the approach
- Reinforcement learning with PPO significantly improves alignment and auditory realism of generated Foley audio

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: MINT dataset enhances Foley audio dubbing by providing complex multi-modal prompts that include narrative texts and images, addressing the limitations of existing text-to-audio (TTA) datasets.
- Mechanism: The dataset's inclusion of long narrative texts and intricate visual expressions from images allows for more accurate and contextually rich audio captions, improving the realism and generalization of Foley audio generation.
- Core assumption: The complexity and richness of the multi-modal prompts in MINT will lead to better audio generation compared to simpler, more acoustically-focused datasets.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "MINT provides multi-modal prompts including images and narrative texts, aiming to improve the realism and generalization of Foley audio generation."
  - [section] "MINT dataset was constructed, representing, to our best knowledge, the first dataset for multi-modal Foley audio dubbing involving long narrative texts and images."
- Break condition: If the narrative texts and images do not provide sufficient context or if the audio generation models cannot effectively utilize the complex prompts, the intended improvement in realism and generalization may not be achieved.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The CPGA framework improves Foley audio generation by leveraging large language models (LLMs) for content planning, addressing the limitations of existing TTA technology in understanding and planning complex prompts.
- Mechanism: The Foley Audio Content Planning module uses LLMs to fuse and analyze multi-modal information, producing accurate textual descriptions that guide the audio generation process.
- Core assumption: LLMs have the capability to deeply understand and synthesize information from multi-modal inputs, leading to more accurate and contextually relevant audio captions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The proposed CPGA framework leverages large language models for content planning, generating accurate audio captions from complex multi-modal prompts."
  - [section] "The Foley Audio Content Planning module leverages large language models (LLMs) to enhance comprehension of complex texts and cross-modal prompts."
- Break condition: If the LLMs are not effectively trained on the multi-modal data or if they fail to capture the necessary context, the content planning may not improve the audio generation process.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The use of reinforcement learning with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) optimizes the alignment and auditory realism of generated Foley audio.
- Mechanism: PPO directly tunes the model's parameters by maximizing a reward function that reflects the quality of the audio output, ensuring that the generated audio is both contextually accurate and acoustically rich.
- Core assumption: Reinforcement learning can effectively optimize the audio generation process by providing feedback based on the acoustic similarity between generated and authentic audio samples.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the training process is optimized using Proximal Policy Optimization based reinforcement learning, significantly improving the alignment and auditory realism of generated foley audio."
  - [section] "Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) serves as the method of choice within this reinforcement learning framework to accomplish end-to-end alignment."
- Break condition: If the reward function does not accurately capture the desired audio qualities or if the PPO algorithm fails to converge, the optimization may not lead to improved auditory realism.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multi-modal learning
  - Why needed here: Understanding how to effectively integrate and process information from multiple modalities (images and text) is crucial for generating contextually relevant Foley audio.

  - Why needed here: Reinforcement learning is used to optimize the audio generation process by providing feedback based on the quality of the generated audio.
  - Quick check question: How does reinforcement learning differ from supervised learning, and what are the advantages of using it for audio generation?
- Concept: Diffusion models
  - Why needed here: Diffusion models are used in the audio generation process to create high-quality audio that aligns closely with the text inputs.
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of a diffusion model, and how do they contribute to the generation of realistic audio?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: MINT Dataset -> Content Planning Module -> Audio Generation Module -> Alignment Module -> Optimized Audio Output
- Critical path: MINT Dataset → Content Planning Module → Audio Generation Module → Alignment Module → Optimized Audio Output
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using a lightweight GPT-2 model instead of larger LLMs to balance performance and computational efficiency
  - Focusing on end-to-end optimization to avoid cumulative errors, even if it requires more complex training processes
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor alignment between generated audio and multi-modal prompts, indicating issues in content planning or generation
  - Low auditory realism, suggesting problems in the reinforcement learning optimization or the quality of the audio samples used for training
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the MINT dataset with existing TTA models to quantify the improvement in audio generation quality
  2. Evaluate the CPGA framework with different LLMs to determine the impact of model size and complexity on performance
  3. Compare the results of using PPO-based reinforcement learning with other optimization techniques to assess its effectiveness in improving auditory realism
