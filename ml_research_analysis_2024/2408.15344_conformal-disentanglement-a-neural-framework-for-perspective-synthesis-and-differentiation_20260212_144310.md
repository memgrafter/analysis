# Conformal Disentanglement: A Neural Framework for Perspective Synthesis and Differentiation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.15344
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15344
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Neural autoencoder framework for disentangling common and unique features across heterogeneous observations using bi-level optimization with orthogonality constraints

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a neural network framework for the "Common & Uncommon Variable" problem, which involves identifying shared features across multiple heterogeneous observations and separating unique information from each source. The method uses a structured autoencoder with common and uncommon encoder components, trained through a bi-level optimization approach. The framework successfully recovers underlying structures in synthetic dynamical systems and high-dimensional image data, demonstrating the ability to generate level sets of consistent observations and handle time-delayed data to establish correlational causality.

## Method Summary
The method employs a structured autoencoder architecture where each sensor has separate common and uncommon encoder components that feed into shared decoders. The bi-level optimization strategy first identifies the common subspace by minimizing reconstruction and common matching losses, then disentangles uncommon components by adding orthogonality constraints between uncommon and common encoder gradients. This approach leverages gradient orthogonality to enforce functional independence between common and uncommon latent representations, providing a geometric, unsupervised alternative to statistical disentanglement methods.

## Key Results
- Successfully recovers underlying structures in synthetic dynamical systems with low reconstruction errors (1.0e-4 test loss)
- Demonstrates disentanglement on high-dimensional image data (bobblehead example)
- Establishes correlational causality through accurate "postdiction" of earlier states from later observations in time-delayed scenarios
- Generalizes to multiple sensors and handles time-delayed observations effectively

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The two-level optimization strategy stabilizes disentanglement by first identifying the common subspace before imposing orthogonality constraints. In level one, the network jointly minimizes reconstruction loss and common matching loss, forcing the common encoders to find aligned latent representations. In level two, with common encoders frozen, orthogonality constraints between uncommon and common gradients force the uncommon encoders to lie in perpendicular subspaces. Core assumption: The common subspace can be identified independently of the uncommon components, and the orthogonality constraint only becomes meaningful after the common space is well-defined.

### Mechanism 2
Orthogonality of gradients in latent space enforces functional independence between common and uncommon components. The Lorthogonality term penalizes the ℓ2 norm of inner products between gradients of uncommon encoder outputs and common encoder outputs. This forces the tangent spaces of the uncommon and common submanifolds to be perpendicular at each data point. Core assumption: Local functional independence (perpendicular tangent spaces) implies global disentanglement of the subspaces.

### Mechanism 3
Time-delayed observations still allow identification of the common system because the diffeomorphism between common observations is deterministic and known (flow map). Even with a constant lag ∆t, the state of the common system at time t+∆t is a deterministic function of the state at time t. The network can learn this correlation, effectively learning the flow map and enabling "postdiction" of earlier states from later observations. Core assumption: The underlying dynamics are deterministic and smooth enough for the network to approximate the flow map.

## Foundational Learning

- **Manifold learning and intrinsic vs extrinsic dimensionality**: Why needed here: The method assumes observations lie on low-dimensional submanifolds embedded in high-dimensional space; understanding this distinction is key to designing encoders/decoders. Quick check: If a circle is embedded in R³, what are its intrinsic and extrinsic dimensions?

- **Autoencoder architecture and latent space regularization**: Why needed here: The network structure separates common/uncommon encoders and uses orthogonality as a regularizer; familiarity with these building blocks is essential. Quick check: How does adding an orthogonality penalty to an autoencoder loss function affect the geometry of the latent space?

- **Differential geometry (tangent spaces, orthogonality of submanifolds)**: Why needed here: The orthogonality constraint is defined via gradients; understanding tangent spaces and their orthogonality is crucial to grasping why the method works. Quick check: In what sense are two submanifolds "orthogonal" at a point of intersection?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Sensor observations → Common encoder + Uncommon encoder → Concatenated latent vectors → Decoder → Reconstructed observations

- **Critical path**: 1) Forward pass through encoders → latent vectors, 2) Decoder reconstructs inputs, 3) Compute losses (reconstruction + common matching in level 1; add orthogonality in level 2), 4) Backward pass and update weights (freeze common encoders in level 2), 5) Iterate until convergence

- **Design tradeoffs**: Using gradient orthogonality vs statistical independence (geometric but local vs statistical but global), two-level training vs joint training (more stable but slower), fixed latent dimensions vs learned (simpler but requires prior knowledge)

- **Failure signatures**: Poor reconstruction loss (encoders/decoders not learning identity mapping), common encoders diverging (common matching loss not effective), residual entanglement (orthogonality constraint insufficient or ill-posed)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Train on synthetic Example 2 data; verify common encoders align and uncommon encoders are orthogonal, 2) Visualize latent embeddings colored by known ground-truth variables; check smoothness, 3) Test on time-delayed version of Example 2; verify ability to "postdict" earlier states from later ones

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the performance of the conformal disentanglement framework scale with the number of sensors and systems beyond the two-sensor, three-system setup demonstrated in the paper? The paper states "It is straightforward to extend to different settings with multiple sensors" but does not provide empirical evidence or theoretical analysis for scenarios with more sensors or more complex commonality patterns.

### Open Question 2
Under what conditions do geometric disentanglement (orthogonality constraints) and statistical disentanglement (conditional independence) coincide, and how can we identify these conditions a priori? The authors note "Depending on the problem at hand, the definition of independence matters" and acknowledge that geometric and statistical disentanglement may not generically coincide, but do not explore when these approaches might yield equivalent results.

### Open Question 3
What are the fundamental mathematical obstructions to achieving complete block-diagonalization of the metric tensor in higher dimensions, and how do these relate to the data's underlying manifold structure? The paper acknowledges theoretical limitations from differential geometry regarding diagonalization in dimensions 3 or 4 and above, but does not quantify these obstructions for practical datasets or explain how manifold curvature specifically impacts disentanglement quality.

## Limitations

- Limited empirical validation beyond synthetic examples; performance on real-world high-dimensional data with complex noise structures remains untested
- Assumes common subspaces can be reliably identified before imposing orthogonality constraints, which may not hold for highly nonlinear or time-varying systems
- Theoretical limitations from differential geometry may prevent complete disentanglement in higher dimensions, though practical impact is not quantified

## Confidence

- **Mechanism 1 (Bi-level Optimization)**: Medium - Concept is well-founded but lacks extensive empirical validation across diverse scenarios
- **Mechanism 2 (Gradient Orthogonality)**: Medium - Theoretical justification exists but practical sufficiency for disentanglement is not rigorously proven
- **Mechanism 3 (Time-delayed Observations)**: Low-Medium - Novel approach with demonstration on synthetic data, but real-world chaotic dynamics could break the method

## Next Checks

1. Test the framework on real-world sensor data with known ground truth (e.g., climate or financial time series) to verify common feature identification and disentanglement accuracy

2. Systematically vary the dimensionality of common/uncommon subspaces to determine the method's sensitivity to prior knowledge requirements and identify breaking points

3. Apply the method to datasets with known chaotic dynamics (e.g., Lorenz system) to assess performance degradation under sensitive dependence on initial conditions
