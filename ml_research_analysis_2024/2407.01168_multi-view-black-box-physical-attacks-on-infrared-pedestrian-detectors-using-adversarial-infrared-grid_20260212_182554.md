# Multi-View Black-Box Physical Attacks on Infrared Pedestrian Detectors Using Adversarial Infrared Grid

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.01168
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01168
- Authors: Kalibinuer Tiliwalidi; Chengyin Hu; Weiwen Shi
- Reference count: 8
- Primary result: Achieves 91.86% attack success rate in physical environments using adversarial infrared grids

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces AdvGrid, a novel method for performing black-box physical adversarial attacks on infrared pedestrian detectors. The approach models perturbations as structured grids and optimizes them using a genetic algorithm to maximize attack success while maintaining stealth. By embedding cold patches inside clothing rather than on the surface, the perturbations remain undetectable to human observers while still affecting infrared imaging. The method demonstrates effectiveness across multiple detector architectures and maintains robustness through cyclic perturbation application and Expectation Over Transformation (EOT) framework.

## Method Summary
AdvGrid models adversarial perturbations as structured infrared grids and optimizes them using a genetic algorithm. The method involves binary encoding of grid parameters, population initialization, and fitness calculation based on attack success rates. EOT framework enhances robustness against viewing variations, while Thin Plate Spline (TPS) mapping handles physical deployment on clothing. The approach achieves both digital and physical attack success while maintaining stealth through internal placement of perturbations inside clothing.

## Key Results
- Achieves 91.86% attack success rate in physical environments
- Outperforms baseline methods including PGD, I-FGSM, MIFGSM, and TIMI
- Maintains stealth by embedding perturbations inside clothing, invisible to naked eye

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Grid-based genetic algorithm optimization effectively evades infrared detectors
- Mechanism: Systematic grid placement with genetic optimization maximizes attack effectiveness
- Core assumption: Grid patterns optimized by genetic algorithm can deceive infrared detectors
- Evidence: Method models perturbations as grid format using genetic algorithm optimization
- Break condition: Advanced detector features resistant to grid-based perturbations

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Internal clothing placement maintains stealth
- Mechanism: Cold patches inside clothing affect infrared imaging while remaining invisible
- Core assumption: Internal perturbations invisible to human observers
- Evidence: Design ensures ordinary observers cannot detect perturbations without thermal cameras
- Break condition: Clothing material negates perturbation effect or observers detect temperature differences

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multi-view robustness through cyclic application and EOT
- Mechanism: Cyclic perturbation application combined with EOT simulates various viewing conditions
- Core assumption: Cyclic perturbations with EOT maintain effectiveness across angles
- Evidence: Perturbations cyclically applied to clothing parts for multi-view attacks
- Break condition: Cyclic placement fails to cover critical angles or EOT inadequately simulates conditions

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Genetic Algorithm Optimization
  - Why needed here: Optimizes physical parameters for maximum attack effectiveness while maintaining stealth
  - Quick check: How does the algorithm balance exploration with exploitation of perturbation patterns?

- Concept: Expectation Over Transformation (EOT) Framework
  - Why needed here: Enhances robustness against various viewing conditions and transformations
  - Quick check: What transformations does EOT typically simulate for adversarial sample robustness?

- Concept: Thin Plate Spline (TPS) Framework
  - Why needed here: Maps perturbations from digital to physical domains accounting for clothing deformation
  - Quick check: How does TPS handle clothing deformation during mapping?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Simulation and modeling -> Binary encoding and population initialization -> Digital perturbation conversion -> EOT robustness enhancement -> Genetic algorithm optimization -> TPS robustness enhancement -> Physical deployment
- Critical path: Simulation → genetic algorithm optimization → EOT/TPS enhancement → physical deployment
- Design tradeoffs: Grid approach provides systematic coverage but may be more detectable; internal placement enhances stealth but may reduce effectiveness
- Failure signatures: Low attack success rates indicate ineffective patterns; high visibility indicates compromised stealth; inconsistent performance indicates insufficient robustness
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test digital attack effectiveness with various grid dimensions and colors to optimize genetic algorithm parameters
  2. Validate physical stealth by having observers detect perturbations without infrared sensors
  3. Measure attack success rates from different angles and distances to evaluate multi-view robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does AdvGrid perform against infrared detectors using transformer-based architectures compared to non-transformer models?
- Basis: Paper mentions inferior effectiveness against DETR detectors based on Transformer architecture
- Why unresolved: Lacks detailed analysis of architectural differences contributing to performance gap
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies between AdvGrid's performance on transformer and non-transformer detectors

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the long-term effects of repeated physical attacks using AdvGrid on infrared detectors in real-world environments?
- Basis: Study focuses on immediate effectiveness without addressing cumulative effects
- Why unresolved: Primarily evaluates isolated experiments without considering detector adaptation over time
- What evidence would resolve it: Long-term field studies tracking detector performance under repeated attacks

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does AdvGrid perform in environments with varying temperature conditions?
- Basis: Mentions use of cold patches maintaining 24°C for 10 hours but doesn't explore varying environmental temperatures
- Why unresolved: Focuses on controlled conditions without addressing environmental temperature variations
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results across temperature ranges with necessary adjustments

## Limitations

- Evaluation relies on single dataset (FLIR) and six specific detectors, limiting generalizability
- Physical attack experiments conducted in controlled environments without real-world variations
- Stealth evaluation depends on human observers without infrared sensors, not reflecting trained security personnel

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Basic mechanism of using infrared grid perturbations is well-supported by experimental results
- **Medium Confidence**: 91.86% physical attack success rate reasonably supported but limited by scope of testing
- **Low Confidence**: Claims of outperforming all baselines not fully supported due to limited comparison scope

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Dataset Validation**: Test AdvGrid on additional infrared pedestrian detection datasets beyond FLIR to assess generalizability across different sensors and conditions.

2. **Real-World Deployment Testing**: Conduct physical attacks in uncontrolled outdoor environments with varying weather, pedestrian movement patterns, and distances to validate real-world effectiveness.

3. **Extended Baseline Comparison**: Compare AdvGrid against a broader range of state-of-the-art physical adversarial attack methods to determine genuine advantages of the grid-based approach.
