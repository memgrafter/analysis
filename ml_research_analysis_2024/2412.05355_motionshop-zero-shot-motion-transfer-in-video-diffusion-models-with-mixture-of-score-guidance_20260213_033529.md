# MotionShop: Zero-Shot Motion Transfer in Video Diffusion Models with Mixture of Score Guidance

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.05355
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05355
- Reference count: 40
- State-of-the-art motion transfer performance with 0.913 Motion Fidelity and 0.928 Temporal Consistency scores

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Mixture of Score Guidance (MSG), a novel zero-shot motion transfer method for diffusion transformers that operates directly on pre-trained video diffusion models without additional training or fine-tuning. The key innovation lies in reformulating conditional score functions to decompose motion and content scores, formulating motion transfer as a mixture of potential energies in score space. The authors demonstrate successful handling of diverse scenarios including single object, multiple objects, cross-object motion transfer, and complex camera motion transfer while preserving scene composition.

## Method Summary
MSG operates by extracting motion representations from reference videos using conditional scores at early diffusion timesteps (t=10% of total), then applying mixture of score guidance during generation. The method uses Langevin dynamics with modified potential energy functions to guide the sampling process, combining the content score with a weighted difference between motion reference and prior scores. This allows MSG to transfer motion patterns from reference videos to generated content while maintaining temporal consistency and motion fidelity. The approach is evaluated on MotionBench, a comprehensive dataset containing 200 source videos and 1000 transferred sequences across various motion categories.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 0.913 Motion Fidelity and 0.928 Temporal Consistency scores
- Successfully handles diverse motion transfer scenarios including single/multiple object and camera motion transfer
- Introduces MotionBench, the first comprehensive motion transfer dataset with 200 source videos and 1000 transferred sequences

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
MSG successfully transfers motion by decomposing the conditional score into motion and content components. The score function ∇z log pt(z|y) is reformulated as a mixture of potential energies in score space, allowing separate treatment of motion patterns and scene content. The method combines the content score with a weighted difference between motion reference and prior scores.

**Core assumption:** Early diffusion timesteps encode predominant motion patterns that can be isolated and transferred
**Evidence anchors:** The score function can be separated into motion and content components through conditional reformulation
**Break condition:** If motion patterns are not predominantly encoded in early timesteps, or if motion and content scores cannot be cleanly separated

### Mechanism 2
MSG operates directly on pre-trained video diffusion models without requiring additional training or fine-tuning. The method uses conditional score reformulation and Langevin dynamics with modified potential energy functions to guide the sampling process, leveraging existing model capabilities rather than retraining.

**Core assumption:** Pre-trained diffusion models contain sufficient motion representation capacity in their score functions to enable zero-shot transfer
**Evidence anchors:** The method operates directly on pre-trained video diffusion models without additional training or fine-tuning
**Break condition:** If pre-trained models lack sufficient motion representation capacity, or if zero-shot operation fails to maintain generation quality

### Mechanism 3
MSG naturally extends to complex scenarios including multi-motion synthesis and complex camera motion transfer. The theoretical framework based on mixture of potential energies can handle multiple reference motions and camera trajectories through the same score guidance mechanism.

**Core assumption:** The score mixture formulation is flexible enough to incorporate multiple motion sources and different motion types
**Evidence anchors:** MSG demonstrates successful handling of diverse scenarios including single object, multiple objects, and cross-object motion transfer as well as complex camera motion transfer
**Break condition:** If the score mixture formulation cannot accommodate multiple motion sources or complex motion types

## Foundational Learning

- **Diffusion Process and Score Functions**: Understanding how diffusion models work and how score functions encode information is fundamental to grasping MSG's theoretical foundations
  - *Why needed here*: The method's theoretical foundation relies on score function reformulation
  - *Quick check question*: How does the score function ∇z log p(z|y) differ from the unconditional score ∇z log p(z)?

- **Langevin Dynamics and Stochastic Differential Equations**: MSG's formulation is based on modifying Langevin dynamics through mixture of potential energies, requiring understanding of these underlying stochastic processes
  - *Why needed here*: The sampling process uses modified Langevin dynamics with mixture of potential energies
  - *Quick check question*: What role does the potential energy function U(zt) play in standard Langevin dynamics?

- **Classifier-Free Guidance**: MSG builds upon classifier-free guidance concepts, extending them to motion transfer scenarios through score mixture formulations
  - *Why needed here*: The method extends classifier-free guidance concepts to motion transfer
  - *Quick check question*: How does classifier-free guidance modify the conditional score in standard diffusion sampling?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Reference motion extraction → Motion transfer through score guidance → MSG path redirection
- **Critical path**: Motion extraction → Score guidance formulation → Modified Langevin dynamics → Generated video with transferred motion
- **Design tradeoffs**: Zero-shot operation (no training) vs. potentially lower performance compared to fine-tuned methods; theoretical elegance vs. practical complexity; flexibility vs. computational overhead
- **Failure signatures**: Poor motion fidelity when motion patterns are not well-represented in early timesteps; temporal inconsistency when content score mixing is not properly balanced; artifacts when reference and target videos have significantly different characteristics
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Single object motion transfer validation - verify basic functionality by transferring simple object motions (e.g., horse jumping)
  2. Multi-object motion transfer testing - evaluate handling of complex scenarios with multiple moving entities
  3. Camera motion transfer evaluation - test performance on various camera trajectory types (pan, tilt, zoom, dolly)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How does the choice of early diffusion timestep (t ≪ T) affect motion transfer quality across different motion categories?
- **Basis in paper**: The paper states they consistently use t=10% of total timesteps, but also shows ablation studies on timestep ratios (0.05, 0.10, 0.25)
- **Why unresolved**: The paper only shows results for one specific motion transfer task and doesn't explore whether different motion categories might benefit from different timestep choices
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Systematic testing of optimal timestep ratios across all three motion categories in MotionBench dataset

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: Can the theoretical relationship between score mixing and Langevin dynamics be extended to multi-reference motion transfer?
- **Basis in paper**: The paper mentions MSG extends to "multi-motion synthesis" but doesn't provide theoretical formulation for multiple reference videos
- **Why unresolved**: The current MSG formulation only shows how to combine one reference motion with content, but the theoretical connection to mixture of potential energies hasn't been generalized to multiple reference motions
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Mathematical formulation showing how to combine N reference motions using mixture of potential energies

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: What is the relationship between motion extraction strength and generalization to unseen motion patterns?
- **Basis in paper**: The ablation study shows optimal strength is 0.7 for horse jumping motion, but doesn't test generalization to other motion types
- **Why unresolved**: The paper only demonstrates one optimal value without exploring whether this generalizes across motion types
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Empirical study showing motion extraction strength performance across all motion categories in MotionBench

## Limitations
- The theoretical decomposition mechanism lacks extensive direct corpus evidence
- Practical implementation details for score mixing weight (wMSG) remain underspecified
- Complex scenario handling (multi-motion synthesis) hasn't been extensively validated

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims:**
- MSG achieves state-of-the-art quantitative results on MotionBench (0.913 Motion Fidelity, 0.928 Temporal Consistency)
- The method successfully handles single object and camera motion transfer scenarios
- MSG operates without requiring additional training or fine-tuning

**Medium Confidence Claims:**
- The theoretical decomposition of conditional score into motion and content components
- Zero-shot operation capability on pre-trained diffusion models
- Extension to multi-object motion transfer scenarios

**Low Confidence Claims:**
- Handling of complex camera motion transfer across all trajectory types
- Robustness to significantly different source and reference video characteristics
- Performance consistency across diverse motion categories beyond benchmark tests

## Next Checks
1. **Score Decomposition Validation**: Implement controlled experiments to verify that motion patterns are predominantly encoded in early diffusion timesteps as claimed. Compare motion representations extracted at different timesteps against ground truth motion patterns using quantitative metrics like motion similarity scores.

2. **Cross-Domain Transfer Testing**: Test MSG's robustness by transferring motions between videos with significantly different characteristics (e.g., transferring human motion to animal videos, or indoor to outdoor scenes). Measure degradation in motion fidelity and temporal consistency to identify limitations.

3. **Real-Time Performance Evaluation**: Measure the computational overhead of MSG compared to standard video diffusion sampling. Benchmark inference time and memory usage on typical hardware configurations to assess practical deployment feasibility.
