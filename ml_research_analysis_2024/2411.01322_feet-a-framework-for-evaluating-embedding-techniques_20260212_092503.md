# FEET: A Framework for Evaluating Embedding Techniques

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.01322
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01322
- Reference count: 9
- Primary result: Introduces FEET framework standardizing foundation model evaluation across frozen, few-shot, and fine-tuned embedding scenarios

## Executive Summary
This paper presents FEET (Framework for Evaluating Embedding Techniques), a standardized protocol for benchmarking foundation models across three embedding scenarios: frozen embeddings (untrained pre-trained features), few-shot embeddings (adaptation with limited examples), and fully fine-tuned embeddings (extensive task-specific training). The framework addresses current inconsistencies in foundation model evaluation by providing structured tables with delta calculations that quantify performance improvements or declines across adaptation scenarios. Demonstrated through sentiment analysis and antibiotic susceptibility prediction case studies, FEET reveals that different models excel under different embedding conditions and that fine-tuning can sometimes degrade performance due to overfitting or suboptimal hyperparameters.

## Method Summary
FEET standardizes foundation model evaluation through three scenarios: frozen embeddings where pre-trained features are used without training, few-shot embeddings with limited examples (powers of 2 up to 2^10 shots), and fully fine-tuned embeddings with extensive task-specific training. The framework recommends specific metrics based on task type—accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for NLP tasks, and AUROC/AUPRC for medical prediction. FEET tables present performance metrics for all three scenarios alongside delta calculations that quantify improvement margins from the frozen baseline. The authors demonstrate the framework using SST-2 dataset for sentiment analysis (comparing BERT, DistilBERT, and GPT-2) and MIMIC-IV ED dataset for antibiotic susceptibility prediction (comparing BioClinicalBERT, MedBERT, and SciBERT).

## Key Results
- Fine-tuning can degrade performance due to overfitting or suboptimal hyperparameters, challenging the assumption that more training always improves results
- BioClinicalBERT excels in frozen embedding scenarios while MedBERT performs better with few-shot and fine-tuned approaches, demonstrating model-specific adaptation characteristics
- Standardized delta calculations in FEET tables enable quick identification of which models excel under which conditions and quantify improvement margins

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: FEET's three-scenario evaluation captures the full spectrum of foundation model adaptation capabilities
- Mechanism: Systematically evaluating models across frozen → few-shot → fine-tuned scenarios reveals how pre-trained representations transfer to new tasks and where fine-tuning adds value or introduces degradation
- Core assumption: Model performance follows a predictable trajectory with quantifiable improvements or declines
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions categorization into three use cases; section on "Evaluating foundation models through Frozen, Few-shot, and Fine-tuned embeddings" discusses essential insights; corpus papers focus on specific applications rather than systematic frameworks
- Break condition: Inconsistent performance patterns across scenarios that cannot be explained by dataset characteristics or hyperparameter settings

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: FEET tables standardize reporting and enable meaningful cross-model comparisons through delta calculations
- Mechanism: Presenting performance metrics for all three scenarios in tabular format with delta calculations enables researchers to quickly identify optimal models for each condition
- Core assumption: Standardized tables with delta metrics provide clearer insights than ad-hoc reporting
- Evidence anchors: Section on "The FEET Table offers a structured and comprehensive way to present performance" and "∆ FEET Table focuses on illustrating relative improvements"; corpus papers don't discuss standardized evaluation protocols
- Break condition: Delta calculations dominated by noise or baseline frozen performances too low for meaningful improvement metrics

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: FEET addresses inconsistencies in current benchmarking practices by standardizing shot counts and evaluation metrics
- Mechanism: Recommending specific shot counts (powers of 2 up to 2^10) and flexible metric selection based on task domain eliminates arbitrary choices in few-shot learning evaluations
- Core assumption: Standardizing shot counts to powers of 2 provides sufficient granularity while maintaining consistency
- Evidence anchors: Section recommending "standardizing the evaluation of few-shot learning by reporting performance at powers of 2^N, up to 2^10"; examination of benchmarking inconsistencies in Figure 1; corpus papers don't discuss benchmarking inconsistencies
- Break condition: Certain tasks requiring non-standard shot counts or insufficient domain-specific metrics

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Transfer learning and representation learning
  - Why needed here: FEET evaluates how well pre-trained representations transfer to new tasks under different adaptation scenarios
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes transfer learning from traditional supervised learning in terms of data requirements and model initialization?

- Concept: Few-shot learning methodology
  - Why needed here: FEET's few-shot scenario requires understanding support/query set separation and similarity-based classification
  - Quick check question: How does the support set size affect the reliability of few-shot learning performance metrics?

- Concept: Statistical significance testing
  - Why needed here: FEET delta calculations require determining whether performance differences are meaningful
  - Quick check question: When comparing model performances across scenarios, what statistical test would you use to determine if delta values are significant?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preparation → Model evaluation across three scenarios → Metric calculation → Delta computation → FEET table generation → Analysis
- Critical path: Data preparation → Model evaluation across three scenarios → Metric calculation → Delta computation → FEET table generation → Analysis
- Design tradeoffs: Comprehensive evaluation vs. computational cost; standardized metrics vs. domain-specific needs; detailed reporting vs. interpretability
- Failure signatures: Inconsistent performance patterns across scenarios, high variance in delta calculations, or failure to capture task-specific nuances
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement frozen embedding evaluation for a simple NLP task using pre-trained BERT and compare with random baseline
  2. Add few-shot evaluation with 2, 4, 8, 16 shots and verify delta calculations are meaningful
  3. Implement full fine-tuning evaluation and check that performance trends align with expectations across all three scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Under what specific conditions does fine-tuning degrade model performance, and how can these negative effects be systematically predicted or mitigated?
- Basis in paper: The paper explicitly states that fine-tuning can sometimes degrade performance due to overfitting, suboptimal hyperparameters, or distortion of pre-trained representations, and provides specific examples from their antibiotic susceptibility prediction case study
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies potential causes of performance degradation during fine-tuning, it doesn't provide a comprehensive framework for predicting when this will occur or systematic methods for preventing it
- What evidence would resolve it: A predictive framework that identifies risk factors for fine-tuning degradation across different model architectures and tasks, along with validated mitigation strategies that consistently prevent performance drops

### Open Question 2
- Question: How should researchers determine the optimal number of shots for few-shot learning tasks, and what theoretical basis exists for the powers-of-2 recommendation?
- Basis in paper: The authors recommend standardizing few-shot evaluation by reporting performance at powers of 2N, up to 210, but don't provide theoretical justification for this specific approach
- Why unresolved: The paper presents this recommendation without explaining why powers of 2 are optimal, whether this applies universally across all tasks, or how to determine when to stop at 210 shots
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing different shot-number selection strategies across diverse tasks, along with theoretical analysis explaining the mathematical properties that make certain shot numbers more informative than others

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the FEET framework be extended to evaluate foundation models in multimodal contexts where text, image, and other data types are combined?
- Basis in paper: The paper focuses on text-based foundation models and evaluates them in unimodal contexts (sentiment analysis and medical text prediction), but doesn't address how the framework would apply to multimodal models like CLIP or GPT-4V
- Why unresolved: The current FEET framework is designed for embedding techniques in text-based models, and extending it to multimodal contexts would require addressing how to handle different input modalities, alignment between modalities, and appropriate evaluation metrics for combined inputs
- What evidence would resolve it: A validated extension of FEET that demonstrates consistent application across multimodal tasks, showing how frozen, few-shot, and fine-tuned evaluations translate to multimodal contexts with appropriate metrics for each modality combination

## Limitations
- The framework's effectiveness depends on the quality of underlying foundation models and appropriateness of chosen shot counts for specific tasks
- The 2^N shot count recommendation up to 2^10 may not be optimal for all domains, particularly those with very limited data or highly imbalanced classes
- Generalization to other domains like computer vision, reinforcement learning, or multimodal tasks remains untested beyond the two demonstrated case studies

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The framework's basic architecture and three-scenario evaluation approach (frozen/few-shot/fine-tuned) is sound and addresses a real need for standardized evaluation in the field
- **Medium confidence**: The specific shot count recommendations (powers of 2 up to 1024) and delta calculation methodology will prove universally useful across diverse applications
- **Low confidence**: The framework will eliminate all inconsistencies in current benchmarking practices and become the definitive standard for foundation model evaluation

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-domain validation**: Apply FEET to at least three additional domains (e.g., computer vision, reinforcement learning, multimodal tasks) to assess generalizability beyond NLP and medical prediction
2. **Statistical robustness analysis**: Conduct repeated trials with different random seeds to quantify variance in delta calculations and determine minimum sample sizes needed for reliable comparisons
3. **Alternative shot count evaluation**: Compare performance using the recommended 2^N shot counts against alternative schedules (linear, logarithmic, domain-specific) to validate the power-of-2 recommendation
