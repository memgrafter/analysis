core_contribution: This paper investigates the emergence of sensorimotor agency in
  cellular automata, specifically in a continuous cellular automata system called
  Lenia. The authors propose an approach using diversity search, curriculum learning,
  and gradient descent to automate the search for environmental conditions that lead
  to the self-organization of robust agents with sensorimotor capabilities.

# Discovering Sensorimotor Agency in Cellular Automata using Diversity Search

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2402.10236
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10236
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: Successfully discovered sensorimotor agents in continuous cellular automata using diversity search and curriculum learning

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a method for discovering sensorimotor agency in continuous cellular automata (Lenia) by combining diversity search, curriculum learning, and gradient descent. The approach automates the search for environmental conditions that lead to self-organizing agents with navigation and obstacle avoidance capabilities. Through systematic experimentation, the authors demonstrate that their method can discover agents exhibiting primitive forms of sensorimotor agency, including self-maintenance, navigation, and emergent interactions with other agents.

## Method Summary
The method uses Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration Processes (IMGEP) to efficiently explore the parameter space of Lenia, combined with curriculum learning to progressively build more complex agent capabilities. The approach treats Lenia as a differentiable system, enabling gradient-based optimization of both rule parameters and initial conditions. The search process samples increasingly distant goals, using previously discovered agents as stepping stones to focus computational resources on promising parameter regions while avoiding the majority of parameter space that leads to collapse or explosion.

## Key Results
- Successfully discovered agents that can self-constitute, self-maintain, and navigate among obstacles
- Agents demonstrate strong generalization to changes in scale, random updates, and perturbations not seen during training
- Discovered agents exhibit emergent interactions including individuality preservation, attraction, and reproduction when interacting with other agents

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Diversity search (IMGEP) enables efficient navigation of chaotic Lenia dynamics by guiding the search toward sparse moving agents
- Core assumption: The parameter space contains sparse but reachable islands of moving agents
- Evidence anchors: Abstract and methodology sections describing IMGEP implementation
- Break condition: If parameter space is truly random with no structure

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Curriculum learning enables emergence of sensorimotor capabilities by progressively increasing task difficulty
- Core assumption: Robust sensorimotor agents can be built incrementally
- Evidence anchors: Abstract and methodology sections describing curriculum stages
- Break condition: If system exhibits catastrophic forgetting

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Gradient descent through differentiable Lenia enables precise optimization of agent parameters toward specific behavioral goals
- Core assumption: Lenia dynamics are sufficiently smooth and differentiable
- Evidence anchors: Abstract and methodology sections describing differentiable optimization
- Break condition: If Lenia dynamics are too chaotic or non-differentiable

## Foundational Learning

- **Cellular automata dynamics and chaos**: Understanding why random parameter search rarely finds moving agents requires grasping the chaotic nature of cellular automata
  - Quick check: Why do most random parameter configurations in cellular automata lead to collapse rather than stable patterns?

- **Intrinsically motivated goal exploration**: IMGEP is the core algorithmic framework enabling efficient discovery of diverse agent behaviors
  - Quick check: How does IMGEP differ from traditional novelty search in terms of goal sampling?

- **Differentiable programming and backpropagation through time**: The method relies on treating Lenia as a differentiable system
  - Quick check: What makes cellular automata like Lenia suitable for differentiation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Lenia environment -> IMGEP search algorithm -> evaluation components
- **Critical path**: IMGEP loop → Lenia rollout → loss computation → gradient descent → parameter update → evaluation → history update
- **Design tradeoffs**: Differentiable Lenia enables precise optimization but requires careful parameterization; diversity search balances exploration efficiency against computational cost
- **Failure signatures**: Random search outperforms IMGEP (no structure in parameter space), agents fail to generalize (overfitting), gradient descent fails to converge (non-differentiability)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Random parameter search baseline, 2) Basic IMGEP implementation, 3) Curriculum learning testing

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- What are the formal definitions of agency and sensorimotor capabilities that can be applied to high-dimensional systems like Lenia?
- How can environmental rules be evolved systematically to generate more advanced agent behaviors and potentially achieve open-ended evolution?
- What are the implications of this work for understanding agency and cognition in large AI systems like large language models?

## Limitations

- Effectiveness depends on assumption that parameter space contains structured regions of moving agents
- Method assumes gradient descent can effectively navigate parameter space despite potential instability
- Curriculum learning approach may suffer from catastrophic forgetting

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Discovery of agents with basic movement capabilities
- **Medium confidence**: Agents demonstrate strong generalization to perturbations
- **Medium confidence**: Emergent agent interactions represent primitive forms of sensorimotor agency
- **Low confidence**: IMGEP provides significant efficiency advantage over random search

## Next Checks

1. Implement systematic random parameter search with same computational budget as IMGEP to quantify efficiency advantage

2. Design controlled experiments testing agent performance across systematic variations in obstacle density and grid size

3. Systematically vary differentiability of Lenia dynamics by modifying kernel parameters and observe effects on optimization success rates
