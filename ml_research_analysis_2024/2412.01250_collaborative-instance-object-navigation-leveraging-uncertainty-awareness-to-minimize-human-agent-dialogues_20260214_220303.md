# Collaborative Instance Object Navigation: Leveraging Uncertainty-Awareness to Minimize Human-Agent Dialogues

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.01250
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01250
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Training-free AIUTA method achieves 14.47% success rate with 1.68 questions per successful episode on CoIN-Bench

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Collaborative Instance Navigation (CoIN), a new embodied AI task where an agent must locate a specific object instance through natural language dialogues with a human user. The key challenge is minimizing user input while accurately identifying the target instance among visually similar objects. The proposed AIUTA method uses a training-free approach that leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and a Large Language Model (LLM) in a self-dialogue to refine object descriptions and reduce perception uncertainty. An Interaction Trigger module determines when to ask questions, continue navigation, or halt based on alignment scores. On the CoIN-Bench benchmark, AIUTA achieves competitive performance while minimizing user effort, with real human evaluations showing flexibility in handling arbitrary user inputs.

## Method Summary
AIUTA is a training-free method for Collaborative Instance Navigation that combines VLM perception with LLM reasoning through a self-dialogue mechanism. The approach uses a base VLFM zero-shot navigation policy to explore the environment, while the Self-Questioner module initiates a self-dialogue between VLM and LLM to refine object descriptions by estimating and reducing uncertainty. The Interaction Trigger module uses LLM-computed alignment scores to decide when to ask questions, continue exploration, or halt navigation. The method processes visual observations through object detection, generates initial descriptions, refines them through iterative self-dialogue with uncertainty estimation, and makes navigation decisions based on similarity thresholds. AIUTA is evaluated on CoIN-Bench, an adapted version of GOAT-Bench with multiple instance scenarios, using both VLM-simulated users and real human evaluations.

## Key Results
- AIUTA achieves 14.47% success rate on CoIN-Bench with an average of 1.68 questions per successful episode
- The method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in balancing success rate with minimal user interaction
- Real human evaluations show success rates up to 87.50% with flexible handling of arbitrary user inputs
- Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of normalized entropy for VLM uncertainty estimation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Self-dialogue between LLM and VLM iteratively refines object descriptions and reduces uncertainty.
- **Mechanism**: LLM prompts VLM to generate an initial description, then generates clarifying questions, collects answers, estimates uncertainty per attribute using normalized entropy, and filters uncertain attributes to produce a refined description.
- **Core assumption**: LLM can generate effective questions and uncertainty labels that improve VLM perception accuracy.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "Self-Questioner model initiates a self-dialogue within the agent to obtain a complete and accurate observation description with a novel uncertainty estimation technique."
  - [section 4.1]: Describes the three-step process: initial description generation, uncertainty estimation via Shannon entropy, and refinement filtering uncertain attributes.
  - [corpus]: Weak; corpus does not directly address self-dialogue mechanisms, but the paper cites prior work on VLM uncertainty.
- **Break condition**: If LLM-generated questions are irrelevant or uncertainty estimation is inaccurate, the refinement step fails to improve descriptions.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Interaction Trigger uses alignment scores to decide when to ask questions, continue, or stop navigation.
- **Mechanism**: LLM computes similarity score between refined description and known target facts; thresholds determine action: high score stops navigation, low score skips interaction, intermediate score triggers a clarifying question.
- **Core assumption**: LLM can reliably estimate similarity scores between natural language descriptions.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "Interaction Trigger module determines whether to ask a question to the human, continue or halt navigation, minimizing user input."
  - [section 4.2]: Details threshold-based decision logic using LLM-estimated alignment scores.
  - [corpus]: Weak; no direct corpus evidence of LLM-based alignment scoring in navigation tasks.
- **Break condition**: Poor threshold tuning or unreliable LLM scoring leads to unnecessary questions or missed targets.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Normalized entropy provides effective VLM uncertainty estimation, outperforming alternatives.
- **Mechanism**: Uses Shannon entropy over restricted vocabulary {Yes, No, I don't know} to compute normalized uncertainty; thresholds determine certainty/uncertainty.
- **Core assumption**: VLM responses over this restricted vocabulary yield meaningful entropy-based uncertainty estimates.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section 4.1]: Describes entropy computation and normalization: "H(pVLM) = -∑p(yi)logp(yi)" and "u = H/Hmax".
  - [section 6]: Ablation II shows normalized entropy achieves best Φc=1 score on IDKVQA dataset.
  - [corpus]: Weak; no direct corpus comparison of normalized entropy vs other uncertainty methods.
- **Break condition**: If VLM outputs are not well-calibrated probabilities, entropy-based uncertainty becomes unreliable.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) interaction.
  - **Why needed here**: VLMs provide visual perception but may hallucinate; LLMs can reason and generate questions to refine descriptions.
  - **Quick check question**: Can you explain how LLM-generated questions improve VLM output quality in this context?

- **Concept**: Shannon entropy and uncertainty quantification.
  - **Why needed here**: Entropy measures uncertainty in VLM responses; normalized entropy allows thresholding for certainty/uncertainty.
  - **Quick check question**: How does normalizing entropy over a restricted vocabulary help in estimating VLM uncertainty?

- **Concept**: Embodied navigation with human-agent collaboration.
  - **Why needed here**: The task requires dynamic interaction during navigation rather than pre-navigation instruction.
  - **Quick check question**: What distinguishes this collaborative navigation from traditional pre-instructioned navigation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: VLFM zero-shot policy (frontier and value maps) → Object detection → Self-Questioner (VLM+LLM self-dialogue) → Interaction Trigger (LLM decision) → Human interaction → Updated target facts → Back to VLFM

- **Critical path**: Detection → Self-Questioner refinement → Interaction Trigger decision → Navigation action

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Training-free vs. trained policies: flexibility vs. potentially lower performance
  - Real human vs. VLM-simulated user: authenticity vs. scalability
  - Number of questions: minimizing user effort vs. ensuring target identification

- **Failure signatures**:
  - No refinement: VLM fails to detect target, empty description returned
  - High uncertainty: Many attributes filtered out, description too vague
  - Poor threshold tuning: Unnecessary questions or missed stops

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Test Self-Questioner on static images with known target facts to measure refinement quality
  2. Vary τ threshold values on IDKVQA to find optimal certainty cutoff
  3. Run Interaction Trigger alone on CoIN-Bench subset to measure question efficiency

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would AIUTA perform with different LLM and VLM combinations, such as smaller models suitable for on-device processing?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses limitations of AIUTA's dependence on large LLMs and VLMs, noting that high computational costs prohibit on-board processing and require cloud-based services.
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates AIUTA using specific large models (LlaVA-NeXT and Llama 3.1) and does not explore alternative model combinations or smaller, more efficient models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing AIUTA's performance using various LLM/VLM combinations, including smaller models optimized for on-device processing, would provide insights into its adaptability and real-world deployment potential.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of varying the maximum number of interaction rounds on AIUTA's performance and user experience?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that user interaction is limited to a maximum of 4 rounds but does not explore the effects of different limits.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide an analysis of how changing the maximum interaction rounds affects success rates, path efficiency, or user satisfaction.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments varying the maximum interaction rounds (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8) and measuring their impact on success rate, number of questions, and user experience would clarify the optimal interaction limit.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does AIUTA handle ambiguous or contradictory responses from human users during interactions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper describes AIUTA's ability to ask clarifying questions and update target object facts based on user responses, but does not address how it deals with potentially conflicting or unclear answers.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not discuss mechanisms for detecting or resolving ambiguities in user responses, which could impact the accuracy of target identification.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments introducing ambiguous or contradictory user responses and analyzing AIUTA's handling of such scenarios would reveal its robustness in real-world interactions.

## Limitations

- Training-free approach may limit performance compared to specialized trained models, despite offering flexibility
- Heavy dependence on large LLMs and VLMs creates computational costs that prohibit on-board processing
- The threshold-based Interaction Trigger decision logic may be brittle to different scene complexities and user communication styles

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The self-dialogue mechanism for description refinement (tested on IDKVQA dataset with ablation results)
- **Medium Confidence**: The overall CoIN task formulation and benchmark (novel but with limited baseline comparisons)
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability of VLM-based uncertainty estimation across diverse real-world scenarios

## Next Checks

1. Test AIUTA's performance degradation when the VLM produces hallucinations or highly uncertain responses to test robustness
2. Evaluate how different threshold values (τ) in the Interaction Trigger affect success rates across various scene complexities
3. Compare AIUTA against trained models specifically designed for object navigation to quantify the training-free approach's limitations
