# FreqX: Analyze the Attribution Methods in Another Domain

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.18343
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18343

- Primary result: Introduces FreqX, a frequency domain interpretability method that runs 10x faster than baselines while preserving privacy in personalized federated learning

## Executive Summary
FreqX presents a novel interpretability method for personalized federated learning that operates in the frequency domain to analyze neural network attributions. The method addresses three key limitations in existing interpretability approaches: high computational costs, privacy preservation requirements, and the need for detailed information. By leveraging signal processing and information theory concepts, FreqX enables layer-by-layer analysis of how neural networks classify samples while maintaining computational efficiency and privacy guarantees.

The approach demonstrates that neural networks are highly sensitive to frequency information, showing that deletion of just 10% of important frequencies can completely change predictions, compared to 30% in the time domain. This frequency-based analysis provides both attribution and concept information, enabling mapping of network transformations back to the original sample space and extraction of important features for potential use in calculating participant contributions in federated learning scenarios.

## Method Summary
FreqX introduces a frequency domain approach to interpretability in personalized federated learning by decomposing input samples into frequency components using signal processing techniques. The method analyzes how neural networks process and classify samples layer by layer in the frequency domain, identifying important frequencies that contribute to predictions. By operating in the frequency domain, FreqX achieves significant computational efficiency gains while preserving privacy since frequency representations can be computed locally without sharing raw data. The approach maps network transformations back to the original sample space, enabling extraction of important features and attribution of predictions to specific frequency components.

## Key Results
- Demonstrates 10x computational speedup compared to baseline interpretability methods
- Shows that deleting 10% of important frequencies completely changes predictions versus 30% in time domain
- Successfully maps network transformations to original sample space while preserving privacy
- Contains both attribution and concept information for federated learning scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the inherent properties of neural networks in processing frequency information. Neural networks naturally decompose input data into hierarchical features, and frequency domain analysis aligns with this decomposition process. By operating in the frequency domain, the method exploits the sparse nature of important frequency components, reducing computational complexity while maintaining interpretability. The approach also benefits from the mathematical properties of frequency transforms, which provide a natural framework for analyzing how information flows through network layers and how different frequency components contribute to final predictions.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Raw Input -> Frequency Decomposition -> Layer-by-Layer Analysis -> Attribution Mapping -> Feature Extraction

**Critical Path**
1. Input sample frequency decomposition using FFT or wavelet transforms
2. Layer-by-layer frequency analysis through neural network
3. Attribution mapping from frequency components to predictions
4. Feature extraction and privacy-preserving representation

**Design Tradeoffs**

- Layer analysis misalignment causing attribution errors
- Privacy leakage through frequency representation
- Computational bottlenecks in frequency processing

**First Experiments**
1. Compare frequency domain vs. time domain deletion sensitivity on simple classification tasks

3. Validate privacy preservation by testing frequency representation leakage

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions for future research.

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation to computer vision tasks, reducing generalizability to other domains
- Privacy preservation claims lack formal security analysis and differential privacy guarantees
- Attribution method validation relies heavily on qualitative assessments rather than quantitative metrics
- Performance in highly heterogeneous federated learning scenarios not thoroughly evaluated

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims:**

## Next Checks

1. Conduct comprehensive ablation studies varying dataset heterogeneity levels to assess method robustness across different federated learning scenarios.

2. Perform formal privacy analysis using established frameworks like differential privacy metrics to quantify privacy guarantees and identify potential vulnerabilities.

3. Compare FreqX's attribution quality against established baselines using quantitative metrics like faithfulness, stability measures, and correlation with ground truth feature importance.
