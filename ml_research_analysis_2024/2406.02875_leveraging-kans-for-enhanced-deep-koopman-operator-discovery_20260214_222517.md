# Leveraging KANs For Enhanced Deep Koopman Operator Discovery

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.02875
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02875
- Reference count: 23
- KANs learned 31× faster, used 15× fewer parameters, and achieved 1.25× better accuracy than MLPs for Koopman operator discovery

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as a replacement for traditional MLPs in deep Koopman operator discovery. KANs use learnable spline-based activation functions that enable more efficient linearization of nonlinear dynamical systems. The authors demonstrate that KANs significantly outperform MLPs on both the pendulum and orbital two-body problems, achieving faster training times, better accuracy, and requiring fewer training trajectories. The learned Koopman operators also enable effective linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control. These results suggest KANs offer a promising approach for discovering Koopman operators in real-world nonlinear systems where data efficiency and computational resources are critical constraints.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes replacing traditional MLPs with KANs for deep Koopman operator discovery, leveraging KANs' learnable spline-based activation functions to better capture nonlinear dynamics. The method involves training KANs to approximate the Koopman operator that linearizes the system dynamics, using either forward or auto-encoder architectures. The learned operator is then used to design LQR controllers for the linearized system. Experiments are conducted on the pendulum and two-body orbital problems, comparing KAN performance against MLPs across training speed, parameter efficiency, accuracy, and control effectiveness metrics.

## Key Results
- KANs trained 31× faster than MLPs on both test systems
- KANs used 15× fewer parameters while maintaining superior accuracy (1.25× better)
- For two-body problem: KANs trained in under 3.5 minutes using 30 trajectories vs. 47 minutes and 200 trajectories for MLPs
- KAN-learned Koopman operators enabled effective LQR control implementation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
KANs leverage learnable spline-based activation functions that can adaptively capture complex nonlinear relationships in dynamical systems. Unlike fixed activation functions in MLPs, these splines can adjust their shape during training to better approximate the Koopman operator's action on the system states. This flexibility allows KANs to achieve better generalization with fewer parameters and faster convergence, particularly for systems with smooth but nonlinear dynamics like the pendulum and orbital mechanics problems tested.

## Foundational Learning
- Koopman operator theory: Linear operator that enables linearization of nonlinear dynamical systems by transforming to an infinite-dimensional space where dynamics are linear
  - Why needed: Provides the theoretical foundation for representing nonlinear dynamics in a form amenable to linear control techniques
  - Quick check: Verify that the system satisfies the conditions for Koopman operator existence (observability, ergodicity)

- Spline basis functions: Piecewise polynomial functions used as learnable activation functions in KANs
  - Why needed: Enable adaptive, smooth nonlinear transformations that can capture complex system dynamics more efficiently than fixed activations
  - Quick check: Confirm spline knot placement and basis function count are appropriate for the system's complexity

- LQR control: Linear quadratic regulator for optimal control of linear systems
  - Why needed: Demonstrates practical utility of learned Koopman operators for real control applications
  - Quick check: Verify controllability and observability of the linearized system before applying LQR

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input states -> KAN layers with learnable spline activations -> Koopman operator -> Reconstructed states

Critical path: Data collection → KAN training → Koopman operator extraction → LQR controller design → System control

Design tradeoffs:
- Spline complexity vs. training efficiency: More knots provide better approximation but increase computational cost
- Forward vs. auto-encoder architecture: Forward may be simpler but auto-encoder can enforce reconstruction constraints
- Parameter count vs. generalization: Fewer parameters improve efficiency but may limit representational capacity

Failure signatures:
- Poor convergence: Indicates inadequate spline complexity or learning rate issues
- Inaccurate reconstruction: Suggests insufficient training data or architectural limitations
- Unstable LQR control: Points to inaccurate Koopman operator learning or linearization errors

First experiments:
1. Train KAN on pendulum system with varying spline knot counts to identify optimal complexity
2. Compare forward and auto-encoder architectures on the two-body problem for reconstruction accuracy
3. Test LQR performance with KAN-learned operators against ground truth linearizations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited scope to low-dimensional, relatively simple dynamical systems (pendulum, two-body problem)
- No exploration of hyperparameter sensitivity for spline knot placement and count
- Minimal detail on LQR control performance metrics and comparative analysis
- Uncertain scalability to high-dimensional chaotic systems with multiple time scales

## Confidence
- Efficiency claims (31× faster, 15× fewer parameters): Medium confidence - results are clear but need broader validation
- Accuracy claims (1.25× better accuracy): Medium confidence - limited test cases reduce generalizability
- Control application (LQR effectiveness): Low confidence - insufficient detail on performance metrics and comparisons

## Next Checks
1. Test KAN-based Koopman discovery on high-dimensional chaotic systems (Lorenz attractor or double pendulum) to verify scaling properties and computational advantages for complex dynamics

2. Conduct ablation studies varying spline knot numbers and placement strategies across multiple dynamical systems to determine architectural sensitivity and generalizability

3. Compare KAN-based Koopman operators against alternative linearization approaches (dynamic mode decomposition variants, neural ODEs) on a standard benchmark suite of nonlinear dynamical systems to establish relative performance in accuracy and computational efficiency
