# Alternatives of Unsupervised Representations of Variables on the Latent Space

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.20172
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20172
- Reference count: 6
- The paper demonstrates beta-VAE can effectively organize variables in 2D latent space, supporting exploratory analysis and insight discovery.

## Executive Summary
This paper explores using variational autoencoders (beta-VAE) to represent variables in a low-dimensional latent space, enabling visualization, disentanglement, and interpretability. Five methods are introduced for variable representation: straightforward transposition, univariate metadata, adjacency matrices, gradient mappings, and combined approaches. Twenty-eight variations are tested, including gradient-based cross-product relationships to capture variable dependencies. The approach handles both continuous and categorical data, using reinforced entanglement for one-hot encoded labels. Synthetic data and real-world examples (MNIST and Canadian interest rates) demonstrate successful disentanglement of variable types, ordering by characteristics, and revealing hidden patterns without explicit business attributes.

## Method Summary
The methodology uses beta-VAE to encode variables into a 2D latent space, preserving intrinsic dependencies through controlled posterior distribution. The approach involves five main representation methods: straightforward transposition of data, univariate statistics with metadata, adjacency matrices capturing variable relationships, gradient mappings using pairwise cross-products, and combined approaches. For categorical variables, reinforced entanglement is implemented through additional all-ones/all-zeros columns in one-hot encoded representations. The framework processes both continuous and categorical data, with synthetic data generation covering various distributions and dependency types for validation.

## Key Results
- Beta-VAE successfully disentangles variable types in latent space, with independent variables forming distinct clusters from dependent variables
- Gradient cross-product methodology reveals orthogonal relationships between variables with high-magnitude cross-products
- Reinforced entanglement keeps one-hot encoded categorical variables spatially grouped in latent space
- Variable ordering in latent space reflects inherent characteristics (scale, distribution, dependencies) without explicit business attributes
- Hidden patterns emerge in latent representations of real-world data (Canadian interest rates) that aren't apparent in raw form

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Beta-VAE encodes variables into a 2D latent space while preserving intrinsic dependencies through controlled posterior distribution.
- Mechanism: The KL divergence term in the loss function encourages the posterior distribution to approximate an isotropic normal distribution, creating a structured latent space where variable relationships manifest as spatial arrangements.
- Core assumption: The beta hyperparameter (0.3 in this paper) appropriately balances reconstruction accuracy with latent space regularization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The beta variational autoencoder (β-VAE) has been selected as an unsupervised method of representing high dimensional data on the low dimensional latent space acknowledging the following properties: (1) capability to control posterior distribution closeness to the isotropic normal distribution"
  - [section 2.2] "Variational autoencoding is a stochastic process, and therefore, the representations on the latent space vary from fitting to fitting. It can be attributed mostly to the isotropic property of the posterior distribution towards 2D normal distribution."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct corpus support for beta-VAE's role in variable representation, only general VAE literature.
- Break condition: If beta is too high, latent space becomes too regularized and loses meaningful variable relationships; if too low, space becomes unstructured and loses interpretability.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Pairwise gradient cross-products capture spot relationships between variables by measuring orthogonality of gradient vectors in latent space.
- Mechanism: For any two variables, gradient vectors are computed along latent space axes, then cross-product magnitudes quantify their local independence - high values indicate orthogonal (independent) changes, near-zero values indicate confounded relationships.
- Core assumption: Linear interpolation on a 35x35 grid provides sufficient resolution to estimate meaningful gradients without overfitting.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.4] "Pairwise spot relationships between variables can be estimated for any observation and, therefore, possess 'curse of dimensionality' of O(N*K2) size"
  - [section 2.4] "The pairwise spot cross product addresses relationships between the changes of two variables, such as orthogonal, confounded positive, confounded negative, and everything in between"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct corpus support for gradient cross-product methodology for variable representation.
- Break condition: If latent space resolution is too coarse, gradient estimates become unreliable; if too fine, overfitting occurs and cross-products become noise-dominated.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Reinforced entanglement of one-hot encoded categories groups categorical variable representations in latent space through additional all-ones/all-zeros columns.
- Mechanism: By adding M columns with all-ones for one-hot encoded rows and all-zeros otherwise, the autoencoder receives explicit signal that these dummy variables represent a single categorical entity, forcing their spatial clustering.
- Core assumption: The additional columns don't overwhelm the original variable information while still providing sufficient entanglement signal.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2] "To represent categorical variables on the latent space, encoding them as numeric vectors first is required... One-hot encoding is the most popular and straightforward approach... After including these ten dummy binary variables, the example of the combined representation of pixels and ten dummy variables on the latent space is shown in Figure 9, b"
  - [section 4.2] "To address this issue, the reinforced entanglement of one-hot encoded categories has been introduced. It includes additional M columns with the following values: all-one values for the rows corresponding to the one-hot encoded variables, and all-zero values, otherwise"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct corpus support for this specific reinforcement technique for categorical variable representation.
- Break condition: If M is too large relative to original variables, the latent space becomes dominated by entanglement columns rather than meaningful relationships.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Beta-VAE architecture and loss function
  - Why needed here: Understanding how the KL divergence term shapes the latent space is crucial for interpreting why variable relationships manifest as spatial arrangements
  - Quick check question: What role does the beta hyperparameter play in balancing reconstruction accuracy versus latent space regularization?

- Concept: Gradient computation and cross-product relationships
  - Why needed here: The gradient-based approach for measuring variable relationships requires understanding of numerical differentiation and vector operations
  - Quick check question: How does the magnitude of a cross-product between two gradient vectors indicate the independence or confounding of those variables?

- Concept: One-hot encoding and categorical variable representation
  - Why needed here: Proper handling of categorical variables requires understanding both the encoding mechanism and why standard one-hot encoding scatters representations in latent space
  - Quick check question: Why does standard one-hot encoding fail to keep categorical representations together in latent space, and how does reinforcement solve this?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing (duplication, reshuffling, subsampling) -> Beta-VAE encoder (flatten -> dense layers -> 2D latent space) -> Gradient computation module (interpolation -> gradient estimation -> cross-product) -> Latent space visualization -> Analysis
- Critical path: Data preparation -> VAE training -> Latent space mapping -> Gradient analysis -> Interpretation
- Design tradeoffs: Higher beta values provide better disentanglement but may lose reconstruction accuracy; more gradient grid points improve resolution but increase computation; reinforced entanglement helps categorical variables but adds dimensionality
- Failure signatures: Random patterns in latent space (poor beta choice), gradients dominated by noise (insufficient grid resolution), scattered categorical representations (missing reinforcement), computational timeouts (excessive subsampling)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run VAE on synthetic data with known linear dependencies using straightforward transposed approach - verify variables align along expected dimensions
  2. Apply gradient cross-product method to the same synthetic data - check that orthogonal dependencies show high cross-product magnitudes
  3. Test reinforced entanglement on MNIST labels - confirm one-hot encoded categories cluster together in latent space

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the 28 different beta-VAE approaches vary when applied to high-dimensional real-world datasets beyond the synthetic and MNIST examples presented?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "Twenty-eight approaches of variable representations by beta-VAE have been considered" and demonstrates results on synthetic data, MNIST, and Canadian interest rates, but does not extensively compare performance across diverse real-world datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on three specific examples and qualitative analysis. A comprehensive quantitative comparison across diverse high-dimensional real-world datasets is needed to determine which approaches generalize best.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic benchmark study applying all 28 approaches to a wide range of high-dimensional real-world datasets (e.g., genomics, finance, image data) with quantitative metrics (clustering accuracy, reconstruction error, disentanglement scores) would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal aggregation method for the pairwise spot magnitudes of cross products in different data scenarios, and how does it impact the interpretability of variable relationships?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces four aggregation options for the cross product magnitudes but does not provide a definitive recommendation or analysis of their performance differences.
- Why unresolved: The paper presents the aggregation methods but lacks a comparative analysis to determine which method is optimal for different types of variable relationships and data structures.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study comparing the four aggregation methods on datasets with known ground truth relationships, evaluating their ability to preserve true variable dependencies and interpretability, would resolve this.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the reinforced entanglement technique for one-hot encoded categorical variables perform compared to alternative methods for representing categorical variables in beta-VAE, and what are its limitations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces reinforced entanglement for one-hot encoded categories but does not compare it to alternative encoding methods or discuss its limitations.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates the technique on MNIST labels, it lacks a comparison to other categorical variable representation methods and does not address potential limitations or failure modes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments applying reinforced entanglement versus alternative methods (e.g., ordinal encoding, entity embeddings) on diverse datasets with categorical variables, along with analysis of failure cases, would resolve this.

## Limitations
- Limited empirical validation with only three datasets (synthetic, MNIST, Canadian interest rates) makes generalization claims uncertain
- Beta-VAE hyperparameters (particularly beta=0.3) appear arbitrary without systematic sensitivity analysis
- The gradient cross-product methodology lacks established theoretical grounding and validation
- No statistical significance testing or error bounds reported for qualitative assessments
- The QFD framework for evaluation is subjective and lacks standardized scoring criteria

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Beta-VAE can produce 2D latent representations and capture some variable relationships (basic functionality established)
- **Medium Confidence**: The five proposed representation methods work as described, based on synthetic and MNIST demonstrations
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about revealing "hidden patterns" and business insights without explicit attributes, as these are qualitative observations without rigorous validation

## Next Checks

1. **Systematic hyperparameter sensitivity**: Test beta values across a range (0.1 to 1.0) and document impact on latent space structure and variable disentanglement quality
2. **Cross-dataset generalization**: Apply the methodology to diverse real-world datasets with known variable relationships and quantify performance using objective metrics (e.g., correlation preservation, cluster purity for categorical variables)
3. **Comparison with established methods**: Benchmark against alternative dimensionality reduction techniques (t-SNE, UMAP, PCA) and variable representation approaches using standardized evaluation metrics
