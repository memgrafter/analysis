# Controllable Unlearning for Image-to-Image Generative Models via $\varepsilon$-Constrained Optimization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.01689
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01689
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: This paper introduces a framework for controllable unlearning in image-to-image generative models using ε-constrained optimization, achieving significant improvements in unlearning completeness while maintaining model utility.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of machine unlearning in image-to-image generative models, focusing on the need for controllable trade-offs between unlearning completeness and model utility. The authors propose a framework that reformulates unlearning as an ε-constrained optimization problem, using a control coefficient ε to balance these competing objectives. By solving this problem with gradient-based methods, the framework identifies Pareto optimal solutions that allow users to select the desired trade-off. Experiments on two benchmark datasets across three I2I generative models (MAE, VQ-GAN, and diffusion models) demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, showing significant improvements in unlearning completeness while maintaining model utility compared to baseline methods. The framework also provides fine-grained control over the degree of unlearning, offering flexible solutions to meet varied user expectations.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a controllable unlearning framework for image-to-image generative models that reformulates the unlearning problem as an ε-constrained optimization. The framework uses a control coefficient ε to balance the trade-off between unlearning completeness (forgetting the forget set) and model utility (retaining performance on the retain set). The optimization problem is solved using a gradient-based method, specifically a variant of the Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) algorithm, to find Pareto optimal solutions. The framework consists of two phases: Phase I identifies the boundary solutions by solving special cases of the ε-constrained problem, and Phase II generates a continuum of Pareto optimal solutions by varying ε within the identified valid range. The choice of control function ψ(θ) and its parameters significantly impacts the efficiency and stability of the unlearning process.

## Key Results
- The proposed framework achieves significant improvements in unlearning completeness while maintaining model utility compared to baseline methods.
- The framework provides fine-grained control over the degree of unlearning by allowing users to select the desired trade-off through the control coefficient ε.
- Experiments on two benchmark datasets across three I2I generative models (MAE, VQ-GAN, and diffusion models) demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of the method.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The controllable unlearning framework achieves Pareto optimal trade-offs between unlearning completeness and model utility by reformulating the problem as an ε-constrained optimization.
- Mechanism: By treating the unlearning objective as a constraint with a control coefficient ε, the framework allows users to adjust the trade-off between forgetting the target data (forget set) and preserving performance on retained data (retain set). This formulation guarantees that every solution within the valid ε range is Pareto optimal.
- Core assumption: The unlearning objectives (f1 for forget set and f2 for retain set) are convex and continuously differentiable near the solution points.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "reformulate the I2I generative model unlearning problem into a ε-constrained optimization problem and solve it with a gradient-based method to find optimal solutions for unlearning boundaries."
  - [section 4.2]: "we select a special variant of the SQP algorithm for its lower complexity and comparable convergence guarantee."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; no direct mention of ε-constrained optimization in neighboring papers, but related concepts like "gradient-based" and "Pareto optimal" appear in similar contexts.
- Break condition: If the objectives are non-convex or not continuously differentiable, the solutions may only be weakly Pareto optimal instead of strictly Pareto optimal.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The two-phase approach efficiently identifies boundary solutions and allows fine-grained control over unlearning completeness.
- Mechanism: Phase I finds the extreme Pareto optimal points (highest and lowest unlearning completeness) by solving special cases of the ε-constrained problem. Phase II relaxes the constraint by varying ε within the identified range to generate a continuum of Pareto optimal solutions.
- Core assumption: The boundary solutions obtained in Phase I accurately define the valid range for ε, and the control function ψ(θ) is appropriately chosen to ensure convergence.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.3]: "we reformulate Eq. (6) into a special form to obtain the solution for the boundaries of unlearning."
  - [section 4.4]: "we investigate the influence of the control function ψ(θ) on convergence rates across different phases."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; no direct mention of two-phase approaches, but "boundary points" and "Pareto optimal" concepts are relevant.
- Break condition: If the boundary solutions are incorrectly identified or the valid ε range is not properly determined, the framework may not provide the intended controllable trade-offs.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The choice of control function ψ(θ) and its parameters significantly impacts the efficiency and stability of the unlearning process.
- Mechanism: By analyzing convergence rates under different settings of ψ(θ), the framework identifies optimal parameters (e.g., δ values) that balance convergence speed and training stability. For example, in Phase I, ψ(θ) = α∥∇f1(θ)∥² provides the best trade-off.
- Core assumption: The convergence analysis accurately predicts the practical performance of different ψ(θ) settings.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.4]: "we investigate the influence of the control function ψ(θ) on convergence rates across different phases."
  - [section 5.4]: "we empirically examine the convergence under these conditions to assess the framework’s unlearning performance of efficiency."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; no direct mention of convergence analysis, but related concepts like "gradient-based" and "optimization" are present.
- Break condition: If the theoretical convergence analysis does not align with practical performance, the chosen parameters may not optimize efficiency and stability.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: ε-constrained optimization
  - Why needed here: It allows the unlearning problem to be reformulated with a controllable constraint, enabling the trade-off between unlearning completeness and model utility.
  - Quick check question: How does the ε-constrained formulation ensure that solutions are Pareto optimal within the valid range?

- Concept: Pareto optimality
  - Why needed here: It guarantees that the solutions provided by the framework are optimal in the sense that no other solution can improve one objective without worsening another.
  - Quick check question: What conditions must be met for a solution to be considered Pareto optimal in the context of this unlearning framework?

- Concept: Gradient-based optimization methods
  - Why needed here: They are used to solve the ε-constrained optimization problem efficiently, especially given the high dimensionality of the model parameters.
  - Quick check question: How does the choice of gradient-based method (e.g., SQP variant) affect the convergence and stability of the unlearning process?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Trained I2I generative model -> Forget set, Retain set -> Phase I: Boundary identification -> Phase II: Controllable unlearning -> Unlearned model with controllable trade-offs
- Critical path:
  1. Reformulate unlearning as ε-constrained optimization.
  2. Solve for boundary solutions in Phase I.
  3. Determine valid ε range.
  4. Generate Pareto optimal solutions in Phase II by varying ε.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Choosing ε too small may result in incomplete unlearning; too large may harm model utility.
  - The control function ψ(θ) must balance convergence speed and stability.
- Failure signatures:
  - If the model fails to unlearn the forget set adequately, check if ε is too large or the control function is not effective.
  - If model utility degrades significantly, verify if ε is too small or the optimization is not converging properly.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the framework on a simple I2I model (e.g., MAE) with a small dataset to validate the basic functionality.
  2. Vary ε across its valid range and observe the trade-offs between unlearning completeness and model utility.
  3. Compare the convergence rates and stability under different settings of the control function ψ(θ).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The framework relies on assumptions of convexity and continuous differentiability of the unlearning objectives, which may not hold for all I2I generative models.
- The effectiveness of the two-phase approach depends on accurately identifying boundary solutions, which could be sensitive to initialization and optimization parameters.
- The generalizability of the framework to other I2I generative models beyond MAE, VQ-GAN, and diffusion models is uncertain.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core mechanism of reformulating unlearning as ε-constrained optimization and the general approach of finding Pareto optimal solutions are well-established concepts in optimization theory. The experimental results showing improved unlearning completeness and maintained model utility are supported by quantitative metrics.

- **Medium Confidence**: The two-phase approach for identifying boundary solutions and generating controllable trade-offs is methodologically sound, but its effectiveness depends on the accurate identification of valid ε ranges and the choice of control function parameters. The convergence analysis provides theoretical support, but practical performance may vary.

- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability of the framework to other I2I generative models beyond MAE, VQ-GAN, and diffusion models is uncertain. The assumption that the objectives are convex and continuously differentiable may not hold in practice, potentially limiting the applicability of the framework.

## Next Checks
1. Apply the framework to additional I2I generative models (e.g., StyleGAN, CycleGAN) and datasets to assess its performance across different architectures and data distributions.
2. Conduct empirical studies to verify the convexity and continuous differentiability of the unlearning objectives (f1 and f2) for various I2I models, and investigate the impact of non-convexity on the Pareto optimality of solutions.
3. Systematically explore a broader range of control function ψ(θ) variants and their parameters to identify optimal settings for different I2I models and datasets, and analyze the trade-offs between convergence speed and training stability.
