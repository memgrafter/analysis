# A Survey on Evaluation of Multimodal Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.15769
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15769
- Reference count: 40
- This paper presents a comprehensive survey of evaluation methods for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), categorizing existing evaluation tasks based on capabilities assessed and domain-specific applications.

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically reviews the evaluation landscape for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), organizing assessment methods into two primary categories: capability-based evaluations (general multimodal recognition, perception, reasoning, and trustworthiness) and domain-specific applications (socioeconomic, natural sciences, engineering, medical usage, AI agents, remote sensing, video/audio processing, 3D point cloud analysis, and others). The paper provides a comprehensive overview of evaluation benchmarks, metrics, and steps, aiming to guide researchers in developing more capable and reliable MLLMs. By mapping the current evaluation ecosystem, the survey identifies critical gaps and opportunities for advancing MLLM assessment methodologies.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a systematic literature review approach to collect and categorize existing evaluation methods for MLLMs. The authors analyze published benchmarks, metrics, and evaluation frameworks across multiple domains, organizing them into capability-based and domain-specific categories. The methodology involves identifying key evaluation tasks, examining their design principles, and assessing their applicability to different MLLM capabilities. The survey synthesizes findings from 40 references to provide a comprehensive mapping of the current evaluation landscape, highlighting both established practices and emerging trends in MLLM assessment.

## Key Results
- Comprehensive categorization of MLLM evaluation tasks into capability-based (recognition, perception, reasoning, trustworthiness) and domain-specific applications
- Systematic review of evaluation benchmarks and metrics across diverse domains including medical, engineering, and AI agents
- Identification of critical evaluation gaps and opportunities for advancing MLLM assessment methodologies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey's systematic organization of evaluation methods provides researchers with a structured framework for understanding MLLM assessment. By categorizing evaluations based on both capabilities and domains, the paper reveals how different assessment approaches address specific aspects of MLLM performance. The comprehensive coverage of benchmarks and metrics enables researchers to identify appropriate evaluation tools for their specific MLLM development goals, while the identification of gaps helps guide future research directions in evaluation methodology.

## Foundational Learning

1. Multimodal Integration Concepts
   - Why needed: Understanding how different modalities (text, image, audio, video) are processed and integrated is crucial for evaluating MLLM performance
   - Quick check: Verify that evaluation benchmarks test cross-modal understanding and not just individual modality processing

2. Reasoning Capability Assessment
   - Why needed: MLLMs must demonstrate logical inference and problem-solving across multiple modalities
   - Quick check: Ensure benchmarks include tasks requiring temporal reasoning, spatial understanding, and causal inference

3. Trustworthiness Metrics
   - Why needed: Evaluating robustness, hallucination, ethics, bias, and safety is essential for real-world deployment
   - Quick check: Confirm that evaluation frameworks include both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments of ethical considerations

4. Domain-Specific Knowledge Evaluation
   - Why needed: MLLMs must demonstrate specialized knowledge in various application domains
   - Quick check: Verify that domain-specific benchmarks test both general multimodal capabilities and specialized domain knowledge

5. Benchmark Design Principles
   - Why needed: Effective benchmarks must balance task complexity, multimodal integration, and generalization capabilities
- Quick check: Assess whether benchmarks include diverse examples and avoid overfitting to specific patterns

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Evaluation Framework -> Capability Categories -> Domain Applications -> Specific Benchmarks -> Performance Metrics

Critical Path:
Task Definition → Benchmark Design → Dataset Creation → Model Evaluation → Performance Analysis

Design Tradeoffs:
- Generalization vs. specialization: Broad benchmarks may miss domain-specific nuances
- Complexity vs. accessibility: Complex tasks may be harder to standardize and reproduce
- Quantitative vs. qualitative: Numerical metrics may not capture all aspects of multimodal understanding

Failure Signatures:
- Overfitting to training distributions
- Inability to handle novel multimodal combinations
- Poor performance on cross-domain transfer tasks
- Failure to detect hallucinations or biases

First Experiments:
1. Test a simple multimodal question-answering task to verify basic integration capabilities
2. Evaluate reasoning performance on a standardized mathematics problem set with visual components
3. Assess trustworthiness by testing robustness to adversarial multimodal inputs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can evaluation benchmarks be designed to effectively measure the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across diverse domains such as mathematics, natural sciences, and engineering?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the need for comprehensive evaluation methods to assess MLLM capabilities in reasoning tasks, including mathematics, natural sciences, and engineering, but does not provide specific guidelines for designing such benchmarks.
- Why unresolved: Designing benchmarks that accurately measure reasoning capabilities across diverse domains requires careful consideration of task complexity, multimodal integration, and the ability to generalize from specific examples to broader concepts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of new benchmarks that demonstrate improved performance in reasoning tasks across multiple domains, along with empirical studies showing the effectiveness of these benchmarks in evaluating MLLM reasoning capabilities.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the key factors that influence the trustworthiness of MLLMs, and how can these factors be systematically evaluated to ensure reliable and ethical AI systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper emphasizes the importance of evaluating trustworthiness in MLLMs, including robustness, hallucination, ethics, bias, and safety, but does not provide a detailed framework for systematically assessing these factors.
- Why unresolved: Trustworthiness in MLLMs is a multifaceted issue that requires a holistic approach to evaluation, considering the interplay between different factors and their impact on real-world applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Creation of comprehensive evaluation frameworks that integrate multiple trustworthiness factors, along with empirical studies demonstrating the effectiveness of these frameworks in improving MLLM reliability and ethical behavior.

### Open Question 3

- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the evaluation of MLLMs on various applications, including 3D point cloud analysis, video processing, and audio understanding, but does not provide specific insights into the challenges and solutions for evaluating these complex multimodal tasks.
- Why unresolved: Evaluating MLLMs on complex multimodal data requires addressing unique challenges related to data representation, temporal dynamics, and the integration of multiple modalities, which are not fully explored in existing evaluation methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of new evaluation methods and benchmarks specifically designed for complex multimodal tasks, along with empirical studies showing their effectiveness in capturing the nuances of these tasks and improving MLLM performance.

## Limitations

- The classification system, while comprehensive, may not capture all nuances of how different evaluation methods interact or overlap in practice
- The survey's reliance on published benchmarks may miss emerging or unpublished evaluation methodologies that could be critical for certain applications
- The depth of coverage varies across different domain-specific applications, potentially missing important evaluation aspects in some areas

## Confidence

- **High**: Categorization of general evaluation capabilities (recognition, perception, reasoning, and trustworthiness) - these are well-established concepts in MLLM research
- **Medium**: Domain-specific applications section - may not have captured all relevant domains or may have varying levels of depth across different application areas
- **Low**: Completeness of evaluation metrics discussed - rapid evolution of MLLMs means new metrics are continuously being developed

## Next Checks

1. Cross-validate the survey's domain-specific categorization by comparing it with practitioner feedback from researchers working in each identified domain to ensure no critical evaluation aspects were missed

2. Conduct a systematic analysis of how well the identified evaluation metrics actually predict real-world MLLM performance in their target domains, as theoretical coverage doesn't guarantee practical effectiveness

3. Perform a temporal analysis to track how the evaluation landscape has evolved since the survey's completion, particularly focusing on any emerging evaluation methodologies or metrics that address previously identified gaps
