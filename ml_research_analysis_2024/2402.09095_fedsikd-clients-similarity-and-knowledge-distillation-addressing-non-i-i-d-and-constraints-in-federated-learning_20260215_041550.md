# FedSiKD: Clients Similarity and Knowledge Distillation: Addressing Non-i.i.d. and Constraints in Federated Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2402.09095
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09095
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Outperforms state-of-the-art FL algorithms by 25% and 18% accuracy on HAR and MNIST datasets with highly skewed data

## Executive Summary
FedSiKD addresses the challenges of non-i.i.d. data distribution and resource constraints in federated learning by combining statistical similarity-based clustering with knowledge distillation. The framework enables clients to securely share data distribution statistics (mean, standard deviation, skewness) with a central server, which then clusters clients based on these statistics to enhance intra-cluster homogeneity. Within each cluster, knowledge distillation is applied, allowing resource-constrained clients to learn from a teacher model, reducing computational load while maintaining high accuracy. The approach achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art algorithms and demonstrates faster convergence, particularly on highly skewed data distributions.

## Method Summary
FedSiKD integrates statistical similarity-based clustering with knowledge distillation in a federated learning framework. Clients first share their dataset statistics (mean, standard deviation, skewness) with the server, which clusters clients using k-means based on statistical similarity. Within each cluster, a leader client acts as the teacher model while other clients act as students, learning through knowledge distillation. The framework uses Dirichlet distribution to simulate varying non-i.i.d. levels across 40 clients on HAR and MNIST datasets, achieving higher accuracy and faster convergence compared to baseline FL algorithms.

## Key Results
- Outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms by 25% and 18% accuracy on HAR and MNIST datasets with highly skewed data (α = 0.1, 0.5)
- Demonstrates faster convergence with 17% and 20% increase in accuracy within first five rounds on HAR and MNIST datasets
- Maintains performance superiority as data becomes less uniform (α = 1.0) compared to other algorithms
- Reduces computational load on resource-constrained devices through knowledge distillation while maintaining high accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Clustering clients by statistical similarity reduces variance in local model updates, leading to faster and more stable convergence
- **Core assumption**: Statistical similarity in data distributions leads to reduced gradient divergence within clusters
- **Evidence anchors**: Abstract states clustering promotes intra-cluster homogeneity; section IV.A mentions using clustering metrics to minimize variance within clusters
- **Break condition**: If data distribution statistics are not representative of true data heterogeneity, clustering will be ineffective

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Knowledge distillation within clusters allows efficient transfer of learned knowledge from teacher to multiple student models, reducing computational burden
- **Core assumption**: Teacher model within a cluster can effectively represent knowledge of entire cluster
- **Evidence anchors**: Abstract mentions knowledge distillation enables efficient knowledge transfer; section IV.C describes teacher-student relationship within clusters
- **Break condition**: If teacher model is not representative of cluster's data distribution, student models will not learn effectively

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Addressing both non-i.i.d. data and resource constraints simultaneously achieves higher accuracy and faster convergence than state-of-the-art methods
- **Core assumption**: Benefits of clustering and knowledge distillation are additive and do not interfere with each other
- **Evidence anchors**: Abstract states FedSiKD outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms; section V.B shows performance at different non-i.i.d. levels
- **Break condition**: If clustering or knowledge distillation components fail, overall performance will degrade significantly

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Federated Learning (FL)
  - **Why needed**: FedSiKD is a federated learning framework; understanding FL concepts like data privacy and decentralized training is essential
  - **Quick check**: What is the main difference between centralized and federated learning in terms of data privacy?

- **Concept**: Non-i.i.d. Data Distribution
  - **Why needed**: Non-i.i.d. data is a major challenge in FL; FedSiKD specifically addresses this through clustering
  - **Quick check**: How does non-i.i.d. data distribution affect the convergence of federated learning algorithms?

- **Concept**: Knowledge Distillation
  - **Why needed**: Knowledge distillation is a key component of FedSiKD; enables efficient knowledge transfer between models
  - **Quick check**: What is the difference between a teacher model and a student model in knowledge distillation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Clients -> Server (statistics sharing) -> Clustering -> Teacher-Student training within clusters -> Model aggregation -> Global model update
- **Critical path**: 1) Clients share dataset statistics with server, 2) Server clusters clients using k-means on statistics, 3) Within each cluster, teacher and student models are initialized and trained, 4) Student models learn from teacher using knowledge distillation, 5) Cluster models are aggregated to update global model, 6) Repeat steps 3-5 for multiple communication rounds
- **Design tradeoffs**: Statistical sharing vs. privacy (more detailed statistics improve clustering but may increase privacy risk), cluster size vs. homogeneity (smaller clusters are more homogeneous but may lead to overfitting), teacher model complexity vs. student model efficiency (more complex teacher provides better knowledge transfer but may increase computational load)
- **Failure signatures**: Poor clustering (large intra-cluster variance, inconsistent model performance), ineffective knowledge distillation (student models do not improve, computational load remains high), communication bottlenecks (slow convergence, increased latency)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Verify clustering quality by measuring intra-cluster variance and silhouette score, 2) Test knowledge distillation effectiveness by comparing student model performance with and without KD, 3) Evaluate convergence speed and accuracy compared to baseline FL algorithms (e.g., FedAvg) on non-i.i.d. datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How can dynamic clustering be implemented in FedSiKD to adapt to changing data distributions and client availability over time?
- **Basis**: Authors mention dynamic clustering as future work, noting it involves balancing privacy, overhead, and accuracy
- **Why unresolved**: Current FedSiKD performs clustering only once at initial stage; no mechanism to update clusters as data distributions or client availability change
- **What evidence would resolve**: Study implementing dynamic clustering within FedSiKD showing improved performance/convergence compared to static clustering

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: What are the trade-offs between noise level added for differential privacy and accuracy of statistical measures shared by clients?
- **Basis**: Authors assume differential privacy is applied but developing exact model is beyond scope
- **Why unresolved**: Paper doesn't explore impact of different noise levels on clustering accuracy and model training
- **What evidence would resolve**: Analysis showing relationship between noise level, statistical measure accuracy, and impact on clustering quality and model performance

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: How can selection of teacher models within clusters be optimized to maximize effectiveness of knowledge distillation?
- **Basis**: Authors mention teacher selection based on computing resources but optimal selection is beyond scope
- **Why unresolved**: Paper doesn't explore different teacher selection strategies or evaluate their impact on knowledge distillation effectiveness
- **What evidence would resolve**: Comparative study of different teacher selection strategies within FedSiKD demonstrating impact on knowledge distillation effectiveness and model performance

## Limitations

- **Limited empirical validation**: Clustering mechanism lacks direct evidence showing correlation between clustering quality and performance improvements
- **Missing ablation studies**: No comparison showing knowledge distillation's specific contribution versus baseline clustering approaches
- **Insufficient methodological detail**: Missing exact differential privacy parameters, knowledge distillation hyperparameters, and cluster assignment criteria

## Confidence

- **Mechanism 1 (clustering)**: Low - statistical similarity clustering is conceptually sound but lacks empirical validation in this specific context
- **Mechanism 2 (knowledge distillation)**: Low - KD application is described but not rigorously evaluated
- **Mechanism 3 (combined benefits)**: Low - additive benefit claims are unsupported by presented data

## Next Checks

1. **Clustering validation**: Run clustering on shared statistics and measure actual intra-cluster variance and silhouette scores. Compare these metrics to reported performance improvements to establish correlation.

2. **Ablation study**: Implement FedSiKD without knowledge distillation (pure clustering approach) and compare accuracy/convergence against full FedSiKD implementation to isolate KD's contribution.

3. **Baseline comparison**: Implement and evaluate FedAvg on same non-i.i.d. data distributions (Dirichlet α = 0.1, 0.5) to establish whether clustering alone provides similar benefits to claimed clustering + KD approach.
