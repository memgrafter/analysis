# A Comprehensive Survey of Federated Transfer Learning: Challenges, Methods and Applications

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.01387
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01387
- Reference count: 40
- This survey comprehensively reviews federated transfer learning (FTL), which integrates transfer learning (TL) into federated learning (FL) to address unique challenges like data heterogeneity, system heterogeneity, incremental data, and labeled data scarcity.

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive overview of federated transfer learning (FTL), which combines transfer learning techniques with federated learning to address challenges that arise when participants have different data distributions, computational capabilities, and labeling resources. The authors identify six key challenges in FTL: homogeneous FTL, heterogeneous FTL, dynamic heterogeneous FTL, model adaptive FTL, semi-supervised FTL, and unsupervised FTL. For each challenge, they categorize solutions into data-based approaches (instance augmentation, feature clustering, model weighting) and model-based approaches (consistency regularization, parameter decoupling, knowledge distillation). The survey also outlines current applications of FTL in areas such as federated cross-domain recommendation, medical image classification, financial services, and traffic flow prediction, demonstrating the practical value of this emerging paradigm.

## Method Summary
This paper is a comprehensive survey rather than an experimental study. The authors systematically review existing literature on federated transfer learning by first defining the problem space and challenges, then categorizing solutions into data-based and model-based approaches. The survey methodology involves identifying key challenges in FTL, organizing existing solutions by challenge type, and examining applications across different domains. The paper synthesizes findings from approximately 40 referenced papers to provide a structured overview of the current state of FTL research.

## Key Results
- FTL effectively addresses data heterogeneity by transferring knowledge across participants with different data distributions using transfer learning techniques
- System heterogeneity is mitigated through selective aggregation strategies that choose the most relevant and informative samples or models from participants
- Labeled data scarcity is addressed by leveraging semi-supervised and unsupervised learning techniques like consistency regularization and knowledge distillation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: FTL improves model performance by transferring knowledge across participants with different data distributions.
- Mechanism: Transfer learning techniques are integrated into federated learning to adapt models trained on one participant's data distribution to another participant's data distribution, mitigating issues like data heterogeneity and label space inconsistency.
- Core assumption: There is a meaningful overlap in feature spaces or task relationships between participants' data distributions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "FTL faces many unique challenges that are not present in TL."
  - [section] "HOFTL refers to differences in marginal distributions (Pi(X) or P j(Y)), conditional distributions (Pi(y|x) , P j(y|x)), or sample sizes ni , n j between participant data"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; corpus neighbors do not directly discuss transfer learning mechanisms.
- Break condition: If participants' data distributions are completely disjoint, transfer learning techniques will fail to improve model performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: FTL addresses system heterogeneity by selectively aggregating model updates from participants with varying computational capabilities.
- Mechanism: Strategies like instance selection and model selection are used to choose the most relevant and informative samples or models from participants, reducing the impact of stragglers and improving overall model performance.
- Core assumption: There is a way to quantify the relevance and informativeness of participant data or models.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Due to inconsistent local storage, computational, and communication capabilities among different participant devices, FL may grapple with system heterogeneity challenges"
  - [section] "FedBalancer [210] chooses samples for training by measuring their statistical utility, derived from the sample loss list based on the latest model"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; corpus neighbors do not directly discuss system heterogeneity mitigation.
- Break condition: If it is not possible to accurately measure the relevance and informativeness of participant data or models, selective aggregation will not improve performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: FTL handles labeled data scarcity by leveraging semi-supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.
- Mechanism: Techniques like consistency regularization and knowledge distillation are used to train models on unlabeled data, reducing the reliance on labeled data and improving model performance.
- Core assumption: There is a way to generate meaningful labels or representations from unlabeled data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Real-world FL applications especially need to use unlabeled data more than others [195, 196]."
  - [section] "FedMatch [51] uses both past local and global models to predict labels for local unlabeled data."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; corpus neighbors do not directly discuss semi-supervised or unsupervised learning in FTL.
- Break condition: If it is not possible to generate meaningful labels or representations from unlabeled data, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning techniques will not improve model performance.

## Foundational Learning

  - Quick check question: What is the main goal of transfer learning, and how does it relate to FTL?
- Concept: Federated learning
  - Why needed here: FTL is built upon federated learning, so understanding its principles is crucial.
  - Quick check question: How does federated learning differ from traditional centralized learning, and what are its key challenges?
- Concept: Data heterogeneity

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Participants -> Local devices or entities with private data
  - Server -> Central entity that coordinates model aggregation and knowledge transfer
  - Transfer learning techniques -> Methods for adapting models across different data distributions
  - Federated learning algorithms -> Methods for aggregating model updates from participants
- Critical path:
  1. Participants train local models on their private data
  2. Participants send model updates to the server
  3. Server aggregates model updates using transfer learning techniques
  4. Server sends aggregated model back to participants
  5. Participants update their local models with the aggregated model
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Privacy vs. performance: Increasing privacy (e.g., by using more secure aggregation methods) may decrease model performance
  - Communication efficiency vs. model accuracy: Reducing communication costs (e.g., by using model compression) may decrease model accuracy
  - Computational efficiency vs. personalization: Increasing personalization (e.g., by using more complex transfer learning techniques) may increase computational costs
- Failure signatures:
  - Model performance degradation: If FTL techniques are not effective, model performance may decrease
  - Communication bottlenecks: If communication costs are too high, the system may become slow or unresponsive
  - Privacy leaks: If privacy-preserving techniques are not effective, sensitive data may be exposed
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the impact of different transfer learning techniques on model performance in a homogeneous FTL setting
  2. Evaluate the effectiveness of instance selection in mitigating system heterogeneity in a heterogeneous FTL setting
  3. Assess the performance of semi-supervised learning techniques in addressing labeled data scarcity in a semi-supervised FTL setting

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can FTL methods effectively address the challenges of feature concept shift and label concept shift, which are less studied compared to prior and covariate shifts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights that feature concept shift and label concept shift are less explored challenges in FTL, with only a few studies addressing them.
- Why unresolved: These shifts involve changes in the relationship between features and labels, which can be caused by external factors like time or policy changes, making them complex to model and address.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies demonstrating effective FTL methods that mitigate feature and label concept shifts, along with theoretical analyses explaining their success.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can FTL strategies be designed to minimize privacy risks associated with sharing strategy preferences for model selection, weighting, or clustering?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that sharing strategy preferences for FTL methods like model selection, weighting, or clustering could lead to privacy leakage if participants manipulate the training process.
- Why unresolved: The trade-off between effective knowledge transfer and privacy preservation in FTL is complex, and designing strategies that prevent manipulation while maintaining performance is challenging.
- What evidence would resolve it: Secure and privacy-preserving FTL algorithms that prevent participants from inferring or manipulating strategy preferences, along with evaluations of their impact on model performance and privacy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the optimal approaches to balance communication costs, communication efficiency, and computational costs in FTL compared to traditional FL methods?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper emphasizes that FTL strategies like instance augmentation, instance selection, feature selection, model selection, and model clustering increase additional computational and communication costs.
- Why unresolved: The trade-offs between communication efficiency, computational costs, and model performance in FTL are not well understood, and finding optimal approaches requires further research.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of different FTL strategies evaluating their communication costs, communication efficiency, computational costs, and model performance, along with theoretical analyses of the trade-offs involved.

## Limitations
- Most evidence comes from cited papers rather than direct experimental validation within the survey itself, creating moderate confidence levels
- The survey assumes transfer learning techniques can effectively bridge data distribution gaps without providing empirical evidence for when this assumption breaks down
- Potential negative transfer scenarios where knowledge transfer could harm model performance are not addressed

## Confidence
- Mechanism claims (Medium): While logically sound, these lack direct experimental validation from the survey itself
- Challenge categorization (High): Well-established theoretical foundations support these classifications
- Application examples (Medium): Described applications are based on existing literature without independent verification

## Next Checks
1. Conduct controlled experiments testing FTL performance across varying degrees of data distribution overlap to identify the threshold where transfer learning becomes ineffective
2. Implement and test selective aggregation strategies under realistic system heterogeneity conditions to measure actual performance improvements
3. Evaluate semi-supervised FTL techniques using datasets with different label-to-unlabeled data ratios to determine practical limits of labeled data reduction
