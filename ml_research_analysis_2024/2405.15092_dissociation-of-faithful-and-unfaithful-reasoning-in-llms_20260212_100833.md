# Dissociation of Faithful and Unfaithful Reasoning in LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.15092
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15092
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Language models use distinct mechanisms for faithful (explicitly correcting) vs. unfaithful (bypassing without acknowledgment) error recovery in chain-of-thought reasoning.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether language models generate faithful reasoning in their chain-of-thought explanations. The authors introduce artificial errors into model-generated reasoning and analyze how the model recovers from these errors. They distinguish between faithful recovery, where the model explicitly identifies and corrects the error, and unfaithful recovery, where the model recovers without acknowledging the error. Through three experiments manipulating error magnitude, context expectations, and evidence for the correct value, the authors find that these factors have divergent effects on faithful and unfaithful recoveries. The results provide evidence for distinct mechanisms underlying faithful and unfaithful reasoning in LLMs, suggesting that models can generate correct answers through either interpretable reasoning or internal processes not fully captured in their explanations.

## Method Summary
The study introduces artificial errors into chain-of-thought transcripts generated by LLMs and evaluates recovery behavior. Researchers collected mathematical reasoning problems from four datasets (MultiArith, ASDiv, SVAMP, GSM8K) and generated CoT transcripts using zero-shot prompting. They introduced numerical errors using regular expressions and perturbation rules (±1 or ±101), then queried models with errored transcripts. Responses were manually annotated to classify recovery behaviors as faithful (explicit acknowledgment and correction) or unfaithful (recovery without acknowledgment). The study analyzed how error magnitude, context expectations, and evidence for correct values affected these recovery types differently.

## Key Results
- Error magnitude affects faithful and unfaithful recovery rates differently - larger errors increase faithful recovery while decreasing unfaithful recovery
- Context expectations that errors are likely increase recovery frequency with divergent effects on faithful vs. unfaithful mechanisms
- Evidence for correct values in prior context increases overall recovery rate and affects faithful and unfaithful recoveries differently
- Results indicate distinct mechanisms driving faithful and unfaithful error recoveries across multiple models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs recover from errors using two distinct mechanisms - one faithful (explicitly identifies and corrects the error) and one unfaithful (recovers without acknowledging the error).
- Mechanism: The model internally processes the error and either generates text that explains the correction (faithful) or bypasses the error without explanation (unfaithful).
- Core assumption: The model's internal reasoning processes can be dissociated from its generated chain-of-thought text.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Critically, these factors have divergent effects on faithful and unfaithful recoveries. Our results indicate that there are distinct mechanisms driving faithful and unfaithful error recoveries."
  - [section 4.1] "We identify factors that shift LLM recovery behavior: LLMs recover more frequently from obvious errors and in contexts that provide more evidence for the correct answer."
  - [corpus] "Found 25 related papers (using 8). Average neighbor FMR=0.48, average citations=0.0."
- Break condition: If the model consistently generates faithful explanations for all errors, the unfaithful mechanism would be unnecessary and potentially absent.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The magnitude of an error affects the likelihood of faithful vs. unfaithful recovery differently.
- Mechanism: Larger errors are more noticeable to the model, increasing the probability of faithful recovery (explicit acknowledgment) while decreasing unfaithful recovery (bypassing without acknowledgment).
- Core assumption: Error magnitude influences the model's internal detection and correction processes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.1] "As shown in 3, the different models' error recovery capabilities varied. All models showed higher error recovery rates for large magnitude errors."
  - [section 5.1] "For GPT-4, increased error size led to higher rates of faithful recovery and lower rates of unfaithful recovery."
  - [corpus] "Chain-of-Thought Reasoning In The Wild Is Not Always Faithful" - suggests that CoT can be unfaithful, which aligns with the mechanism of bypassing errors.
- Break condition: If error magnitude had uniform effects on both faithful and unfaithful recovery, it would suggest a single recovery mechanism rather than two distinct ones.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Contextual evidence about error likelihood and correct values influences recovery behavior, with divergent effects on faithful vs. unfaithful mechanisms.
- Mechanism: When the context suggests errors are likely or provides evidence for the correct answer, the model is more likely to engage faithful recovery (acknowledging and correcting the error) and less likely to use unfaithful recovery (bypassing without acknowledgment).
- Core assumption: The model's behavior is influenced by contextual cues about error likelihood and correct values.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 6] "Experiment 2 found that stronger prior expectations that an error will occur increase the frequency of recovery."
  - [section 7] "Experiment 3 found that evidence for the correct value in the prior context increases the error recovery rate."
  - [section 6] "Across all models, this contextual evidence has distinct effects on faithful recoveries compared to unfaithful recoveries."
  - [corpus] "FRIT: Using Causal Importance to Improve Chain-of-Thought Faithfulness" - suggests that improving faithfulness is possible, which aligns with the mechanism of contextual influence.
- Break condition: If contextual evidence had uniform effects on both faithful and unfaithful recovery, it would suggest a single recovery mechanism rather than two distinct ones.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Data collection -> Error introduction -> Error recovery evaluation -> Annotation -> Analysis

- Critical path:
  1. Collect valid <question, CoT, answer> triples from datasets
  2. Introduce errors into CoT and generate errored versions
  3. Query model with errored CoT and collect responses
  4. Manually annotate responses for recovery behavior and faithfulness
  5. Analyze data to identify factors influencing faithful vs. unfaithful recovery

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Manual annotation vs. automated labeling: Manual annotation is more accurate but time-consuming
  - Artificial errors vs. natural errors: Artificial errors allow for controlled experiments but may not reflect natural error patterns
  - Fixed vs. variable error magnitude: Fixed error magnitude allows for controlled comparisons but may not reflect real-world scenarios

- Failure signatures:
  - Low recovery rates across all conditions: Suggests issues with the error introduction process or model capability
  - Uniform effects of interventions on faithful and unfaithful recovery: Suggests a single recovery mechanism rather than two distinct ones
  - Inconsistent annotations: Suggests issues with the annotation guidelines or annotator training

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Error magnitude manipulation: Compare recovery rates for small vs. large errors to test if magnitude affects faithful vs. unfaithful recovery differently
  2. Context expectations manipulation: Introduce noise or prompts suggesting errors are likely to test if prior expectations affect faithful vs. unfaithful recovery differently
  3. Recoverability manipulation: Introduce errors in positions with varying amounts of evidence for the correct value to test if evidence affects faithful vs. unfaithful recovery differently

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The artificial nature of introduced errors may not fully capture natural error patterns in LLM reasoning
- Manual annotation process introduces potential subjectivity in classifying recovery behaviors
- Focus on mathematical reasoning problems may limit generalizability to other domains

## Confidence
- Medium-High confidence in the dissociation finding, given consistent effects across multiple experimental manipulations and models, but tempered by the artificial experimental setup
- The specific mechanisms proposed are supported but remain speculative given the black-box nature of LLM internal processes
- Findings provide valuable insights but should be interpreted within controlled experimental conditions

## Next Checks
- Replicate the error magnitude experiment with additional model architectures to test generalizability
- Conduct inter-annotator agreement analysis to validate the manual annotation process
- Test the dissociation findings on non-mathematical reasoning tasks to assess domain transferability
