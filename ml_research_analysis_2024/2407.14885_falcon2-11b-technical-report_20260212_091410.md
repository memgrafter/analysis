# Falcon2-11B Technical Report

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.14885
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14885
- Reference count: 9
- Primary result: 11-billion parameter language model trained on 5 trillion tokens with strong multilingual and code generation capabilities

## Executive Summary
This technical report introduces Falcon2-11B, a foundation language model with 11 billion parameters trained on over 5 trillion tokens. The model employs a multi-stage training approach including context length extension and a final stage using curated high-quality data. The model demonstrates strong generalization across tasks and improved multilingual and code generation capabilities. The authors also present Falcon2-11B-vlm, a multimodal variant that achieves higher average scores on vision-language benchmarks compared to open-source models of similar size. Both models are released under a permissive license.

## Method Summary
Falcon2-11B uses a three-stage training approach with context length extension. The first two stages involve standard pretraining on a large corpus, with a key innovation being the doubling of batch size mid-training to reduce loss spikes. The final stage uses carefully curated high-quality data. The model follows the architecture of its predecessor, Falcon-180B, but with optimizations for the 11B parameter scale. The vision language model variant extends this foundation with multimodal capabilities through additional training on vision-language data pairs.

## Key Results
- Model trained on 5+ trillion tokens shows strong generalization across diverse tasks
- Doubling batch size mid-training effectively reduces training loss spikes
- Vision language model achieves higher benchmark scores than comparable open-source models
- Demonstrates improved multilingual support and code generation capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The three-stage training approach allows for progressive learning with different data qualities and batch sizes. The mid-training batch size doubling addresses optimization challenges that commonly occur in large-scale pretraining. The final curated data stage helps refine model capabilities on high-quality examples. The vision language model leverages the strong foundation to learn cross-modal representations effectively.

## Foundational Learning
- Large-scale pretraining: Why needed - enables broad knowledge acquisition; Quick check - measure perplexity on held-out data
- Batch size scaling: Why needed - improves optimization efficiency; Quick check - compare loss curves with/without scaling
- Context length extension: Why needed - enables longer sequence processing; Quick check - measure performance on long-document tasks
- Curated data fine-tuning: Why needed - refines capabilities on quality examples; Quick check - compare outputs before/after this stage
- Multimodal training: Why needed - enables vision-language understanding; Quick check - evaluate on image-text retrieval tasks

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map:
Input embedding -> Transformer blocks -> Context length extension -> Output projection

Critical path:
Input tokens flow through embedding layer, pass through multiple transformer layers, undergo context length extension training, and produce final output logits through projection layer.

Design tradeoffs:
The model balances parameter efficiency (11B vs larger alternatives) with training scale (5T+ tokens). The multi-stage approach trades training complexity for better optimization control and final quality.

Failure signatures:
Loss spikes during training, degraded multilingual performance, reduced code generation quality, or poor vision-language alignment would indicate training issues.

First experiments:
1. Measure pretraining perplexity on held-out corpus
2. Evaluate multilingual capabilities across language subsets
3. Test code generation performance on standard benchmarks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited comparison with most recent frontier models
- Lack of detailed ablation studies for the multi-stage training approach
- No statistical significance testing for the batch size doubling intervention
- Unclear methodology for multimodal evaluation

## Confidence
- Training scale claims: Medium
- Benchmark comparisons: Medium
- Architectural innovations: Medium
- License terms: High

## Next Checks
1. Conduct controlled ablation experiments comparing the three-stage training approach against alternative curricula, particularly focusing on the batch size doubling intervention
2. Perform comprehensive bias and toxicity audits using standardized evaluation frameworks to assess the impact of curated high-quality data in the final training stage
3. Replicate the context length extension training with different initialization strategies and document failure modes or instability patterns
