# Automatic Dataset Construction (ADC): Sample Collection, Data Curation, and Beyond

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.11338
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11338
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Automated pipeline creating 1 million clothing images with 12,000 subclasses using LLMs and search engines

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Automatic Dataset Construction (ADC) pipeline to automate dataset creation with minimal human involvement. ADC leverages LLMs for detailed class design and uses search engines to collect relevant samples, significantly reducing manual annotation and time costs. The authors developed the Clothing-ADC dataset, containing one million images with over 1,000 subclasses per clothing type. ADC also addresses challenges like label noise and class imbalance by incorporating open-source tools for error detection and robust learning. Benchmark datasets and experiments show ADC's effectiveness, with F1-scores up to 0.5721 for label noise detection and accuracies up to 81.94% for noisy label learning. The method offers a scalable, efficient approach for high-quality dataset creation tailored for machine learning applications.

## Method Summary
ADC is an automated pipeline for constructing large-scale image classification datasets, specifically demonstrated on clothing images. The method uses LLMs to generate detailed class hierarchies with attributes (color, material, pattern) for 12 main clothing categories, then automatically collects images via search engines using these attributes. The collected data undergoes curation using open-source tools (Docta, CleanLab) to detect and correct label noise and address class imbalance. The pipeline significantly reduces manual effort while maintaining dataset quality through automated error detection and relabeling processes.

## Key Results
- F1-score up to 0.5721 for label noise detection
- Accuracy up to 81.94% for noisy label learning
- Clothing-ADC dataset: 1,076,738 images across 12 main classes and 12,000 subclasses
- Reduced manual annotation time and costs compared to traditional dataset construction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ADC works by combining the pattern recognition capabilities of LLMs with automated data collection and curation tools. The LLM generates detailed, attribute-rich class hierarchies that guide targeted image collection, ensuring diversity and specificity. Automated search engines then efficiently gather large volumes of relevant samples based on these attributes. The curation phase uses statistical methods and machine learning to identify and correct label noise, while also balancing class distributions. This end-to-end automation reduces human bias and error while scaling dataset creation to unprecedented sizes.

## Foundational Learning
- **LLM-based class design**: Why needed - to generate detailed, attribute-rich taxonomies automatically; Quick check - compare generated attributes against human-designed hierarchies for coverage and specificity
- **Automated image collection**: Why needed - to efficiently gather large volumes of relevant samples without manual searching; Quick check - calculate collection rate and relevance score compared to manual collection
- **Label noise detection**: Why needed - to identify and correct mislabeled samples in automatically collected data; Quick check - measure F1-score of noise detection against ground truth labels
- **Class imbalance handling**: Why needed - to ensure balanced representation across all subclasses for better model training; Quick check - compare class distribution before and after rebalancing

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** LLM class design -> Automated search collection -> Data curation (noise detection + relabeling) -> Final dataset

**Critical Path:** The pipeline's critical path is the sequential flow from LLM-generated class attributes through automated collection to curation and final dataset creation. Each stage depends on the previous one's output, with curation being the most computationally intensive step.

**Design Tradeoffs:** ADC trades human expertise and quality control for scalability and efficiency. While manual dataset creation ensures high quality, it's time-consuming and expensive. ADC automates the process, accepting some noise and requiring curation tools to maintain quality. This tradeoff enables creation of much larger datasets but requires robust error detection mechanisms.

**Failure Signatures:** Common failure modes include irrelevant image collection due to overly generic search queries, over-aggressive filtering removing valid samples during curation, and class imbalance persisting despite rebalancing attempts. Diagnostics involve manual inspection of collected samples, comparing pre/post-filtering counts, and examining edge cases where valid samples were removed.

**First Experiments:**
1. Implement LLM-based class design for a small clothing subset and benchmark against human-designed taxonomies
2. Reproduce automated collection pipeline for one clothing category and evaluate sample relevance and diversity
3. Test data curation pipeline on a small annotated dataset with known label errors to verify noise detection performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the paper.

## Limitations
- Lacks specific LLM prompt templates and parameter settings for faithful reproduction
- Proprietary Clothing-ADC dataset prevents independent verification of claims
- Limited validation beyond clothing domain, raising questions about generalizability
- Missing comparison to baseline methods and statistical significance testing for reported metrics

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| General pipeline approach (LLM → search → curation) | High |
| Effectiveness metrics (F1-scores, accuracies) | Medium |
| Scalability claims and cross-domain applicability | Low |

## Next Checks

1. Implement the class design component using publicly available LLMs with the described prompt strategy, then benchmark against human-designed taxonomies for a small clothing subset
2. Reproduce the automated collection pipeline for one clothing category and conduct human evaluation of sample relevance and diversity compared to existing datasets
3. Test the data curation pipeline on a small annotated dataset with known label errors to verify the claimed F1-score performance of the noise detection tools
