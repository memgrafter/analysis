# CROPE: Evaluating In-Context Adaptation of Vision and Language Models to Culture-Specific Concepts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.15453
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15453
- Reference count: 40
- Top models score around 60-80% F1 on common concepts but only 40-50% on culture-specific ones

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates how well current Vision and Language Models (VLMs) recognize and adapt to culture-specific concepts, distinguishing between knowledge encoded in model weights and contextual knowledge provided during inference. The authors introduce CROPE, a dataset with 1060 binary visual question answering examples paired with Wikipedia summaries and images for culture-specific concepts from Indonesian, Swahili, Tamil, Turkish, and Chinese. Experiments show a large performance gap between common and culture-specific concepts in zero-shot settings, with top open models scoring around 60-80% F1 on common concepts but only 40-50% on culture-specific ones. Providing contextual information, even multimodal, does not significantly improve performance, suggesting VLMs struggle to utilize contextual cues to differentiate visually or functionally similar concepts.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates open-source VLMs (up to 11B parameters) across four experimental conditions varying the amount of contextual information provided: zero-shot (no context), textual context (Wikipedia summaries), visual context (images), and multimodal context (both text and images). The CROPE dataset contains 1060 binary visual question answering examples from five cultures, each paired with Wikipedia summaries and images. Models are tested using greedy decoding with system/chat prompts from Hugging Face, and performance is measured using F1-score, precision, recall, percentage of positive responses, and consistency score across context conditions.

## Key Results
- Large performance disparity between culture-specific and common concepts in zero-shot settings (F1 scores of ~40-50% vs ~80%)
- Providing contextual knowledge does not improve performance and may even worsen it
- No significant correlation between model parameter scale and culture-specific concept performance
- Human evaluations suggest people benefit from both text and image context when identifying unfamiliar concepts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: VLMs fail to differentiate visually similar culture-specific concepts due to limited multimodal contextual binding.
- Mechanism: VLMs trained on multimodal web data can process interleaved image-text inputs but struggle to bind culture-specific concepts to their depictions when given contextual cues.
- Core assumption: The visual and textual descriptions provided as context are sufficient to disambiguate culture-specific concepts from visually similar ones.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "experiments with contextual knowledge indicate that models struggle to effectively utilize multimodal information and bind culture-specific concepts to their depictions."
  - [section] "Our findings illustrate that with no context at all, models exhibit a considerable performance drop relative to common concepts... Surprisingly, when provided with contextual knowledge, the performance of most models deteriorates even more."
  - [corpus] Weak. Corpus evidence does not directly address this mechanism. The related papers focus on cultural awareness in VLMs but do not specifically discuss multimodal contextual binding.
- Break condition: If VLMs are provided with richer multimodal contexts that explicitly highlight the distinguishing features of culture-specific concepts, they may improve in differentiating them from visually similar ones.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: VLMs are sensitive to the task structure and length of the input prompt when provided with contextual information.
- Mechanism: The addition of Wikipedia summaries as contextual information increases the length of the input prompt, potentially overwhelming the model's attention mechanism and leading to decreased performance.
- Core assumption: The model's attention mechanism is sensitive to the length and structure of the input prompt.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "experiments with contextual knowledge indicate that models struggle to effectively utilize multimodal information and bind culture-specific concepts to their depictions."
  - [section] "Our findings suggest that current VLMs struggle to process multimodal contextual information. We consider two possible reasons for this behavior. First, the models might be sensitive to the task structure, which, due to the concept's summary, includes a relatively lengthy prompt."
  - [corpus] Weak. The related papers do not directly address the impact of prompt length and structure on VLM performance.
- Break condition: If VLMs are designed with attention mechanisms that are more robust to input prompt length and structure, they may maintain or improve performance when provided with contextual information.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: VLMs struggle to reason about nuanced differences between visually and functionally similar concepts.
- Mechanism: VLMs trained on common concepts prevalent in most training data struggle to generalize to culture-specific concepts that require reasoning about subtle visual and functional differences.
- Core assumption: The ability to reason about nuanced differences is not adequately captured in the training data of VLMs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art open VLMs shows large performance disparities between culture-specific and common concepts in the parametric setting."
  - [section] "Our findings suggest that current VLMs struggle to process multimodal contextual information. We consider two possible reasons for this behavior. Second, the contextual information may not suffice to disambiguate the concept in question and in the image."
  - [corpus] Weak. The related papers focus on cultural awareness in VLMs but do not specifically discuss the ability to reason about nuanced differences between visually similar concepts.
- Break condition: If VLMs are trained on more diverse and culture-specific data that explicitly highlights the nuanced differences between visually similar concepts, they may improve in generalizing to culture-specific concepts.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multimodal contextual binding
  - Why needed here: Understanding how VLMs process and integrate information from different modalities (e.g., text and images) to form a coherent representation of a concept.
  - Quick check question: How does a VLM combine information from an image and its corresponding text description to identify a culture-specific concept?

- Concept: Prompt sensitivity
  - Why needed here: Recognizing that the performance of VLMs can be affected by the length and structure of the input prompt, especially when additional contextual information is provided.
  - Quick check question: What happens to the performance of a VLM when the input prompt is increased in length by adding a Wikipedia summary as context?

- Concept: Cultural bias in VLMs
  - Why needed here: Understanding that VLMs may exhibit biases towards Western cultures due to the prevalence of Western-centric data in their training sets.
  - Quick check question: How does the cultural background of the data used to train a VLM influence its ability to recognize and understand culture-specific concepts from other regions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Vision encoder -> Language encoder -> Fusion module
- Critical path: Image and text processing → Feature extraction → Multimodal fusion → Concept representation
- Design tradeoffs: Model complexity vs. generalization to culture-specific concepts; context richness vs. processing effectiveness
- Failure signatures: Inability to differentiate visually similar concepts, sensitivity to prompt length, lack of nuanced reasoning
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate VLM performance on culture-specific concepts with and without contextual information
  2. Analyze impact of prompt length and structure on performance with contextual information
  3. Investigate VLM ability to reason about nuanced differences between visually similar culture-specific concepts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do VLMs' performance on culture-specific concepts vary with different training data compositions across model development stages?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that VLMs are built by integrating vision and language backbones through joint training stages with image-text examples, and suggests that analyzing how cultural concept coverage varies across these stages is important.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not systematically analyze how the coverage of cultural concepts changes across different training stages in VLM development, leaving the relationship between training data composition and cultural concept performance unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing VLM performance on culture-specific concepts after each major training stage, with detailed analysis of which concepts are introduced at each stage and how this affects performance on CROPE.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal way to retrieve informative multimodal contexts for culture-specific concepts to improve VLM performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges that while Wikipedia summaries and images are used as context, this is not necessarily the optimal way to retrieve informative multimodal contexts for practical applications.
- Why unresolved: The paper uses Wikipedia as a source for context but does not explore alternative methods of retrieving more relevant or effective multimodal contexts that could better help VLMs understand culture-specific concepts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments testing different context retrieval methods (e.g., culturally diverse image-text pairs, region-specific knowledge bases) and measuring their impact on VLM performance for culture-specific concepts.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does increasing the scale of VLMs affect their ability to recognize and adapt to culture-specific concepts?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses models up to 11B parameters and notes that parameter scale is not a determining factor of performance, but does not explore larger models.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests VLMs up to 11B parameters, leaving open the question of whether larger models might show improved performance on culture-specific concepts through better parameter capacity or different training approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing VLM performance on CROPE across a wider range of model scales, particularly testing frontier models with hundreds of billions of parameters, to determine if scale correlates with improved cultural concept recognition.

## Limitations

- Limited generalizability of findings due to focus on 50 culture-specific concepts from only five languages
- Unclear mechanism for why contextual information fails to improve performance (insufficient context vs. model limitations)
- Unknown impact of model architecture variations beyond parameter count on culture-specific concept recognition

## Confidence

**High confidence**: VLMs show substantial performance gaps between common and culture-specific concepts in zero-shot settings (F1 scores ~40-50% vs ~80%)

**Medium confidence**: Providing contextual knowledge does not improve performance, but reasons remain speculative without controlled experiments

**Low confidence**: Humans benefit from multimodal context when identifying unfamiliar concepts based on preliminary analysis without rigorous statistical validation

## Next Checks

1. **Controlled context ablation study**: Design experiments that systematically vary the quality and quantity of contextual information (e.g., using gold-standard descriptions vs. Wikipedia summaries) to determine whether the issue is insufficient context or model inability to utilize context.

2. **Cross-cultural concept generalization**: Test VLMs on culture-specific concepts from additional linguistic and cultural backgrounds beyond the five represented in CROPE to assess whether performance patterns generalize across diverse cultures.

3. **Human-model performance comparison**: Conduct a rigorous human evaluation study where annotators are given the same contextual information as VLMs, using identical images and descriptions, to establish whether human performance truly benefits from multimodal context and how it compares to model performance.
