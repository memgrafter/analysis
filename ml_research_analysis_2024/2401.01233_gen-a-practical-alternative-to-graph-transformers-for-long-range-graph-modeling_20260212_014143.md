- Introduces Graph Elimination Algorithm for disentangled multi-hop feature propagation

## Executive Summary
GENs present a novel approach to long-range graph modeling that addresses the quadratic complexity bottleneck of traditional Graph Transformers. By introducing a Graph Elimination Algorithm that disentangles multi-hop features during propagation, GENs achieve efficient hop-wise attention without sacrificing performance. The method combines edge-wise and hop-wise attention in parallel within a bounded K-hop receptive field, preventing feature double counting while preserving structural distinctions across different hop distances.

## Method Summary
The Graph Elimination Network (GEN) introduces a novel Graph Elimination Algorithm that performs ordered node elimination to disentangle multi-hop features during message passing. This elimination process ensures that each propagation round only injects the k-hop incremental term, preventing feature redundancy and preserving structural distinctions across hop distances. The architecture combines edge-wise attention (capturing local edge features) and hop-wise attention (capturing multi-hop relationships) in parallel, creating a separable attention kernel that operates within a bounded K-hop receptive field. This design achieves linear complexity for sparse graphs while maintaining the expressive power needed for long-range dependencies.

## Key Results
- Outperforms strong MPNN baselines by 7.7 and 6.0 percentage points on PascalVOC-SP and COCO-SP respectively
- Matches or exceeds state-of-the-art Graph Transformers on the Long-Range Graph Benchmark
- Demonstrates practical scalability by supporting full-batch training on OGBN-Products with linear complexity while sparse-attention methods struggle with memory limits

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
GENs work by fundamentally rethinking how information propagates through graphs. The Graph Elimination Algorithm creates an ordered elimination sequence that ensures each node receives information incrementally across different hop distances without redundancy. By separating edge-wise and hop-wise attention into parallel streams, GENs can capture both local edge features and long-range structural relationships simultaneously. The elimination procedure acts as a gating mechanism that prevents double counting of features while maintaining the distinct characteristics of each hop distance, enabling clean multi-hop reasoning without the quadratic complexity overhead of traditional attention mechanisms.

## Foundational Learning

**Graph Elimination Algorithm**: Why needed - To prevent feature redundancy during multi-hop propagation; Quick check - Verify that each node's features are only updated once per hop distance

**Separable Attention Kernel**: Why needed - To combine local and global information without quadratic complexity; Quick check - Confirm linear scaling with graph size while maintaining performance

**Hop-wise Disentanglement**: Why needed - To preserve structural distinctions across different path lengths; Quick check - Test that features from different hop distances remain distinguishable after propagation

**Edge-wise Attention**: Why needed - To capture fine-grained local edge relationships; Quick check - Validate that edge features are properly aggregated before multi-hop processing

**Bounded K-hop Receptive Field**: Why needed - To limit computational complexity while maintaining expressive power; Quick check - Ensure that increasing K improves performance up to a point before plateauing

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Input Graph -> Edge-wise Attention -> Hop-wise Attention -> Graph Elimination Algorithm -> Output Embeddings

Critical Path: Node features flow through edge-wise attention to capture local relationships, then through hop-wise attention for multi-hop reasoning, with the elimination algorithm ensuring proper feature disentanglement at each step.

Design Tradeoffs: The elimination ordering introduces implementation complexity but enables linear scalability. The bounded K-hop limit balances expressiveness against computational cost. Parallel edge-wise and hop-wise processing increases model capacity but requires careful coordination to prevent feature redundancy.

Failure Signatures: Performance degradation when K is too small (missing long-range dependencies), memory overflow with extremely large K values, or feature collapse when elimination ordering is suboptimal.

First Experiments: 1) Test on small synthetic graphs with known structure to verify elimination correctness, 2) Compare performance with varying K values to find optimal receptive field size, 3) Evaluate memory usage scaling on progressively larger graphs to confirm linear complexity.

## Next Checks
1. Test GENs on dynamic graph datasets (temporal citation networks or evolving social graphs) to verify elimination procedure stability and feature disentanglement over time
2. Perform ablation study isolating edge-wise and hop-wise attention components to quantify individual performance contributions
3. Evaluate GENs on larger-scale datasets (trillion-edge graphs) and heterogeneous graphs to confirm linear complexity and robustness beyond current evaluation scope
