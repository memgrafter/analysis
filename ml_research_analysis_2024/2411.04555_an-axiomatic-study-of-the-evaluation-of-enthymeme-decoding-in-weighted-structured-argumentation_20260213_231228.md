# An Axiomatic Study of the Evaluation of Enthymeme Decoding in Weighted Structured Argumentation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.04555
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04555
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces an axiomatic framework for evaluating enthymeme decodings in weighted structured argumentation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an axiomatic framework for evaluating enthymeme decodings in weighted structured argumentation. The authors formalize enthymemes as incomplete arguments where premises do not fully entail the claim, and propose seven criteria for evaluating potential decodings: inference, coherence, minimality, preservation, similarity, granularity, and stability. They introduce criterion measures that score decodings against these criteria and establish axioms that desirable measures should satisfy. The paper constructs specific measures validated by these axioms and demonstrates how to aggregate multiple criterion measures into a single quality score. The framework is tested on a running example comparing different enthymeme decodings, showing how different aggregation strategies can affect the ranking of decodings.

## Method Summary
The paper formalizes enthymemes as incomplete arguments and proposes an axiomatic framework for evaluating potential decodings. The framework uses weighted logic with confidence scores to represent enthymemes, applies normalization methods to standardize syntactic representation, and constructs seven criterion measures each satisfying specific axioms. These measures are then aggregated using functions like average or product to produce quality scores that rank different decodings. The approach is demonstrated through a running example that compares various decodings using different aggregation strategies.

## Key Results
- Seven criteria for enthymeme decoding evaluation are formalized with corresponding axioms
- Specific criterion measures are constructed that satisfy the established axioms
- Aggregation functions can combine multiple criterion measures into single quality scores
- The framework produces different rankings of decodings depending on the aggregation strategy used

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The axiomatic framework provides a principled way to evaluate enthymeme decodings by formalizing multiple quality criteria and their desired properties.
- Mechanism: The framework defines seven evaluation criteria and constructs specific criterion measures that satisfy axioms for each criterion. These measures can then be aggregated to produce a single quality score.
- Core assumption: That enthymeme decodings can be meaningfully evaluated using multiple orthogonal criteria, and that these criteria can be formalized in a way that produces useful rankings.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we introduce seven criteria related to decoding, based on different research areas"
  - [section] "For each criterion Z, we establish one or several axioms that a measure centered on Z should satisfy"
  - [corpus] Weak - The corpus contains related work on enthymemes and argumentation but no direct evidence of axiomatic frameworks for evaluation
- Break condition: If the axioms prove inconsistent or if real-world enthymeme data reveals that the proposed criteria miss important aspects of decoding quality.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The weighted logic representation allows for nuanced evaluation that accounts for confidence levels in premises and claims.
- Mechanism: By representing knowledge as weighted formulae with confidence scores, the framework can distinguish between different levels of certainty in enthymeme components and evaluate decodings accordingly. The weighted consequence relation captures how confidence propagates through inference.
- Core assumption: That confidence scores in weighted logic accurately reflect the reliability of information in real enthymeme scenarios.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We chose a weighted one, because weights play an important role in enthymeme decodings"
  - [section] "weights play an important role in enthymeme decodings as we will see it in the section devoted to the axioms"
  - [corpus] Weak - While weighted argumentation exists in the literature, specific application to enthymeme evaluation is not well-established
- Break condition: If confidence scores prove difficult to obtain or unreliable in practice, or if the weighted logic framework becomes too complex for practical application.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The normalization method ensures consistent comparison of enthymeme decodings by standardizing syntactic representation.
- Mechanism: The normalization method converts weighted formulae into a canonical form (decomposed CNF) that allows for meaningful comparison of different decodings by counting and comparing elements consistently.
- Core assumption: That syntactic normalization adequately captures semantic equivalence for the purposes of enthymeme evaluation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Later in the paper, we count the number of elements in a set of formulae Γ. Thus, we need first to normalize the syntactic form of Γ."
  - [section] "For any function taking a set of weighted formulae as a parameter, we will simplify the notation for the case of a single formula"
  - [corpus] Moderate - Normalization methods are well-established in logic, but their application to enthymeme evaluation is novel
- Break condition: If semantic differences are not adequately captured by syntactic normalization, leading to misleading comparisons between decodings.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Weighted logic and consequence relations
  - Why needed here: The entire framework relies on weighted logic as the foundation for representing enthymemes and evaluating decodings
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes a weighted consequence relation from a classical one, and why is this distinction important for enthymeme evaluation?

- Concept: Axiomatic method in evaluation
  - Why needed here: The paper's novel contribution is establishing axioms that desirable evaluation measures should satisfy
  - Quick check question: How does the axiomatic approach help ensure that evaluation measures are principled and comparable?

- Concept: Aggregation functions for multi-criteria evaluation
  - Why needed here: The framework produces multiple criterion measures that need to be combined into a single quality score
  - Quick check question: What are the key properties of aggregation functions used in this context, and how do they affect the final evaluation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Weighted Logic Representation -> Normalization Methods -> Individual Criterion Measures -> Aggregation Functions -> Quality Measures

- Critical path: The most important sequence is: input enthymeme → normalization → apply criterion measures → aggregate results → produce quality score. Each step must be implemented correctly for the system to function.

- Design tradeoffs: The framework balances expressiveness (supporting multiple evaluation criteria) against complexity (managing multiple measures and aggregation functions). Choosing which criteria to include and how to weight them involves tradeoffs between comprehensiveness and practical usability.

- Failure signatures: If the system produces inconsistent rankings (e.g., A > B and B > A under different criteria without clear resolution), this suggests axiom conflicts or aggregation function issues. If all decodings receive similar scores, the criteria may be too coarse or the aggregation may be flattening differences.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement the normalization method and verify it produces consistent representations for semantically equivalent enthymemes
  2. Implement one complete criterion measure (e.g., inference) and test it on the running example to verify it satisfies its axioms
  3. Implement a simple aggregation function and apply it to the running example to see if it produces intuitive rankings of the provided decodings

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we formally study the properties of quality measures to guarantee and explain their overall operation?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper concludes that "a formal study of the properties of these quality measures is required to guarantee and explain their overall operation."
- Why unresolved: While the paper introduces axiomatic properties for individual criterion measures, it doesn't provide a comprehensive analysis of how these measures interact when combined into quality measures through aggregation functions.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal proof showing how desirable properties of individual criterion measures (like monotonicity) are preserved or transformed when combined through various aggregation functions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How should we learn the numerical parameterization of criterion measures and aggregation functions from examples?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "the numerical parameterisation of these measures and aggregations is not straightforward. Fortunately, a solution is to learn these configurations from examples."
- Why unresolved: The paper proposes various parametric measures but doesn't provide methodology for determining optimal parameter values (like penalty scores p or acceptable error thresholds a) from real-world enthymeme decoding examples.
- What evidence would resolve it: A learning framework that takes labeled examples of enthymemes with human-judged optimal decodings and automatically determines optimal parameters for the criterion measures and aggregation functions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we apply these quality measures to optimize the generation of decodings from practical data in knowledge graphs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper concludes "we plan to apply these quality measures to optimize the generation of decoding from practical data" and mentions knowledge graphs as a potential source of weighted formulae.
- Why unresolved: While the paper establishes a theoretical framework, it doesn't demonstrate how to integrate this with real knowledge graph data extraction methods or how to optimize decoding generation algorithms using these quality measures.
- What evidence would resolve it: An implementation showing how to extract weighted formulae from a knowledge graph, generate candidate enthymeme decodings, and use the quality measures to rank and select optimal decodings in a real-world domain.

## Limitations
- The framework's reliance on weighted logic assumes confidence scores can be reliably assigned to enthymeme components, but real-world applications may struggle with obtaining meaningful weight values
- The seven criteria may not capture all relevant aspects of enthymeme decoding quality, particularly for specialized domains or non-classical argument structures
- The normalization method's syntactic approach may miss semantic nuances that could affect decoding evaluation

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The axiomatic approach itself is well-established and provides a principled framework for evaluation
- **Medium confidence**: The specific criteria and axioms are reasonable and well-motivated, but their practical effectiveness requires validation on real enthymeme data
- **Low confidence**: The weighted logic representation may prove too complex for practical application, and the assumption that confidence scores can be meaningfully assigned may not hold

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on a diverse corpus of real enthymemes from different domains to verify the criteria capture relevant quality aspects and produce intuitive rankings
2. Compare the framework's evaluations against human judgments of enthymeme decoding quality to validate the axiomatic approach
3. Investigate alternative aggregation strategies and their impact on final rankings, particularly for cases where different criteria conflict
