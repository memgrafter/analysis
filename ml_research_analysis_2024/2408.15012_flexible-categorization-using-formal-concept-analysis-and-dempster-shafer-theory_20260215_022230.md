# Flexible categorization using formal concept analysis and Dempster-Shafer theory

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.15012
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15012
- Reference count: 40
- The paper develops a formal framework for explainable categorization of business processes in auditing using formal concept analysis and Dempster-Shafer theory.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a formal framework for explainable categorization of business processes in auditing that models agents with different interrogative agendas using formal concept analysis and Dempster-Shafer theory. The framework enables agents to represent their preferences for different financial accounts as mass functions, allows deliberation between agents to reach aggregated agendas, and provides both global and local explanations for categorizations. A meta-learning algorithm is described that uses this framework for outlier detection and classification tasks, demonstrated through an application to financial statements networks.

## Method Summary
The method converts financial statement networks into formal contexts using interval scaling, then applies formal concept analysis to generate concept lattices representing different categorizations based on agents' interrogative agendas. Agents' priorities over financial accounts are represented as Dempster-Shafer mass functions, which can be combined using Dempster's rule of combination to model deliberation. A stability-based method transforms non-crisp agendas into crisp concept lattices by selecting Galois-stable subsets with high probability under the given mass function. A meta-learning algorithm learns optimal agendas for classification/outlier detection by combining results from multiple concept lattices weighted by their relevance.

## Key Results
- The framework models agents with different interrogative agendas representing their preferences for different financial accounts
- Dempster-Shafer mass functions enable deliberation between agents to reach aggregated agendas
- A meta-learning algorithm uses the framework for outlier detection and classification with both global and local explanations
- The method is demonstrated on financial statements networks showing how different agents' agendas lead to different categorizations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The framework allows different agents to represent and combine their priorities over financial accounts using Dempster-Shafer mass functions, enabling explainable categorization.
- Mechanism: Each agent's interest in subsets of financial accounts is encoded as a Dempster-Shafer mass function. When multiple agents interact, their mass functions are combined using Dempster's rule of combination, producing an aggregated mass function that reflects the group's collective priorities.
- Core assumption: Agents' priorities over subsets of financial accounts can be accurately represented as mass functions, and Dempster's rule of combination appropriately models their deliberation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We use Dempster-Shafer mass functions to represent agendas showing different interest in different set of financial accounts."
  - [section 6]: "Suppose different agents have mass functions describing their interest or preference in different set of issues i.e. for agent j we have a mass function m j : P(X) → [0, 1] where for any Y ⊆ X, m j(Y) denotes preference of agent to use set of features (agenda) Y as a criterion for categorization."
  - [corpus]: Weak. No corpus evidence directly confirms that Dempster-Shafer combination models deliberation accurately in auditing contexts.
- Break condition: If agents' priorities cannot be meaningfully expressed as mass functions over subsets, or if Dempster's rule produces counterintuitive results in the deliberation scenario.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The stability-based method transforms non-crisp agendas into crisp concept lattices by selecting subsets of business processes that are Galois-stable with high probability under the given mass function.
- Mechanism: For each subset G of business processes, the stability index ρm(G) is computed as the sum of probabilities of all contexts in which G is Galois-stable. Subsets with stability index above a threshold β form the crisp categorization.
- Core assumption: Galois-stable sets under high-probability contexts represent meaningful and stable categories for the given agenda.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 6.1.1]: "For any G ⊆ A, the stability index of G is given by ρm(G) = X {m′(P1) | G is Galois-stable in P1}."
  - [section 6.1.1]: "P(m, β) = {Cl(G) | G ⊆ A, ρm(G) ≥ β}."
  - [corpus]: Weak. No corpus evidence validates the stability-based method as a general approach for transforming non-crisp agendas.
- Break condition: If the stability index fails to correlate with category meaningfulness, or if the threshold β is poorly chosen, leading to over- or under-partitioning.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The meta-learning algorithm learns an agenda (mass function) that optimizes classification/outlier detection performance by combining results from multiple concept lattices weighted by their relevance.
- Mechanism: The algorithm maintains a weight vector for concept lattices, updates it via gradient descent to minimize a loss function comparing predictions to labels, and uses the learned weights to define a mass function representing feature set importance.
- Core assumption: The performance of a classification/outlier detection algorithm can be improved by learning to weight different concept lattices based on their relevance to the task.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 8]: "The meta-algorithm learns an (non-crisp) agenda best suited for given outlier detection or classification task."
  - [section 8]: "The probability function induced on set of all categorizations by this agenda are used as estimation of relevance of this categorization to given task."
  - [corpus]: Weak. No corpus evidence demonstrates the meta-learning algorithm's effectiveness in practice.
- Break condition: If the gradient descent optimization fails to converge, or if the learned agenda does not generalize beyond the training data.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Formal Concept Analysis (FCA)
  - Why needed here: FCA provides the mathematical framework for generating hierarchical categorizations (concept lattices) from formal contexts, which are used to represent financial statement networks.
  - Quick check question: Given a formal context (A, X, I), can you construct the corresponding concept lattice by computing all formal concepts?

- Concept: Dempster-Shafer Theory
  - Why needed here: Dempster-Shafer theory allows representing and combining uncertain beliefs about subsets of financial accounts, enabling agents to express and aggregate their priorities.
  - Quick check question: Given two mass functions m1 and m2, can you compute their combination using Dempster's rule of combination?

- Concept: Galois Connections
  - Why needed here: Galois connections define the derivation operators used to compute formal concepts in FCA, which are essential for generating the categorizations.
  - Quick check question: Given a formal context (A, X, I), can you define the derivation operators f': P(A) → P(X) and f: P(X) → P(A)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Financial statement network -> Formal context conversion -> Conceptual scaling -> Concept lattice generation -> Agent mass function definition -> Dempster's rule combination -> Stability-based method -> Meta-learning algorithm -> Explainable categorizations and predictions

- Critical path:
  1. Convert financial statement network to formal context
  2. Define agents' mass functions
  3. Generate concept lattices for each agent's agenda
  4. Combine mass functions using Dempster's rule
  5. Apply stability-based method to obtain crisp categorization

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Computational cost vs. granularity: Finer conceptual scaling leads to more features and larger concept lattices, increasing computational cost.
  - Stability threshold β: Lower β yields finer categorizations but may include less stable categories.
  - Mass function complexity: More focal elements in mass functions allow finer-grained priority representation but increase computational complexity.

- Failure signatures:
  - Empty concept lattice: Indicates no meaningful categories exist for the given agenda.
  - Degenerate mass function: All mass assigned to the empty set or the entire set, indicating no useful priority information.
  - Unstable categories: Categories with low stability indices that may not be meaningful.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Generate concept lattices for a simple financial statement network with 3-5 business processes and 3-5 financial accounts using different conceptual scaling methods.
  2. Define two agents with different mass functions and combine them using Dempster's rule, then generate the resulting concept lattice.
  3. Apply the stability-based method to a non-crisp agenda and compare the resulting crisp categorization to the most likely categorization.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the framework handle agents with conflicting or contradictory agendas when attempting to reach a common categorization?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses deliberation scenarios between agents with different agendas but doesn't fully explore the outcomes when agents have fundamentally conflicting interests.
- Why unresolved: While the paper mentions using Dempster-Shafer theory for combining agendas, it doesn't provide a clear mechanism for resolving situations where agents' preferences are completely opposed.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal model showing how the framework handles contradictory agendas, including specific rules for combining or resolving conflicts when agents have opposing views on feature relevance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the computational complexity of the stability-based method for obtaining crisp categorizations from non-crisp agendas?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper introduces a novel stability-based method but doesn't analyze its computational efficiency, especially considering the exponential growth of possible categorizations with feature count.
- Why unresolved: The method's complexity is crucial for practical implementation, yet the paper only describes the theoretical framework without performance analysis.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed complexity analysis showing time and space requirements, along with empirical benchmarks comparing the stability-based method to other categorization approaches.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How sensitive are the categorization results to the choice of stability parameter β in the stability-based method?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces β as a parameter for controlling categorization stability but doesn't provide guidance on how to choose or tune this parameter.
- Why unresolved: The paper establishes that lower β values lead to finer categorizations but doesn't explore the practical implications of different β values or provide a principled approach to selecting it.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies showing how categorization results vary with different β values across multiple datasets, along with recommendations for parameter selection based on data characteristics.

## Limitations
- Computational complexity: Exponential growth of concept lattices with increasing features makes scalability a significant concern for large financial networks.
- Assumption validity: The framework assumes agents' priorities can be accurately modeled as Dempster-Shafer mass functions and that Dempster's rule of combination appropriately represents deliberation.
- Meta-learning validation: The effectiveness of the meta-learning algorithm for optimizing classification/outlier detection performance needs empirical demonstration.

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The mathematical foundations of Formal Concept Analysis and Dempster-Shafer theory are well-established and correctly applied in the framework.
- Medium Confidence: The stability-based method for transforming non-crisp agendas into crisp categorizations is theoretically sound, but its practical effectiveness requires validation.
- Low Confidence: The meta-learning algorithm's ability to optimize classification/outlier detection performance through learned agendas needs empirical demonstration.

## Next Checks
1. **Scalability Test**: Apply the framework to progressively larger financial networks (10, 50, 100+ business processes) and measure computational time and memory usage to identify practical limits.

2. **Agent Preference Validation**: Conduct user studies with auditing professionals to assess whether Dempster-Shafer mass functions accurately capture their priority structures and whether the combined results align with expert judgment.

3. **Meta-Learning Performance**: Implement the meta-learning algorithm on a standardized financial dataset with known outliers and evaluate its detection accuracy against baseline methods, measuring both precision and interpretability of explanations.
