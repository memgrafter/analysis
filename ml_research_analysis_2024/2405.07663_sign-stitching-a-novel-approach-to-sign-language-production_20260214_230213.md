# Sign Stitching: A Novel Approach to Sign Language Production

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.07663
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07663
- Authors: Harry Walsh; Ben Saunders; Richard Bowden
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on SLP, with up to 269% improvement in BLEU-1 scores over baselines

## Executive Summary
Sign Stitching addresses the challenge of producing natural and expressive sign language sequences from spoken language text by leveraging dictionary examples of isolated signs and stitching them together with facial expressions. The approach overcomes the "regression to the mean" problem that plagues direct pose regression methods by using pre-recorded expressive signs rather than generating new poses. The method includes a novel sign segmentation technique for cases without ground truth timing information and achieves significant improvements across multiple sign language datasets through back-translation evaluation and user studies.

## Method Summary
The Sign Stitching approach uses a 7-step pipeline: (1) select appropriate signs and facial expressions from dictionaries, (2) convert signs to 3D canonical poses, (3) crop signs to remove resting poses, (4) resample signs to predicted durations, (5) stitch signs with smart transitions, (6) concatenate and resample to ground truth length, and (7) apply frequency-domain filtering with predicted cutoff values. A translation transformer predicts glosses, durations, facial expressions, and cutoff frequencies from spoken language text. Facial expressions are generated using a Noise Substitution Vector Quantization (NSVQ) model, and photo-realistic videos are produced using SignGAN from the final pose sequences.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple sign language datasets (BSL CorpusT, PHOENIX14T, mDGS)
- Shows up to 269% improvement in BLEU-1 scores on the mDGS dataset compared to baseline methods
- User evaluations indicate enhanced realism and expressiveness of the produced sign language sequences
- Introduces novel sign segmentation technique for datasets without ground truth timing information

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Stitching isolated sign dictionary examples prevents regression to the mean that plagues direct pose regression from text.
- Mechanism: By using pre-recorded, expressive isolated signs instead of generating new poses, the system avoids the averaging effect seen in prior work where models output under-articulated, mean-like poses due to limited training data diversity.
- Core assumption: Isolated signs in the dictionary are sufficiently expressive and cover the required vocabulary for translation tasks.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "simply concatenating the signs would create robotic and unnatural sequences" → implies isolated signs exist but need proper joining; [section] "previous works have suffered from regression to the mean, resulting in under-articulated and incomprehensible signing" → sets up the problem solved by dictionary-based stitching.
- Break condition: If the dictionary is incomplete or lacks expressive variants, the system will still produce under-articulated signing.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Frequency-domain filtering and resampling mimic natural prosody, making stitched sequences stylistically cohesive.
- Mechanism: Predicted low-pass cutoff values and duration adjustments are applied per sequence to smooth movements and align signing rhythm with original continuous data, emulating natural signer style.
- Core assumption: Prosodic features in the original data are learnable and can be transferred via low-pass filtering and timing modification.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "applying filtering in the frequency domain and resampling each sign we create cohesive natural sequences, that mimic the prosody found in the original data."; [section] "by applying filtering in the frequency domain, we can adjust the trajectory of each sign to create softer signing, akin to how signers modify a sign to convey sentiment" → explains the stylistic smoothing.
- Break condition: If predicted cutoffs or durations are inaccurate, the resulting sequence may sound unnatural or out of sync.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Learned facial expression codebook via Noise Substitution VQ enables realistic non-manual features in the produced sequence.
- Mechanism: NSVQ VAE learns discrete facial expression tokens from continuous data and maps them to isolated signs, adding non-manual features that were missing from dictionary examples.
- Core assumption: Facial expressions can be effectively clustered into a discrete vocabulary and transferred to isolated signs without breaking manual articulation.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "we propose a Noise Substitution Vector Quantization (NSVQ) transformer architecture to learn a dictionary of facial expressions that can be added to each sign"; [section] "we apply a NSVQ to learn a spatial-temporal dictionary of facial expressions" → describes the training approach.
- Break condition: If facial expression tokens do not align temporally with sign articulation, the result may look unnatural.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Vector Quantization and discrete latent spaces
  - Why needed here: Enables compact, learnable representation of facial expressions and supports efficient decoding into continuous sequences.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the codebook in NSVQ and how does it differ from standard VQ?

- Concept: Dynamic Time Warping for sequence alignment
  - Why needed here: Used to infer sign durations from ground truth data when gloss timing is unavailable, by aligning stitched sequences to original.
  - Quick check question: How does DTW handle different lengths between the stitched and original sequences?

- Concept: Butterworth low-pass filtering
  - Why needed here: Smooths pose trajectories to mimic natural signer style and remove sharp, robotic transitions.
  - Quick check question: What does the cutoff frequency control in the Butterworth filter applied to pose sequences?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Translation Transformer (text→gloss+duration+face+cutoff) → Stitching Pipeline (dictionary lookup, cropping, resampling, smart stitching, filtering) → NSVQ Face Generator → SignGAN (pose→photo-realistic video)
- Critical path: Text input → Translation model → Stitching → Pose output → SignGAN → Final video
- Design tradeoffs: Using dictionary examples avoids regression but requires complete, expressive dictionary; frequency filtering smooths style but may lose sharp articulation; NSVQ facial expressions add realism but depend on quality of learned codebook.
- Failure signatures: Under-articulated signs (incomplete dictionary), unnatural transitions (bad stitching parameters), robotic motion (filter cutoff too aggressive), missing facial features (NSVQ failure), poor visual quality (SignGAN issues).
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test translation model outputs (gloss, duration, face tokens, cutoff) on dev set and compare BLEU scores.
  2. Validate stitching pipeline on a small set of known glosses: check pose continuity, cropping correctness, and duration resampling.
  3. Evaluate NSVQ facial expression generation: ensure facial tokens align with sign timing and look natural when overlaid on poses.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the Sign Stitching approach scale with the size of the sign language dictionary, and what is the optimal dictionary size for balancing expressiveness and computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using a dictionary of 500 facial expressions and discusses the trade-offs between isolated and continuous dictionaries.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a systematic study of how dictionary size impacts performance or computational efficiency.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing performance and efficiency across varying dictionary sizes.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the Sign Stitching approach handle out-of-vocabulary signs, and what is the impact on the quality and coherence of the produced sign language sequences?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using word embeddings to find the closest matching sign for out-of-vocabulary glosses.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not evaluate the effectiveness of this substitution method or its impact on the overall quality of the produced sequences.
- What evidence would resolve it: User studies or objective metrics comparing sequences with and without out-of-vocabulary substitutions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the Sign Stitching approach be extended to handle sign language variants and regional differences, and how would this impact the model's performance and generalization?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses different datasets for German and British Sign Language, suggesting some awareness of regional differences.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the challenges of handling sign language variants or propose methods to adapt the model for different regions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments training and evaluating the model on multiple sign language variants or regional datasets.

## Limitations

- Dictionary Completeness: The approach assumes a comprehensive, expressive dictionary of isolated signs exists. If vocabulary coverage is incomplete or signs lack expressive variation, the system cannot generate missing content, limiting applicability to languages or domains with limited resources.

- Prosody Transfer Generalization: The frequency-domain filtering and duration adjustment mechanism relies on learning prosodic patterns from continuous data. The method's effectiveness may degrade when applied to datasets with different signing styles or when the original data lacks sufficient prosodic variation.

- Facial Expression Alignment: The NSVQ-based facial expression system assumes temporal alignment between learned facial tokens and manual signs is learnable and stable. Without quantitative validation of this alignment quality, there's risk of producing mismatched or unnatural non-manual features.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core stitching pipeline (dictionary lookup, cropping, resampling, smart transitions) is well-specified and grounded in standard signal processing techniques. The problem formulation and evaluation methodology (back-translation with CSLR, user studies) are clearly defined.

- **Medium Confidence**: The claim of state-of-the-art performance (269% BLEU-1 improvement on mDGS) is supported by quantitative results, but the comparison methodology and baseline implementations are not fully detailed in the paper. The prosody transfer mechanism is plausible but lacks direct empirical validation.

- **Low Confidence**: The NSVQ facial expression generation is described conceptually but lacks implementation details, making it difficult to assess whether the claimed benefits are achievable. The method's effectiveness depends heavily on unstated architectural and training specifics.

## Next Checks

1. **Dictionary Coverage Analysis**: Audit the sign dictionary completeness across the three datasets by counting unique glosses and identifying any missing vocabulary. Test system performance when dictionary coverage drops below 90%.

2. **Prosody Transfer Ablation**: Implement an ablation study comparing sequences with and without frequency-domain filtering and duration adjustment. Measure quantitative differences in DTW-MJE and conduct user studies specifically focused on naturalness of motion.

3. **Facial Expression Alignment Validation**: Extract facial expression timing from ground truth data and compare against NSVQ-generated facial token sequences. Measure temporal alignment accuracy and conduct user studies focusing specifically on non-manual feature quality and synchronization.
