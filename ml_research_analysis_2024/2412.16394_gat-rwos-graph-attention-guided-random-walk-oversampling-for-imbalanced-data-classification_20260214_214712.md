# GAT-RWOS: Graph Attention-Guided Random Walk Oversampling for Imbalanced Data Classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.16394
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16394
- Authors: Zahiriddin Rustamov; Abderrahmane Lakas; Nazar Zaki
- Reference count: 21
- One-line primary result: GAT-RWOS consistently outperforms original data and state-of-the-art oversampling techniques, achieving average balanced accuracy of 0.843, F1-score of 0.727, AUC of 0.843, and G-mean of 0.818.

## Executive Summary
GAT-RWOS addresses class imbalance in machine learning by combining Graph Attention Networks (GATs) with random walk-based oversampling. The method uses GAT's attention mechanism to guide random walks through informative neighborhoods of minority nodes, generating synthetic samples that expand class boundaries while preserving the original data distribution. Experiments on 24 imbalanced datasets demonstrate that GAT-RWOS consistently outperforms the original data and state-of-the-art oversampling techniques.

## Method Summary
GAT-RWOS combines Graph Attention Networks with attention-guided random walks for imbalanced classification. The method trains a GAT on graph representations of tabular data, extracts attention weights between nodes, and uses these weights as transition probabilities in biased random walks. During the random walk, the algorithm interpolates features between consecutive nodes to generate synthetic minority samples. The method operates directly in feature space, making it compatible with existing ML pipelines without requiring additional post-processing.

## Key Results
- GAT-RWOS achieves average balanced accuracy of 0.843, significantly outperforming original data and state-of-the-art oversampling techniques
- The method demonstrates particular effectiveness on datasets with high imbalance ratios, with improvements most pronounced in severe class imbalance scenarios
- GAT-RWOS consistently improves F1-score (0.727), AUC (0.843), and G-mean (0.818) across all 24 tested datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GAT-RWOS leverages attention weights from GAT to guide random walks toward informative minority node neighborhoods.
- Mechanism: The GAT learns attention coefficients αij between nodes i and j, which capture the importance of each neighbor. These attention weights are then used as transition probabilities in a biased random walk, steering the walk toward regions likely to generate valuable synthetic samples.
- Core assumption: Attention weights from GAT accurately reflect the importance of neighboring nodes for minority class representation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "GAT-RWOS leverages the attention mechanism of GATs to guide the random walk process, focusing on the most informative neighbourhoods for each minority node."
  - [section] "The attention coefficients αij between nodes i and j are computed as... The output features for each node are obtained by aggregating features across the node's neighbours, scaled by the computed attention coefficients..."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence. No corpus neighbors explicitly discuss GAT-guided random walks or attention-based sampling in imbalanced learning contexts.
- Break condition: If attention weights do not correlate with node importance for minority class representation, the random walk may focus on irrelevant neighborhoods.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Attention-guided interpolation along random walk paths generates synthetic samples that expand minority class boundaries while preserving data distribution.
- Mechanism: After performing a biased random walk, the method interpolates features between consecutive nodes along the path using attention-guided weights. This interpolation creates new minority samples that are positioned in meaningful locations in the feature space.
- Core assumption: Linear interpolation between node features along random walk paths creates realistic minority samples that preserve local data structure.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "By performing attention-guided random walks and interpolating features along the traversed paths, GAT-RWOS generates synthetic minority samples that expand class boundaries while preserving the original data distribution."
  - [section] "The synthetic feature vector xnew is obtained via weighted summation... xnew[k] = λ′i,i+1xi[k] + (1 − λ′i,i+1)xi+1[k], if k ∈ T"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence. No corpus neighbors discuss interpolation-based oversampling methods or their effectiveness in imbalanced learning.
- Break condition: If the interpolation method creates unrealistic samples or disrupts local data structure, the generated samples may not improve classification performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Operating directly in feature space allows GAT-RWOS to integrate easily into existing ML pipelines without additional post-processing.
- Mechanism: Unlike graph-based methods that augment graphs and struggle to map back to feature space, GAT-RWOS works directly with node features, generating synthetic samples in the same feature space as the original data.
- Core assumption: Working directly in feature space provides better compatibility with standard ML pipelines compared to graph augmentation approaches.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Furthermore, operating directly in the feature space allows GAT-RWOS to integrate easily into existing ML pipelines without additional post-processing."
  - [section] "Unlike graph-based methods... GAT-RWOS works directly with node features, generating synthetic samples in the same feature space as the original data."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence. No corpus neighbors discuss integration challenges of graph-based oversampling methods or advantages of feature-space approaches.
- Break condition: If the feature space representation loses important structural information that graph-based methods preserve, the synthetic samples may be less informative.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph Attention Networks (GATs)
  - Why needed here: GATs provide the attention mechanism that guides the random walk process toward informative minority node neighborhoods.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between GATs and standard graph convolutional networks (GCNs)?

- Concept: Random Walk Oversampling
  - Why needed here: Random walks provide a systematic way to explore the graph structure and identify regions where synthetic minority samples should be generated.
  - Quick check question: How does the transition probability calculation in a biased random walk differ from a standard random walk?

- Concept: Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)
  - Why needed here: GAT-RWOS builds upon the interpolation concept from SMOTE but enhances it with attention-guided random walks.
  - Quick check question: What is the main limitation of SMOTE that GAT-RWOS aims to address?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: GAT model -> Biased random walk -> Attention-guided interpolation -> Synthetic sample generation -> Classification pipeline

- Critical path: GAT training → Attention weight extraction → Biased random walk → Interpolation → Synthetic sample generation → Classification

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Computational cost vs. oversampling quality: GAT training adds overhead but produces more informative synthetic samples
  - Feature space vs. graph space: Working in feature space improves integration but may lose some structural information
  - Interpolation method: Simple linear interpolation is efficient but may not capture complex relationships

- Failure signatures:
  - Attention weights converge to uniform values: Random walk loses guidance and behaves like standard random walk
  - Synthetic samples cluster in unrealistic regions: Interpolation parameters or attention weights are poorly calibrated
  - No performance improvement on imbalanced datasets: Method fails to address class imbalance effectively

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify GAT attention weights correlate with node importance by visualizing attention distributions on known graph structures
  2. Test synthetic sample generation on a simple 2D imbalanced dataset and visualize sample placement relative to original data
  3. Compare GAT-RWOS performance against SMOTE and RWOS on a medium-sized imbalanced dataset using multiple classifiers

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does GAT-RWOS perform on multi-class imbalanced classification problems compared to binary classification?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses binary classification datasets and mentions that extending GAT-RWOS to multi-class imbalance remains to be explored.
- Why unresolved: The current study focuses exclusively on binary classification, and the effectiveness of GAT-RWOS on multi-class problems is not evaluated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing GAT-RWOS performance on multi-class imbalanced datasets against baseline methods and existing multi-class oversampling techniques.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of hyperparameter tuning on GAT-RWOS performance, and how sensitive is the method to specific parameter choices?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning but doesn't provide sensitivity analysis.
- Why unresolved: While the paper states that hyperparameters were tuned using Optuna, there is no analysis of how performance varies with different parameter values or which parameters are most critical.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic sensitivity analysis showing performance changes across different ranges of key hyperparameters like attention threshold, random walk parameters, and GAT architecture choices.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the computational complexity of GAT-RWOS scale with dataset size and dimensionality compared to other oversampling methods?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges higher computational complexity due to GAT training but doesn't provide detailed complexity analysis or scaling experiments.
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions that GAT-RWOS has higher computational complexity than simpler methods but doesn't quantify this relationship or provide runtime comparisons across different dataset sizes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Runtime experiments showing how GAT-RWOS performance scales with increasing dataset size, feature dimensions, and imbalance ratio compared to baseline methods.

## Limitations

- The method's performance heavily depends on the quality of attention weights learned by the GAT, which is not thoroughly validated
- Computational complexity is higher than simpler oversampling methods due to GAT training requirements
- The interpolation method's effectiveness in preserving local data structure is assumed rather than empirically demonstrated

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The experimental results showing GAT-RWOS outperforming baseline methods on the 24 KEEL datasets. The methodology is clearly specified and the evaluation metrics are standard in imbalanced learning research.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that attention-guided random walks generate more informative synthetic samples than standard random walks. While this is supported by experimental results, the mechanism could benefit from more rigorous validation.

**Low Confidence**: The assertion that GAT-RWOS is particularly effective on datasets with high imbalance ratios. The paper presents this as a key advantage, but the analysis focuses on aggregate performance across all datasets rather than systematically varying the imbalance ratio.

## Next Checks

1. **Attention Weight Validation**: Visualize and statistically analyze the correlation between GAT attention weights and actual node importance for minority class representation on several test datasets.

2. **Interpolation Quality Assessment**: Generate synthetic samples on a simple 2D imbalanced dataset and quantitatively measure how well the interpolated samples preserve local data structure compared to original SMOTE.

3. **Imbalance Ratio Sensitivity**: Systematically test GAT-RWOS performance across datasets with varying imbalance ratios (e.g., IR < 10, 10-50, >50) to validate claims about effectiveness on highly imbalanced data.
