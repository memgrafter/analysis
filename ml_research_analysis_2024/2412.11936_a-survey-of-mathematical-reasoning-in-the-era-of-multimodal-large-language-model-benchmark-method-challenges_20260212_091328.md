## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of mathematical reasoning capabilities in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), examining over 200 studies published since 2021. The work systematically categorizes the field into three dimensions: benchmarks, methodologies, and challenges. It identifies three distinct paradigms for LLM-based mathematical reasoning approaches - Reasoner, Enhancer, and Planner - and highlights seven major obstacles hindering progress in multimodal mathematical reasoning. The survey emphasizes that while significant advancements have been made, particularly in text-based mathematical reasoning, multimodal contexts present unique challenges due to complex cross-modal interactions and diverse problem types.

## Method Summary
The survey employed a systematic review methodology, analyzing over 200 studies in the Math-LLM domain since 2021. The approach involved categorizing benchmarks across four dimensions (basic focus, tasks, evaluation, training data), classifying methodologies into three paradigms (Reasoner, Enhancer, Planner), and identifying seven key challenges through comprehensive analysis. The reproduction plan involves collecting and categorizing benchmark datasets, implementing the three methodology paradigms, and evaluating models using discriminative and generative metrics. However, some implementation details remain unspecified, particularly regarding multimodal processing pipelines and specific training procedures for each paradigm.

## Key Results
- Comprehensive categorization of Math-LLM research into benchmarks, methodologies, and challenges
- Identification of three distinct LLM-based mathematical reasoning paradigms: Reasoner, Enhancer, and Planner
- Systematic analysis of benchmarks across four key dimensions (basic focus, task, evaluation, training data)
- Highlighting of seven major challenges including lack of high-quality multimodal datasets and insufficient visual reasoning capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** The survey's categorization of LLM-based mathematical reasoning into three paradigms—Reasoner, Enhancer, and Planner—provides a structured framework for understanding the current landscape and future directions of the field.
- **Mechanism:** By organizing methodologies into these three distinct roles, the survey enables researchers to identify the strengths and limitations of each approach, facilitating targeted improvements and hybrid strategies.
- **Core assumption:** The three paradigms are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive in capturing the ways LLMs are used in mathematical reasoning.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "We categorize the field into three dimensions: benchmarks, methodologies, and challenges."
  - [section 3.1] "Based on our comprehensive review of recent methodologies... we classify the works into three distinct paradigms: LLM as Reasoner (Sec.3.2), LLM as Enhancer (Sec.3.3), and LLM as Planner (Sec.3.4)."
- **Break condition:** If new LLM-based mathematical reasoning methodologies emerge that do not fit into any of these three paradigms, the categorization would need to be revised.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** The survey's identification of seven key challenges provides a roadmap for future research efforts in multimodal mathematical reasoning.
- **Mechanism:** By highlighting specific obstacles such as lack of high-quality multimodal datasets, insufficient visual reasoning, and limited domain generalization, the survey directs researchers towards the most pressing issues that need to be addressed.
- **Core assumption:** The identified challenges are the most significant barriers to advancing multimodal mathematical reasoning capabilities.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Finally, we identify seven major challenges hindering the realization of AGI in this domain, offering insights into the future direction for enhancing multimodal reasoning capabilities."
  - [section 4] "In the realm of MLLMs for mathematical reasoning, the following key challenges persist that hinder their full potential."
- **Break condition:** If new research demonstrates that some of these challenges are not as critical as initially thought, or if other challenges become more prominent, the roadmap would need to be updated.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** The survey's comprehensive analysis of benchmarks provides a standardized framework for evaluating the performance of Math-LLMs across different tasks and modalities.
- **Mechanism:** By examining benchmarks through four key aspects—basic focus, task, evaluation, and training data—the survey offers a holistic view of the current state of evaluation practices in the field.
- **Core assumption:** The four aspects of benchmark analysis (basic focus, task, evaluation, and training data) are sufficient to capture the essential characteristics of a benchmark.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 2.1] "In this section, we present a comprehensive analysis of recent benchmarks for mathematical reasoning in the context of (M)LLMs."
  - [section 2.2-2.5] The survey systematically covers basic focus, tasks, evaluation, and training data aspects of benchmarks.
- **Break condition:** If new types of benchmarks emerge that cannot be adequately described by these four aspects, the framework would need to be expanded.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Multimodal learning
  - **Why needed here:** Mathematical reasoning often involves integrating information from multiple modalities (text, images, diagrams), making multimodal learning essential for developing effective Math-LLMs.
  - **Quick check question:** What are the key challenges in aligning text and visual information in multimodal mathematical problems?

- **Concept:** Chain-of-thought reasoning
  - **Why needed here:** Many mathematical problems require step-by-step reasoning, and chain-of-thought prompting has been shown to improve LLM performance on complex reasoning tasks.
  - **Quick check question:** How does chain-of-thought reasoning differ from direct answer generation in the context of mathematical problem-solving?

- **Concept:** Process reward modeling
  - **Why needed here:** Process reward modeling can provide more nuanced feedback on the reasoning process itself, rather than just the final answer, which is crucial for improving mathematical reasoning capabilities.
  - **Quick check question:** What are the advantages of using process reward modeling over outcome-based reward modeling in training Math-LLMs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  - Benchmark analysis component -> Methodology classification component -> Challenge identification component -> Progress tracking component

- **Critical path:**
  1. Analyze existing benchmarks to understand the current state of evaluation practices
  2. Classify methodologies into the three paradigms to identify strengths and limitations
  3. Identify key challenges that need to be addressed for future progress
  4. Track progress in Math-LLMs to stay informed about the latest developments

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Comprehensive coverage vs. depth of analysis: The survey aims to provide a broad overview of the field, but this may come at the cost of in-depth analysis of specific topics
  - Generalizability vs. specificity: The three paradigms are designed to be broadly applicable, but they may not capture all nuances of specific approaches
  - Timeliness vs. completeness: The survey covers over 200 studies since 2021, but some recent developments may not be included

- **Failure signatures:**
  - If a new LLM-based mathematical reasoning approach does not fit into any of the three paradigms, it may indicate a gap in the categorization
  - If the identified challenges do not align with the actual obstacles faced by researchers, the roadmap may be ineffective
  - If the benchmark analysis framework does not adequately capture the essential characteristics of new benchmarks, it may become outdated

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Apply the three paradigms to a new LLM-based mathematical reasoning approach to test the categorization's comprehensiveness
  2. Use the seven identified challenges to guide the development of a new multimodal mathematical reasoning system and evaluate its effectiveness
  3. Extend the benchmark analysis framework to include a new type of benchmark and assess its ability to capture the essential characteristics of the new benchmark

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can multimodal data augmentation techniques be developed that effectively combine visual and textual elements to create more diverse and challenging mathematical reasoning tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that current multimodal mathematical reasoning datasets face limitations in task diversity, with an overemphasis on problem-solving versus error diagnosis or theorem proving. It also notes that while text-based augmentation methods have proven effective, the potential for multimodal augmentation is still underexplored.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific examples of successful multimodal data augmentation techniques, nor does it discuss the challenges in creating such techniques that effectively combine visual and textual elements.
- What evidence would resolve it: Research demonstrating successful multimodal data augmentation techniques that improve mathematical reasoning performance on diverse task types, such as error detection or theorem proving, would resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can test-time scaling techniques be effectively integrated with multimodal mathematical reasoning to dynamically allocate computational resources based on problem complexity across modalities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies "Test-Time Scaling Technique in Multimodal Context" as a challenge, noting that current implementations struggle to dynamically allocate computational resources based on math problem complexity across modalities.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific examples of how test-time scaling techniques can be adapted for multimodal mathematical reasoning, nor does it discuss the potential benefits or limitations of such an approach.
- What evidence would resolve it: Research demonstrating improved mathematical reasoning performance using test-time scaling techniques specifically adapted for multimodal problems, with measurable improvements in efficiency and accuracy, would resolve this question.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the most effective strategies for integrating multimodal mathematical reasoning models with real-world educational needs, such as incorporating draft notes and handwritten calculations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies "Integration with Real-world Educational Needs" as a challenge, noting that existing benchmarks and models often overlook real-world educational contexts like handwritten notes or diagrams used by students.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific examples of how multimodal mathematical reasoning models can be adapted to incorporate real-world educational elements, nor does it discuss the potential challenges or benefits of such an approach.
- What evidence would resolve it: Research demonstrating successful integration of multimodal mathematical reasoning models with real-world educational data, such as handwritten notes or diagrams, and measurable improvements in student learning outcomes, would resolve this question.

## Limitations
- The rapid pace of developments in Math-LLMs means some cutting-edge approaches may not be included in the survey
- The three-paradigm methodology classification may not fully capture hybrid approaches that combine multiple paradigms
- Current benchmarks may not adequately represent real-world mathematical reasoning scenarios, particularly those requiring deep integration of visual and textual information

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The survey's systematic categorization of benchmarks across four dimensions (basic focus, task, evaluation, training data) is well-supported by evidence from the 200+ reviewed studies and provides a reliable framework for understanding current evaluation practices.
- **Medium Confidence**: The three-paradigm classification of methodologies is grounded in extensive review but may face challenges as new hybrid approaches emerge that don't fit neatly into any single category.
- **Medium Confidence**: The identification of seven key challenges is based on comprehensive analysis but may not fully capture all future obstacles, particularly as new technical approaches are developed.

## Next Checks
1. **Paradigm Coverage Test**: Apply the three methodology paradigms (Reasoner, Enhancer, Planner) to five recently published Math-LLM approaches not included in the survey to assess whether the categorization framework remains comprehensive and identify any emerging paradigms.

2. **Challenge Prioritization Validation**: Conduct a Delphi study with 10-15 active researchers in the field to rank the seven identified challenges by severity and urgency, comparing their assessments with the survey's conclusions.

3. **Benchmark Framework Extension**: Attempt to apply the four-dimensional benchmark analysis framework (basic focus, task, evaluation, training data) to a new type of mathematical reasoning benchmark that emerged after the survey's completion to test the framework's adaptability.
