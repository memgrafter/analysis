# Large Multi-modal Models Can Interpret Features in Large Multi-modal Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.14982
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14982
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces a framework for interpreting open-semantic features in large multimodal models (LMMs) using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and LMM-based zero-shot interpretation.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel framework for interpreting the internal representations of large multimodal models by combining sparse autoencoders with another LMM for zero-shot interpretation. The approach automatically identifies and explains visual concepts extracted from LMM neural representations, achieving interpretable feature discovery without human annotation. The method demonstrates practical utility through hallucination reduction experiments and reveals insights into low-level visual features and emotional representations across modalities.

## Method Summary
The framework employs sparse autoencoders to disentangle neural representations in LMMs, extracting sparse features from model activations. These extracted features are then interpreted using a separate LMM in a zero-shot manner, allowing automatic semantic labeling of discovered visual concepts. The approach is applied to different layers of the LLaVA architecture, with evaluation using CLIP scores to measure interpretability quality. The method also enables targeted model steering by identifying and modifying specific feature activations.

## Key Results
- Achieves CLIP-scores of 24.92 and 26.55 on different LLaVA layers, significantly outperforming random baselines
- Demonstrates 9% reduction in hallucinations on HallucinationBench through targeted feature modification
- Reveals interpretable visual concepts including low-level features, emotional representations, and invariant concepts across modalities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging the complementary strengths of SAEs and LMMs: SAEs excel at decomposing complex neural activations into sparse, interpretable components, while LMMs possess strong zero-shot reasoning capabilities for semantic interpretation. The SAE acts as a feature extractor that identifies salient patterns in the LMM's internal representations, and the LMM then provides semantic labels for these patterns without requiring labeled training data. This creates a self-interpreting system where the model can explain its own internal features.

## Foundational Learning

**Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs)**: Neural networks that learn to compress and reconstruct inputs while enforcing sparsity in the latent representation. Why needed: Enables decomposition of dense neural activations into interpretable, sparse features. Quick check: Verify reconstruction quality and sparsity levels during training.

**Zero-shot Learning**: Model inference without task-specific training, using only pre-existing knowledge. Why needed: Allows interpretation of features without manual annotation or fine-tuning. Quick check: Test interpretation consistency across different prompts and contexts.

**CLIP Score**: Metric measuring similarity between image and text embeddings in CLIP space. Why needed: Provides quantitative evaluation of feature interpretability by measuring semantic alignment. Quick check: Compare against human judgment for validation.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Image/LMM Input -> SAE Feature Extraction -> Sparse Feature Set -> LMM Zero-shot Interpretation -> Semantic Labels

**Critical Path**: The SAE feature extraction and LMM interpretation stages form the core pipeline. Performance bottlenecks would likely occur in either the SAE's ability to extract meaningful features or the LMM's capacity to accurately interpret them.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational efficiency (running two large models sequentially) for interpretability gains. The zero-shot approach avoids annotation costs but may sacrifice accuracy compared to supervised interpretation methods.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor SAE reconstruction quality would manifest as noisy or incomplete feature extraction. LMM interpretation failures would appear as semantically inconsistent or nonsensical labels. Both issues would degrade overall interpretability scores.

**First Experiments**: 1) Test SAE reconstruction quality on held-out data to validate feature extraction capability. 2) Perform ablation studies removing either the SAE or LMM components to measure their individual contributions. 3) Evaluate interpretation consistency by running multiple interpretations on identical features with different prompts.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies heavily on CLIP scores without establishing practical significance or comparison to established benchmarks
- The 9% hallucination reduction lacks context about baseline performance and statistical significance
- No independent validation that LMM interpretations accurately capture semantic meaning of SAE-discovered features

## Confidence

High: Technical implementation of SAEs for feature extraction follows standard practices
Medium: Overall framework design is sound but multimodal application introduces novel challenges
Low: Quantitative claims lack sufficient validation and context for strong conclusions

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies comparing LMM interpretation against alternative methods (human annotation, other zero-shot models) to establish reliability
2. Perform statistical significance testing on hallucination reduction results with confidence intervals and multiple baseline comparisons
3. Implement cross-modal consistency checks to verify invariant concepts across different input modalities and assess interpretation consistency
