# Investigating Plausibility of Biologically Inspired Bayesian Learning in ANNs

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2411.18788
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18788
- **Reference count**: 34
- **Primary result**: BNNs with learnable activations achieve 96% accuracy on MNIST when allowed to skip uncertain predictions, versus 79% when forced to predict

## Executive Summary
This paper explores the integration of biologically inspired activation mechanisms into Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) to address catastrophic forgetting in continual learning. The authors propose learnable activation functions based on biological neurons' spatial summation properties and compare this approach against Bayesian Inference with Spiking Neural Networks. Experiments on the MNIST dataset demonstrate that BNNs with learnable activations outperform standard BNNs, particularly when models are allowed to refuse uncertain predictions. The study suggests that biologically plausible Bayesian learning frameworks could offer both improved performance and ethical advantages through uncertainty-aware decision-making.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a novel BNN architecture incorporating learnable activation functions inspired by biological neuron behavior, specifically spatial summation properties. These activations are trained alongside network weights to optimize both feature extraction and uncertainty quantification. The model is evaluated in a continual learning setup on MNIST, where tasks are presented sequentially. Two experimental conditions are tested: one where the model must make predictions for all inputs, and another where the model can skip predictions when uncertainty exceeds a threshold. Performance is compared against standard BNNs and a recent approach using Bayesian Inference with Spiking Neural Networks.

## Key Results
- BNNs with learnable activations achieve 96% accuracy on MNIST when allowed to skip uncertain predictions
- Performance drops to 79% when forced to make predictions on all inputs
- BNNs with SNNs show comparable performance improvements over standard BNNs
- The framework demonstrates potential for biological plausibility in Bayesian learning approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The proposed approach leverages biological inspiration by incorporating learnable activation functions that mimic spatial summation in biological neurons. This allows the network to dynamically adjust its response characteristics based on input patterns and accumulated knowledge. In the Bayesian framework, these activations contribute to more accurate uncertainty quantification by modulating how information flows through the network. The spatial summation-inspired mechanism helps the network maintain task-specific representations while preserving uncertainty estimates, which is crucial for mitigating catastrophic forgetting in continual learning scenarios.

## Foundational Learning
- **Bayesian Neural Networks**: Probabilistic models that capture weight uncertainty through distributions rather than point estimates. Needed for principled uncertainty quantification in continual learning. Quick check: verify that posterior distributions are properly maintained across task sequences.
- **Catastrophic Forgetting**: The tendency of neural networks to overwrite previously learned knowledge when trained on new tasks. Critical context for continual learning evaluation. Quick check: measure performance degradation on earlier tasks after training on new ones.
- **Spatial Summation**: Biological neurons integrate inputs from multiple sources before firing. Provides inspiration for learnable activation functions. Quick check: confirm activations exhibit adaptive integration properties.
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Methods for measuring model confidence in predictions. Essential for implementing refusal mechanisms. Quick check: validate uncertainty estimates correlate with actual prediction errors.
- **Continual Learning**: Learning paradigm where tasks are presented sequentially without access to previous data. The primary evaluation framework. Quick check: ensure proper task boundaries and evaluation protocols.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input -> Learnable Activations -> Bayesian Layers -> Output/Uncertainty Estimation

**Critical Path**: The core innovation lies in the learnable activation functions that bridge the input and Bayesian layers. These activations modulate information flow and contribute directly to uncertainty estimation, making them central to both performance and the refusal mechanism.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach balances biological plausibility with computational efficiency. Learnable activations add parameters and complexity compared to standard activations, but enable more nuanced uncertainty representation. The refusal mechanism improves accuracy but reduces coverage, requiring careful threshold tuning for practical applications.

**Failure Signatures**: Potential failure modes include overfitting to specific activation patterns, miscalibration of uncertainty estimates leading to inappropriate refusals, and computational overhead that limits scalability. The simple MNIST dataset may mask issues that would appear with more complex data distributions.

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Compare learnable activations against standard activation functions (ReLU, sigmoid) on MNIST continual learning
2. Evaluate uncertainty calibration by correlating predicted uncertainty with actual error rates
3. Test the impact of activation function capacity (number of parameters) on both performance and refusal rates

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to MNIST dataset, which is relatively simple and may not generalize to complex real-world scenarios
- Only two extreme experimental conditions tested (forced prediction vs. allowing skips) without exploring intermediate confidence thresholds
- Biological plausibility claims remain speculative without neurophysiological validation of the proposed activation mechanisms

## Confidence

**Major Claim Clusters and Confidence:**

1. **BNN performance improvement with learnable activations (High confidence)**: The experimental results are clearly presented with specific accuracy metrics (96% vs 79%), though limited to a single dataset.

2. **Biological plausibility of Bayesian learning framework (Medium confidence)**: While the approach draws inspiration from biological mechanisms, the connection to actual neural processes remains largely theoretical without empirical validation.

3. **Ethical importance of refusal mechanisms (Low confidence)**: The paper mentions this as an important direction but provides minimal analysis of practical implementation or impact assessment.

## Next Checks

1. Replicate experiments on more complex datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST) to assess scalability and robustness across different task complexities.

2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contribution of learnable activations versus other BNN components in achieving the reported performance improvements.

3. Implement and evaluate confidence threshold optimization strategies that balance prediction accuracy with refusal rates, providing a more nuanced view of when and how models should decline predictions.
