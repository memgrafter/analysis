# Agentic LLMs in the Supply Chain: Towards Autonomous Multi-Agent Consensus-Seeking

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.10184
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10184
- Reference count: 25
- Primary result: LLM-powered agents reduce supply chain costs by up to 92.8% and bullwhip effect by up to 66.2% through autonomous consensus-seeking

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes using LLM-powered autonomous agents to automate consensus-seeking in supply chain management, addressing challenges like the bullwhip effect and inefficiencies in manual coordination. The authors introduce novel, supply chain-specific frameworks for LLM agents, enabling communication, negotiation, and tool usage among neighboring agents in a sequential supply chain. Tested on inventory management, the frameworks show significant reductions in global costs (up to 92.8%) and bullwhip effect (up to 66.2%) compared to traditional baselines. The study highlights the potential of LLM agents for scalable, efficient supply chain coordination while emphasizing the need for human oversight due to current limitations in reliability and explainability. The open-source implementation accelerates further research in this domain.

## Method Summary
The study implements LLM-powered decision-making frameworks with increasing sophistication: standalone agents, information sharing, standalone agents with tools, information sharing with tools, and negotiation with tools. Using LangGraph, agents perceive their environment state, store observations in memory, optionally use external tools (demand forecasting via linear regression and EOQ calculations), communicate with neighbors through information sharing or negotiation protocols, make decisions, and execute actions. The experiments use zero-shot prompting with two foundation models (Gemini Flash and Gemini Pro) in a simulated three-echelon sequential supply chain with two-step lead time, comparing performance against traditional baselines (S,s policy and tool-based agents) on global costs and bullwhip effect metrics.

## Key Results
- LLM frameworks achieve 92.8% reduction in global costs compared to traditional baselines
- Bullwhip effect reduced by up to 66.2% with sophisticated consensus-seeking frameworks
- Information sharing and negotiation protocols enable agents to reach consensus with bullwhip effect metric below 1
- Tool usage combined with LLM reasoning provides optimal performance for specific metrics like cost minimization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLM-powered agents reduce consensus-seeking costs by 92.8% through sophisticated communication frameworks.
- Mechanism: Agents use information sharing and negotiation protocols to agree on order quantities, reducing demand amplification upstream in the supply chain. This coordinated decision-making minimizes the bullwhip effect and global costs.
- Core assumption: LLM agents can effectively negotiate and reach consensus when provided with sufficient context about neighboring agents' states and tool outputs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Tested on inventory management, the frameworks show significant reductions in global costs (up to 92.8%) and bullwhip effect (up to 66.2%) compared to traditional baselines."
  - [section]: "Introducing more sophisticated consensus-seeking frameworks (information sharing, information sharing with tool, and negotiation) yields a bullwhip effect metric below 1 for both foundation models."
  - [corpus]: Weak - The corpus contains related work on LLM-powered multi-agent systems but lacks specific evidence of cost reductions in supply chain contexts.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Tool usage combined with LLM agents improves performance for specific metrics like cost minimization.
- Mechanism: Agents use external tools (e.g., demand forecasting with linear regression, EOQ calculations) to generate optimal order quantities. The LLM then incorporates this tool output into its decision-making process through prompt engineering.
- Core assumption: The tool outputs are reliable and the LLM can be effectively guided to prioritize them through prompt engineering.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We introduce a series of novel, supply chain-specific consensus-seeking frameworks tailored for LLM agents and validate the effectiveness of our approach through a case study in inventory management."
  - [section]: "The experiments relative to the cost minimization objective illustrate that, when a tool is highly suited for a given metric, such as our linear regression tool to predict future demand and minimize costs, the highest performance is achieved by those frameworks that give strong weight to the tool itself."
  - [corpus]: Weak - The corpus contains general information about LLM tool usage but lacks specific evidence of tool effectiveness in supply chain cost minimization.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: LLM agents can achieve near-human-level consensus at scale with minimal entry barriers.
- Mechanism: Pre-trained LLMs possess negotiation, reasoning, and planning skills from training on vast datasets. They can be accessed via APIs and instructed through natural language interfaces, reducing implementation complexity.
- Core assumption: The pre-trained LLM skills are transferable to supply chain consensus-seeking tasks and the natural language interface is sufficient for effective agent orchestration.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "LLMs, trained on vast datasets can negotiate, reason, and plan, facilitating near-human-level consensus at scale with minimal entry barriers."
  - [section]: "Unlike previous generations of agents that required rigorously defined inputs and outputs, LLM-powered agents are capable of learning from vast amounts of unstructured data, enabling them to adapt to complex environments in real-time."
  - [corpus]: Weak - The corpus contains related work on LLM capabilities but lacks specific evidence of their effectiveness in supply chain consensus-seeking.

## Foundational Learning

  - Quick check question: What is the bullwhip effect and how does it impact supply chain performance?

- Concept: Multi-agent systems and consensus-seeking
  - Why needed here: The proposed solution involves LLM-powered autonomous agents that need to coordinate and reach consensus on operational decisions. Understanding multi-agent systems and consensus-seeking mechanisms is essential for comprehending the framework design.

  - Quick check question: What are the key capabilities of LLMs that make them suitable for autonomous decision-making in complex environments?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Environment (simulated sequential supply chain) -> Agents (LLM-powered with perception, memory, communication, execution) -> Tools (demand forecasting, EOQ calculation) -> Frameworks (standalone, information sharing, negotiation) -> Metrics (global costs, bullwhip effect)

- Critical path:
  1. Environment perception: Agent perceives its state (inventory, backlog, orders, demand)
  2. Memory storage: Agent stores its state and retrieves previous observations
  3. Tool invocation (optional): Agent uses tools to generate optimal order quantities
  4. Communication (optional): Agent shares information with neighbors and negotiates order quantities
  5. Decision-making: Agent makes final order quantity decision based on its observations, tool output, and communication results
  6. Execution: Agent executes its decision and updates the environment

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Framework complexity vs. performance: More sophisticated frameworks (e.g., negotiation) generally yield better results but are more complex to implement and may require more computational resources.
  - Tool usage vs. LLM reasoning: Tools can provide optimal solutions for specific metrics but may limit the LLM's ability to reason and adapt to complex scenarios.
  - Communication frequency vs. efficiency: More frequent communication can improve coordination but may increase computational overhead and latency.

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance: If the global costs or bullwhip effect are not reduced compared to baselines, it may indicate issues with the agent's decision-making process or the effectiveness of the communication framework.
  - Communication breakdown: If agents fail to reach consensus or if the negotiation protocol does not converge, it may indicate issues with the communication framework or the LLM's ability to negotiate effectively.
  - Tool unreliability: If the tool outputs are inconsistent or not properly incorporated into the LLM's decisions, it may indicate issues with the tool implementation or the prompt engineering.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Standalone LLM agents without tools: Evaluate the baseline performance of LLM agents making decisions based solely on their observations and reasoning.
  2. LLM agents with information sharing: Introduce the information sharing framework to assess the impact of neighbor communication on performance.
  3. LLM agents with negotiation and tools: Implement the full framework with negotiation and tool usage to evaluate the combined effect on performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of LLM-powered agents vary with different supply chain structures beyond the sequential three-echelon model tested?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the implementation can be extended to a supply chain network with multiple parallel layers of echelons.
- Why unresolved: The study only tested the LLM frameworks in a simple sequential supply chain with three agents. Real-world supply chains often have more complex network structures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing the frameworks in supply chain networks with varying numbers of agents, echelons, and network topologies, comparing performance to the sequential model.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of long-term conversation memory on the performance of LLM-powered agents in supply chain consensus-seeking?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that agents' conversation memory is limited to the current step in the simulation, while observation memory relates to the previous ten steps.
- Why unresolved: The study did not explore the potential benefits of allowing agents to retain and use information from past interactions across multiple simulation steps.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the performance of agents with short-term conversation memory (as in the current implementation) to those with long-term conversation memory, measuring metrics like global costs and bullwhip effect.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the reliability and explainability of LLM-powered agents be improved for real-world supply chain applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the current limitations of LLM agents, noting that neither model size nor tool reliability guarantee high performance, and that decisions still require a human-in-the-loop approach.
- Why unresolved: The study acknowledges these limitations but does not propose specific solutions to address them.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of techniques such as self-reflection, chain-of-thought reasoning, or algorithmic prompt optimization to improve the reliability and explainability of LLM agent outputs in supply chain contexts.

## Limitations
- Performance heavily depends on prompt engineering quality, with limited details provided on exact templates
- Scalability claims remain theoretical without empirical validation in supply chains with more than three agents
- Current implementation requires human oversight due to reliability and explainability limitations

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The fundamental observation that LLM agents can reduce bullwhip effect and costs through coordinated decision-making
- Medium Confidence: The specific performance improvements (92.8% cost reduction, 66.2% bullwhip reduction) based on controlled experiments
- Low Confidence: Claims about scalability and real-world deployment readiness without empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation Study on Prompt Engineering**: Systematically vary prompt templates across different foundation models and metrics to isolate the contribution of framework design versus prompt optimization to performance gains.

2. **Stress Testing Tool Reliability**: Introduce controlled noise and failures in tool outputs to evaluate how LLM agents respond when tools become unreliable, and whether they can maintain performance through reasoning alone.

3. **Scaling Experiment with 10+ Agents**: Extend the supply chain simulation to 10+ echelons to empirically validate claims about scalability, measuring communication overhead and performance degradation as agent count increases.
