# Hermes: A Large Language Model Framework on the Journey to Autonomous Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.06490
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06490
- Authors: Fadhel Ayed; Ali Maatouk; Nicola Piovesan; Antonio De Domenico; Merouane Debbah; Zhi-Quan Luo
- Reference count: 18
- Key outcome: Introduces chain-of-agents LLM framework achieving up to 82.5% success rate in complex network modeling tasks

## Executive Summary
Hermes presents a novel chain-of-agents LLM framework designed to advance autonomous network operations in cellular networks. The framework addresses the challenge of creating reliable, accurate network models by using structured "blueprints" that decompose complex tasks into logical steps, combining high-level reasoning with executable code. By separating modeling tasks into Designer and Coder roles with iterative refinement and feedback mechanisms, Hermes significantly outperforms baseline approaches like chain-of-thought prompting and direct code generation. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse network modeling scenarios, representing meaningful progress toward fully autonomous network operations.

## Method Summary
Hermes employs a three-phase process: design phase (initial reflections, validation, fine-grained generation, blueprint creation), coding phase (initial code, tracebacks debugging), and feedback phase (sanity checks). The framework uses Designer agents to create blueprints (YAML files with logical steps) and Coder agents to translate these into Python code. A dedicated code interpreter handles computations while LLMs focus on reasoning and planning. The approach leverages multi-scale refinement from coarse-grained to fine-grained generation, with validation agents and code execution testing to mitigate hallucinations and ensure blueprint accuracy. The framework was tested on four autonomous network tasks using both GPT-4o and Llama-3.1 models.

## Key Results
- Achieved 82.5% success rate on complex network modeling tasks using GPT-4o
- Outperformed chain-of-thought prompting and direct code generation baselines
- Demonstrated significant performance improvements (up to 60% increase) when using expert-designed model repositories with open-source LLMs
- Successfully handled power control, energy saving, SINR-energy tradeoff, and new BS deployment scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Hermes improves LLM performance by decomposing complex tasks into structured "blueprints" combining high-level reasoning with executable code
- Mechanism: Chain-of-agents approach where Designer agents create blueprints and Coder agents translate these into Python code, allowing LLMs to focus on reasoning while code interpreter handles computations
- Core assumption: LLMs perform better when focused on planning and reasoning rather than direct computation
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "uses 'blueprints' for constructing NDT instances through structured and explainable logical steps"; [section II-B] "LLMs should focus on reasoning and code generation, while a dedicated code interpreter handles all computations"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-scale refinement addresses LLM planning limitations by providing both high-level strategy and detailed implementation
- Mechanism: Coarse-grained generators for high-level reflections, evaluators for validation and refinement, then fine-grained generators for comprehensive strategies with mathematical formulas and pseudo-code
- Core assumption: Breaking planning into multiple abstraction levels prevents LLMs from losing task context while managing details
- Evidence anchors: [section III-A] "Hermes utilizes a multi-scale approach inspired by LLM-based coding agents, beginning with a coarse-grained strategy to capture high-level aspects"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Feedback loops with validation agents and code execution testing mitigate hallucinations and ensure blueprint accuracy
- Mechanism: Validation agents use Foresee and Reflect framework to anticipate issues, then code execution on test data provides quantitative feedback for iterative refinement
- Core assumption: LLMs cannot reliably self-correct hallucinations without external validation mechanisms
- Evidence anchors: [section II-B] "LLMs may generate plausible-sounding but inaccurate or entirely fabricated information, commonly referred to as hallucinations"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Chain-of-thought prompting
  - Why needed here: Provides baseline for comparing Hermes performance and understanding LLM reasoning capabilities
  - Quick check question: What is the success rate of chain-of-thought prompting on the power control task without Hermes enhancements?

- Concept: Network Digital Twin (NDT) architecture
  - Why needed here: Core concept being modeled by Hermes framework; understanding NDT limitations motivates the approach
  - Quick check question: What are the main limitations of current NDT implementations that Hermes aims to address?

- Concept: Telecommunications network parameters and KPIs
  - Why needed here: Essential for understanding the modeling tasks Hermes performs (SINR, RSRP, energy consumption, etc.)
  - Quick check question: What are the key network parameters that affect SINR in cellular networks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Designer phase: coarse-grained generators → evaluators → fine-grained generators → blueprint editor → blueprint refiner; Coding phase: code generator → code refiner → code interpreter (with debugger); Feedback phase: functional block validation → blueprint refinement; External components: data repository, model repository, Python interpreter

- Critical path: Designer creates blueprint → Coder generates and refines code → Code interpreter executes with test data → Designer refines blueprint based on feedback → Final evaluation

- Design tradeoffs: Multiple agents vs single agent (trades computational overhead for improved reliability); Open-source vs proprietary LLMs (higher performance with GPT-4o but potential with open-source when augmented with expert-designed blocks); Blueprint complexity vs execution speed (more detailed blueprints improve accuracy but increase processing time)

- Failure signatures: Blueprint creation failures (vague or incorrect logical steps, missing dependencies, unit handling errors); Code generation failures (syntax errors, incorrect variable handling, missing imports); Execution failures (tracebacks, incorrect numerical results, performance degradation)

- First 3 experiments: 1) Run power control task with Hermes using GPT-4o and verify 82.5% success rate on simple network configuration; 2) Test blueprint refinement process by introducing deliberate errors in initial blueprint and observing correction through feedback loop; 3) Compare performance of Hermes with and without expert-designed model repository using Llama-3.1-70b on power control task

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can Hermes be extended to handle multi-modal data (e.g., real-time network measurements, wireless signals) more effectively, beyond its current reliance on structured blueprints?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that creating large multi-modal models is challenging due to data availability and integration complexity, and that Hermes currently relies on blueprints rather than direct measurement interpretation
- Why unresolved: Multi-modal data integration is critical for real-world deployment, but the paper focuses on blueprint-based modeling rather than direct handling of diverse data types
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments demonstrating Hermes's performance with integrated multi-modal inputs (e.g., live network data streams) compared to blueprint-only approaches

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal size and composition of the expert-designed model repository to maximize Hermes's performance across diverse network scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows that performance improves with more expert-designed models in the repository, but does not determine the optimal size or diversity of models needed
- Why unresolved: The relationship between repository size/composition and performance is unclear, and different network scenarios may require different types of models
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying repository size and model types across different network use cases to identify performance trade-offs

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can Hermes's prompt engineering be optimized for open-source LLMs to achieve performance comparable to GPT-4o?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper attributes poor open-source LLM performance to GPT-4o-tailored prompts and suggests prompt adaptation could improve results
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates the gap but does not explore prompt engineering strategies for alternative models
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies testing different prompt formulations across multiple open-source models to identify optimal configurations

## Limitations

- Generalization Beyond Test Tasks: Evaluation focuses on four specific network modeling tasks using synthetic datasets; performance on real-world, production network data with diverse topologies remains unverified
- LLM Dependency and Cost: Success rates heavily depend on GPT-4o performance; practical deployment feasibility questionable given computational overhead and API costs
- Missing Failure Analysis: Success rates reported but nature and frequency of failures not thoroughly characterized; behavior on novel scenarios outside training distribution unclear

## Confidence

**High Confidence** (supported by direct experimental evidence):
- Hermes framework architecture and multi-agent approach are correctly implemented
- Chain-of-thought prompting performs worse than Hermes on tested tasks
- Direct code generation without intermediate reasoning steps underperforms Hermes

**Medium Confidence** (supported by evidence but with limitations):
- Multi-scale refinement approach improves planning quality
- Feedback mechanisms effectively reduce hallucinations and errors
- Expert-designed model repositories significantly improve open-source LLM performance

**Low Confidence** (largely unsupported by evidence):
- Hermes represents meaningful progress toward fully autonomous network operations
- Framework will generalize to diverse real-world network scenarios
- Computational overhead is justified by reliability improvements

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-task generalization test**: Evaluate Hermes on at least 10 additional network modeling tasks not included in original study, using both synthetic and real network datasets, to assess robustness and transfer learning capabilities

2. **Cost-benefit analysis**: Measure end-to-end latency and operational costs of Hermes compared to traditional network modeling approaches, including computational overhead, LLM API costs, and human oversight requirements for production deployment

3. **Failure mode characterization**: Systematically induce failures (data inconsistencies, novel scenarios, adversarial inputs) and document framework's recovery mechanisms, error propagation patterns, and whether feedback loops can handle complex error chains without human intervention
