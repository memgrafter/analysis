# Tera-SpaceCom: GNN-based Deep Reinforcement Learning for Joint Resource Allocation and Task Offloading in TeraHertz Band Space Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.07911
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07911
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: GNN-DRL algorithm achieves highest resource efficiency with 105ms latency in LEO mega-constellation

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenging problem of joint communication resource allocation and computing task offloading in TeraHertz Band Space Networks for Satellite Edge Computing. The authors propose GRANT, a GNN-DRL algorithm that leverages graph neural networks to capture satellite connectivity patterns and employs multi-agent mechanisms for collaborative learning. The approach solves an NP-hard MINLP problem by maximizing long-term resource efficiency while adhering to physical constraints and latency requirements in a 1584-satellite LEO mega-constellation.

## Method Summary
The GRANT algorithm formulates joint task offloading and resource allocation as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. It employs Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn relationships among satellites from connectivity information, using multi-agent and multi-task mechanisms for collaborative training. The method uses on-policy training with a centralized critic that evaluates joint actions from all involved satellites, while maintaining decentralized actors for individual satellite decision-making. Safe initialization and exploration mechanisms prevent catastrophic latency during training by incorporating large penalty weights for latency violations.

## Key Results
- GRANT achieves highest resource efficiency with 105ms latency, outperforming benchmarks by 20% better latency or 83% less resource usage
- THz communications realize significantly lower latency compared to Ka and Ku bands
- GRANT demonstrates superior memory efficiency with lowest trainable parameters and running time among evaluated algorithms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GRANT's use of GNNs captures satellite connectivity structure, enabling efficient feature aggregation without exploding parameter counts in a large LEO constellation
- Mechanism: GCN layers in the actor and critic process adjacency matrices representing ISL links, aggregating features from neighboring satellites using shared weights, which keeps parameter size constant regardless of satellite count
- Core assumption: Satellite connectivity is stable over the training window
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "GNNs learn relationships among different satellites from their connectivity information"; [section IV-E] "In the LEO mega-constellation, Ai,j = 1 only when satellites i and j are adjacent hops in any route for task offloading or outcome transmission... the size of all trainable parameters of GCN remains constant regardless of the number of nodes in a graph"
- Break condition: If topology changes rapidly or links become unstable, the GCN's assumption of consistent adjacency fails, degrading performance

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-agent architecture allows decentralized decision-making per satellite while maintaining coordinated learning via a centralized critic
- Mechanism: Each involved satellite has an actor generating continuous power/subarray/task ratios; the centralized critic evaluates all actions jointly using shared Q-values, enabling coordinated optimization without requiring global state access by all agents
- Core assumption: Actions of satellites not directly involved in computation or transmission do not affect the joint objective significantly
- Evidence anchors: [section IV-B] "since the GRANT critic provides Q values on the basis of states and actions, the useless input states and actions are also omitted... only the actions of the involved satellites can be input into GRANT critic"; [section IV-E] "the GRANT leverages the safe initialization and safe exploration mechanisms... to explore actions beyond the local optimum..."
- Break condition: If inter-satellite interference or cross-dependency increases, excluding uninvolved satellites from the joint Q-value computation may ignore critical constraints

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Reward design with latency penalty avoids catastrophic latency spikes during on-policy training
- Mechanism: Reward includes a large fixed penalty weight for latency exceeding a threshold, ensuring the agent prioritizes avoiding high latency over marginal RE gains during exploration
- Core assumption: High latency during training is unacceptable and must be preemptively penalized rather than learned through trial-and-error
- Evidence anchors: [section III-C] "χ2 denotes the weight of the penalty pertaining to latency... instead of utilizing constrained DRL solutions, χ2 is set as a large value during the entire training process, to encourage DRL training to alleviate the large latency on the fly"; [section IV-E] "Since GRANT learns on the fly with on-policy training, the bad offloading or allocation actions that cause very large latency might result in a catastrophe... GRANT leverages the safe initialization and safe exploration..."
- Break condition: If the latency threshold is poorly tuned, the agent may become overly conservative, sacrificing RE to avoid any latency risk

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)
  - Why needed here: LEO constellation connectivity is naturally represented as a graph; GNNs enable efficient learning over this structure without requiring pairwise processing of all satellites
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why GCNs can process large graphs without exploding parameter counts?

- Concept: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)
  - Why needed here: The joint task offloading and resource allocation problem is non-convex and NP-hard; DRL can approximate solutions online, while MARL enables decentralized action selection with coordinated learning
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes centralized critics from decentralized critics in MARL, and why is a centralized critic used in GRANT?

- Concept: Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP)
  - Why needed here: The problem combines discrete decisions (task assignment, subarray counts) with continuous variables (transmit power), making it computationally intractable for exact solutions at scale
  - Quick check question: Why does discretizing actions in GNN-based AC and DQN introduce trade-offs in solution quality and training efficiency?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: State preprocessing -> GCN layers -> Multi-task heads (task offloading, power, subarray) -> Centralized critic evaluation -> Action execution
- Critical path: 1) Collect observed states from LEO satellites 2) Preprocess and filter states/actions to only involved satellites 3) Pass through GCN-based actor to generate continuous actions 4) Apply action noise for exploration (if training) 5) Send actions to satellites and execute 6) Collect reward (resource usage + latency penalty) 7) Update actor and critic via backpropagation
- Design tradeoffs: Parameter efficiency vs. expressiveness; On-policy vs. off-policy training; Centralized critic vs. decentralized critics
- Failure signatures: High latency despite low resource usage → latency penalty weight too low; Slow convergence → GCN layers not capturing connectivity or insufficient training steps; Unstable training → action noise too high or initialization not safe; Poor RE performance → GCN oversmoothing or insufficient feature extraction
- First 3 experiments: 1) Sanity check: Run GRANT with a small 9-satellite Walker constellation, verify that GCN parameter count stays constant while performance matches or exceeds baseline 2) Latency sensitivity: Sweep χ2 (latency penalty weight) and observe trade-off between RE and latency 3) Connectivity robustness: Gradually remove edges from the adjacency graph and measure impact on RE and convergence speed

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
No explicit open questions are called out in the paper.

## Limitations
- GNN architecture specifics (layer depth, hidden dimensions) are not fully specified
- Safe exploration/initialization mechanisms lack detailed parameter settings
- Generalization to different LEO constellation configurations (non-Walker, different altitudes) is not validated

## Confidence
- High: GRANT achieves higher resource efficiency than benchmarks with acceptable latency
- Medium: GNN-based approach enables parameter-efficient learning in large constellations
- Low: Safe exploration mechanisms are essential for avoiding catastrophic latency during training (limited empirical validation)

## Next Checks
1. Implement GRANT with multiple GNN architectures (varying depth and width) to identify optimal configuration for the LEO constellation problem
2. Test GRANT's performance under dynamic topology changes (simulating link failures or rapid GS handovers) to validate robustness claims
3. Conduct ablation studies removing the GNN component to quantify its contribution to parameter efficiency and performance gains
