# Modular Adaptation of Multilingual Encoders to Written Swiss German Dialect

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2401.14400
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14400
- **Reference count**: 9
- **Key outcome**: Modular adaptation achieves 97.5% of monolithic adaptation performance while updating only a fraction of parameters for Swiss German dialect processing

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of creating neural text encoders for written Swiss German, a dialect with limited training data and significant variation. The authors adapt pre-trained multilingual encoders to Swiss German using continued pre-training on a modest dataset. They evaluate three approaches: monolithic adaptation (updating all parameters), modular adaptation (using language adapters), and a character-level adapter. Results show that modular adaptation achieves 97.5% of the performance of monolithic adaptation while updating only a fraction of parameters. The character-level CANINE model excels at cross-lingual sentence retrieval tasks, while subword-based models perform better for part-of-speech tagging. The authors conclude that adding a Swiss German adapter to SwissBERT is a competitive alternative to full monolithic adaptation, offering significant parameter efficiency.

## Method Summary
The authors investigate three adaptation strategies for multilingual encoders to Swiss German: monolithic adaptation (updating all parameters during continued pre-training), modular adaptation using language adapters, and a character-level adapter. They train adapters of varying sizes (4-32k parameters) and evaluate on two downstream tasks: part-of-speech tagging and cross-lingual sentence retrieval. The modular approach uses adapter modules that can be plugged into pre-trained models without updating the original parameters. They also compare subword-based models with a character-level CANINE model to understand how different tokenization strategies affect dialect processing performance.

## Key Results
- Modular adaptation achieves 97.5% of monolithic adaptation performance while updating only a fraction of parameters
- Character-level CANINE models excel at cross-lingual sentence retrieval tasks
- Subword-based models perform better for part-of-speech tagging compared to character-level approaches
- Adding Swiss German adapters to SwissBERT provides a competitive alternative to full monolithic adaptation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper demonstrates that modular adaptation works by isolating dialect-specific features in adapter modules rather than modifying the entire pre-trained encoder. This approach leverages the existing multilingual knowledge in pre-trained models while efficiently capturing Swiss German-specific patterns. The character-level adapter particularly benefits from processing the language's high orthographic variation without being constrained by subword tokenization boundaries.

## Foundational Learning

### Parameter-efficient fine-tuning
**Why needed**: Traditional fine-tuning updates all model parameters, which is computationally expensive and risks catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained knowledge
**Quick check**: Compare adapter performance against full fine-tuning on downstream tasks

### Adapter modules
**Why needed**: Small neural modules that can be inserted into pre-trained models to capture task or language-specific features without modifying original parameters
**Quick check**: Measure adapter size versus performance tradeoff across different adapter configurations

### Cross-lingual sentence retrieval
**Why needed**: Evaluates whether models can match semantically equivalent sentences across languages, testing multilingual representations
**Quick check**: Compute retrieval accuracy between Swiss German and Standard German sentence pairs

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Pre-trained model <- Adapter modules -> Downstream task heads
**Critical path**: Pre-training data → Continued pre-training (monolithic/modular) → Adapter integration → Task-specific fine-tuning → Evaluation
**Design tradeoffs**: 
- Monolithic: Updates all parameters, higher computational cost, better performance
- Modular: Updates fraction of parameters, lower computational cost, slightly reduced performance
- Character-level vs subword: Tradeoff between handling orthographic variation and leveraging pre-trained subword knowledge

**Failure signatures**: 
- Adapter collapse when adapter size too small
- Performance degradation when adapter training data insufficient
- Suboptimal cross-lingual retrieval when character-level processing fails to capture semantic boundaries

**First experiments**:
1. Baseline monolithic adaptation on POS tagging task
2. Modular adaptation with small adapter (4k parameters) on same task
3. Character-level CANINE adaptation on cross-lingual retrieval task

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses on a single Swiss German dialect family, limiting generalizability to other dialects
- Results based on relatively small-scale datasets, constraining conclusions about larger-scale performance
- Character-level adapter success on retrieval doesn't necessarily translate to other downstream tasks
- Fixed adapter sizes used without exploring the full parameter-efficiency tradeoff space

## Confidence
- **High**: Modular adaptation achieves comparable performance to monolithic adaptation with significantly fewer updated parameters
- **High**: Character-level CANINE models show particular strength in cross-lingual sentence retrieval tasks
- **Medium**: Subword-based models perform better for part-of-speech tagging compared to character-level approaches
- **Medium**: Adding Swiss German adapters to SwissBERT represents a competitive alternative to full monolithic adaptation

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the modular adaptation approach across multiple Swiss German dialects and other low-resource language pairs to test generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies varying adapter sizes and architectures to optimize the parameter-efficiency tradeoff
3. Test the character-level adapter's effectiveness on additional downstream tasks beyond cross-lingual retrieval, including sequence labeling and generation tasks
