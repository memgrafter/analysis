# Are you sure? Analysing Uncertainty Quantification Approaches for Real-world Speech Emotion Recognition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.01143
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01143
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Entropy-based UQ provides useful uncertainty estimates for detecting faulty predictions in SER; Prior Networks significantly improve OOD detection when trained with OOD data.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for speech emotion recognition (SER) under realistic challenges such as corrupted signals, out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and missing speech. The authors evaluate four UQ approaches—entropy, Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, evidential deep learning (EDL), and prior networks (PNs)—on three SER datasets using a wav2vec2.0 model. They find that entropy-based UQ can already provide useful uncertainty estimates for detecting faulty predictions. Prior networks, especially when trained with additional OOD data, significantly improve the ability to distinguish between in-domain and OOD samples, offering the most reliable uncertainty estimates under noise and corrupted signals. These results suggest that incorporating UQ into SER models can help prevent incorrect predictions in real-world applications.

## Method Summary
The study uses a wav2vec2.0 pre-trained model followed by a classification head to perform emotion recognition. Four UQ methods (entropy, MC dropout, EDL, and PNs) are evaluated on three datasets (CREMA-D, MSP-Podcast, EmoDB) focusing on four basic emotions. The models are trained with a learning rate of 1e-4 without hyperparameter tuning. Performance is assessed using four tests: rater agreement, unknown emotions, non-speech data, and corrupted signals, with metrics including Unweighted Average Recall (UAR), accuracy, and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC).

## Key Results
- Entropy-based UQ provides useful uncertainty estimates for detecting faulty predictions in SER
- Prior Networks significantly improve OOD detection when trained with additional OOD data
- Training with additional OOD data greatly improves the identification of uncertain signals

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Prior Networks (PNs) trained with OOD data significantly improve the ability to distinguish between in-domain and out-of-domain samples.
- Mechanism: PNs model the uncertainty distribution using a Dirichlet distribution with sharp distributions for in-domain classes and flat distributions for OOD data. This allows the network to explicitly learn the difference between data uncertainty and OOD uncertainty through the precision of the distribution.
- Core assumption: The OOD data used during training is sufficiently diverse and representative of the types of OOD samples the model will encounter in real-world applications.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Prior networks, especially when trained with additional OOD data, significantly improve the ability to distinguish between in-domain and OOD samples, offering the most reliable uncertainty estimates under noise and corrupted signals."
  - [section] "For PNs it is possible to differentiate between data uncertainty and OOD data by calculating the precision (sharpness) of the distribution."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus contains related papers but no direct evidence about PN performance with OOD data.
- Break condition: If the OOD data used for training is not representative of real-world OOD samples, the PN may fail to generalize and correctly identify OOD samples.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Entropy-based UQ can already provide useful uncertainty estimates for detecting faulty predictions in SER.
- Mechanism: Entropy measures the uncertainty of a model's prediction by calculating the entropy over logits. Higher entropy indicates higher uncertainty, which can be used to identify potentially incorrect predictions.
- Core assumption: The entropy of a model's output is correlated with the likelihood of a faulty prediction, even without explicit UQ training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "entropy-based UQ can already provide useful uncertainty estimates for detecting faulty predictions"
  - [section] "One of the easiest ways to get insights about the uncertainty of a categorical task is to calculate the entropy [15] over logits."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus contains related papers but no direct evidence about entropy-based UQ performance in SER.
- Break condition: If the model's entropy is not well-calibrated with the actual uncertainty of its predictions, entropy-based UQ may not be reliable for detecting faulty predictions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Training with additional OOD data can greatly improve the identification of uncertain signals in SER.
- Mechanism: By exposing the model to OOD data during training, it learns to recognize patterns that are different from the in-domain data. This allows the model to better distinguish between in-domain and OOD samples, leading to more reliable uncertainty estimates.
- Core assumption: The OOD data used for training is diverse enough to cover the range of OOD samples the model will encounter in real-world applications.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "training with additional OOD data can greatly improve the identification of such signals."
  - [section] "By specifying a flat distribution (Figure 1 c)) it is possible to train on OOD data without the need for an additional OOD class."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus contains related papers but no direct evidence about the impact of OOD training data on SER uncertainty quantification.
- Break condition: If the OOD data used for training is not representative of real-world OOD samples, the model may not learn to correctly identify OOD samples, leading to unreliable uncertainty estimates.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) methods
  - Why needed here: To evaluate and compare different UQ methods for SER under realistic challenges such as corrupted signals, OOD data, and missing speech.
  - Quick check question: What are the main categories of UQ methods and how do they differ in terms of computational cost and reliability?

- Concept: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data
  - Why needed here: To test the model's ability to handle samples that are not from the same distribution as the training data, which is a common challenge in real-world SER applications.
  - Quick check question: How can OOD data be simulated and what are the potential sources of OOD data in SER?

- Concept: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) challenges
  - Why needed here: To understand the specific challenges faced by SER models, such as label ambiguity, poor recording conditions, and background noise, which can impact the reliability of UQ methods.
  - Quick check question: What are the main sources of uncertainty in SER and how do they affect the model's performance and reliability?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Speech signal -> wav2vec2.0 model -> Classification head -> UQ method (entropy, MC dropout, EDL, or PNs) -> Uncertainty estimate
- Critical path: Extract features from speech signal using wav2vec2.0 model → Pass features to classification head for emotion prediction → Apply UQ method to output for uncertainty estimation
- Design tradeoffs: The choice of UQ method involves a tradeoff between computational cost and reliability. Simple methods like entropy-based UQ have low computational cost but may not be as reliable as more complex methods like PNs. PNs, on the other hand, have higher computational cost but can provide more reliable uncertainty estimates, especially when trained with OOD data.
- Failure signatures: Common failure modes include: 1) Overconfidence in predictions, where the model assigns high confidence to incorrect predictions, 2) Underconfidence in predictions, where the model assigns low confidence to correct predictions, 3) Inability to distinguish between in-domain and OOD samples, leading to unreliable uncertainty estimates.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the performance of entropy-based UQ on the SER datasets and compare it to the other UQ methods.
  2. Train a PN with OOD data and evaluate its ability to distinguish between in-domain and OOD samples.
  3. Test the model's performance under different levels of noise and corrupted signals to assess the reliability of the UQ methods in realistic scenarios.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How does the reliability of entropy-based uncertainty quantification compare to more sophisticated methods like Prior Networks when dealing with out-of-domain data that shares acoustic characteristics with in-domain data (e.g., background noise in speech recordings)?
- To what extent does the correlation between model uncertainty and rater agreement in speech emotion recognition reflect the true ambiguity of emotions, versus being influenced by the limited number of emotion categories used in the model?
- How can uncertainty quantification methods be effectively integrated into real-time speech emotion recognition systems to improve reliability without significantly increasing computational overhead?

## Limitations
- Limited dataset diversity may affect generalizability of results to other SER domains
- Performance differences between EDL and MC Dropout were not statistically significant across all test conditions
- Lack of hyperparameter tuning may limit the observed performance ceiling of each method

## Confidence
- High confidence in the observation that entropy-based UQ provides baseline utility for fault detection, as this aligns with established uncertainty literature
- Medium confidence in the core findings due to the controlled experimental setup but limited dataset diversity
- Low confidence in the relative ranking of EDL vs MC Dropout, as their performance differences were not statistically significant across all test conditions

## Next Checks
1. Test the same UQ methods on a larger, more diverse SER dataset (e.g., IEMOCAP) to assess generalizability.
2. Conduct ablation studies with varying amounts of OOD data to quantify the minimum OOD training requirement for Prior Networks.
3. Measure the real-time inference latency of each UQ method to evaluate production feasibility.
