# HARIVO: Harnessing Text-to-Image Models for Video Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.07763
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07763
- Reference count: 0
- Method: Freezes pretrained text-to-image model and trains only temporal components for video generation

## Executive Summary
HARIVO presents a novel approach to text-to-video generation by leveraging pretrained text-to-image models, specifically StableDiffusion, while freezing the image model and training only the temporal components. This method avoids the complexity and data requirements of training full video generation models from scratch. The system achieves high-quality, temporally consistent video generation with improved motion dynamics and semantic coherence, even when trained on limited public video data. It also seamlessly integrates with personalized T2I models like DreamBooth and ControlNet.

## Method Summary
The HARIVO method introduces several architectural and loss function improvements for video generation. It employs a mapping network to adjust noise distribution specifically for video generation, frame-wise tokens to capture subtle temporal variations between frames, and temporal regularized self-attention loss to ensure smoothness across frames. A decoupled contrastive loss on bottleneck features promotes semantic consistency, while gradient sampling mitigation improves inference quality. The approach trains only the temporal components while keeping the pretrained image model frozen, allowing efficient adaptation to video generation without the need for extensive video datasets.

## Key Results
- Achieves significant improvements in Fréchet Video Distance (FVD) compared to baseline methods
- Demonstrates superior motion quality and temporal consistency in generated videos
- Seamlessly integrates with personalized models like DreamBooth and ControlNet for customized video generation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
HARIVO works by leveraging the rich visual representations learned by pretrained text-to-image models while adding specialized temporal components that enable coherent video generation. By freezing the image model, the approach preserves the high-quality image generation capabilities while focusing training resources on learning temporal dynamics. The frame-wise token mechanism captures subtle variations between consecutive frames, creating natural motion progression. The temporal regularization losses ensure smooth transitions, while the contrastive loss maintains semantic consistency across the video sequence. This approach effectively transfers knowledge from the image domain to video generation with minimal additional training.

## Foundational Learning
- **Stable Diffusion architecture**: Why needed - Forms the foundation for image generation capabilities; Quick check - Verify understanding of U-Net, VAE, and text encoder components
- **Temporal consistency in video**: Why needed - Ensures smooth motion and coherent scene progression; Quick check - Review frame interpolation and motion prediction techniques
- **Contrastive learning**: Why needed - Maintains semantic consistency across video frames; Quick check - Understand how contrastive losses work in feature space
- **Mapping networks**: Why needed - Adapts noise distribution for video-specific generation; Quick check - Study how mapping networks transform latent distributions
- **Frame-wise tokens**: Why needed - Captures subtle temporal variations between frames; Quick check - Examine how token-based approaches handle sequential data
- **Self-attention mechanisms**: Why needed - Enables long-range dependencies in video generation; Quick check - Review attention patterns in video versus image models

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Text prompt -> Text encoder -> Frozen Stable Diffusion -> Mapping network -> Frame-wise tokens -> Temporal regularization -> Generated video frames
- **Critical path**: Text encoding → Image generation backbone (frozen) → Temporal components (trained) → Video output
- **Design tradeoffs**: Freezing image model preserves quality but limits architectural innovations; training only temporal components reduces data requirements but may miss video-specific optimizations
- **Failure signatures**: Temporal inconsistency in longer sequences, motion artifacts at frame transitions, semantic drift in complex scenes
- **3 first experiments**: 1) Generate short videos with simple motion to verify basic temporal coherence, 2) Test personalized model integration with DreamBooth on single-subject videos, 3) Compare FVD scores against baseline methods on standard video datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance bounded by quality and biases of underlying StableDiffusion image model
- Frame-wise token mechanism may struggle with dramatic motion changes or complex action sequences
- Temporal consistency may degrade in longer video sequences where semantic coherence becomes challenging

## Confidence
- **High**: Architectural innovations (mapping network, frame-wise tokens, temporal self-attention loss) based on described mechanisms
- **Medium**: Quantitative FVD improvements and qualitative comparisons depend on specific datasets and evaluation protocols
- **Medium**: Seamless integration with personalized models supported by methodology but needs broader validation

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate HARIVO on longer video sequences (beyond typical 4-8 frames) to assess temporal consistency breakdown points and compare against state-of-the-art video generation models trained specifically on video data
2. Conduct ablation studies systematically removing each proposed component (mapping network, frame-wise tokens, temporal losses, contrastive loss) to quantify their individual contributions to final performance
3. Test the personalized model integration capability across a wider range of personalization scenarios, including multiple subjects in the same video, varying styles, and complex motion patterns to validate the claimed seamless compatibility
