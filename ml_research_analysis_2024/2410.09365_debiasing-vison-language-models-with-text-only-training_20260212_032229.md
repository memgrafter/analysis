# Debiasing Vison-Language Models with Text-Only Training

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.09365
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09365
- Reference count: 15
- Text-only debiasing framework for vision-language models without image data

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses bias in vision-language models (VLMs) by proposing a text-only debiasing framework that eliminates the need for image data. The method leverages large language models to generate balanced text descriptions for target and bias attributes, then applies multi-target prediction with prompt tuning to mitigate overfitting to text modality. The approach achieves significant improvements over existing image-free debiasing methods while maintaining competitive performance compared to image-supervised approaches.

## Method Summary
The framework operates through a three-stage process: first, an LLM generates balanced text descriptions for target and bias attributes; second, these descriptions are used for multi-target prediction to learn balanced representations; third, prompt tuning is applied to the VLM to incorporate the debiased knowledge while preventing overfitting to the text modality. This design enables effective bias mitigation without requiring any image data, making it particularly useful when image resources are limited or unavailable.

## Key Results
- Achieves worst-group accuracy improvements over image-free debiasing methods
- Reduces robustness gaps compared to traditional approaches
- Demonstrates competitive performance with image-supervised debiasing methods
- Successfully handles multiple and unknown bias attributes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by decoupling bias from visual features through text-only training. By generating balanced text descriptions using LLMs, the framework creates a modality where visual bias signals are inherently removed or balanced. The multi-target prediction framework ensures that the model learns to predict both target and bias attributes without favoring either, while prompt tuning allows the VLM to incorporate this balanced knowledge without overfitting to the text modality.

## Foundational Learning
- Vision-Language Models (VLMs): AI systems that process both visual and textual information together, essential for understanding multimodal tasks and their associated biases.
- Bias Attributes: Features in data that can lead to unfair predictions, crucial to identify and mitigate for responsible AI deployment.
- Prompt Tuning: A parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that modifies model behavior through task-specific prompts, needed to adapt pre-trained VLMs without extensive retraining.
- Multi-target Prediction: A learning framework that simultaneously predicts multiple related outputs, required for balanced learning across target and bias attributes.

Quick check: Verify understanding of how bias manifests in multimodal data and why text-only approaches can help mitigate it.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
LLM-generated text descriptions -> Multi-target prediction module -> Prompt tuning -> Debiased VLM

Critical Path:
The critical path flows from LLM-generated balanced text descriptions through multi-target prediction, where the model learns balanced representations, to prompt tuning that incorporates this knowledge into the VLM. Each stage builds upon the previous one to ensure bias mitigation without image data.

Design Tradeoffs:
The framework trades potential accuracy from visual features for bias mitigation capabilities. While image-free training avoids visual bias sources, it may miss some contextual information available in images. The multi-target prediction approach balances this by ensuring the model doesn't overfit to text modality.

Failure Signatures:
- Poor performance when LLM-generated descriptions contain their own biases
- Overfitting to text modality despite prompt tuning
- Reduced accuracy when bias attributes are highly correlated or ambiguous

First Experiments:
1. Validate LLM-generated text quality through human evaluation or automated metrics
2. Test multi-target prediction performance on balanced versus imbalanced text datasets
3. Evaluate prompt tuning effectiveness on a small subset of the VLM architecture

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions, but implicit questions include the scalability of the approach to more complex bias scenarios and the robustness of LLM-generated descriptions across different domains.

## Limitations
- Relies heavily on quality of LLM-generated text descriptions, which may introduce new biases
- Limited evaluation to specific datasets (Waterbirds and CelebA), raising questions about generalization
- Multi-target prediction may still face overfitting risks with highly correlated bias attributes

## Confidence
- Competitive results compared to image-supervised methods: High confidence
- Ability to handle multiple/unknown bias attributes: High confidence
- Significant improvements over image-free debiasing methods: Medium confidence

## Next Checks
1. Test framework on diverse real-world datasets with varying bias complexity to assess generalization beyond curated benchmarks
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate impact of LLM-generated descriptions versus other framework components
3. Evaluate robustness when dealing with ambiguous or incomplete bias attribute information, including unknown or partially observable bias attributes
