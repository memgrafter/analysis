# WildSAT: Learning Satellite Image Representations from Wildlife Observations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.14428
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14428
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: WildSAT introduces a novel contrastive learning framework that leverages species observation data to enhance satellite image representations, achieving average accuracy improvements of 7.7% to 17.4% across seven satellite image classification datasets.

## Executive Summary
WildSAT presents a novel contrastive learning framework that leverages species observation data to enhance satellite image representations. The method combines satellite images, species distribution maps, and textual habitat descriptions from sources like iNaturalist and Wikipedia to train models. By aligning visual and textual information, WildSAT significantly improves performance on diverse satellite image recognition tasks, outperforming both ImageNet-pretrained models and satellite-specific baselines.

## Method Summary
WildSAT uses a contrastive learning framework to combine information from species distribution maps with text descriptions that capture habitat and range details, alongside satellite images, to train or fine-tune models. The method takes satellite images, species observation locations (latitude/longitude), environmental covariates (e.g., temperature, precipitation from WorldClim2), and Wikipedia text descriptions of species habitats. These modalities are encoded using modality-specific encoders (image encoder, SINR location encoder, GritLM text encoder) and projected to a shared embedding space. The model is trained using InfoNCE loss to minimize distance between aligned embeddings (same location, species, and habitat) and maximize distance between non-aligned ones. The framework also incorporates geometric and time-based augmentations on satellite images to encourage learning of rotation-invariant and time-invariant visual features.

## Key Results
- WildSAT achieves average accuracy improvements of 7.7% to 17.4% across seven satellite image classification datasets
- The method significantly outperforms both ImageNet-pretrained models and satellite-specific baselines
- WildSAT demonstrates strong performance in bird species encounter rate prediction and enables zero-shot image retrieval based on textual descriptions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** The alignment of satellite images with species habitat descriptions improves feature discrimination for ecologically relevant classes.
- **Mechanism:** WildSAT uses contrastive learning to jointly embed satellite images, species observation locations, and textual habitat descriptions into a shared representation space. When these modalities originate from the same location, their embeddings are pushed closer together, while mismatched pairs are separated. This cross-modal alignment enforces the model to associate visual patterns in satellite imagery with ecological attributes encoded in species descriptions.
- **Core assumption:** Habitat preferences of species are reliably encoded in textual descriptions and correlate strongly with observable satellite features (e.g., vegetation density, terrain ruggedness).
- **Break condition:** If textual descriptions are noisy, vague, or not correlated with observable satellite features, the contrastive signal degrades and may mislead the model.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Adding location and environmental covariate information provides fine-grained spatial context that improves classification accuracy beyond visual cues alone.
- **Mechanism:** WildSAT incorporates a location encoder (SINR) and environmental covariates (e.g., temperature, precipitation from WorldClim2) alongside the image and text encoders. The model learns to associate geographic coordinates and climate variables with both visual patterns and species presence, enriching the embedding space with ecological metadata.
- **Core assumption:** Environmental covariates are strong predictors of species distributions and correlate with observable landscape features in satellite imagery.
- **Break condition:** If environmental covariates are inaccurate, missing, or irrelevant to the geographic area, the model cannot exploit this signal and may overfit to location patterns instead of visual features.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Self-supervised image augmentation in WildSAT encourages learning of rotation-invariant and time-invariant visual features that generalize across satellite image tasks.
- **Mechanism:** In addition to cross-modal alignment, WildSAT applies geometric augmentations (flipping, random cropping) and time-based augmentations (same location, different times) to satellite images, enforcing the model to learn consistent features across these variations. This is implemented through the image contrastive loss Limg.
- **Core assumption:** Satellite images from the same location but different times share core visual features (e.g., terrain, land cover) while differing in temporal details (e.g., vegetation state, lighting).
- **Break condition:** If augmentations are too aggressive or if the temporal variation between images is too large, the model may learn spurious invariances that hurt performance on fine-grained classification tasks.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Contrastive learning and InfoNCE loss
  - **Why needed here:** WildSAT relies on contrastive objectives (Limg, Ltxt, Lloc) to align multiple modalities (image, text, location) into a shared embedding space. Understanding InfoNCE loss and its temperature hyperparameter is critical to tuning the model.
  - **Quick check question:** What is the role of the temperature parameter τ in the InfoNCE loss, and how does changing it affect embedding similarity distributions?

- **Concept:** Multi-modal representation learning
  - **Why needed here:** WildSAT integrates satellite images, text, location, and environmental covariates into a unified embedding space. Engineers must understand how to align heterogeneous data types and handle modality-specific encoders.
  - **Quick check question:** How do you ensure that embeddings from different modalities (e.g., image vs. text) are comparable in the same space after projection layers?

- **Concept:** Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
  - **Why needed here:** WildSAT fine-tunes large pre-trained models (e.g., CLIP, ImageNet) on ecological data. Knowing when to apply PEFT (e.g., DoRa, scale-and-shift) vs. full fine-tuning is important for balancing performance and efficiency.
  - **Quick check question:** When should you apply PEFT to out-of-domain models vs. in-domain models, and what are the trade-offs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Satellite image → image encoder → projection → embedding → contrastive loss with text/location embeddings
- **Critical path:** Satellite image → image encoder → projection → embedding → contrastive loss with text/location embeddings. All modalities must be available at training time.
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Full fine-tuning vs. PEFT: Full fine-tuning yields better performance on in-domain models but risks overfitting; PEFT preserves pre-training representations for out-of-domain models.
  - Text granularity: Using whole Wikipedia pages vs. individual sections affects embedding quality and training efficiency.
  - Environmental covariates: Optional inclusion adds spatial context but increases data dependency.
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Poor alignment between modalities → embeddings from different sources not clustered correctly → degraded downstream performance.
  - Overfitting to location patterns → model memorizes coordinates instead of learning visual features.
  - Incorrect augmentation strategy → model learns spurious invariances or fails to generalize.
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Ablation of location encoder:** Train with and without SINR, using only lat/lon or lat/lon + env covariates, and measure impact on downstream classification accuracy.
  2. **Ablation of text modality:** Train with only image + location (no text), then add text, and compare performance on zero-shot retrieval and classification.
  3. **Augmentation sensitivity:** Vary geometric and temporal augmentations (e.g., no flipping, only cropping, no time shifts) and measure effect on feature invariance and accuracy.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1:** How does the performance of WildSAT vary across different geographic regions with varying data density in iNaturalist observations?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper explicitly mentions that "The US and Europe are over-represented in the data as most citizen contributed data currently come from these locations" and discusses potential limitations for underrepresented areas in Asia, Africa, Australia, and South America.
  - **Why unresolved:** The paper acknowledges the geographic bias in the training data but doesn't provide quantitative analysis of how WildSAT's performance degrades in regions with fewer observations. They only state it as a limitation without measuring the extent.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** A systematic evaluation of WildSAT's performance across different continents or countries, comparing accuracy metrics between well-represented regions (North America, Europe) versus underrepresented regions (Africa, Asia, South America), would quantify this geographic bias.

- **Open Question 2:** What is the impact of different environmental covariate resolutions on WildSAT's performance, and how sensitive is the model to the choice of covariate granularity?
  - **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper mentions using "five minute resolution data" from WorldClim2 and notes that "bilinearly interpolate between data points to get values for specific locations," but doesn't explore how different resolutions might affect performance.
  - **Why unresolved:** While the paper specifies their resolution choice, they don't investigate whether higher or lower resolution environmental covariates would improve or degrade performance, nor do they analyze the sensitivity to this hyperparameter.
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments comparing WildSAT performance using different environmental covariate resolutions (e.g., 2.5-minute, 5-minute, 10-minute) across the same downstream tasks would reveal the optimal resolution and sensitivity.

- **Open Question 3:** How does WildSAT's zero-shot retrieval capability generalize to species and habitats not present in the training data?
  - **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper demonstrates zero-shot retrieval for known species and habitats but doesn't test the model's ability to handle queries for completely unseen species or habitat types.
  - **Why unresolved:** While the paper shows successful retrieval for species like 'ibex' and 'gull,' it doesn't explore whether the model can generalize to novel species or whether it can distinguish between similar but unseen habitats (e.g., different types of wetlands).
  - **What evidence would resolve it:** Testing zero-shot retrieval on species and habitat descriptions completely absent from the training data, measuring retrieval accuracy and qualitative quality of results, would reveal the model's generalization capabilities.

## Limitations

- The method relies heavily on the quality and coverage of iNaturalist data, which is biased toward areas with high human activity and may underrepresent certain species or geographic regions.
- The framework assumes that Wikipedia habitat descriptions accurately reflect species-environment relationships, but these descriptions may contain outdated or incorrect information.
- The performance gains are primarily demonstrated on temperate regions where both satellite data and iNaturalist observations are abundant, raising questions about applicability to tropical or remote areas with sparse observation data.

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims:**
- The contrastive learning framework effectively aligns multiple modalities (image, text, location) in a shared embedding space
- Adding location and environmental covariate information improves classification accuracy compared to image-only models
- WildSAT outperforms ImageNet-pretrained models on satellite-specific tasks

**Medium Confidence Claims:**
- The specific performance improvements (7.7% to 17.4% accuracy gains) will generalize across all satellite image datasets
- Zero-shot retrieval capabilities are robust across diverse geographic locations and textual descriptions
- Each individual component (location, environment, text, augmentations) contributes independently to performance gains

**Low Confidence Claims:**
- WildSAT will maintain similar performance improvements in regions with sparse species observation data
- The model's robustness to temporal changes in land cover and vegetation patterns
- The framework's effectiveness for species not well-represented in iNaturalist or Wikipedia

## Next Checks

1. **Geographic Generalization Test:** Evaluate WildSAT on satellite datasets from regions with minimal iNaturalist coverage (e.g., tropical rainforests, Arctic regions) to assess whether the learned representations transfer to data-poor areas. Compare performance against baselines trained solely on satellite imagery from these regions.

2. **Temporal Robustness Analysis:** Test the model's performance on satellite images from different time periods than those used during training. Use time-series satellite data to evaluate whether WildSAT maintains accuracy when environmental conditions have changed significantly (e.g., post-fire landscapes, seasonal variations).

3. **Cross-Species Transfer Study:** Assess WildSAT's ability to improve classification for species with minimal observation data by leveraging information from well-documented species. Measure whether the model can generalize habitat associations from common species to rare ones through the shared embedding space.
