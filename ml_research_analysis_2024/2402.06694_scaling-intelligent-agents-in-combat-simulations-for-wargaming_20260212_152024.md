# Scaling Intelligent Agents in Combat Simulations for Wargaming

## Quick Facts

- This research addresses scaling AI to complex wargaming environments using hierarchical reinforcement learning

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for scaling intelligent agents in complex combat simulations. The approach decomposes decision-making into multiple levels using dimension-invariant observation abstractions and a multi-model agent framework. Preliminary results demonstrate significant improvements over single-model approaches, with local observation agents learning faster than global-observation agents in larger gameboards. The method enables training in complex scenarios that were previously intractable by reducing state space complexity through hierarchical decomposition.

## Method Summary
The framework implements a three-level hierarchical decomposition (Commander, Manager, Operator) where each level uses different observation abstractions and specializes in different decision timescales. A multi-model agent framework selects between specialized behavior models using score prediction models that estimate game outcomes. Local 7x7 observation spaces with piecewise linear spatial decay weighting enable agents to focus on immediate surroundings while maintaining spatial relationships. The training procedure involves independent training of each hierarchical level with frozen other levels, using Atlatl Combat Simulation environment with deterministic 17-channel observation spaces.

## Key Results
- 62.6% improvement over single-model approaches using multi-model framework
- Local observation agents learn significantly faster than global-observation agents in larger gameboards
- Hierarchical decomposition enables training in complex scenarios previously intractable
- Agents successfully learn from reduced state space representations while maintaining performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Hierarchical decomposition reduces computational complexity by allowing each level to focus on abstract decision-making while lower levels handle local execution. The framework splits decision-making into Commander (coarse global objectives), Manager (intermediate sub-goals), and Operator (local actions) levels. Each level uses different observation abstractions - coarse for high levels, local for low levels. Core assumption: Different abstraction levels preserve sufficient information for effective decision-making at each hierarchy level.

### Mechanism 2
Multi-model framework outperforms single-model approaches by selecting specialized models for specific situations. Multiple behavior models are evaluated using score prediction models that estimate game outcomes. An evaluation function selects the best model for each action-selection step based on predicted performance. Core assumption: Score prediction models can accurately estimate which behavior model will perform best in a given state.

### Mechanism 3
Local observation abstractions enable faster learning in larger gameboards compared to global observations. Local 7x7 observation spaces with piecewise linear spatial decay weighting allow agents to focus on immediate surroundings while maintaining spatial relationships. This reduces state space complexity compared to global observations. Core assumption: Local information is sufficient for effective tactical decision-making while preserving computational tractability.

## Foundational Learning

- **Reinforcement Learning fundamentals (states, actions, rewards, policies)**: Forms the foundation for understanding how agents learn through interaction with the environment
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a policy and a value function in RL?

- **Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning and temporal abstraction**: Essential for understanding how the framework decomposes complex decision-making into manageable subtasks
  - Quick check question: How do options in HRL differ from primitive actions in standard RL?

- **Observation space abstraction and dimensionality reduction**: Critical for understanding how the framework manages exponential growth in state space complexity
  - Quick check question: What is the trade-off between coarse abstraction and information preservation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Commander → Manager → Operator levels; Abstract objectives → Sub-goals → Primitive actions; Score prediction models + Behavior models + Evaluation function; Global coarse → Local spatial decay → Dimension-invariant representations

- **Critical path**: State observation → Hierarchical decision decomposition → Multi-model selection → Action execution → Reward collection

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Hierarchy depth vs. coordination complexity
  - Abstraction level vs. information preservation
  - Model specialization vs. generalization capability
  - Local vs. global observation effectiveness

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Poor performance indicates abstraction too coarse or hierarchy misaligned
  - Slow learning suggests inadequate reward signals or suboptimal model selection
  - Inconsistent behavior points to evaluation function issues or model prediction errors

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Implement single-level hierarchy with local observations vs. global observations on small gameboard
  2. Add multi-model selection capability and compare against single best model
  3. Extend to two-level hierarchy (Commander + Operator) with different abstraction levels

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How do the performance characteristics of local-observation agents compare to global-observation agents in complex, large-scale combat scenarios with limited training budgets? The paper presents preliminary results showing faster learning rates for local-observation agents but notes that "it remains to be seen if this ability to learn from this reduced representation of the state space is generalizable across any starting condition" and that experiments are still ongoing.

### Open Question 2
What is the optimal number of hierarchical levels for different combat simulation complexities, and how does this affect learning efficiency and performance? The paper mentions "one can think of this hierarchy as anywhere from 1 to n levels deep" and anticipates needing "at least three levels of hierarchy" for complex scenarios, but doesn't provide empirical data on how different hierarchical depths affect performance across various scenario complexities.

### Open Question 3
How does the multi-model agent framework scale when incorporating an increasing number of specialized models, and what is the point of diminishing returns? While the paper demonstrates improvement with more models, it doesn't investigate how this scales to hundreds or thousands of models, nor does it identify the optimal number of models for different scenario types.

## Limitations

- The hierarchical decomposition framework assumes abstraction levels preserve sufficient information, but this is largely theoretical rather than empirically validated
- Multi-model selection mechanism relies on score prediction models whose accuracy and generalization across different game states remain unverified
- Baseline methods and their training procedures are not fully specified, making it difficult to assess the true magnitude of the 62.6% improvement

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Core architectural framework (hierarchical decomposition with Commander-Manager-Operator levels) is well-specified and logically sound
- **Medium Confidence**: 62.6% improvement claim is supported by internal comparisons, but baseline methodology lacks transparency
- **Low Confidence**: Generalizability of local observation abstractions and robustness of score prediction models require further validation

## Next Checks

1. **Benchmark Comparison Validation**: Implement and train multiple baseline RL approaches (DQN, PPO, A2C) with identical computational resources to establish proper baselines for the improvement claim.

2. **Cross-Scenario Generalization Test**: Evaluate trained hierarchical agents across diverse combat scenarios beyond initial training environments, including asymmetric force compositions and varied terrain configurations.

3. **Abstraction Fidelity Analysis**: Conduct systematic ablation studies removing hierarchical levels one at a time to quantify each level's specific contribution and test whether information loss impacts strategic decision quality.
