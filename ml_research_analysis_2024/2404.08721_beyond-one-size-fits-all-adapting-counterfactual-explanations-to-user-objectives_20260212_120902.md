# Beyond One-Size-Fits-All: Adapting Counterfactual Explanations to User Objectives

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.08721
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08721
- Reference count: 25
- One-line primary result: Different user objectives for counterfactual explanations require different properties like actionability, plausibility, and robustness rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.

## Executive Summary
This paper challenges the conventional one-size-fits-all approach to counterfactual explanations in Explainable AI by identifying three distinct user objectives: achieving desired outcomes, investigating system behavior, and detecting vulnerabilities. The authors argue that each objective requires different properties from counterfactual explanations - outcome fulfillment needs both actionability and plausibility, system investigation prioritizes plausibility for bias detection, and vulnerability detection focuses on robustness at the expense of plausibility and actionability. This framework provides a foundation for developing tailored counterfactual explanation systems that better serve specific user needs.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a conceptual analysis of counterfactual explanations through the lens of user objectives, identifying three main use cases and mapping them to specific property requirements. The authors analyze the trade-offs between actionability, plausibility, and robustness across these objectives without providing a concrete algorithmic implementation. The approach involves defining AI system inputs that produce outputs, generating counterfactual instances that produce different outputs, and evaluating these counterfactuals based on their alignment with user objectives. The analysis focuses on theoretical properties and use cases rather than empirical evaluation or implementation details.

## Key Results
- Different user objectives (outcome fulfillment, system investigation, vulnerability detection) require different properties for counterfactual explanations
- Actionability and plausibility are essential for achieving desired outcomes but may conflict with vulnerability detection objectives
- Presenting multiple counterfactuals with contrasting properties helps reveal system biases during investigation
- Vulnerability detection requires robustness and may benefit from out-of-distribution inputs that would typically be considered implausible

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Different user objectives require different properties for counterfactual explanations to be effective.
- Mechanism: The paper identifies three user objectives (outcome fulfillment, system investigation, vulnerability detection) and maps them to specific property requirements (actionability, plausibility, robustness). This allows counterfactual explainers to be tailored to user needs rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach.
- Core assumption: Users have clearly distinguishable objectives when using counterfactual explanations, and these objectives cannot be satisfied by a single explanation type.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "different objectives require different properties, such as actionability and plausibility"
  - [section] "we identify three main user objectives, and explore the desired properties of the counterfactual explanations in each case"
- Break condition: If users' objectives are not clearly separable or if one explanation type could satisfy multiple objectives effectively.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Actionability and plausibility properties can conflict with vulnerability detection objectives.
- Mechanism: For vulnerability detection, counterfactual explanations should focus on robustness and be able to handle out-of-distribution inputs and imperceptible changes. Imposing actionability and plausibility constraints would hinder the ability to identify weaknesses in the AI system.
- Core assumption: Vulnerability detection requires testing edge cases and unusual inputs that would typically be considered implausible or non-actionable.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "For example, a security engineer may want to ensure that slight changes to input data, or inconsistencies like leaving fields empty or providing invalid values, do not compromise the integrity of the system."
  - [section] "considerations of plausibility and actionability pose potential conflicts with the user's objectives as they could impede the detection of vulnerabilities to attacks involving random noise or out-of-distribution permutations."
- Break condition: If vulnerability detection could be effectively performed using only plausible and actionable counterfactuals.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Presenting multiple counterfactuals with contrasting properties helps reveal system biases.
- Mechanism: For system investigation, showing multiple counterfactual explanations with different properties (e.g., one requiring large income increase vs. one requiring small income increase plus gender change) allows users to detect inconsistencies and biases in the model's decision-making.
- Core assumption: Biases and inconsistencies in AI systems become apparent when comparing multiple counterfactual explanations with varying properties.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Presenting a multitude of counterfactuals is very important in this use case, since it is through their contrast that biases are revealed. E.g. one counterfactual edit might be an increase of income by $10,000 and another might be an increase of income by $1,000 and a change of gender."
- Break condition: If a single counterfactual explanation could adequately reveal all relevant biases and inconsistencies.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Counterfactual Explanations (CFEs)
  - Why needed here: Understanding what counterfactual explanations are and how they work is fundamental to grasping why different properties are needed for different user objectives.
  - Quick check question: What is a counterfactual explanation in the context of XAI, and how does it differ from other explanation methods?

- Concept: Actionability vs. Plausibility
  - Why needed here: These two properties are central to the paper's argument about why different user objectives require different types of counterfactual explanations.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between actionability and plausibility in counterfactual explanations, and why might these properties conflict with each other in certain use cases?

- Concept: User Objectives in XAI
  - Why needed here: The paper's main contribution is identifying different user objectives and mapping them to specific properties of counterfactual explanations.
  - Quick check question: What are the three main user objectives identified in the paper for using counterfactual explanations, and how do they differ from each other?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - User interface for specifying objectives
  - Counterfactual explainer engine with configurable properties
  - Property constraint module (actionability, plausibility, robustness)
  - Output formatter for different explanation types
  - Feedback collection system for user satisfaction

- Critical path:
  1. User specifies their objective (outcome fulfillment, system investigation, or vulnerability detection)
  2. System configures counterfactual explainer properties based on selected objective
  3. Explainer generates counterfactual explanations with appropriate constraints
  4. Explanations are formatted and presented to the user
  5. User provides feedback on explanation quality

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Flexibility vs. complexity: More configurable properties allow for better tailoring but increase system complexity
  - Generality vs. specificity: A more general explainer can handle multiple objectives but may be less effective for specific use cases
  - Performance vs. accuracy: Stricter property constraints may improve explanation quality but reduce the number of valid counterfactuals

- Failure signatures:
  - User dissatisfaction despite explanations being technically correct
  - Inability to generate any counterfactuals for certain inputs
  - Generated counterfactuals being consistently implausible or non-actionable for the user's objective

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a basic counterfactual explainer with configurable actionability and plausibility constraints, test with simple classification tasks
  2. Create a user study comparing explanations generated for different objectives (outcome fulfillment vs. system investigation)
  3. Develop a benchmark suite with diverse AI models and datasets to test the explainer's performance across different use cases

## Limitations

- Lacks empirical validation through user studies or experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of objective-specific counterfactual explanations
- Does not provide concrete algorithmic implementations or quantitative evaluation methods for generating counterfactuals with different property constraints
- Does not address challenges in automatically determining user objectives or handling cases where multiple objectives may be relevant simultaneously

## Confidence

- User Objectives Framework: Medium confidence - The identification of three distinct user objectives appears well-founded, but lacks empirical validation
- Property Trade-offs: Medium confidence - The theoretical analysis of actionability/plausibility trade-offs is reasonable but speculative without experimental evidence
- Contrast-based Bias Detection: Medium confidence - Intuitively appealing but would benefit from quantitative assessment of its effectiveness
- Vulnerability Detection Claims: Low confidence - The claim that plausibility/actionability inherently conflict with vulnerability detection remains speculative without experimental support

## Next Checks

1. **User Study**: Conduct a controlled experiment comparing user performance and satisfaction when using counterfactual explanations tailored to specific objectives versus generic explanations across all three identified use cases.

2. **Bias Detection Evaluation**: Implement the contrast-based approach for system investigation and measure its effectiveness in detecting known biases in benchmark datasets compared to single-explanation approaches.

3. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Design a security-focused evaluation where counterfactual explanations with different property constraints are used to identify vulnerabilities in AI systems, measuring both detection coverage and false positive rates.
