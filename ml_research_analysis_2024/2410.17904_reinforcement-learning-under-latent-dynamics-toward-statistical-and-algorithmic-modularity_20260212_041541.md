# Reinforcement Learning under Latent Dynamics: Toward Statistical and Algorithmic Modularity

## Quick Facts

- This paper studies reinforcement learning under general latent dynamics, showing statistical modularity fails for most RL settings but is preserved under latent pushforward coverability, while also developing algorithmic modularity through observable-to-latent reductions.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses reinforcement learning under latent dynamics, where agents observe complex states but the underlying dynamics are simpler. The authors show that while statistical modularity fails for most reinforcement learning settings with function approximation when composed with rich observations, it is preserved under a condition called latent pushforward coverability. They also develop algorithmic modularity through observable-to-latent reductions that transform arbitrary algorithms for the latent MDP into algorithms that can operate on rich observations. These results represent a first step toward a unified statistical and algorithmic theory for reinforcement learning under latent dynamics.

## Method Summary
The paper establishes that most function approximation settings are intractable under latent dynamics, but identifies latent pushforward coverability as a condition enabling statistical tractability. They develop observable-to-latent reductions in two settings: one with hindsight observations of latent states and one with self-predictive latent models. The O2L meta-algorithm alternates between representation learning and executing a base RL algorithm in the learned representation space, inheriting the base algorithm's sample complexity guarantees. For self-predictive estimation, they use optimistic modeling to jointly fit a decoder and base dynamics model by minimizing the discrepancy between predicted and actual next latent states.

## Key Results
- Statistical modularity fails for most RL settings with function approximation when composed with rich observations
- Latent pushforward coverability enables statistical tractability by allowing construction of low-dimensional linear embeddings that approximate Bellman backups
- Algorithmic modularity is achievable through observable-to-latent reductions using representation learning oracles
- Self-predictive estimation with optimistic modeling enables algorithmic modularity without requiring hindsight observability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Statistical modularity fails for most RL settings with function approximation when composed with rich observations, but is preserved under latent pushforward coverability.
- Mechanism: Pushforward coverability enables construction of low-dimensional linear embeddings that approximate Bellman backups for arbitrary function classes, enabling application of existing PAC RL algorithms.
- Core assumption: Base MDPs with pushforward coverability admit low-dimensional embeddings that can approximate Bellman backups for any sufficiently small function class.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we complement this with a positive result, identifying latent pushforward coverability as a general condition that enables statistical tractability"
  - [section] "Theorem 3.2 shows that, modulo a term that is doubly-logarithmic in |S|, latent pushforward coverability enables statistical modularity"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus neighbors don't discuss pushforward coverability specifically
- Break condition: If the base MDP class doesn't satisfy pushforward coverability or if the decoder class Φ is too large relative to the embedding dimension requirements.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Algorithmic modularity is achievable through observable-to-latent reductions using representation learning oracles.
- Mechanism: O2L meta-algorithm alternates between representation learning and executing a base RL algorithm in the learned representation space, inheriting the base algorithm's sample complexity guarantees.
- Core assumption: Representation learning oracle can learn sufficiently accurate representations (low regret) and base algorithm can achieve low risk when given true latent states.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we develop provably efficient observable-to-latent reductions—that is, reductions that transform an arbitrary algorithm for the latent MDP into an algorithm that can operate on rich observations"
  - [section] "the O2L meta-algorithm learns a near-optimal policy for M*obs by alternating between performing representation learning and executing a black-box 'base' RL algorithm"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus neighbors don't discuss observable-to-latent reductions
- Break condition: If representation learning oracle cannot achieve sublinear regret or if base algorithm is not CorruptionRobust (in self-predictive estimation setting).

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Self-predictive estimation with optimistic modeling enables algorithmic modularity without hindsight observability.
- Mechanism: Jointly fits a decoder and base dynamics model by minimizing the discrepancy between predicted and actual next latent states, with optimism over learned models to encourage exploration.
- Core assumption: Mismatch completeness assumption allows capture of pushforward models ϕ♯M*obs using decoder and base model realizability.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "one where the agent can estimate self-predictive latent models [SAGHCB20]"
  - [section] "our self-predictive representation learning oracles learn to fit a representation ϕ such that the induced latent transitions can be accurately modeled by some base (latent) MDP Mlat"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus neighbors don't discuss self-predictive estimation
- Break condition: If mismatch completeness assumption fails or if optimistic estimation introduces excessive bias.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Bellman operators and value function backups
  - Why needed here: Core to understanding how pushforward coverability enables approximation of Bellman backups in observation space
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between the Bellman optimality operator T and the Bellman evaluation operator Tπ?

- Concept: Coverability and pushforward coverability coefficients
  - Why needed here: These are the key structural properties that enable statistical and algorithmic modularity
  - Quick check question: How does pushforward coverability differ from standard coverability in terms of what distributions it controls?

- Concept: Online learning and regret bounds
  - Why needed here: Essential for understanding how representation learning oracles achieve sublinear regret
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between online classification regret and the performance of the O2L algorithm under hindsight observability?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Base MDP class Mlat -> Decoder class Φ -> Representation learning oracle -> O2L meta-algorithm -> Base RL algorithm Alglat

- Critical path:
  1. Establish that base MDP class Mlat has low pushforward coverability
  2. Construct representation learning oracle with appropriate regret guarantees
  3. Run O2L algorithm with oracle and base algorithm
  4. Verify risk bounds scale appropriately with problem parameters

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Statistical modularity vs algorithmic modularity: Stronger conditions enable algorithmic modularity but may be harder to satisfy
  - Self-predictive estimation vs hindsight observability: Self-predictive estimation removes need for additional feedback but requires stronger assumptions
  - Dimension of embeddings vs approximation quality: Higher dimension embeddings give better approximation but increase computational cost

- Failure signatures:
  - High regret from representation learning oracle indicates poor representation quality
  - Failure of CorruptionRobustness suggests model misspecification or insufficient exploration
  - Breakdown of pushforward coverability assumptions indicates structural incompatibility

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement O2L with tabular base MDP class and simple decoder class to verify statistical modularity
  2. Test self-predictive estimation oracle on a simple Block MDP with known latent structure
  3. Compare performance of O2L with and without optimism in self-predictive estimation on a challenging latent dynamics problem

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Theoretical results rely heavily on structural assumptions (latent pushforward coverability, mismatch completeness, decoder realizability) whose practical verifiability is unclear
- The paper does not address how to estimate these parameters or verify their satisfaction in practice
- Generalization from finite to infinite function classes remains informal
- Empirical validation is absent entirely

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The statistical modularity impossibility result (most RL settings are intractable under latent dynamics)
- **Medium Confidence**: The positive result showing pushforward coverability enables statistical tractability (relies on several technical assumptions)
- **Medium Confidence**: The algorithmic modularity results via observable-to-latent reductions (constructive but require strong oracle assumptions)

## Next Checks
1. Implement the O2L meta-algorithm on a simple Block MDP benchmark to verify the statistical modularity claims empirically
2. Test the self-predictive estimation oracle on a continuous control problem with known latent structure to validate the mismatch completeness assumption
3. Analyze the sensitivity of the results to violations of the pushforward coverability assumption through controlled synthetic experiments
