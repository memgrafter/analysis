# Revisit Large-Scale Image-Caption Data in Pre-training Multimodal Foundation Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.02740
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02740
- Reference count: 22
- One-line primary result: Hybrid approach combining synthetic captions with AltText consistently outperforms synthetic captions alone in pre-training multimodal foundation models.

## Executive Summary
This paper systematically investigates the role of synthetic captions and their interaction with original web-crawled AltText in pre-training multimodal foundation models. A novel, controllable, and scalable captioning pipeline is introduced to generate diverse caption formats tailored to various models. By examining short synthetic captions (SSC) and dense synthetic captions (DSC+) across CLIP, multimodal LLMs, and diffusion models, the study reveals that a hybrid approach combining synthetic captions with AltText consistently outperforms using synthetic captions alone. The results show that AltText provides data variety while synthetic captions offer better image-text alignment, with different models demonstrating preferences for specific caption formats.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces a controllable and scalable captioning pipeline with a two-stage fine-tuning process for converting MLLMs into captioners. The pipeline generates various caption formats including Short Synthetic Captions (SSC), Descriptive Synthetic Captions (DSC), and Dense Synthetic Captions (DSC+). These synthetic captions are combined with web-crawled AltText at different ratios to pre-train CLIP, multimodal LLMs (MM1), and diffusion models. The study evaluates performance using zero-shot image classification, retrieval tasks, and specific benchmarks like ImageNet classification and COCO retrieval.

## Key Results
- Hybrid approach combining synthetic captions with AltText consistently outperforms synthetic captions alone, improving both alignment and performance
- CLIP benefits from shorter synthetic captions while multimodal LLMs show improved performance with more descriptive captions
- Dense Synthetic Captions (DSC+) with more hallucinations can be tolerated if they provide sufficient richness for multimodal LLM pre-training
- Optimal mixing ratio of 40-50% AltText with synthetic captions yields best performance for CLIP

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: A hybrid approach combining synthetic captions with AltText consistently outperforms using synthetic captions alone in multimodal foundation model pre-training.
- Mechanism: Synthetic captions provide better image-text alignment and reduced noise, while AltText provides greater data diversity and wider knowledge coverage. The combination leverages both benefits.
- Core assumption: Both alignment quality and data diversity are critical factors for effective pre-training of multimodal foundation models.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "a hybrid approach that keeps both synthetic captions and AltTexts can outperform the use of synthetic captions alone, improving both alignment and performance"
  - [section] "AltText provides data variety and synthetic captions provide better image-text alignment"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct corpus citations, but this aligns with general principles in data curation literature
- Break condition: If synthetic captions become too dominant, they may reduce vocabulary diversity; if AltText dominates, alignment quality may suffer.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Different multimodal foundation models have unique preferences for specific caption formats.
- Mechanism: CLIP benefits from shorter captions that match the prompt distribution of evaluation datasets, while multimodal LLMs benefit from more descriptive captions that provide richer visual context for fine-tuning.
- Core assumption: The optimal caption format depends on the specific architecture and downstream task requirements of each model type.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "each model demonstrating preferences for particular caption formats"
  - [section] "CLIP tends to favor short synthetic captions, whereas MLLMs benefit from more descriptive captions"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - this is primarily derived from the paper's own experiments rather than external corpus support
- Break condition: If caption format preferences are not respected, model performance degrades significantly in specific tasks.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Hallucinations in synthetic captions can be tolerated if the captions provide sufficient richness and detail for multimodal LLM pre-training.
- Mechanism: While detailed captions contain more hallucinations, the additional richness and specificity helps multimodal LLMs generalize better after the SFT stage, outweighing the negative impact of hallucinations.
- Core assumption: Multimodal LLMs can learn to distinguish between accurate and hallucinated information during fine-tuning, making caption richness more important than perfect accuracy during pre-training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "detailed captions (DSC+) alone yield the best performance after the SFT stage" and "DSC+ achieves a 58.7% score, outperforming LLaV A captions (56.5%) by 2.2%"
  - [section] "DSC+ improves performance on 7 out of 9 benchmarks" despite containing more hallucinations
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - this specific finding about hallucination tolerance is primarily from the paper's own experiments
- Break condition: If hallucinations become too severe or frequent, they may overwhelm the model's ability to learn useful patterns during pre-training.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multimodal foundation models
  - Why needed here: Understanding the different types of models (CLIP, multimodal LLMs, diffusion models) and their specific requirements is crucial for interpreting the experimental results and design decisions.
  - Quick check question: What are the key architectural differences between CLIP, multimodal LLMs, and diffusion models that would explain their different caption format preferences?

- Concept: Data quality vs. data diversity tradeoff
  - Why needed here: The paper demonstrates a fundamental tradeoff between the alignment quality of synthetic captions and the diversity of AltText, which is central to understanding the hybrid approach.
  - Quick check question: Why does using only high-quality synthetic captions sometimes lead to worse performance than using noisy AltText alone?

- Concept: Controlled captioning pipeline
  - Why needed here: The paper introduces a novel two-stage fine-tuning process for converting MLLMs into captioners, which is essential for generating the various caption formats studied.
  - Quick check question: How does the two-stage fine-tuning process help address both hallucination issues and format-following limitations in MLLMs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Image Dataset -> MLLM-based Captioner (3B/7B) -> Two-Stage Fine-Tuning Pipeline -> Caption Format Generators (SSC, DSC, DSC+, AFC) -> Target Models (CLIP, MM1, Stable Diffusion 3) -> Evaluation Metrics (CapScore, ANA, CHAIR) -> Performance Benchmarks

- Critical path:
  1. Fine-tune MLLM on Stage-1-1M dataset to create basic captioner
  2. Further fine-tune on Stage-2-HA dataset to create human-aligned captioner
  3. Generate various caption formats at scale
  4. Pre-train target models using different caption combinations
  5. Evaluate performance across multiple benchmarks

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Caption length vs. accuracy (richness vs. hallucination control)
  - Synthetic captions vs. AltText balance (alignment vs. diversity)
  - Model size vs. scalability (3B vs. 7B captioners)
  - Pre-training vs. fine-tuning data preferences

- Failure signatures:
  - Over-reliance on synthetic captions leads to vocabulary narrowing
  - Excessive hallucinations degrade downstream performance
  - Incorrect caption format for target model type
  - Poor balance between AltText and synthetic captions

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test captioner hallucination levels on validation set using CapScore and CHAIR metrics
  2. Compare SSC vs DSC performance on CLIP with small dataset subset
  3. Evaluate optimal mixing ratio of synthetic captions and AltText for CLIP using linear probing

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal mixture ratio between synthetic captions and AltText for different multimodal foundation models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explores this question by examining the effect of different ratios on CLIP performance, finding that a 40-50% AltText ratio yields optimal results for CLIP.
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides insights for CLIP, it does not comprehensively investigate the optimal ratios for other models like multimodal LLMs and diffusion models. The optimal ratio may vary depending on the specific model architecture and task requirements.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting systematic experiments to determine the optimal mixture ratios for different models and tasks would provide concrete evidence. This could involve training models with varying ratios and evaluating their performance on relevant benchmarks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do different caption formats (e.g., SSC, DSC, DSC+) impact the performance of multimodal LLMs in various tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper investigates this question for MM1, finding that DSC+ yields the best performance after SFT. However, it does not extensively explore the impact of different formats on other multimodal LLM tasks.
- Why unresolved: The paper's focus on MM1 and specific benchmarks limits the generalizability of the findings to other multimodal LLM tasks and models. Different tasks may have varying requirements for caption detail and accuracy.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating multimodal LLMs on a wider range of tasks and datasets using different caption formats would provide insights into their relative strengths and weaknesses. This could involve designing new benchmarks or adapting existing ones to assess performance across diverse scenarios.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the trade-off between caption richness and accuracy for different multimodal tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces the CapScore metric to quantify this trade-off, finding that longer captions like DSC+ have higher ANA but lower CapScore, indicating more hallucinations.
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides a framework for evaluating this trade-off, it does not fully explore the optimal balance for different tasks. Some tasks may prioritize accuracy over richness, while others may require more detailed descriptions despite potential hallucinations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting controlled experiments to measure the impact of caption richness and accuracy on task performance would provide insights into the optimal balance. This could involve training models with captions of varying richness and accuracy and evaluating their performance on specific tasks.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How do hallucination-tolerant pre-training strategies affect the performance of multimodal LLMs on complex vision-language reasoning tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper suggests that MLLMs may benefit from detailed captions with minor hallucinations, as evidenced by the improved performance of the DSC+ pre-trained model on tasks like MMEC and LLaV AW.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explicitly investigate the impact of hallucination-tolerant pre-training on complex reasoning tasks. It is unclear whether this approach generalizes to other multimodal LLM architectures and reasoning benchmarks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Designing experiments to compare the performance of hallucination-tolerant and hallucination-averse pre-training strategies on complex reasoning tasks would provide insights into their relative effectiveness. This could involve training models with different pre-training approaches and evaluating their performance on benchmarks that require sophisticated vision-language understanding.

## Limitations
- The generalizability of caption format preferences across different model architectures remains uncertain
- The two-stage fine-tuning captioning pipeline requires significant computational resources
- The study focuses primarily on English-language datasets, raising questions about cross-lingual applicability

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The hybrid approach combining synthetic captions with AltText consistently outperforming synthetic captions alone. This finding is supported by extensive experiments across multiple model types and evaluation benchmarks, with clear performance improvements demonstrated.

**Medium Confidence**: The specific caption format preferences for different model types (CLIP preferring shorter captions, multimodal LLMs benefiting from more descriptive captions). While well-supported within the study's experimental framework, these preferences may vary with different model scales or architectural modifications.

**Low Confidence**: The tolerance of hallucinations in synthetic captions for multimodal LLM pre-training. The mechanism by which models distinguish accurate from hallucinated information during fine-tuning is not fully explained, and the long-term impact of caption hallucinations on model reliability remains unclear.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Modal Generalization Test**: Validate the hybrid approach's effectiveness on non-visual modalities (audio, text-to-text) to determine if the AltText + synthetic caption synergy extends beyond image-text pairs.

2. **Hallucination Impact Analysis**: Systematically measure the downstream effects of caption hallucinations by creating controlled datasets with varying hallucination severity levels and tracking model performance degradation patterns.

3. **Resource Efficiency Evaluation**: Compare the two-stage fine-tuning captioning pipeline against alternative approaches (prompt engineering, smaller fine-tuning datasets) to quantify the practical trade-offs between caption quality and computational cost.
