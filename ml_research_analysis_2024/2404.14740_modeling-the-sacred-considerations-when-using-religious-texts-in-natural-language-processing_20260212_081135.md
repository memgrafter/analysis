# Modeling the Sacred: Considerations when Using Religious Texts in Natural Language Processing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.14740
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14740
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: NLP research frequently uses religious texts without acknowledging their sacred significance, requiring ethical frameworks that account for cultural context and marginalized voices.

## Executive Summary
This position paper examines the ethical considerations when using religious texts in NLP, revealing that while these texts are frequently used for tasks like machine translation and dataset creation, their sacred and cultural significance is often overlooked. The paper presents empirical data showing thousands of NLP papers use religious texts, primarily the Bible and Quran, often without acknowledging their cultural significance. It argues that responsible NLP practice requires attention to researcher positionality, cultural contexts, and the perspectives of marginalized religious communities.

## Method Summary
The paper employs a mixed-methods approach combining empirical analysis of ACL Anthology papers containing "bible" or "koran" with case study analysis of specific NLP projects using religious texts. The empirical component involves systematic searches and manual review of 200 papers to categorize application domains and identify patterns of ethical consideration. The theoretical component develops ethical frameworks by applying various ethical theories to the domain of religious text usage in NLP, considering positionality, cultural contexts, and marginalized perspectives.

## Key Results
- Thousands of NLP papers use religious texts as data sources, with the Bible and Quran being the most common choices
- Descriptions of religious texts in NLP publications emphasize technical utility (availability, size, multilingual character) while rarely acknowledging their sacred nature
- Current AI ethics frameworks are insufficient for addressing the unique challenges of using religious texts in NLP applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The paper demonstrates that NLP research using religious texts lacks awareness of the cultural and religious significance of these texts, leading to ethical oversights. By conducting empirical analysis of ACL Anthology papers and revealing the frequency and context of religious text usage, the paper exposes a gap between the technical utility of these texts and their sacred or cultural dimensions.

### Mechanism 2
The paper argues that researcher positionality and cultural standpoint significantly influence ethical considerations when working with religious texts. By examining the relationship between researcher background and the cultural contexts of religious texts, the paper highlights how positionality affects understanding of potential harms.

### Mechanism 3
The paper identifies that current AI ethics frameworks are insufficient for addressing the unique challenges of using religious texts in NLP. By comparing standard AI principles against the specific context of religious texts, the paper shows how traditional ethical frameworks fail to capture religious and cultural nuances.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cultural relativism vs. universal ethics
  - Why needed here: The paper debates whether ethical considerations should be relative to cultural contexts or follow universal principles, which is central to how religious texts should be handled
  - Quick check question: Can ethical guidelines for NLP be truly universal when religious texts hold different meanings across cultures?

- Concept: Positionality in research methodology
  - Why needed here: The paper emphasizes researcher positionality as crucial for understanding the implications of using religious texts, requiring awareness of one's own cultural standpoint
  - Quick check question: How might a researcher's own religious background (or lack thereof) influence their approach to working with sacred texts?

- Concept: Indigenous data sovereignty principles
  - Why needed here: The paper connects religious text usage to broader concerns about Indigenous data rights and cultural intellectual property, which provides a framework for ethical handling
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes appropriate consultation with Indigenous communities from extractive research practices when using their languages?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Empirical data collection -> Identification of ethical gaps -> Theoretical framework development -> Practical recommendations
- Critical path: Empirical analysis provides foundation for all subsequent arguments, with case studies illustrating practical implementation challenges
- Design tradeoffs: Breadth across multiple traditions versus depth on any single religious tradition; focus on ACL data provides empirical grounding but may miss industry practices
- Failure signatures: Empirical data showing widespread ethical consideration; theoretical frameworks proving adequate; practical recommendations found irrelevant; weak empirical anchors or missing cultural perspectives
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate ACL Anthology search methodology with expanded search terms to verify frequency patterns
  2. Conduct structured interviews with NLP researchers who have used religious texts to assess ethical awareness
  3. Apply ethical framework to case study of specific NLP project using religious texts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What specific harms to religious communities result from NLP's use of sacred texts, and how can these be quantified or measured? The paper argues that NLP research may cause or be complicit with harms to religious communities but acknowledges that weighing benefits against ethical considerations is beyond the scope of the paper.

### Open Question 2
How effective are current researcher positionality statements in the ACL community at signaling researcher agendas and potential biases when working with religious texts? The paper recommends positionality statements but only observes their current rarity without examining whether existing examples serve this signaling function.

### Open Question 3
What are the most effective mechanisms for consulting with and obtaining consent from religious communities when creating datasets of sacred texts for NLP research? While the paper advocates for community consultation, it does not provide concrete guidance on what consultation methods work best or what forms of consent are most meaningful.

## Limitations

- Empirical analysis restricted to ACL Anthology papers, potentially missing industry practices and broader NLP community work
- Theoretical framework provides a sketch rather than comprehensive application of ethical theories to the domain
- Focus on frequency and patterns of usage rather than in-depth analysis of specific harm cases or community impacts

## Confidence

- High Confidence: Claims about frequency of religious text usage and general lack of ethical discussion are well-supported by empirical data
- Medium Confidence: Arguments about researcher positionality and cultural considerations are theoretically sound but need empirical validation
- Medium Confidence: Recommendations for ethical practice are practical but require testing in real-world projects

## Next Checks

1. Conduct systematic review of industry NLP papers and datasets to compare ethical considerations in academic versus commercial contexts
2. Interview 20+ NLP researchers who have used religious texts to assess their awareness of ethical considerations and positionality
3. Apply the paper's ethical framework to a case study of a specific NLP project using religious texts to test practical utility of recommendations
