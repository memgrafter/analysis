# ConvMixFormer- A Resource-efficient Convolution Mixer for Transformer-based Dynamic Hand Gesture Recognition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.07118
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07118
- Authors: Mallika Garg; Debashis Ghosh; Pyari Mohan Pradhan
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on NVGesture and Briareo datasets with approximately half the parameters of traditional transformers

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the computational inefficiency of transformers in dynamic hand gesture recognition by proposing ConvMixFormer, which replaces the computationally expensive self-attention mechanism with a simpler convolution-based token mixer. The proposed architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on NVGesture and Briareo datasets while using approximately 50% fewer parameters than traditional transformer models. The method also introduces a Gated Depthwise Feed Forward Network (GDFN) to control information flow within transformer stages, further improving parameter efficiency.

## Method Summary
ConvMixFormer is a transformer-based architecture that replaces self-attention with convolution layers as token mixers, reducing computational complexity from quadratic to linear. The model incorporates a Gated Depthwise Feed Forward Network (GDFN) instead of standard feed-forward networks, and uses late fusion for multimodal inputs. The architecture processes 40-frame video sequences through a ResNet-18 backbone for feature extraction, followed by 6 ConvMixFormer stages with convolution-based token mixing, average pooling, and linear classification.

## Key Results
- Achieves 80.83% accuracy on NVGesture dataset using depth images with only 13.57M parameters
- Reduces parameters by approximately 50% compared to traditional transformer baseline (24.30M parameters)
- Demonstrates improved performance with multimodal inputs, with depth and optical flow fusion achieving best results
- Sets new state-of-the-art performance on both NVGesture and Briareo benchmark datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Replacing self-attention with convolution reduces computational complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length
- Mechanism: Convolution layers process local spatial patterns with fixed kernel size, avoiding the O(n²) complexity of self-attention where every token attends to every other token
- Core assumption: Local spatial relationships in hand gestures are sufficient for recognition, and global dependencies can be captured through hierarchical processing
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "computational cost and the parameters used for the convolution-based mixer are comparatively less than the quadratic self-attention"
  - [section 3.2]: "The self-attention is computed using a scaled-dot product which has quadratic complexity that increases with long sequences"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus neighbors focus on gesture recognition but don't directly validate computational complexity claims
- Break condition: If hand gestures require long-range dependencies that cannot be captured through local convolutions, performance would degrade significantly

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Gated Depthwise Feed Forward Network (GDFN) improves feature selection and reduces parameters compared to standard FFN
- Mechanism: Depthwise convolutions process each channel independently, followed by gating mechanisms that control information flow, allowing selective feature activation
- Core assumption: Channel-wise processing with gating is more efficient than fully connected layers for capturing spatial patterns in gesture data
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "an efficient gate mechanism is employed instead of a conventional feed-forward network in the transformer to help the model control the flow of features"
  - [section 3.3]: "We follow [52], to incorporate depth-wise convolutions within the Gated mechanism to effectively encode and process information"
  - [section 4.4]: "BL2 explores the convolution mixer with the use of a gating mechanism in the feed-forward network"
- Break condition: If gating mechanism over-prunes important features or if depthwise convolutions cannot capture necessary cross-channel dependencies

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multimodal late fusion improves recognition accuracy by combining complementary information from different sensor modalities
- Mechanism: Independent processing of each modality followed by probability score fusion captures diverse aspects of gestures (appearance, depth, motion) that individual modalities might miss
- Core assumption: Different modalities provide complementary information that, when combined, improves overall recognition accuracy
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.4]: "The late fusion of the different modalities helps the model to capture the large and diverse aspect of the input data"
  - [section 4.3]: "From the table, we also conclude that the performance of the proposed model increases with the increase in the number of inputs"
  - [section 4.3]: "For two inputs, our model achieves the best accuracy when depth map output probabilities are fused with an optical flow output probability score"
- Break condition: If modalities are highly correlated or if fusion introduces noise that degrades performance

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Transformer architecture and self-attention mechanism
  - Why needed here: Understanding why self-attention is computationally expensive (quadratic complexity) is crucial to appreciate why convolution-based token mixing is beneficial
  - Quick check question: What is the computational complexity of self-attention in terms of sequence length n?

- Concept: Convolutional neural networks and their properties
  - Why needed here: Convolution layers are used as token mixers, so understanding their local receptive fields, parameter efficiency, and translation invariance is essential
  - Quick check question: How do convolutional layers achieve translation invariance, and why is this beneficial for gesture recognition?

- Concept: Multimodal learning and late fusion strategies
  - Why needed here: The model uses late fusion of probability scores from different modalities, requiring understanding of how complementary information from multiple sensors improves recognition
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between early fusion and late fusion in multimodal learning, and what are the trade-offs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input → ResNet-18 → ConvMixFormer (6 stages) → Average pooling → Linear classifier
- Critical path: Input → ResNet-18 → ConvMixFormer (6 stages) → Average pooling → Linear classifier
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Convolution vs self-attention: Lower complexity but potentially less global context
  - Gated Dconv vs standard FFN: Fewer parameters but risk of information loss
  - Multimodal fusion: Better accuracy but increased complexity and data requirements
  - Frame count (40): Balance between temporal information and computational cost
- Failure signatures:
  - High parameter count but poor performance: Check if convolution kernel sizes are appropriate
  - Low accuracy on depth images: Verify preprocessing pipeline for depth data
  - Poor multimodal fusion: Check if probability scores are properly normalized before fusion
  - Slow training: Profile convolution layers and gating mechanisms for bottlenecks
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate convolution token mixer: Replace convolution with identity mapping and compare performance
  2. Test gating mechanism: Remove GDFN and use standard FFN, measure parameter reduction and accuracy impact
  3. Single modality baseline: Run model on each input modality separately to establish individual performance before fusion

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does ConvMixFormer perform on other video-related tasks beyond dynamic hand gesture recognition, such as action recognition or video captioning?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the model achieves state-of-the-art results on NVGesture and Briareo datasets, but doesn't test on other video-related tasks
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses specifically on dynamic hand gesture recognition and doesn't explore the model's performance on other video understanding tasks
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results showing ConvMixFormer's performance on benchmark datasets for action recognition (e.g., Kinetics, UCF101) or video captioning (e.g., MSVD, MSR-VTT) compared to state-of-the-art methods

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal depth (number of stages) for ConvMixFormer on different datasets or input modalities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "our model consists of 6 transformer stages" but doesn't explore whether this is optimal
- Why unresolved: The paper uses a fixed 6-stage architecture without exploring whether fewer or more stages would be beneficial for different scenarios
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies showing performance variations with different numbers of ConvMixFormer stages across various datasets and input modalities

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does ConvMixFormer handle temporal information compared to temporal attention mechanisms or recurrent architectures?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper replaces self-attention with convolution but doesn't explicitly compare how well it captures temporal dependencies versus dedicated temporal mechanisms
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates effectiveness, it doesn't directly compare temporal feature extraction capabilities against models with explicit temporal attention or recurrent components
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies measuring temporal feature quality and performance against transformer models with temporal attention mechanisms or hybrid architectures combining ConvMixFormer with temporal modules

## Limitations

- The computational complexity reduction claims are based on theoretical analysis rather than empirical runtime measurements
- The model's generalization to other video-based recognition tasks beyond hand gestures remains unverified
- Late fusion effectiveness depends heavily on proper probability score normalization, which is not fully specified in the paper

## Confidence

- **High**: The overall parameter efficiency claim (~50% reduction vs traditional transformers) is well-supported by the comparative results in Table 1
- **Medium**: The state-of-the-art performance claims are convincing but based on limited dataset evaluation (NVGesture and Briareo only)
- **Low**: The theoretical complexity reduction arguments are reasonable but not empirically validated through runtime measurements

## Next Checks

1. **Runtime Complexity Validation**: Measure actual inference time and FLOPs for ConvMixFormer vs traditional transformer baseline on identical hardware to verify the claimed quadratic-to-linear complexity reduction

2. **Ablation Studies**: Systematically evaluate the contribution of each key component (convolution token mixer, GDFN, late fusion) through controlled experiments removing one component at a time

3. **Cross-Dataset Generalization**: Test ConvMixFormer on additional gesture recognition datasets (e.g., 20BN-JESTER, EgoGesture) and non-gesture video tasks to assess generalization beyond the reported datasets
