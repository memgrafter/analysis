# Explore-Go: Leveraging Exploration for Generalisation in Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.08069
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08069
- Reference count: 40
- Key result: Exploration phase at episode start increases state diversity and improves generalization to unseen environments.

## Executive Summary
Explore-Go is a novel approach to improve generalization in deep reinforcement learning by increasing the diversity of starting states during training. The method introduces a pure exploration phase at the beginning of each episode, followed by regular policy learning. This strategy aims to train agents on a wider range of states, reducing overfitting to spurious correlations and encouraging invariance to task-specific features. Experiments on a CMDP and the Procgen benchmark demonstrate that Explore-Go can improve generalization to unreachable tasks, particularly in environments with varying visual features.

## Method Summary
Explore-Go augments training data diversity by prepending an exploration phase to each episode. During this phase, the agent acts randomly for a set number of steps before transitioning to regular policy learning. This approach increases the variety of initial states the agent encounters, theoretically leading to better generalization by exposing the agent to a broader distribution of states. The method is compatible with existing RL algorithms like PPO and aims to train agents that are less sensitive to specific visual features and more robust to variations in task dynamics.

## Key Results
- CMDP experiments show Explore-Go enables generalization to unreachable tasks by increasing initial state diversity.
- Procgen benchmark results demonstrate improved performance in unseen environments, particularly those with varying visual features.
- The method is compatible with existing RL algorithms like PPO, suggesting broad applicability.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Explore-Go leverages the principle that increased state diversity during training leads to better generalization. By starting each episode with a random exploration phase, the agent encounters a wider range of states before engaging in goal-directed behavior. This approach encourages the agent to learn features and policies that are invariant to specific task details, potentially reducing overfitting to spurious correlations present in the training environments.

## Foundational Learning
- **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**: Understanding the basic framework for sequential decision-making problems in RL.
  - Why needed: Explore-Go modifies the standard MDP structure by adding an exploration phase.
  - Quick check: Can you explain the components of an MDP (states, actions, rewards, transitions)?
- **Generalization in RL**: The ability of an agent to perform well on tasks or environments not seen during training.
  - Why needed: Explore-Go specifically targets improved generalization as its primary goal.
  - Quick check: What are some common techniques used to improve generalization in RL?
- **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: The fundamental trade-off in RL between gathering new information and using known information.
  - Why needed: Explore-Go explicitly uses exploration to improve generalization, balancing it with exploitation.
  - Quick check: How does the exploration-exploitation trade-off typically manifest in RL algorithms?
- **Visual Feature Learning**: The ability of RL agents to learn from raw visual inputs and extract relevant features.
  - Why needed: Procgen experiments highlight the importance of visual generalization.
  - Quick check: What challenges arise when training RL agents on visual observations?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Random exploration phase -> Regular policy learning -> State-action-value updates
- **Critical Path**: Exploration phase generates diverse initial states -> Policy learning operates on varied state distribution -> Improved generalization to unseen environments
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Exploration duration vs. learning efficiency; state diversity vs. task-specific optimization
- **Failure Signatures**: Poor exploration strategy leads to insufficient state diversity; excessive exploration hinders learning; lack of generalization despite increased state diversity
- **First 3 Experiments**: 1) Implement Explore-Go on a simple gridworld task, 2) Compare performance with and without exploration phase on Procgen levels, 3) Ablation study varying exploration duration

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly stated in the provided information.

## Limitations
- Evidence for broader applicability beyond visual generalization tasks is limited.
- Lack of direct comparisons to other state-diversity methods makes it hard to isolate Explore-Go's unique contribution.
- Absence of ablation studies on exploration duration and frequency limits understanding of optimal deployment.

## Confidence
- Core mechanism effectiveness: Medium
- Generalization benefits: Medium
- Compatibility with PPO and similar algorithms: High

## Next Checks
1. Conduct head-to-head comparisons with alternative diversity-enhancement methods (e.g., random state resets, data augmentation) on Procgen.
2. Perform ablation studies to determine the optimal balance between exploration and exploitation phases.
3. Test Explore-Go on a broader set of RL environments with varying reward and dynamics distributions to assess robustness beyond visual generalization.
