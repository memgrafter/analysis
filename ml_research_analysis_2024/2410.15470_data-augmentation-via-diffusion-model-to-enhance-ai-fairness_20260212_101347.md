# Data Augmentation via Diffusion Model to Enhance AI Fairness

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.15470
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15470
- Reference count: 33
- This paper investigates using diffusion models for data augmentation to improve AI fairness in binary classification tasks

## Executive Summary
This study explores using Tab-DDPM, a diffusion model for tabular data, to generate synthetic samples that enhance AI fairness in binary classification tasks. The approach combines synthetic data generation with sample reweighting techniques from AIF360 to reduce bias across protected attributes (Race and Sex) in the Adult Income dataset. Five traditional ML models (Decision Trees, Gaussian Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest) are evaluated using five fairness metrics. The results demonstrate that while synthetic data generation alone does not effectively reduce bias, combining it with sample reweighting significantly improves fairness across all models while maintaining reasonable classification performance.

## Method Summary
The method employs Tab-DDPM to generate synthetic tabular data at three different volumes (20K, 100K, and 150K samples), which is combined with original training data. Sample reweighting from AIF360 is then applied to adjust the relative importance of samples across protected groups. Five traditional ML models are trained on the augmented and reweighted datasets, and evaluated using five fairness metrics (Statistical Parity Difference, Average Odds Difference, Disparate Impact, Equal Opportunity Difference, and Theil Index) along with balanced accuracy. The approach targets bias mitigation in binary classification tasks while preserving model performance.

## Key Results
- Synthetic data generation alone does not effectively reduce bias across fairness metrics
- Combining synthetic data with sample reweighting significantly improves fairness across all ML models
- Larger synthetic datasets (150K samples) show the most improvement in fairness metrics while maintaining classification performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Tab-DDPM's multimodal diffusion structure enables synthetic tabular data generation that preserves statistical properties while enabling bias-aware augmentation. Tab-DDPM uses separate Gaussian diffusion for numerical features and multinomial diffusion for categorical/binary features, processing them through distinct branches before merging via a multilayer perceptron. This separation allows accurate modeling of mixed data types while maintaining distributional fidelity.

### Mechanism 2
Sample reweighting from AIF360 recalibrates training data distributions to reduce disparate outcomes across protected groups without altering original labels. The reweighting algorithm calculates weights for four categories (privileged/positive, privileged/negative, unprivileged/positive, unprivileged/negative) based on frequency counts, then adjusts sample weights to promote uniform distribution across groups.

### Mechanism 3
Combining synthetic data generation with sample reweighting creates a synergistic effect that improves fairness metrics more effectively than either technique alone. Synthetic data increases sample diversity and quantity, while reweighting adjusts the relative importance of samples to balance protected group representation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Diffusion models and their reverse-time sampling process**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how Tab-DDPM generates synthetic data through iterative noise removal is crucial for evaluating synthetic data quality and its impact on fairness
  - Quick check question: What are the three main components of the DDPM process, and how do they work together to generate new data?

- **Concept: Fairness metrics (SPD, AOD, DI, EOD, TI) and their interpretation**
  - Why needed here: The paper uses multiple fairness metrics to evaluate bias mitigation, requiring understanding of what each metric measures and acceptable ranges
  - Quick check question: What is the ideal value for Disparate Impact (DI), and what does a value below 0.8 indicate about model bias?

- **Concept: Sample reweighting as a preprocessing fairness technique**
  - Why needed here: The reweighting mechanism is central to the paper's approach, requiring understanding of how frequency-based weighting works to mitigate bias
  - Quick check question: How does the reweighting algorithm calculate weights for the four sample categories, and what frequency counts does it use?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data preprocessing pipeline (quantile transformation, one-hot encoding) -> Tab-DDPM model (Gaussian diffusion branch + multinomial diffusion branch + MLP merger) -> Sample generation module -> AIF360 reweighting module -> ML model training pipeline -> Evaluation framework

- **Critical path:** Data → Tab-DDPM generation → Data augmentation → AIF360 reweighting → ML training → Evaluation

- **Design tradeoffs:** Larger synthetic datasets improve fairness but may introduce distributional drift; aggressive reweighting can improve fairness but may hurt classification performance; separate processing of numerical vs categorical features simplifies implementation but may miss cross-feature interactions

- **Failure signatures:** Fairness metrics worsen when synthetic data quantity increases (indicates quality degradation); classification performance drops significantly after reweighting (indicates over-correction); synthetic data distributions diverge markedly from original (indicates generation failure)

- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Generate 20K synthetic samples and compare original vs synthetic attribute distributions to verify generation quality; 2) Apply reweighting to original data only (no synthetic augmentation) to establish baseline effectiveness; 3) Test different classification thresholds on augmented/reweighted data to find optimal fairness-performance tradeoff

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different diffusion model architectures (beyond Tab-DDPM) affect the quality and fairness of generated synthetic tabular data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper specifically uses Tab-DDPM but mentions diffusion models broadly as a powerful technique for generating synthetic data
- Why unresolved: The study focuses exclusively on Tab-DDPM without comparing alternative diffusion model architectures for tabular data
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments testing multiple diffusion model architectures on the same tabular datasets with fairness metrics

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal amount of synthetic data augmentation for balancing fairness improvements with classification performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The study tests 20K, 100K, and 150K synthetic samples but finds that larger amounts improve fairness while potentially reducing classification accuracy
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies a trade-off but doesn't determine the optimal balance point or explore intermediate sample sizes
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments testing additional synthetic data increments with both fairness and accuracy metrics

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does sample reweighting interact with other bias mitigation techniques beyond data augmentation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper combines reweighting with diffusion-generated data but doesn't explore combinations with other preprocessing, in-processing, or post-processing fairness techniques
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on one specific combination without testing how reweighting performs with alternative bias mitigation approaches
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing reweighting effectiveness across different bias mitigation pipelines and techniques

## Limitations
- Limited to a single dataset (Adult Income) and five traditional ML models, reducing generalizability
- No ablation studies to isolate individual contributions of synthetic data generation versus sample reweighting
- No statistical significance testing on fairness metric improvements across different synthetic data volumes

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: That Tab-DDPM can generate synthetic tabular data and that sample reweighting from AIF360 can be applied to training data
- **Medium confidence**: That the combination of Tab-DDPM generation + sample reweighting improves fairness metrics more effectively than either technique alone
- **Medium confidence**: That larger synthetic datasets (150K samples) show the most improvement in fairness metrics

## Next Checks
1. Conduct statistical significance testing (paired t-tests or bootstrap confidence intervals) to verify that fairness improvements at 150K synthetic samples are significantly better than at 20K or 100K samples
2. Perform ablation studies by testing Tab-DDPM generation alone, sample reweighting alone, and the combination on additional datasets beyond Adult Income
3. Measure and report computational costs (training time, memory usage) for the Tab-DDPM generation process across different synthetic data volumes to assess scalability
