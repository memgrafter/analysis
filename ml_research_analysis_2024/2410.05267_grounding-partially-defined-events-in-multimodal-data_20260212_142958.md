# Grounding Partially-Defined Events in Multimodal Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.05267
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05267
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces MultiVENT-G, a new multimodal dataset for understanding partially-defined events in video and text.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MultiVENT-G, a new multimodal dataset for understanding partially-defined events in video and text. The dataset includes 14.5 hours of densely annotated videos and 1,168 text documents, totaling 22.8K event-related entities. The authors formulate event understanding as a three-stage retrieval task: extracting relevant text spans, temporal video segments, and spatial bounding boxes. They evaluate several LLM and VLM-based approaches, showing strong performance on text retrieval (up to 67.2% F1) and promising results on temporal and spatial tasks. The work advances event-centric video-language understanding and provides a benchmark for future research in multimodal event extraction.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce MultiVENT-G, a multimodal dataset for event understanding, and formulate the task as a three-stage retrieval problem: text span extraction from documents, temporal grounding of video segments, and spatial grounding of bounding boxes. They evaluate LLM and VLM-based approaches including GPT-3.5/4o, LLaMA 2, TimeChat-based video models, InternVL, LLaVA, Grounding-DINO, and GLIP on this task. The dataset contains 14.5 hours of videos, 1,168 text documents, and 22.8K event-centric entities, with annotations for text spans, temporal segments, and spatial bounding boxes across 31 event templates.

## Key Results
- Strong performance on text retrieval with up to 67.2% F1 using LLM approaches
- Temporal grounding shows moderate performance with 39.5% IoU at 0.7 threshold
- Spatial retrieval achieves 45.2% IoU with confidence-weighted metrics
- Three-stage retrieval formulation enables tractable decomposition of the complex event understanding task

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The three-stage span retrieval formulation enables tractable decomposition of the partially-defined event extraction task
- Mechanism: By decomposing event understanding into discrete text, temporal, and spatial span retrieval stages, the system avoids the need to directly model the complete event structure from fragmented multimodal inputs. Each stage can be optimized independently before integration
- Core assumption: Partial observations of events can be meaningfully represented as disjoint spans across different modalities
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We cast the extraction of these events as a three-stage span retrieval task"
  - [section]: "we explicitly decompose the event understanding task into three distinct stages"
- Break condition: If event understanding requires holistic multimodal reasoning that cannot be decomposed into independent stages

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: LLM-driven approaches can generalize to the partially-defined event extraction task despite domain shift
- Mechanism: Large language models trained on diverse web data can leverage their understanding of event structures and temporal-spatial reasoning to adapt to the specific requirements of the three-stage retrieval task, even when fine-tuned on limited data
- Core assumption: LLMs possess sufficient general knowledge about event structures and temporal-spatial relationships to handle the domain shift
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We propose a collection of LLM-driven approaches to the task of multimodal event analysis"
  - [section]: "We propose a collection of approaches that leverage the generalizability and high-level reasoning abilities of LLMs and VLMs"
- Break condition: If the domain shift between general web data and news event videos is too large for effective transfer

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The confidence scoring mechanism for spatial annotations improves annotation quality by explicitly handling visual ambiguity
- Mechanism: By requiring annotators to rate their confidence that bounded entities help answer template questions, the dataset captures uncertainty information that allows downstream models to better handle ambiguous visual content
- Core assumption: Human confidence judgments provide meaningful quantification of visual ambiguity that can be leveraged by models
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "We include this confidence score because visual content is often ambiguous, and work suggests that human confidence scores are often a sound method for quantifying the clarity of such data"
- Break condition: If human confidence judgments are not consistent or reliable enough to be useful for model training

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Event template structure
  - Why needed here: The task relies on pre-specified event templates to guide annotation and retrieval. Understanding how templates define event roles and questions is fundamental to the approach
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between the template structures for disasters versus elections?

- Concept: Multimodal span representation
  - Why needed here: The task involves representing spans across text (character offsets), temporal (seconds), and spatial (pixel coordinates) modalities. Understanding how to normalize and compare these different representations is crucial
  - Quick check question: How would you compute overlap between a text span and a temporal span for evaluation purposes?

- Concept: Cross-modal alignment
  - Why needed here: The task requires linking information across text descriptions, video segments, and spatial regions. Understanding how to align information across these modalities is essential for the three-stage retrieval approach
  - Quick check question: How would you determine which spatial annotations correspond to which temporal segments?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data pipeline: Video/text loading → template application → annotation interface
  - Text stage: LLM/VLM → span extraction → template field mapping
  - Temporal stage: Video encoder → temporal grounding → start/end extraction
  - Spatial stage: Frame selection → object detection → bounding box generation
  - Evaluation: Span matching → metric computation → result aggregation

- Critical path: Annotation → Model training → Evaluation → Analysis
  - Annotation must complete before model training can begin
  - Model training must complete before evaluation can proceed
  - Evaluation results inform analysis and potential model improvements

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Span vs. full entity extraction: The span-based approach is more granular but requires more complex alignment
  - Confidence vs. precision: Including lower-confidence annotations provides more data but may introduce noise
  - Modality independence vs. integration: Processing stages independently is simpler but may miss cross-modal dependencies

- Failure signatures:
  - Low precision in text stage: LLM not understanding template questions or event context
  - Temporal misalignment: Video grounding models not handling long-form content well
  - Spatial annotation sparsity: Bounding box models missing relevant entities or drawing incorrect boxes

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline text-only retrieval: Evaluate LLM performance on text span extraction without temporal/spatial components
  2. Temporal grounding ablations: Compare different video models (TC vs TC-c vs TC-vg) on temporal retrieval
  3. Spatial detection comparison: Evaluate different VLM/captioning combinations (InternVL vs LLaVA with different grounding models)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we develop a comprehensive end-to-end system that simultaneously addresses all three stages of the event extraction task (text, temporal, and spatial retrieval) in tandem?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state in the conclusion that they hope to develop comprehensive systems that can address each stage of the event extraction task in tandem, allowing the outputs for each stage to be conditioned on the intermediate states and outputs of the other two stages.
- Why unresolved: The experiments were conducted independently due to the complexity and general difficulty of the task. Developing an integrated system that can handle all three stages simultaneously while maintaining performance is a significant challenge.
- What evidence would resolve it: A working prototype or proof-of-concept system that demonstrates improved performance over the individual stage approaches, with quantitative results showing the benefits of the integrated approach.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can multilingual OCR systems be incorporated into the event extraction pipeline to improve performance, especially for videos not taken in predominantly English-speaking countries?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention in the conclusion that incorporating multilingual OCR systems into their pipeline would improve performance, especially for videos not taken in predominantly English-speaking countries.
- Why unresolved: The current experiments only evaluated PaddleOCR and EasyOCR, which may not be optimal for all languages represented in the dataset. Developing or fine-tuning OCR systems for each language could significantly improve performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative results showing the performance improvement of the event extraction pipeline when using multilingual OCR systems versus the current OCR approaches, with particular focus on non-English videos.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can temporal modeling methods be improved to better handle abstract visual content and OCR information, particularly in science and technology news videos?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors note in the supplementary temporal evaluations that science and technology news videos tend to involve highly abstract visual content paired with OCR information, and that more investigation into incorporating OCR into temporal modeling methods may provide further insight.
- Why unresolved: The current temporal retrieval models, even when fine-tuned on additional temporal video grounding data, struggle with the broader event spectrum in MultiVENT-G, especially for non-human-centric and out-of-distribution content.
- What evidence would resolve it: Improved temporal retrieval results on the science and technology news videos in MultiVENT-G, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating OCR information and handling abstract visual content, with quantitative metrics showing performance gains over the current approaches.

## Limitations

- The three-stage retrieval formulation may not capture complex events requiring holistic multimodal reasoning
- Domain shift between general web data and news event content may limit LLM effectiveness
- Confidence scoring mechanism adds complexity without fully characterizing its impact on model performance

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The dataset creation methodology and annotation process are well-documented with clear task specifications
- **Medium Confidence**: The three-stage retrieval formulation and evaluation metrics are sound, though their effectiveness for complex event understanding remains to be validated
- **Medium Confidence**: The reported performance numbers are plausible given the evaluation setup, but detailed experimental configurations are not fully specified

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies removing the confidence scoring mechanism to quantify its impact on spatial retrieval performance and annotation quality
2. Test the three-stage retrieval approach on events requiring significant cross-modal reasoning to identify decomposition failure modes
3. Replicate the text-only retrieval baseline using publicly available LLMs with the provided template questions to verify the zero-shot/few-shot performance claims
