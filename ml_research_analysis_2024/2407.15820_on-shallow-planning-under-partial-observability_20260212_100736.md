# On shallow planning under partial observability
## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15820
- Reference count: 27
- Introduces a new bound on planning loss under partial observability by linking MDP structural parameters to bias-variance trade-off.

## Executive Summary
This work introduces a novel bound on the planning loss under partial observability by explicitly connecting structural parameters of the Markov Decision Process to the bias-variance trade-off. The authors extend prior work on the bias bound by incorporating planning horizon-sensitive action variation, and introduce a novel variance bound using empirical action variation. These extensions yield a tighter bound on the planning loss, especially when the model approximation error is low. Experiments with both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that shorter planning horizons can be beneficial under partial observability, supporting the theoretical findings.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a new bound on the planning loss under partial observability by connecting structural parameters of the MDP to the bias-variance trade-off. They extend the bias bound from prior work by incorporating planning horizon-sensitive action variation, and introduce a variance bound using empirical action variation. The method involves analyzing the effect of planning horizon on the bias and variance of the value function estimates under partial observability, leading to a tighter overall bound on the planning loss.

## Key Results
- Shorter planning horizons can be beneficial under partial observability.
- The new bound on planning loss is tighter, especially when model approximation error is low.
- Empirical action variation is used to bound the variance of value function estimates.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The proposed method works by explicitly connecting the structural parameters of the MDP to the bias-variance trade-off under partial observability. By incorporating planning horizon-sensitive action variation into the bias bound and using empirical action variation for the variance bound, the authors achieve a tighter overall bound on the planning loss. This approach allows for better understanding and control of the trade-off between bias and variance when planning under partial observability.

## Foundational Learning
- Markov Decision Processes (MDPs): why needed: fundamental framework for modeling sequential decision-making problems; quick check: can you define the MDP tuple (S, A, P, R, γ)?
- Partial Observability: why needed: many real-world problems involve incomplete or noisy observations; quick check: what is the difference between an MDP and a POMDP?
- Bias-Variance Trade-off: why needed: crucial for understanding the quality of value function estimates; quick check: can you explain the bias-variance decomposition of mean squared error?

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: MDP model -> Value function approximator -> Planning algorithm -> Action selection
Critical path: MDP model -> Value function approximator -> Planning algorithm
Design tradeoffs: Planning horizon vs. computational complexity, bias vs. variance in value function estimates
Failure signatures: High bias when planning horizon is too short, high variance when model approximation error is large
First experiments:
1. Test the bounds on a simple grid-world environment with partial observability
2. Evaluate the effect of varying the planning horizon on the bias and variance of value function estimates
3. Compare the performance of the proposed method with standard planning algorithms under partial observability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The theoretical bounds rely on several structural assumptions about the MDP.
- The generalizability of the bounds to arbitrary POMDPs remains an open question.
- The tightness and applicability of the variance bound in high-dimensional or continuous action spaces require further investigation.

## Confidence
High for the bias bound extension and medium for the variance bound and overall planning loss bound.

## Next Checks
1. Test the bounds on continuous control tasks with partial observability
2. Evaluate the variance bound under varying amounts of noise in observations
3. Compare performance when using learned versus known models for action variation estimation
