## Executive Summary
This study presents a probabilistic framework for analyzing patient-reported experiences from online healthcare reviews. The approach combines metadata network topic modeling with a naive Bayes classifier to predict multilabel emotions and binary sentiment from free-text narratives. The method achieves high performance while maintaining interpretability, with the topic modeling component reducing overfitting by aggregating sparse word-emotion interactions into higher-level themes. The model outperforms standard sentiment lexicons and provides a transparent, probabilistic way to understand the emotional landscape of patient feedback.

## Method Summary
The method uses metadata network topic modeling to identify 105 themes in patient narratives, then employs these topics as predictors in a naive Bayes classifier to predict emotions and sentiment. Text preprocessing includes normalization, stop word removal, and filtering rare words. The model treats topics as probabilistic features representing document content, with the naive Bayes framework assuming class-conditional independence of topics. Sentiment is derived by marginalizing the emotion posterior distribution. The approach is implemented as an R package and interactive dashboard for healthcare research applications.

## Key Results
- Achieved F1 score of 0.921 for binary sentiment classification, significantly outperforming standard sentiment lexicons
- Topic modeling reduces overfitting by aggregating sparse word-emotion interactions into higher-level themes
- Model provides interpretable, transparent predictions through probabilistic naive Bayes framework
- Available as open-source R package and interactive dashboard for healthcare research

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Topic modeling reduces overfitting by aggregating sparse word-emotion interactions into higher-level themes.
- Mechanism: The high-dimensional vocabulary space is mapped to a low-dimensional topic space, which groups contextually similar words into meaningful themes. This aggregation pools information from related words, reducing the number of parameters and preventing the model from fitting noise in individual word-emotion pairs.
- Core assumption: The thematic structure of patient narratives is more stable and generalizable than individual word occurrences.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Topic modeling reduces overfitting and improves interpretability by capturing general relationships between patient experiences and emotions."
  - [section]: "By summarising the documents in this manner, we obtain an insightful representation of the data that would otherwise be unnecessarily specific and
