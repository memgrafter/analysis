# How do Multimodal Foundation Models Encode Text and Speech? An Analysis of Cross-Lingual and Cross-Modal Representations

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2411.17666
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17666
- **Reference count**: 27
- **Key outcome**: This paper analyzes cross-lingual and cross-modal representations in three multimodal foundation models (SeamlessM4T, SONAR, and SALMONN) using SVCCA similarity scores on semantically equivalent sentences across 30 languages and speech/text modalities.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates how multimodal foundation models encode text and speech across different languages, focusing on cross-lingual and cross-modal representation similarities. The authors analyze three prominent models—SeamlessM4T, SONAR, and SALMONN—using Singular Vector Canonical Correlation Analysis (SVCCA) to measure representational similarity across 30 languages and both modalities. Their findings reveal that cross-modal representations converge over model layers after initial specialization, with length adaptation mechanisms primarily effective for high-resource languages. The study also demonstrates that speech exhibits larger cross-lingual differences than text, and that for models not explicitly trained for modality-agnostic representations, the modality gap is more prominent than the language gap.

## Method Summary
The authors employ SVCCA similarity scores to analyze cross-lingual and cross-modal representations in three multimodal foundation models. They use semantically equivalent sentences across 30 languages and both speech and text modalities as inputs. The analysis tracks representational similarity across model layers, examining how representations evolve from modality-specific to more generalized forms. The study compares models with different training objectives regarding cross-modal and cross-lingual generalization, and evaluates the effectiveness of length adaptation mechanisms across resource levels.

## Key Results
- Cross-modal representations converge over model layers after initial specialization
- Speech exhibits larger cross-lingual differences than text representations
- Length adaptation mechanisms are primarily effective for high-resource languages
- For models not explicitly trained for modality-agnostic representations, the modality gap is more prominent than the language gap

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The analysis reveals that multimodal foundation models initially encode text and speech in modality-specific ways, but representations gradually converge toward more generalized forms as information flows through deeper layers. This convergence occurs because higher layers must produce outputs that work across both translation and transcription tasks, forcing the model to find modality-agnostic representations. The effectiveness of length adaptation mechanisms for high-resource languages suggests that models leverage abundant training data to develop robust strategies for handling variable-length inputs, while struggling with this adaptation for low-resource languages due to insufficient training examples.

## Foundational Learning

**Cross-modal representation analysis**: Understanding how different input modalities (text vs speech) are encoded in neural networks is crucial for developing models that can seamlessly translate between modalities. Quick check: Verify that SVCCA scores between text and speech representations increase across layers.

**Cross-lingual generalization**: Models must learn to handle linguistic variations across languages while maintaining semantic consistency. Quick check: Compare SVCCA scores across languages within each modality to identify patterns of cross-lingual similarity.

**Length adaptation mechanisms**: Models need strategies to handle variable-length inputs, particularly important for speech processing where duration varies significantly. Quick check: Measure representation stability across different input lengths for each language resource level.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Text/Speech Input -> Modality-specific Encoders -> Shared Representations -> Cross-modal Decoder -> Output

**Critical path**: Input encoding → Layer-wise representation evolution → Cross-modal convergence → Output generation

**Design tradeoffs**: Models must balance between modality-specific specialization (which may capture modality nuances) and modality-agnostic generalization (which enables seamless translation). Training objectives that explicitly encourage cross-modal similarity can reduce the modality gap but may sacrifice some modality-specific performance.

**Failure signatures**: Large modality gaps in early layers indicate insufficient cross-modal training, while persistent language-specific clusters suggest inadequate cross-lingual generalization. Poor length adaptation manifests as unstable representations for variable-length inputs.

**First experiments**:
1. Compare SVCCA scores between text and speech representations across all layers
2. Analyze representation similarity patterns across different language families
3. Test model performance on code-switching inputs to probe cross-lingual robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Analysis limited to three multimodal models, constraining generalizability
- Focuses on sentence-level representations without examining longer discourse structures
- Uses a fixed set of 30 languages, potentially missing behaviors in underrepresented language families
- SVCCA scores may oversimplify complex neural representation dynamics

## Confidence

**Major Claim Confidence:**
- Cross-modal convergence over layers: High confidence
- Speech vs text cross-lingual differences: Medium confidence
- Modality gap prominence over language gap: Medium confidence
- Length adaptation effectiveness for high-resource languages: Medium confidence

**Major Uncertainties:**
- Potential confounding factors from model size and training data differences
- Interpretation of SVCCA scores as definitive measures of representational similarity
- Limited model diversity may not capture the full landscape of multimodal architectures

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the SVCCA analysis using additional similarity metrics (e.g., CKA, PWCCA) to verify that findings are not artifacts of a single similarity measure
2. Conduct controlled experiments varying input length systematically across all resource levels to isolate length adaptation mechanisms from other confounding factors
3. Test model behaviors on languages from underrepresented families in the current 30-language sample to assess generalizability of cross-lingual findings
