# SUDS: A Strategy for Unsupervised Drift Sampling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.02995
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02995
- Reference count: 32
- Key outcome: SUDS reduces labeled data needs by 80% while maintaining performance on real-world concept drift problems

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SUDS (Strategy for Unsupervised Drift Sampling), a method that piggybacks on existing unsupervised drift detection algorithms to select homogeneous training samples for model retraining. By leveraging the drift detection model itself to identify and reject out-of-distribution samples, SUDS maintains model performance while significantly reducing the amount of labeled data required. The authors also introduce HADAM (Harmonized Annotated Data Accuracy Metric) to evaluate the trade-off between model performance and annotation costs. Experiments show SUDS outperforms existing methods in real-world datasets, requiring only 20% of labeled data while maintaining comparable or better performance.

## Method Summary
SUDS works by modifying existing drift detection algorithms (D3 and OCDD) to select homogeneous samples from detected drift windows for retraining. The method trains a classifier on both old and new data windows, then selects samples with the highest confidence scores for the new distribution. HADAM, a harmonic mean of performance and inverse annotation cost, is used to evaluate the trade-off between model accuracy and labeled data requirements. The approach assumes that homogeneous training data improves drift detection and model performance.

## Key Results
- SUDS reduces labeled data requirements by approximately 80% compared to baseline methods
- The method outperforms existing approaches in 11 of 19 tested datasets
- SUDS shows particular effectiveness on real-world datasets with gradual drifts
- HADAM successfully balances performance with annotation cost considerations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: SUDS piggybacks on drift detection models to identify and reject out-of-distribution samples for homogeneous retraining.
- Mechanism: SUDS uses the existing drift detection model as a classifier to predict confidence scores for incoming data. Samples with high confidence in the newer class are retained for retraining, while low-confidence samples (outliers) are rejected. This ensures the training set remains homogeneous and aligned with the newer data distribution.
- Core assumption: The drift detection model can reliably distinguish between the current and newer distributions, and most data in the newer distribution belongs to the new class.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "SUDS (Strategy for Unsupervised Drift Sampling), piggybacks on existing unsupervised drift detection algorithms to select homogeneous data points for retraining."
  - [section III] "Our method works by selecting a window around the point of detected drift occurrence and use a classifier to identify the data points that only belong to the newer distribution."
- Break condition: If the drift detection model cannot reliably distinguish between distributions (e.g., in abrupt drifts), SUDS performance degrades significantly.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: HADAM balances model performance with the cost of acquiring labeled data by incorporating the percentage of unannotated samples into the evaluation metric.
- Mechanism: HADAM is defined as a harmonic mean of the performance metric (e.g., accuracy) and the inverse of the fraction of unannotated samples. This ensures that models requiring less labeled data are favored, even if their raw performance is slightly lower.
- Core assumption: In real-world applications, the cost of acquiring labeled data is a significant factor, and balancing performance with labeling effort is crucial.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "HADAM provides a metric that balances classifier performance with the amount of labeled data, ensuring efficient resource utilization."
  - [section III-C] "We propose the metric as a harmonic mean based on the Pythagorean means of the performance metric (e.g. Accuracy) and the amount of unannotated samples in the dataset."
- Break condition: If the dataset is already fully labeled, HADAM reduces to the raw performance metric, losing its unique advantage.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: SUDS outperforms existing methods in real-world datasets by requiring only 20% of the labeled data while maintaining comparable or better performance.
- Mechanism: SUDS modifies existing drift detection algorithms (D3 and OCDD) to select homogeneous samples for retraining. This reduces the need for extensive labeled data while improving model adaptability to evolving distributions.
- Core assumption: Real-world datasets exhibit gradual drifts, allowing SUDS to effectively select homogeneous samples for retraining.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Experiments show that SUDS, when applied to D3 and OCDD algorithms, significantly reduces the amount of annotated data needed for retraining (by approximately 80%) while maintaining comparable or better performance."
  - [section IV] "Our modifications outperform existing methods in eleven of nineteen datasets."
- Break condition: In datasets with abrupt drifts or no noise, SUDS performance may degrade, as the method relies on gradual drift characteristics.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Concept Drift
  - Why needed here: Understanding concept drift is essential to grasp why SUDS and HADAM are necessary. Concept drift refers to changes in the data distribution over time, which degrades model performance and necessitates retraining.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between gradual and abrupt concept drift, and why does SUDS perform better on gradual drifts?

- Concept: Unsupervised Drift Detection
  - Why needed here: SUDS builds on unsupervised drift detection algorithms, so understanding how these algorithms work is crucial for implementing and modifying them.
  - Quick check question: How do unsupervised drift detection algorithms like D3 and OCDD identify changes in data distribution without labeled data?

- Concept: Harmonic Mean
  - Why needed here: HADAM uses the harmonic mean to balance performance and the amount of labeled data. Understanding this mathematical concept is necessary to implement and interpret the metric.
  - Quick check question: Why is the harmonic mean used in HADAM instead of the arithmetic mean, and how does it affect the evaluation of models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Drift Detection Model -> SUDS Module -> Retraining Pipeline -> HADAM Evaluator

- Critical path:
  1. Detect drift using the existing drift detection model
  2. Apply SUDS to select homogeneous samples from the detected drift window
  3. Retrain the model using the selected samples
  4. Evaluate performance using HADAM

- Design tradeoffs:
  - SUDS trades off some raw performance for reduced labeled data requirements, which is beneficial in real-world scenarios where labeling is expensive
  - HADAM introduces a new evaluation metric that may not be directly comparable to traditional accuracy metrics

- Failure signatures:
  - SUDS may fail in datasets with abrupt drifts or no noise, as the method relies on gradual drift characteristics
  - HADAM may not provide meaningful insights if the dataset is already fully labeled

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement SUDS on a simple drift detection algorithm (e.g., DDM) and evaluate its performance on a synthetic dataset with gradual drift
  2. Compare the labeled data requirements of SUDS with the original algorithm on a real-world dataset
  3. Calculate HADAM for both SUDS and the original algorithm to assess the trade-off between performance and labeled data requirements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does SUDS performance vary across different types of concept drift (e.g., gradual vs. abrupt, recurring vs. non-recurring) in real-world datasets beyond the ones tested?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that SUDS performs well with gradual drifts and real-world datasets but struggles with abrupt drifts in artificial datasets. They suggest that in real-world scenarios, gradual drifts are more common.
- Why unresolved: The paper's experiments are limited to specific datasets, and the behavior of SUDS across a broader range of drift types in real-world settings remains unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing SUDS on a diverse set of real-world datasets with varying drift characteristics (e.g., abrupt, gradual, recurring) and comparing its performance to existing methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can SUDS be extended to handle multi-class or multi-label drift detection scenarios, and how would its performance compare to existing multi-class/multi-label drift detection methods?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on binary classification drift detection using D3 and OCDD, which are designed for binary cases. The authors do not discuss multi-class or multi-label extensions.
- Why unresolved: The current implementation of SUDS is tailored to binary drift detection, and its applicability to more complex classification scenarios is not explored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Adapting SUDS to multi-class or multi-label drift detection and evaluating its performance on datasets with multiple classes or labels.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How sensitive is SUDS to the choice of hyperparameters, and what is the optimal strategy for hyperparameter tuning in dynamic environments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors conduct a hyperparameter search for D3 and OCDD, showing that SUDS performs better with certain parameter settings. However, they do not provide a comprehensive strategy for hyperparameter tuning.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the impact of hyperparameter tuning on SUDS performance in depth, nor does it propose a systematic approach for tuning in dynamic environments.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing a robust hyperparameter tuning strategy for SUDS and validating its effectiveness across different datasets and drift scenarios.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does the HADAM metric compare to other existing metrics in terms of capturing the trade-off between model performance and annotation costs in real-world applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors introduce HADAM as a novel metric that balances model performance with annotation costs, but they do not compare it to other existing metrics.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comparative analysis of HADAM against other metrics used in drift detection or machine learning evaluation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparing HADAM to established metrics (e.g., F1-score, AUC) in terms of their ability to capture the trade-off between performance and annotation costs in various real-world applications.

## Limitations
- SUDS performance degrades significantly on artificial datasets with abrupt drifts
- The method requires a reliable drift detection model as its foundation
- HADAM introduces a new evaluation metric that may not be widely adopted
- Effectiveness depends on the assumption that homogeneous training data improves detection

## Confidence
- SUDS performance claims on real-world datasets: **High** - well-supported by experimental results across 11 of 19 datasets
- 80% reduction in labeled data claim: **High** - consistently demonstrated across multiple datasets
- Effectiveness on artificial datasets: **Low** - method struggles with abrupt drifts and no-noise scenarios
- HADAM metric validity: **Medium** - theoretically sound but requires broader adoption to validate practical utility

## Next Checks
1. Test SUDS on additional datasets with abrupt concept drift to quantify the performance degradation and identify breaking points
2. Compare HADAM against traditional accuracy metrics on fully labeled datasets to validate its practical utility
3. Implement a cross-validation study to assess SUDS's robustness to hyperparameter variations across different dataset characteristics
