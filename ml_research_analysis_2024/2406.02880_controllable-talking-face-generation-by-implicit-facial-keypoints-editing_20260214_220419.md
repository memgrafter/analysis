# Controllable Talking Face Generation by Implicit Facial Keypoints Editing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.02880
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02880
- Authors: Dong Zhao; Jiaying Shi; Wenjun Li; Shudong Wang; Shenghui Xu; Zhaoming Pan
- Reference count: 39
- Key outcome: ControlTalk achieves precise and naturalistic lip synchronization while enabling quantitative control over mouth opening shape, outperforming state-of-the-art on HDTF and MEAD benchmarks.

## Executive Summary
ControlTalk is a talking face generation method that controls face expression deformation based on driven audio. The method can construct the head pose and facial expression including lip motion for both single image or sequential video inputs in a unified manner. It achieves precise and naturalistic lip synchronization while enabling quantitative control over mouth opening shape. ControlTalk is superior to state-of-the-art performance on widely used benchmarks, including HDTF and MEAD.

## Method Summary
ControlTalk uses a pre-trained video synthesis renderer (face-vid2vid) to extract 3D facial motions and applies a learnable Audio2Exp module to predict expression coefficients from audio and original expressions. This allows both single image and video inputs to be processed through the same pipeline by replacing 3D implicit points. The method employs perceptual loss and lip-sync loss during training, with training taking 1 day on 8 NVIDIA A10 GPUs.

## Key Results
- Achieves precise and naturalistic lip synchronization
- Enables quantitative control over mouth opening shape
- Superior performance on HDTF and MEAD benchmarks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
ControlTalk unifies single-image and video-based talking face generation using a pre-trained renderer and lightweight adaptation. The pre-trained renderer can generalize across different identities and the lightweight Audio2Exp module can accurately predict expression coefficients without extensive retraining.

### Mechanism 2
ControlTalk allows for flexible control of mouth opening shape through adjustable parameters. The Audio2Exp module predicts a bias of expression deformation (∆Ei) that is scaled by a coefficient α. By adjusting α, the degree of mouth opening can be controlled.

### Mechanism 3
ControlTalk demonstrates remarkable generalization capabilities across same-ID and cross-ID scenarios, and extends to out-of-domain portraits and multiple languages. The pre-trained models and lightweight adaptation allow ControlTalk to handle various input types and scenarios without extensive retraining.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: 3D Morphable Models (3DMM) and implicit facial keypoints
  - Why needed here: ControlTalk uses 3DMM as an intermediate representation for facial motions and implicit keypoints for rendering.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of 3DMM in ControlTalk, and how does it differ from using explicit facial keypoints?

- Concept: Audio feature extraction and speech-driven facial animation
  - Why needed here: ControlTalk uses an audio encoder to extract speech features from the input audio, which are then used to drive facial animations.
  - Quick check question: How does ControlTalk extract speech features from audio, and how are these features used to drive facial animations?

- Concept: Neural radiance fields (NeRF) and video synthesis
  - Why needed here: ControlTalk uses a pre-trained video synthesis renderer (face-vid2vid) based on NeRF to render the generated talking faces.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of NeRF in ControlTalk's video synthesis renderer, and how does it contribute to the generation of high-quality talking face videos?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Audio encoder -> Motion extractor -> Audio2Exp module -> Video synthesis renderer -> Loss functions
- Critical path:
  1. Extract speech features from input audio using the audio encoder
  2. Extract 3D facial motions from input video using the motion extractor
  3. Predict expression coefficients using the Audio2Exp module and input audio/speech features
  4. Combine 3D facial motions and predicted expression coefficients to generate talking faces using the video synthesis renderer
  5. Apply perceptual and lip-sync losses for training
- Design tradeoffs: Using a pre-trained renderer allows for faster training and better generalization but may limit control over the generated output. The lightweight Audio2Exp module simplifies the architecture but may not capture all nuances of facial expressions.
- Failure signatures: Poor lip synchronization, unnatural facial expressions, limited generalization
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the Audio2Exp module's ability to predict expression coefficients from audio and original expressions using a small dataset
  2. Evaluate the model's performance on a same-ID scenario using the HDTF dataset and compare it to baseline methods
  3. Assess the model's generalization capabilities by testing it on cross-ID scenarios, out-of-domain portraits, and multiple languages

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the choice of alpha (α) value for mouth opening control affect the naturalness and expressiveness of generated talking faces across different languages and speaker styles? The paper mentions that adjusting alpha controls the mouth opening size and that different speakers have varying mouth shapes for the same phonemes, suggesting language and speaker style might influence optimal alpha values.

### Open Question 2
What are the limitations of ControlTalk when dealing with extreme head poses or occlusions (e.g., hands covering the mouth) in the input video? The paper focuses on generating realistic talking faces but does not explicitly discuss handling extreme head poses or occlusions.

### Open Question 3
How does the performance of ControlTalk scale with increasing video resolution, and what are the computational requirements for high-resolution video generation? The paper mentions that ControlTalk can be extended to high-resolution video but does not provide a detailed analysis of performance scaling or computational requirements.

## Limitations
- Limited empirical evidence across diverse domains for generalization claims
- Lack of extensive user studies to validate the naturalness of controlled deformations
- No detailed analysis of performance scaling with video resolution

## Confidence
- High confidence: Technical architecture and training methodology are well-specified
- Medium confidence: Performance improvements supported by quantitative metrics but evaluation scope is limited
- Low confidence: Generalization claims to multiple languages, out-of-domain portraits, and cross-identity scenarios lack substantial empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate ControlTalk on a diverse set of out-of-domain portraits including different ethnicities, ages, and artistic styles to validate generalization capabilities
2. Test the model on extended talking face sequences (5+ minutes) to identify temporal consistency issues or degradation in lip-sync quality over time
3. Conduct a controlled user study comparing ControlTalk's adjustable mouth opening feature against baseline methods to quantify subjective quality and naturalness across different α values and facial types
