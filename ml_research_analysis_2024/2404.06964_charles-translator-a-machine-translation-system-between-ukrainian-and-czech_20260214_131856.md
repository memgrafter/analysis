# Charles Translator: A Machine Translation System between Ukrainian and Czech

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2404.06964
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06964
- **Reference count:** 0
- **Primary result:** Developed machine translation system between Ukrainian and Czech with competitive BLEU scores of 30-35 and chrF scores of 57-60

## Executive Summary
Charles Translator is a machine translation system developed to address urgent communication needs between Ukrainian and Czech speakers following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The system uses Transformer architecture with block back-translation to efficiently leverage monolingual data. It directly translates between the two languages without pivoting through English, taking advantage of their typological similarity. The system is accessible via web and Android interfaces with transliteration features and has been adopted by various organizations and individuals.

## Method Summary
The system employs Transformer architecture enhanced with block back-translation to effectively utilize monolingual data. Rather than using English as an intermediary language, Charles Translator directly translates between Ukrainian and Czech, leveraging their linguistic similarities. The model was trained on a carefully curated mix of parallel and monolingual data, collected with volunteer assistance. The approach focuses on maximizing the utility of available data through advanced training techniques while maintaining translation quality for real-world applications.

## Key Results
- BLEU scores of 30-35 and chrF scores of 57-60 demonstrate competitive performance
- High usage statistics, particularly in the Ukrainian-to-Czech direction
- System adopted by various organizations and individuals for practical communication needs
- Successfully handles transliteration requirements through dedicated interface features

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system's effectiveness stems from leveraging the typological similarity between Ukrainian and Czech, which share Slavic language features including similar grammatical structures, case systems, and vocabulary roots. Direct translation between these languages, rather than pivoting through English, preserves linguistic nuances and reduces error propagation. The block back-translation technique allows efficient utilization of monolingual data, which is particularly valuable given the limited parallel corpus size for this language pair.

## Foundational Learning
- **Transformer Architecture**: Neural network structure using self-attention mechanisms for sequence-to-sequence translation; needed for capturing long-range dependencies and achieving state-of-the-art performance; quick check: verify attention weights distribution
- **Back-translation**: Technique of translating monolingual target language data to source language to create additional training pairs; needed to augment limited parallel data; quick check: measure synthetic data quality
- **Block Back-translation**: Advanced version of back-translation that processes text in blocks; needed for computational efficiency with large monolingual corpora; quick check: compare training time with standard back-translation
- **Typological Similarity**: Shared linguistic features between languages from the same family; needed to justify direct translation approach; quick check: analyze vocabulary overlap and grammatical structure alignment
- **Transliteration Support**: Conversion between different writing systems or representations; needed for proper handling of Ukrainian text in Czech contexts; quick check: test edge cases in name and place transliteration

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Charles Translator follows a standard NMT pipeline: Data Collection -> Preprocessing -> Model Training (Transformer + Block Back-translation) -> Evaluation -> Deployment (Web/Android)

**Critical Path:**
The critical path is: Data Collection → Preprocessing → Model Training → Evaluation → Deployment. Each stage depends on the previous one, with model training being the most resource-intensive component requiring careful hyperparameter tuning.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The system prioritizes direct translation over pivoting through English, sacrificing potential training data from English-Czech/Ukrainian pairs for better linguistic fidelity. Block back-translation trades some synthetic data quality for computational efficiency, enabling training on larger monolingual datasets.

**Failure Signatures:**
Translation errors typically manifest as morphological inconsistencies, incorrect case usage, or word order issues. The system may struggle with domain-specific terminology or idiomatic expressions. Transliteration failures can occur with proper nouns or specialized vocabulary.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Evaluate translation quality on a small parallel test set to establish baseline performance
2. Test transliteration accuracy for common Ukrainian names and places in Czech context
3. Assess model robustness to out-of-domain text and specialized vocabulary

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Exact composition and size of training data remain unclear beyond general descriptions
- No detailed information about evaluation datasets or protocols used
- Block back-translation effectiveness asserted but not thoroughly validated through ablation studies
- Long-term system performance and maintenance strategies are not discussed

## Confidence

**System Architecture and Implementation:** High - Transformer-based approaches are well-established
**Performance Claims:** Medium - Reasonable metrics but limited verification details
**Real-world Impact:** Medium - Usage statistics reported but not independently verified

## Next Checks
1. Conduct blind evaluation using standardized test sets to verify the reported BLEU and chrF scores
2. Perform error analysis on typical translation challenges for Ukrainian-Czech pairs (morphology, word order, idioms)
3. Document and test the system's performance on domain-specific content (legal, medical, educational) used by the reported organizations
