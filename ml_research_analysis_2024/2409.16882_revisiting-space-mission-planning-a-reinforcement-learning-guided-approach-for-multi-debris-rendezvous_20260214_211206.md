# Revisiting Space Mission Planning: A Reinforcement Learning-Guided Approach for Multi-Debris Rendezvous

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.16882
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16882
- Reference count: 40
- Multi-debris rendezvous planning using masked PPO achieves 10.96% time reduction vs genetic algorithms

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the optimization of space debris removal mission planning by determining the most efficient sequence for debris rendezvous. The authors propose using a masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm from deep reinforcement learning, trained on simulated debris fields. The approach aims to minimize total mission time by optimizing the visitation sequence. Results show the RL method reduces total mission time by 10.96% compared to a genetic algorithm and 13.66% compared to a greedy algorithm, while also achieving faster computational speeds.

## Method Summary
The method employs a masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to optimize the sequence of space debris rendezvous, aiming to minimize total mission time. The approach uses simulated space missions with varying debris fields, utilizing Iridium 33 debris data from Celestrak. The RL agent learns through interaction with the environment, receiving rewards based on time-to-rendezvous calculated using Izzo's modified Lambert solver. The algorithm incorporates invalid action masking to exclude already-visited debris from consideration, focusing the policy on valid transitions. The state space includes six Keplerian elements, Cartesian coordinates, and a visited debris mask for each object.

## Key Results
- RL approach reduces total mission time by 10.96% compared to genetic algorithm
- RL approach reduces total mission time by 13.66% compared to greedy algorithm
- Model achieves faster computational speeds while consistently identifying time-efficient sequences

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Masked PPO outperforms greedy and genetic algorithms by pruning invalid actions (revisiting debris) during policy updates.
- Mechanism: Invalid action masking restricts the action space to unvisited debris only, reducing exploration noise and focusing gradient updates on valid transitions.
- Core assumption: The MDP state fully encodes visited debris history and current orbital configuration.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we incorporate invalid action masking. An invalid action, in our scenario, is defined as any attempt by the interceptor to revisit a debris site."
  - [section IV-B] "By weeding out invalid actions from the current action space, the algorithm has a much easier task to improve the cumulative reward."
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct citation of masked PPO applied to TSP variants in literature.
- Break condition: If the debris field is so dense that almost all remaining debris are equally optimal, the masking benefit shrinks.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Lambert solver-based time-to-rendezvous calculation enables realistic, physics-grounded reward shaping.
- Mechanism: Each action's reward is computed as normalized negative time-to-rendezvous using Izzo's modified Lambert problem, aligning the agent's objective with mission time minimization.
- Core assumption: Lambert solver is computationally cheap enough to run online for every candidate action during training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "utilizing the Lambert solver as per Izzo's adaptation for individual rendezvous."
  - [section II-C] "This modified algorithm by Izzo for solving the Lambert problem is approximately 1.25 times faster to execute than the traditionally used Gooding's algorithm."
  - [corpus] Weak: No literature benchmark for Lambert vs Lambert+RL performance.
- Break condition: If mission fuel constraints become binding, the purely time-based reward no longer reflects true mission cost.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Dynamic decision-making allows the RL agent to adapt to on-the-fly mission changes without full replanning.
- Mechanism: At each step the agent chooses the next debris based on current state (positions, visited list), so new constraints (e.g., collision risk) can be injected into the state representation and handled immediately.
- Core assumption: The agent's policy generalizes across states that differ only in short-term perturbations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "At each step, the agent visits one debris object and then analyzes the current scenario to determine the next target."
  - [section V-E] "Unlike traditional methods where the entire debris visitation sequence is pre-planned, our agent adopts a dynamic decision-making approach."
  - [corpus] Weak: No cited work comparing static vs dynamic TSP solvers under mid-mission changes.
- Break condition: If perturbations are too large (e.g., debris destroyed), the state distribution shifts outside the training distribution and performance degrades.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Markov Decision Process (MDP)
  - Why needed here: RL policy assumes current state contains all information needed to choose optimal next action; critical for framing debris rendezvous as sequential decision making.
  - Quick check question: What elements must be in the state to make the debris-visitation problem Markovian?

- Concept: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) clipped surrogate objective
  - Why needed here: PPO's clipping stabilizes policy updates in a high-variance discrete-action space (next debris to visit).
  - Quick check question: How does the clip range (ϵ=0.2) prevent destructive policy updates in early training?

- Concept: Lambert's problem for orbital transfers
  - Why needed here: Provides physically accurate, low-thrust maneuver times used as the reward signal for each rendezvous leg.
  - Quick check question: What inputs to the Lambert solver change when the spacecraft has already visited some debris?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  OpenAI Gym-like environment -> Masked PPO trainer -> Lambert solver -> Debris catalog loader

- Critical path:
  1. Environment step: agent selects next debris index
  2. Compute time-to-rendezvous via Lambert solver
  3. Apply invalid action mask to exclude already-visited debris
  4. Reward = -normalized_TTR (bonus for final step)
  5. PPO update after batch of steps

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Masking reduces action space → faster learning but requires accurate visited-state encoding.
  - Lambert solver per-step → high fidelity but computationally heavier than heuristic distances.
  - Fixed Tmax normalization → stable reward scale but may flatten reward signal if Tmax is too loose.

- Failure signatures:
  - Reward plateau at -1 → masking is too restrictive or state under-specifies reachable debris.
  - High variance in TTR predictions → Lambert solver numerical instability or debris positions not synchronized.
  - Slow convergence → batch size too small for 10-step episodes or clip range too tight.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run PPO with masking disabled; compare training curves and final TTR to masked baseline.
  2. Replace Lambert solver with Euclidean distance reward; measure degradation in optimality and compute speed.
  3. Inject synthetic collision constraints into the state; verify dynamic re-planning reduces total mission time vs static re-plan.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the masked PPO algorithm scale when the number of debris objects increases beyond the tested scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that "The differences between the algorithms execution time are likely to be exacerbated when dealing with a larger number of debris objects."
- Why unresolved: The paper only tested scenarios with ten debris pieces, and no larger-scale tests were conducted to verify the scaling behavior.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing execution times and total mission times for scenarios with significantly more debris (e.g., 50, 100, or 500 pieces) compared to the current algorithms.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How sensitive is the masked PPO algorithm's performance to variations in initial conditions, such as the spacecraft's parking orbit or the distribution of debris orbits?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper assumes a given parking orbit and does not explore how different starting conditions might affect the algorithm's ability to find optimal rendezvous sequences.
- Why unresolved: The simulations used a fixed parking orbit and random debris selection, without systematically varying initial conditions to test robustness.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative results showing the algorithm's performance across multiple parking orbits and debris distributions, including edge cases like highly eccentric or inclined orbits.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the masked PPO algorithm effectively incorporate real-time constraints, such as collision avoidance or dynamic changes in debris orbits, during the mission?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that "This method offers significant flexibility for real-time adjustments, such as collision avoidance or removal operations that last longer than expected."
- Why unresolved: While the paper claims flexibility, it does not demonstrate or test the algorithm's ability to handle dynamic changes or unexpected events during a mission.
- What evidence would resolve it: Simulation results showing the algorithm's performance when debris orbits are perturbed or when new debris is introduced mid-mission, along with metrics on mission time and success rate.

## Limitations

- Masking mechanism's benefits lack direct ablation studies showing isolated impact on convergence speed
- Lambert solver's computational overhead per step is not quantified against simpler heuristics
- Dynamic re-planning capability is only demonstrated implicitly through final mission times without explicit mid-mission perturbation tests

## Confidence

- Mechanism 1 (masking benefit): Medium - theoretically justified but lacks direct ablation evidence
- Mechanism 2 (Lambert solver reward shaping): Medium - physics-grounded but computational cost unexamined
- Mechanism 3 (dynamic adaptation): Low - claimed but not explicitly validated with perturbations
- Overall performance claims (10.96%/13.66% improvements): Medium - based on limited debris field configurations

## Next Checks

1. Run ablation study comparing masked vs unmasked PPO to isolate masking's impact on convergence and final performance
2. Benchmark Lambert solver per-step computation time against Euclidean distance baseline across varying debris field densities
3. Implement mid-mission debris removal (simulating collisions) and measure RL agent's ability to re-optimize vs static re-planning approaches
