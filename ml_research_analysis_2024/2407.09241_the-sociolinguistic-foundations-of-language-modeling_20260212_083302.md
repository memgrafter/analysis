# The Sociolinguistic Foundations of Language Modeling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.09241

- Primary result: Language models are fundamentally models of varieties of language, and sociolinguistic theory provides a theoretical foundation for understanding and improving language modeling

## Executive Summary
This paper argues that large language models are inherently models of varieties of language, where varieties are defined as populations of texts characterized by extra-linguistic factors such as social background, context, and time period. The authors demonstrate how this sociolinguistic perspective can inform five key challenges in language modeling: social bias, domain adaptation, alignment, language change, and scale. By viewing language models through this lens, they suggest that improving their performance and societal value requires careful consideration of the sociolinguistic diversity and representativeness of training corpora, including their internal varietal structure.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a theoretical framework based on sociolinguistic concepts of varieties of language (dialects, registers, periods) and discusses how these concepts can inform various challenges in language modeling. Rather than providing specific datasets or empirical experiments, the authors synthesize existing sociolinguistic theory with language modeling practice to establish a conceptual foundation. The approach involves defining target varieties of language, analyzing corpus representativeness, and proposing sociolinguistically-informed approaches to address challenges like social bias and domain adaptation.

## Key Results
- Language models are inherently models of varieties of language, not general language
- Sociolinguistic diversity in training corpora directly impacts model performance and fairness across social groups
- Understanding the sociolinguistic structure of target domains enables more effective domain adaptation
- Machine-generated language will become part of language varieties and must be incorporated into future modeling approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Training corpora that accurately represent dialectal variation within a language variety reduces quality-of-service harms by improving model accuracy for underrepresented groups.
- Mechanism: When language models are trained on data that underrepresents certain dialects, they learn to predict tokens less accurately for speakers of those dialects. By ensuring balanced representation of dialects in the training corpus, the model can better capture the linguistic patterns of all groups, reducing errors when processing their language.
- Core assumption: Dialectal variation leads to systematic differences in linguistic patterns that affect token prediction accuracy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we argue that large language models are inherently models of varieties of language"
  - [section 3.1] "if language data from certain social groups is under-represented in the training data for a language model, we should expect that NLP applications based on that model will process language structures produced by these groups less accurately"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no specific corpus data provided in the paper
- Break condition: If dialectal variation is not systematic or predictable, or if the model architecture cannot capture the relevant patterns.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Training corpora that represent a wider range of dialects and registers reduces stereotyping harms by exposing the model to diverse perspectives and language patterns.
- Mechanism: Language models learn associations between words based on co-occurrence patterns in training data. If certain social groups are underrepresented or only represented in limited contexts, the model may develop biased associations. By including diverse dialectal and register data, the model learns a more balanced set of associations.
- Core assumption: Stereotyping arises from biased co-occurrence patterns in training data that can be mitigated through diverse representation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1] "If the training corpus contains relatively frequent expression of harmful or inaccurate ideas about certain social groups... language models will inevitably reproduce those biases"
  - [section 3.3] "by balancing training data originating from different social groups, language models can be trained to better align with the general values of society"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no specific corpus data provided in the paper
- Break condition: If diverse representation alone is insufficient to overcome deep-seated societal biases, or if the model architecture amplifies biases.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Understanding the sociolinguistic structure of language varieties enables more effective domain adaptation by targeting the specific sub-varieties relevant to the target domain.
- Mechanism: Domain adaptation involves fine-tuning a base model on data from a more specific domain. By understanding the sociolinguistic structure of the target domain (which dialects, registers, and periods it encompasses), adaptation can be more precisely targeted to the relevant sub-varieties, improving performance.
- Core assumption: Domain adaptation is more effective when the target domain is understood as a specific sub-variety of language with its own sociolinguistic structure.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "the process of domain adaptation can be meaningfully informed by linguistic analysis that rigorously identifies maximally distinctive varieties of language"
  - [section 3.2] "understanding the sociolinguistic structure of the larger variety of language could also allow models to be adapted to represent target varieties with missing data"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no specific corpus data provided in the paper
- Break condition: If the sociolinguistic structure of the target domain is too complex or poorly understood to be useful for adaptation.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Variety of language
  - Why needed here: The paper's core argument is that language models are models of varieties of language, so understanding what this means is fundamental.
  - Quick check question: What are the three basic sources of linguistic variation that define varieties of language?

- Concept: Dialect, register, and period
  - Why needed here: The paper argues that understanding these three types of linguistic variation is crucial for addressing challenges in language modeling.
  - Quick check question: How do dialects differ from registers in terms of what defines them?

- Concept: Corpus representativeness
  - Why needed here: The paper emphasizes that the performance and ethical application of language models depends on how well training corpora represent the target variety of language.
  - Quick check question: Why is it important for a corpus to represent the internal structure of a language variety, including its sub-varieties?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Corpus compilation -> Model training -> Domain adaptation -> Evaluation for bias and performance
- Critical path: 1) Define target variety of language, 2) Compile representative corpus, 3) Train base model, 4) Adapt for specific domains, 5) Evaluate for bias and performance
- Design tradeoffs: Balancing corpus size with sociolinguistic diversity vs. computational efficiency; balancing model complexity with ability to capture fine-grained linguistic variation
- Failure signatures: Quality-of-service harms (poor performance for certain groups), stereotyping harms (biased outputs), domain adaptation failures (poor performance on specific tasks), misalignment with societal values
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train two models on corpora with different levels of dialectal representation and compare performance on dialect-specific tasks.
  2. Fine-tune a base model on a narrowly defined sub-variety and compare performance to fine-tuning on a broader variety.
  3. Evaluate a model's outputs for stereotyping using a sociolinguistically stratified test corpus.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the precise relationship between corpus size and sociolinguistic diversity in determining LLM performance, and is there a point of diminishing returns?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors hypothesize that increasing corpus size improves performance only if it also increases sociolinguistic diversity, and question whether there's a limit to performance gains from scaling alone.
- Why unresolved: The paper suggests this is a fundamental question for LLM development but doesn't provide empirical evidence or formal testing of this hypothesis.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing model performance across corpora of varying sizes and sociolinguistic diversity, controlling for other variables, would clarify the relationship.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can language models be effectively adapted to represent varieties of language for which no direct data exists?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors propose using overlap between varieties and combinations of available corpora, but acknowledge this is speculative and requires further research.
- Why unresolved: This approach relies on theoretical assumptions about linguistic relationships that haven't been empirically validated for model adaptation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic testing of adaptation techniques using simulated missing data scenarios, comparing performance against ground truth for the target variety.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How should machine-generated language be incorporated into training corpora as it becomes increasingly prevalent in natural language use?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors argue that machine-generated language will become part of language varieties and cannot be excluded, but don't provide guidance on how to handle this in practice.
- Why unresolved: This is a new challenge created by LLM adoption, and there's no established methodology for distinguishing or incorporating machine-generated text in sociolinguistic terms.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of corpus compilation strategies that account for human-machine collaboration patterns, measuring their impact on model performance and alignment.

## Limitations
- The paper provides minimal empirical validation of its theoretical claims and mechanisms
- The operationalization of sociolinguistic concepts for practical language modeling remains under-specified
- Treatment of register variation is less developed than dialect and period variation
- Major assumptions about corpus representativeness and variety identification lack robust methodological support

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The claim that language models are inherently models of varieties of language is well-supported theoretically and aligns with observed performance differences across social groups and domains.

**Medium Confidence**: The mechanisms proposed for addressing specific challenges (social bias, domain adaptation, alignment) are theoretically justified but lack empirical validation.

**Low Confidence**: The paper's treatment of scale and language change as challenges that can be addressed through sociolinguistic understanding is the most speculative and under-developed.

## Next Checks
1. Analyze existing large language model training corpora using sociolinguistic metrics to quantify dialectal and register diversity, then compare model performance across sociolinguistic dimensions.
2. Train two versions of a language model - one on a dialect-balanced corpus and one on a dialect-skewed corpus - and evaluate both on dialect-specific benchmarks.
3. Select a domain (e.g., biomedical literature) and create training splits based on different sociolinguistic criteria, then fine-tune models on each split and evaluate performance on both task-specific metrics and sociolinguistic bias measures.
