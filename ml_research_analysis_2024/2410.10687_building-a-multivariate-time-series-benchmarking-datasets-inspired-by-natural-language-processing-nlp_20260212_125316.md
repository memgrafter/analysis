# Building a Multivariate Time Series Benchmarking Datasets Inspired by Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.10687
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10687
- Authors: Mohammad Asif Ibna Mustafa; Ferdinand Heinrich
- Reference count: 38
- This paper proposes a benchmarking framework for time series analysis inspired by NLP methodologies, addressing gaps in current time series evaluation frameworks.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the need for comprehensive evaluation frameworks for advanced time series models by adapting successful NLP benchmarking methodologies. The authors propose creating a unified benchmark that evaluates models across multiple time series tasks including forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection. Drawing inspiration from NLP benchmarks like GLUE and SuperGLUE, the framework incorporates diverse datasets, task-specific metrics, and multi-task learning strategies to create a more robust evaluation platform for time series analysis.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes curating diverse datasets across multiple time series tasks (forecasting using M4 dataset, classification using UEA/UCR datasets, and anomaly detection using Yahoo dataset) and evaluating models using task-specific metrics. It introduces multi-task learning strategies including hard parameter sharing (shared lower layers with task-specific upper layers) and soft parameter sharing (separate models with parameter similarity regularization). The framework draws parallels to NLP benchmarking approaches while acknowledging the distinct challenges of time series data, aiming to create an expansive and robust evaluation platform for time series analysis models.

## Key Results
- Proposes adapting NLP benchmarking methodologies (GLUE, SuperGLUE) to time series analysis
- Curates diverse datasets across forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection tasks
- Introduces multi-task learning strategies with hard and soft parameter sharing approaches
- Suggests task-specific evaluation metrics including MSE, MAE, F1 score, Recall, and Accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Adapting NLP benchmarking methodologies to time series analysis provides a structured evaluation framework that addresses current gaps in time series benchmarking.
- Mechanism: NLP benchmarks like GLUE and SuperGLUE established standardized evaluation frameworks with diverse tasks, clear metrics, and multi-task learning approaches. The paper proposes transferring these principles to time series by curating datasets across forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection tasks, using task-specific metrics (MSE, MAE, F1, accuracy), and incorporating multi-task learning strategies.
- Core assumption: The success factors that made NLP benchmarks effective (standardized tasks, clear metrics, multi-task learning) can be directly translated to time series analysis despite the fundamental differences in data structure and analytical requirements.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Inspired by the success of Natural Language Processing (NLP) benchmark datasets in advancing pre-trained models, we propose a new approach to create a comprehensive benchmark dataset for time series analysis."
  - [section] "The paper explores the historical development of NLP benchmarking datasets, noting their crucial role in enhancing model performance. It then addresses the distinct challenges of time series data and proposes integrating NLP-inspired methodologies to create an expansive and robust benchmarking dataset."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - while the corpus contains related papers on time series benchmarking, none specifically discuss the NLP-inspired methodology proposed in this paper.
- Break condition: If the fundamental differences between NLP (discrete sequences of words) and time series (continuous temporal measurements) prevent effective transfer of evaluation methodologies, or if task-specific metrics from NLP don't capture the unique characteristics of time series analysis.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-task learning strategies improve time series model performance by leveraging shared patterns across different analytical tasks.
- Mechanism: The paper proposes both hard parameter sharing (shared lower layers with task-specific upper layers) and soft parameter sharing (separate models with parameter similarity regularization) approaches. This allows models to learn common temporal patterns while maintaining task-specific capabilities, similar to how NLP models learn shared linguistic representations.
- Core assumption: Time series tasks like forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection share underlying temporal patterns and dependencies that can be learned jointly, improving generalization and performance across all tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We investigate multi-task learning strategies that leverage the benchmark dataset to enhance the performance of time series models. This technique aims to not only create robust, accurate, and scalable solutions but also drive progress in a diverse range of applications."
  - [section] "In contrast, multi-task learning with hard parameter sharing uses a shared architecture for lower layers across multiple tasks, while having separate, task-specific top layers for each task."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - the corpus contains papers on time series anomaly detection and forecasting, but none specifically discuss multi-task learning approaches for combining multiple time series tasks.
- Break condition: If the tasks have conflicting optimization objectives that prevent effective joint training, or if the shared representations learned harm performance on specific individual tasks.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Curating diverse, representative, and challenging datasets across multiple domains creates a more comprehensive evaluation framework that better captures model capabilities.
- Mechanism: The paper selects datasets from different domains (finance, healthcare, electricity, web traffic) and task types (forecasting, classification, anomaly detection) to ensure broad coverage of time series characteristics including different periodicities, noise levels, and dependency structures.
- Core assumption: Time series models need to be evaluated on data that represents the full diversity of real-world applications, and a comprehensive benchmark must include challenging cases that reveal model limitations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The M4 competition dataset [17] is widely recognized as a benchmark in the field of time-series forecasting and provides a more comprehensive evaluation platform than the M3 competition [16]. It includes a collection of 100,000 time series from a range of domains, such as finance, economics, demography, and industry."
  - [section] "The UEA and UCR Time Series Classification Dataset is a well-known benchmarking resource that offers a diverse range of 128 univariate and 30 multivariate time series datasets across various domains [7]."
  - [corpus] Moderate evidence - several corpus papers discuss dataset selection for time series benchmarking, supporting the importance of diverse and representative datasets.
- Break condition: If the selected datasets don't adequately represent the full diversity of time series applications, or if the evaluation metrics don't capture the nuances of performance across different domain characteristics.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Dataset curation pipeline (M4, UCR/UEA, Yahoo datasets) -> Multi-task learning framework with configurable sharing strategies -> Evaluation module with task-specific metrics (MSE, MAE, F1, accuracy) -> Benchmarking interface for model submission and comparison -> Data preprocessing module for handling time series characteristics

- Critical path:
  1. Dataset ingestion and preprocessing
  2. Task-specific model training (single-task baseline)
  3. Multi-task learning model training with configurable sharing
  4. Evaluation using task-specific metrics
  5. Result aggregation and comparison

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Hard vs. soft parameter sharing: Hard sharing is more parameter-efficient but may limit task-specific learning; soft sharing provides more flexibility but requires more parameters
  - Task weighting: Equal weighting may not reflect task importance or difficulty differences
  - Dataset selection: Comprehensive coverage vs. manageable evaluation scope

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on individual tasks despite good multi-task performance (over-regularization)
  - Inconsistent results across different dataset splits (overfitting to specific data characteristics)
  - High variance in multi-task learning performance (unstable optimization)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Single-task baseline evaluation: Train and evaluate separate models for forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection on their respective datasets to establish baseline performance.
  2. Hard parameter sharing evaluation: Implement a multi-task model with shared lower layers and evaluate performance across all tasks compared to single-task baselines.
  3. Soft parameter sharing evaluation: Implement separate models with parameter similarity regularization and compare performance and parameter efficiency against hard sharing approach.
