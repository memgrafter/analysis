core_contribution: This study applied a logical approach to criminal case investigation
  using a knowledge graph based on "The Adventure of the Speckled Band" from the Sherlock
  Holmes stories. The authors developed an ontology of murder motives and methods,
  added it to the knowledge graph, and applied SPARQL and SHACL scripts to identify
  characters with motives, opportunities, and means to commit the crime.

# A Logical Approach to Criminal Case Investigation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.08284
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08284
- Reference count: 3
- Primary result: Correctly identified Roylott as the perpetrator in "The Adventure of the Speckled Band" using knowledge graphs and logical inference

## Executive Summary
This study applies a logical approach to criminal case investigation by encoding narrative facts and domain knowledge into a knowledge graph and using SPARQL queries and SHACL constraints to infer suspects. The authors map "The Adventure of the Speckled Band" into RDF triples, develop ontologies for murder motives and methods, and apply inference rules to identify characters matching motive, opportunity, and method conditions. The system successfully identifies Roylott as the perpetrator who killed Julia with a poisonous snake for financial gain. The work demonstrates the feasibility of structured reasoning for criminal investigation, though the ontologies and inference rules require further development for broader applicability.

## Method Summary
The authors create a knowledge graph representing "The Adventure of the Speckled Band" and develop ontologies for murder motives and methods based on crime dictionaries. They apply SPARQL queries to identify suspects with motives by matching character relationships to motive categories, use SHACL constraints to validate opportunity based on spatial connections, and apply SPARQL to match victim symptoms to murder methods using the method ontology. The system aggregates results to rank suspects, successfully identifying Roylott as the perpetrator through logical inference from the structured data.

## Key Results
- Correctly identified Roylott as the perpetrator who killed Julia with a poisonous snake for financial gain
- Demonstrated the feasibility of using SPARQL queries and SHACL constraints for motive, opportunity, and method inference
- Developed ontologies for murder motives (e.g., greed, self-defense) and methods (e.g., poisoning, strangulation) from crime dictionaries

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Knowledge graph approach allows structured reasoning about criminal motives, opportunities, and methods by encoding domain knowledge as ontology classes and SHACL constraints
- Mechanism: Maps narrative elements into RDF triples, applies SPARQL queries and SHACL validation shapes to infer suspects matching motive, opportunity, and method conditions
- Core assumption: Narrative facts can be accurately represented as structured triples and ontology fully captures relevant motive/method categories
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] created ontology of motives and methods, added to knowledge graph, applied scripts; [section 4.2] developed ontology of motives from White Paper on Crime; [corpus] Weak - no directly relevant corpus citations
- Break condition: If narrative cannot be fully mapped to RDF triples or ontology does not cover relevant categories, inference will fail

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: SHACL shapes encode logical constraints that automatically detect suspect characteristics matching specific motives
- Mechanism: SHACL constraints define shapes for "grudge motive" that match characters who lost close relations and have potential causes of death; applying these shapes yields suspects like Roylott
- Core assumption: Causal chain from motive to opportunity can be represented as SHACL shape constraints without loss of nuance
- Evidence anchors: [section 4.2] Fig. 5 assigns information about motivation for grudges to characters in SHACL; [section 4.2] Using SHACL system obtained results: Roylott could kill Julia and Helen for money; [corpus] Weak - corpus does not cite SHACL applications in criminal investigation
- Break condition: If SHACL shape logic is too coarse or misses indirect motive chains, suspects may be omitted

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: SPARQL queries combined with ontology-derived murder method classes narrow down suspects by matching victim symptoms and available criminal objects
- Mechanism: System first queries victim's appearance and scene details to identify poisoning as method, then retrieves characters possessing related objects to infer likely perpetrators
- Core assumption: Mapping between symptoms and method classes is complete and possession of related objects is valid proxy for capability
- Evidence anchors: [section 4.4] Fig.10 shows SPARQL query to narrow down murder methods by comparing victim's appearance with ontology; [section 4.4] Extract crime offerings and related objects, yielding results: Viper-killing is theorised as viable means of killing Roylott; [corpus] Weak - corpus lacks citations of SPARQL-based murder inference
- Break condition: If symptoms map ambiguously to multiple methods or object possession does not imply capability, inference accuracy drops

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: RDF triple structure and SPARQL query language
  - Why needed here: Knowledge graph is represented in RDF, SPARQL used to query suspect data and scene facts
  - Quick check question: Given triples (Roylott, hasObject, whip) and (Roylott, inRoom, bedroom), write a SPARQL query to find all characters with objects in Roylott's bedroom

- Concept: SHACL constraint modeling
  - Why needed here: SHACL shapes encode motive, opportunity, and method constraints to validate suspect properties
  - Quick check question: Define a SHACL shape that matches characters who lost a close relative and have a motive of financial gain

- Concept: Ontology class hierarchy for motives and methods
  - Why needed here: Ontology provides structured vocabulary to categorize motives (e.g., greed, self-defence) and methods (e.g., poisoning, strangulation)
  - Quick check question: List two subclasses under "murder method" class that could apply to poisoning with a snake

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Knowledge graph (RDF store) holding narrative facts -> Motive/Method ontologies (OWL/Turtle) defining categories -> SHACL shapes (constraints) for motive matching -> SPARQL queries for method inference and opportunity checks -> Inference engine (SPARQL/SHACL processor) executing queries and validations -> Result aggregation layer for final suspect ranking

- Critical path:
  1. Load narrative facts into RDF store
  2. Load ontologies and SHACL shapes
  3. Run motive SHACL validation
  4. Run opportunity SPARQL queries
  5. Run method SPARQL queries
  6. Aggregate results and rank suspects

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Ontology completeness vs. development effort: richer ontologies improve coverage but require more manual work
  - SHACL expressiveness vs. performance: complex constraints yield more accurate matches but slow validation
  - SPARQL query granularity vs. result precision: fine-grained queries reduce false positives but increase complexity

- Failure signatures:
  - Empty motive result set → ontology missing relevant motive class
  - No opportunity matches → spatial/temporal triples missing or misstructured
  - Multiple method candidates → symptom-to-method mapping ambiguous

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Load minimal narrative subset into RDF and run single motive SHACL shape to verify constraint matching
  2. Add small set of method classes to ontology and run SPARQL to match victim symptoms to methods
  3. Combine motive and method results and manually verify suspect ranking against expected outcome

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can current ontology be extended to cover all possible motives and methods of murder?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Authors explicitly state ontology does not describe all motives and methods, necessitating future improvements
- Why unresolved: Paper does not provide detailed plan or methodology for extending ontology comprehensively
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic approach to ontology expansion including comprehensive list of motives and methods, strategy for integrating new data sources and expert knowledge

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can process of making overall judgment be automated based on results of motive, opportunity, and method assessments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Authors mention overall judgment was made manually and suggest automation as future task
- Why unresolved: Paper does not explore or propose specific algorithms or methods for automating this decision-making process
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of automated decision-making system that can integrate and weigh results of motive, opportunity, and method assessments to reach final conclusion

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can system handle distinction between "statement," "thought," and "fact" more effectively?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Authors note all statements and thoughts were treated as facts, which may not be accurate, suggest analyzing suspects' words, actions, knowledge, intentions, and judgments of lies
- Why unresolved: Paper does not provide method for distinguishing between different types of information or handling potential falsehoods
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation of natural language processing system that can analyze and categorize statements and thoughts, assess reliability based on context and consistency with other evidence

## Limitations
- Relies on manually constructed ontologies and inference rules that may not generalize to cases with different motive structures or crime methods
- Absence of cited prior work using SHACL or SPARQL for forensic reasoning limits assessment of novelty
- Narrative-to-RDF mapping process is not detailed, raising concerns about reproducibility

## Confidence

- Identification of Roylott as perpetrator: High (based on clear narrative facts and logical inference)
- Generalizability of method to real criminal cases: Low (single case study, no validation on real cases)
- Completeness of motive and method ontologies: Medium (ontologies constructed from crime dictionaries, but coverage not empirically validated)

## Next Checks

1. Apply the knowledge graph and inference system to a different fictional or real criminal case with known perpetrator to test generalizability
2. Conduct an expert review of the motive and method ontologies against a larger set of criminal cases to identify coverage gaps
3. Perform a sensitivity analysis by varying the RDF representation of key narrative facts to assess impact on inference accuracy
