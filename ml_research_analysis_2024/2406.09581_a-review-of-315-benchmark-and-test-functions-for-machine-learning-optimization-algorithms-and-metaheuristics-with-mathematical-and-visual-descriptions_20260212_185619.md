# A Review of 315 Benchmark and Test Functions for Machine Learning Optimization Algorithms and Metaheuristics with Mathematical and Visual Descriptions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.09581
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09581
- Reference count: 40
- Provides an exhaustive catalog of over 300 benchmark and test functions used in optimization and metaheuristics algorithm evaluation

## Executive Summary
This comprehensive review consolidates over 300 benchmark functions into a single, categorized resource, addressing the need for a centralized reference in optimization research. The paper provides mathematical and visual descriptions, range of suitability, and domain implications for each function, enabling researchers to select appropriate benchmarks for their algorithmic challenges. Additionally, it proposes two new dynamic benchmark functions designed to better simulate real-world problem landscapes and identifies gaps in current benchmarking practices.

## Method Summary
The review systematically categorizes 315 benchmark functions based on their characteristics (modality, continuity, separability, scalability, differentiability, dimensionality) and provides detailed mathematical formulations and visual representations for each. It compiles the 25 most commonly used functions and introduces two new dynamic functions ("Dynamic Deceptive Basin" and "Complex Dynamic Deceptive Basin") to address the limitations of static benchmarks. The methodology involves analyzing existing collective works, identifying gaps in current practices, and proposing new functions that incorporate stochastic elements and dynamically updating parameters to simulate real-time, evolving problem landscapes.

## Key Results
- Comprehensive catalog of over 300 benchmark functions with mathematical and visual descriptions
- Categorization system based on function characteristics to aid in benchmark selection
- Introduction of two new dynamic benchmark functions to better simulate real-world optimization scenarios
- Identification of gaps in current benchmarking practices and suggestions for future research directions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The survey consolidates 315 benchmark functions into a single, categorized resource, reducing the time researchers spend locating and comparing test functions. By providing mathematical and visual descriptions, range of suitability, and domain implications in one document, the review acts as a "lookup table" that streamlines function selection and prevents redundant implementation. Core assumption: Researchers currently lack a centralized, standardized reference for benchmark functions.

### Mechanism 2
Categorization by characteristics (e.g., modality, continuity, scalability) enables targeted selection of benchmark functions that match the specific strengths and weaknesses an algorithm must handle. By grouping functions based on their mathematical properties and the type of challenges they present, the review allows practitioners to simulate real-world problem landscapes (e.g., sharp peaks, deep valleys, plateaus) that algorithms may face. Core assumption: Different optimization algorithms are suited to different problem landscapes, and matching benchmarks to algorithmic capabilities yields more meaningful evaluations.

### Mechanism 3
Introducing two new, highly dimensional, dynamic, and challenging functions addresses the gap in current benchmarking practices by simulating real-time, evolving problem landscapes. The proposed "Dynamic Deceptive Basin" functions incorporate stochastic elements and dynamically updating parameters, forcing optimization algorithms to adapt continuously and resist premature convergence. Core assumption: Static benchmark functions fail to capture the complexity and uncertainty of real-world optimization problems.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Mathematical representation of optimization landscapes (e.g., convexity, modality, continuity)**
  - Why needed here: Understanding these properties is essential for selecting appropriate benchmark functions and interpreting their impact on algorithm performance.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a unimodal and a multimodal function, and why does it matter for algorithm selection?

- **Concept: Properties of common optimization algorithms (e.g., gradient-based vs. metaheuristic)**
  - Why needed here: Knowing which algorithms rely on gradient information versus exploration/exploitation strategies helps in matching them to suitable benchmarks.
  - Quick check question: Why would a gradient-based algorithm struggle on a discontinuous benchmark function?

- **Concept: Dynamic and constrained optimization problems**
  - Why needed here: The review highlights gaps in benchmarking for dynamic and constrained scenarios, which are increasingly relevant in real-world applications.
  - Quick check question: How does the introduction of time-varying parameters in a benchmark function affect the evaluation of an optimization algorithm?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Function catalog (mathematical definitions, visual plots, properties) -> Classification schema (modality, continuity, scalability, etc.) -> Gap analysis and future directions -> New function proposals (Dynamic Deceptive Basin variants)

- **Critical path**: 1. Define benchmark function categories 2. Compile mathematical descriptions and visualizations 3. Analyze current usage patterns (top 25 functions) 4. Identify gaps in benchmarking practices 5. Propose new dynamic benchmark functions 6. Suggest future research directions

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Comprehensiveness vs. usability: Including 315 functions provides breadth but may overwhelm users; categorization mitigates this.
  - Static vs. dynamic benchmarks: Static functions are easier to implement but less representative of real-world problems; dynamic functions add complexity.
  - Mathematical rigor vs. accessibility: Detailed mathematical descriptions aid experts but may hinder newcomers; visual representations help bridge this gap.

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Over-reliance on commonly used functions may lead to biased algorithm evaluation.
  - Lack of dynamic benchmarks may result in algorithms that perform well on static tests but poorly in real-time scenarios.
  - Incomplete categorization may cause researchers to overlook functions that better match their algorithmic needs.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Implement a small subset of benchmark functions (e.g., Sphere, Rastrigin, Rosenbrock) and verify their mathematical properties using a test optimization algorithm.
  2. Use the classification schema to select benchmark functions that target specific algorithmic weaknesses (e.g., local optima traps, high dimensionality).
  3. Prototype one of the proposed dynamic functions and test its impact on a standard optimization algorithm's convergence behavior.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How do the proposed "Dynamic Deceptive Basin" and "Complex Dynamic Deceptive Basin" functions compare in terms of performance evaluation with existing benchmark functions? The paper introduces two new benchmark functions but does not provide empirical data or comparisons to validate their effectiveness. Empirical studies comparing the performance of algorithms on these new functions versus traditional benchmarks would resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
What specific real-world problem scenarios could benefit from the integration of dynamic and constrained functions as suggested in the paper? The paper identifies a gap in benchmarking practices but does not provide specific examples or case studies where such functions have been successfully applied. Case studies or examples demonstrating the application of dynamic and constrained functions in real-world scenarios would resolve this question.

### Open Question 3
How can the integration of real-world scenarios into benchmark functions enhance the reliability and applicability of optimization algorithms across different sectors? The paper suggests that integrating real-world scenarios into benchmark functions could enhance the reliability and applicability of optimization algorithms but does not provide detailed methodologies or frameworks for this integration. Development of frameworks or methodologies for creating benchmark functions that incorporate real-world constraints and scenarios would resolve this question.

## Limitations
- Completeness of Function Catalog: The actual number and selection criteria for inclusion are not explicitly detailed, leaving the representativeness of the catalog uncertain.
- Effectiveness of New Dynamic Functions: The proposed dynamic functions lack empirical validation and real-world testing to confirm their practical impact on algorithm evaluation.
- Generalizability of Categorization: The classification schema may not capture all relevant properties of optimization landscapes, potentially leading to suboptimal benchmark selection for certain algorithmic challenges.

## Confidence

- **Central Claim Cluster (Comprehensive Catalog and Categorization)**: Medium confidence. The review provides a substantial catalog and categorization, but the selection criteria and completeness are not fully transparent.
- **New Function Proposals**: Low confidence. The dynamic functions are theoretically sound but lack empirical validation and real-world testing.
- **Gap Analysis and Future Directions**: Medium confidence. The identified gaps are reasonable, but the proposed solutions (e.g., dynamic benchmarks) require further investigation.

## Next Checks
1. Implement and test the proposed dynamic benchmark functions on a diverse set of optimization algorithms to assess their effectiveness in simulating real-world problem landscapes and their impact on algorithm performance.
2. Conduct a study where researchers use the categorization schema to select benchmark functions for specific algorithmic challenges, comparing results with those obtained using random or commonly used benchmark sets to evaluate the practical utility of the classification system.
3. Track the performance of optimization algorithms on static and dynamic benchmark functions over time, including real-world problem instances, to determine the predictive value of the proposed benchmarks for real-world applications.
