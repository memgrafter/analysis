## Quick Facts

- Integrates human preferences into unsupervised skill discovery using instruction videos

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of unsupervised skill discovery algorithms learning undesirable or unsafe behaviors in complex environments. The proposed DoDont method integrates human intention into skill discovery by training an instruction network using videos of desirable (Do's) and undesirable (Don'ts) behaviors. This network then serves as a distance metric in a distance-maximizing skill discovery framework, promoting desired behaviors while avoiding undesirable ones.

The method demonstrates effectiveness across various continuous control tasks, including complex locomotion and precise manipulation. With fewer than eight instruction videos, DoDont successfully learns complex behaviors like running quadruped locomotion while avoiding actions like backflipping. The instruction network shows superior ability to balance multiple behavioral objectives compared to manual reward design.

## Method Summary
DoDont addresses unsupervised skill discovery by incorporating human guidance through instruction videos. The method trains an instruction network to distinguish between desirable (Do's) and undesirable (Don'ts) behaviors using video demonstrations. This trained network then serves as a distance metric within a distance-maximizing skill discovery framework. The approach uses a reward function that is the sum of the instruction network output and a distance maximization term, guiding the agent toward desired behaviors while avoiding undesirable ones. The method is evaluated on continuous control tasks in simulated environments, showing that minimal instruction video data can effectively steer skill discovery toward complex, desirable behaviors.

## Key Results
- DoDont successfully learns complex locomotion behaviors (e.g., running quadruped) with fewer than eight instruction videos
- The method effectively avoids undesirable behaviors (e.g., backflipping) that standard USD algorithms tend to discover
- Outperforms both standard USD algorithms and variants using hand-designed reward functions in terms of behavioral diversity and desirability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging human intention through video demonstrations to guide skill discovery. The instruction network learns to distinguish between desired and undesired behaviors, creating a learned distance metric that captures behavioral semantics. This metric is then integrated into the skill discovery process, where the reward function encourages exploration of diverse skills while simultaneously promoting behaviors similar to the Do's and dissimilar to the Don'ts. The distance-maximizing framework ensures exploration of the state space while the instruction network provides semantic guidance toward human-desired behaviors.

## Foundational Learning
- Unsupervised Skill Discovery: Needed to automatically learn diverse behaviors without explicit reward engineering; quick check is whether the algorithm can discover multiple distinct skills in a given environment
- Distance Maximization: Required to encourage exploration and diversity in skill discovery; quick check is whether the discovered skills cover different regions of the state space
- Video-based Behavioral Analysis: Essential for capturing human intentions without manual reward design; quick check is whether the instruction network can accurately classify Do's and Don'ts videos
- Distance Metric Learning: Critical for quantifying similarity between behaviors; quick check is whether the learned metric correlates with human judgments of behavioral similarity

## Architecture Onboarding
Component Map: Instruction Videos -> Instruction Network -> Distance Metric -> Skill Discovery Algorithm -> Agent Behaviors

Critical Path: The instruction network is the core component that transforms video demonstrations into a behavioral distance metric. This metric is then used within the skill discovery algorithm's reward function to guide exploration toward desired behaviors.

Design Tradeoffs: The method trades off the need for some human-provided data (instruction videos) against the complexity of manual reward engineering. While requiring curated video demonstrations, it avoids the need for detailed reward function design for each behavior.

Failure Signatures: Potential failures include the instruction network failing to generalize from limited video data, leading to incorrect behavioral guidance. The method may also struggle if the Do's and Don'ts videos are ambiguous or contradictory, causing confusion in the learned distance metric.

First Experiments: 
1. Test instruction network classification accuracy on held-out Do's and Don'ts videos
2. Evaluate distance metric by checking if it correctly ranks behavioral similarity
3. Run skill discovery with only the instruction network reward (no distance maximization) to isolate its effects

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Scalability to complex real-world scenarios with noisy or low-quality instructional data remains uncertain
- Evaluation is limited to simulated environments, with unknown performance in real robotic systems with sensor noise and actuator limitations
- The method's effectiveness with ambiguous behavioral boundaries or nuanced decision-making tasks has not been tested

## Confidence
- Effectiveness of DoDont in steering skill discovery toward desirable behaviors: Medium
- Superiority over manual reward design for balancing behavioral objectives: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test DoDont on more complex manipulation tasks requiring precise motor control and fine-grained behavioral discrimination
2. Evaluate performance degradation when using low-quality or ambiguous instruction videos to assess robustness to real-world data
3. Implement and test DoDont on a real robotic platform to validate simulation results in physical environments with sensor noise and actuator limitations
