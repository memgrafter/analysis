# Boosting Disfluency Detection with Large Language Model as Disfluency Generator

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.08229
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08229
- Authors: Zhenrong Cheng; Jiayan Guo; Hao Sun; Yan Zhang
- Reference count: 34
- Primary result: Achieves state-of-the-art disfluency detection with only 6.4K LLM-generated sentences

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a lightweight data augmentation approach for disfluency detection that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate realistic disfluent sentences without fine-tuning. The method uses specific prompts to guide LLM generation, followed by uncertainty-aware data filtering to improve sentence quality. By distilling LLM knowledge into small detection models, the approach achieves state-of-the-art results with minimal augmented data, demonstrating efficiency and cost-effectiveness compared to traditional approaches requiring extensive manual annotation.

## Method Summary
The method employs text-davinci-003 to generate disfluent sentences from fluent examples using description and generation prompts. An ELECTRA-based model filters the generated sentences by uncertainty, removing those with low-confidence disfluent labels. Detection models (BERT, RoBERTa, ELECTRA) are then fine-tuned on the original Switchboard dataset combined with the filtered generated data (DisAug). The approach achieves significant performance improvements while using only 6.4K generated sentences, proving more efficient than traditional data augmentation methods.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art disfluency detection performance on Switchboard dataset
- Requires only 6.4K generated disfluent sentences for significant improvement
- Demonstrates cost-effectiveness compared to traditional annotation or fine-tuning approaches
- Successfully distills LLM knowledge into lightweight detection models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLM generates realistic disfluent sentences without fine-tuning
- Mechanism: The LLM uses prompt-guided generation based on example sentences with POS tags and disfluency annotations, allowing it to produce diverse and human-like disfluencies
- Core assumption: LLMs can understand disfluency concepts from descriptive prompts and generate realistic instances without parameter updates
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We leverage LLM to generate diverse and more realistic sentences guided by specific prompts, without the need for fine-tuning the LLM."
  - [section III.B.1]: "Description Prompt" and "Generation Prompt" sections show how descriptive and example-based prompts guide LLM
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no direct citations of prior work using LLM for disfluency generation without fine-tuning
- Break condition: If LLM lacks sufficient understanding of disfluency concepts or cannot generate varied disfluency types from prompts alone

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Uncertainty-aware filtering improves quality of generated disfluent sentences
- Mechanism: The filtering approach computes average predicted probabilities of disfluent labels and removes sentences with probabilities below a threshold, ensuring only high-confidence disfluent sentences are used
- Core assumption: Lower predicted probabilities for disfluent labels indicate lower quality or unrealistic disfluencies
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Subsequently, we apply an uncertainty-aware data filtering approach to improve the quality of the generated sentences"
  - [section III.B.2]: "The uncertainty measure is computed by averaging the predicted probabilities of words labeled as disfluent"
  - [section IV.B.1]: "Figure 2 shows the number of disfluent sentences filtered by different label confidence thresholds"
- Break condition: If the filtering threshold is too strict (removes too many sentences) or too lenient (allows poor quality sentences)

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Knowledge distillation from LLM to small detection models improves efficiency
- Mechanism: By training small detection models on LLM-generated data, the knowledge and capabilities of the large LLM are distilled into more efficient models suitable for practical deployment
- Core assumption: The small detection models can effectively learn from the LLM-generated data and generalize to real disfluencies
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "This approach distills the knowledge from LLM into small detector models, resulting in efficient and lightweight models"
  - [section III.B.3]: "We aim to use data augmentation to enable simple models to perform better"
  - [section IV.B.2]: "Incorporating DisAug into SWBD for training the ELECTRA model achieved SOTA results"
- Break condition: If the small models cannot learn effectively from the generated data or if the generated data doesn't generalize well to real disfluencies

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Disfluency types and structure
  - Why needed here: Understanding the different types of disfluencies (repetition, substitution, deletion, etc.) and their typical structure is essential for designing effective prompts and evaluating generated data
  - Quick check question: What are the three main categories of disfluencies according to Shriberg et al., and what are their typical structural elements?

- Concept: Data augmentation and knowledge distillation
  - Why needed here: The approach relies on generating synthetic training data and transferring knowledge from a large model to smaller ones, which requires understanding these fundamental ML concepts
  - Quick check question: How does data augmentation help address data sparsity, and what is the purpose of knowledge distillation in this context?

- Concept: Sequence labeling and model evaluation
  - Why needed here: Disfluency detection is framed as a sequence labeling task, and understanding evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score is crucial for assessing model performance
  - Quick check question: In the context of disfluency detection, what do the I and O labels represent in sequence labeling, and how are they used to compute precision and recall?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - LLM (text-davinci-003) -> ELECTRA-based filtering model -> Detection model (BERT/RoBERTa/ELECTRA)
  - DisAug dataset: Filtered LLM-generated disfluent sentences

- Critical path:
  1. Generate disfluent sentences using LLM with description and generation prompts
  2. Filter generated sentences using ELECTRA-based uncertainty measure
  3. Train detection model on SWBD + filtered generated data
  4. Evaluate performance on test set

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using LLM without fine-tuning vs. fine-tuning for better quality but higher cost
  - Larger filtering threshold (fewer but higher quality sentences) vs. smaller threshold (more data but potentially lower quality)
  - Simple detection models (more efficient) vs. complex models (potentially better performance)

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance despite large amount of generated data: suggests filtering threshold is too low or LLM prompts are ineffective
  - High computational cost: indicates need to optimize detection model size or filtering process
  - Model overfits to generated data: suggests generated data is too different from real disfluencies or insufficient real training data

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Generate disfluent sentences using LLM with description prompt only vs. description + generation prompts, compare quality and diversity
  2. Train detection model on SWBD only vs. SWBD + unfiltered generated data, measure performance difference
  3. Vary filtering threshold (0.3, 0.5, 0.7), measure impact on F1-score and number of filtered sentences

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of disfluency detection models vary with different LLM sizes or architectures when used for data generation?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses OpenAI's text-davinci-003 language model for disfluency generation but does not explore how different LLM sizes or architectures might affect the quality or diversity of generated disfluent sentences.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on a single LLM model for generation, limiting the understanding of how LLM characteristics impact the effectiveness of the data augmentation approach.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments using different LLM models of varying sizes and architectures to generate disfluent data, then comparing the performance of detection models trained on each dataset.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the proposed disfluency generation method be effectively adapted for other languages beyond English?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The study focuses on English disfluency detection using the Switchboard dataset and does not address the applicability of the method to other languages.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore cross-linguistic applications or the challenges of adapting the approach to languages with different disfluency patterns or linguistic structures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing the proposed method for disfluency detection in other languages and evaluating its performance on language-specific datasets.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of the maximum generation round (max round) hyperparameter on the quality and diversity of generated disfluent sentences?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions setting a maximum number of generation rounds but does not provide a detailed analysis of how this hyperparameter affects the generated data or model performance.
- Why unresolved: The study does not explore the sensitivity of the approach to different values of the max round parameter or its optimal setting for different scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with varying max round values to assess their impact on the quality of generated disfluent sentences and the performance of detection models trained on the resulting datasets.

## Limitations

- Reproducibility challenge: Specific example sentences and exact prompt formats are not provided, making faithful reproduction difficult
- Limited evaluation scope: Only tested on Switchboard dataset without validation on other disfluency detection benchmarks
- Quality validation: Generated disfluency quality relies on automated filtering rather than human evaluation

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The core claim that LLM-generated disfluent sentences can improve detection performance when properly filtered and distilled to smaller models is well-supported by the experimental results. The methodology is sound and the results are reproducible given the same prompts.

**Medium confidence**: The claim that the approach achieves state-of-the-art results with minimal augmented data is moderately supported but limited by the single dataset evaluation. The 6.4K sentence threshold appears effective but may not generalize to other datasets or domains.

**Low confidence**: The assertion that this approach is significantly more cost-effective than traditional methods lacks quantitative comparison. The quality assessment of generated disfluencies relies on automated filtering rather than human evaluation, which may not accurately capture linguistic quality.

## Next Checks

1. **Prompt quality validation**: Conduct human evaluation of LLM-generated disfluent sentences using the same prompts described in the paper. Compare quality, diversity, and realism against human-annotated disfluencies to validate the generation mechanism.

2. **Cross-dataset generalization**: Evaluate the trained detection models on alternative disfluency detection datasets (e.g., Fisher Corpus, BNC) to assess whether the 6.4K sentence augmentation threshold remains effective across different data distributions and speaking styles.

3. **Cost-benefit analysis**: Measure and compare the actual computational costs (API calls, fine-tuning time, inference time) of the LLM-based augmentation approach against traditional data augmentation methods and human annotation for equivalent amounts of disfluent training data.
