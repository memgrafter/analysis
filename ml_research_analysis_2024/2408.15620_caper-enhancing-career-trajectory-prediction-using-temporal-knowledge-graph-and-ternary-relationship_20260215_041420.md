# CAPER: Enhancing Career Trajectory Prediction using Temporal Knowledge Graph and Ternary Relationship

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.15620
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15620
- Reference count: 40
- Outperforms 11 competitors with 6.80% and 34.58% more accurate company and position predictions

## Executive Summary
CAPER addresses career trajectory prediction by modeling the mutual ternary dependency between users, positions, and companies as a temporal knowledge graph. It uses GCN and GRNN encoders to capture both mutual dependency and temporal dynamics, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods. The approach significantly improves prediction accuracy by preserving the triadic relationships inherent in career moves and tracking entity evolution over time.

## Method Summary
CAPER represents career trajectories as a temporal knowledge graph where edges connect users to companies with position labels. The model uses a GCN encoder to aggregate position information from neighboring careers at each timestamp, then applies a GRNN encoder to track how user experience and company characteristics evolve over time. Trained on a real-world career trajectory dataset, CAPER predicts future companies and positions by iteratively constructing KG snapshots and computing likelihood scores.

## Key Results
- Achieves 6.80% more accurate company predictions on average compared to 11 competitors
- Yields 34.58% improvement in position prediction accuracy
- Demonstrates consistent performance gains across multiple evaluation metrics (MRR and Accuracy@K)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Ternary relationship modeling (user, position, company) captures richer career dynamics than pairwise methods
- Mechanism: By representing careers as edges between user and company nodes labeled with position, CAPER preserves the full triadic dependency that influences career moves
- Core assumption: The position attribute carries critical semantic information that jointly determines career transitions
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "jointly considers the mutual ternary dependency between three key units (i.e., user, position, and company) of a career"
  - [section 4.4.1] "CAPER preserves the intense interaction on three highly-correlated units, i.e., a user, a company, and a position, which form each career"
- Break condition: If positions become so generic that they no longer distinguish career paths meaningfully, ternary modeling loses advantage

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Temporal embeddings capture entity evolution better than static representations
- Mechanism: By treating the same user/company at different timestamps as separate embeddings and tracking their evolution through GRNN, CAPER models how experience and company characteristics change over time
- Core assumption: Users and companies undergo meaningful characteristic shifts that affect future career trajectories
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "captures the characteristic shifts of key units in career over time"
  - [section 4.3] "CAPER obtains each user 𝑢𝑥's (resp. each company 𝑐𝑧's) evolution embedding ˜u𝑥(𝑡𝑚) (resp. ˜c𝑧(𝑡𝑚)) with respect to 𝑡𝑚 as follows"
- Break condition: If career patterns become predominantly static (e.g., in industries with low turnover), temporal evolution modeling adds unnecessary complexity

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Graph convolution aggregates contextual career information effectively
- Mechanism: GCN layers aggregate position information from neighboring careers at each timestamp, allowing each entity embedding to incorporate multi-hop career context
- Core assumption: Career decisions depend not just on direct experience but also on the broader career context of similar users/companies
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2] "CAPER obtains each user 𝑢𝑥's (resp. each company 𝑐𝑧's) temporal embeddingu𝑥(𝑡𝑚) (resp. c𝑧(𝑡𝑚)) with respect to 𝑡𝑚 by aggregating career information of 𝑢𝑥 (resp. 𝑐𝑧) at 𝑡𝑚"
- Break condition: If career decisions are primarily idiosyncratic and context-insensitive, aggregation provides diminishing returns

## Foundational Learning

- Temporal knowledge graphs
  - Why needed here: Career trajectories are inherently temporal, with entities evolving over time
  - Quick check question: How would you represent a user who worked as "Software Engineer" at Google in 2015 and "Senior Engineer" at Microsoft in 2020 using TKG?

- Graph neural networks
  - Why needed here: To aggregate contextual career information from neighboring entities in the knowledge graph
  - Quick check question: What information would a user's embedding contain after one GCN layer if they have worked as both "Engineer" and "Manager" at different companies?

- Recurrent neural networks for temporal dynamics
  - Why needed here: To capture how user experience and company characteristics evolve across time steps
  - Quick check question: How would you initialize the evolution embedding for a user's first career timestamp?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Career trajectories (user, position, company, timestamp) -> TKG Construction -> GCN Encoder -> GRNN Encoder -> Prediction Layer -> Ranked predictions

- Critical path:
  1. Build TKG snapshots from training data
  2. Initialize temporal and evolution embeddings
  3. For each timestamp, run GCN to update temporal embeddings
  4. Run GRNN to update evolution embeddings
  5. Train using negative log-likelihood loss
  6. For inference, iteratively predict future careers and construct KG snapshots

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Static vs. temporal position embeddings: CAPER uses static position embeddings based on experimental evidence
  - GCN depth: Single layer chosen to balance expressiveness and overfitting risk
  - GRNN type: LSTM selected for stable long-term dependencies

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on company prediction vs position prediction: May indicate position embeddings are too coarse or too fine-grained
  - Accuracy degradation with longer prediction horizons: Suggests temporal evolution modeling needs refinement
  - Slow convergence during training: Could indicate learning rate or embedding dimensionality issues

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare CAPER with and without temporal evolution modeling (w/o GRNN) to validate Mechanism 2
  2. Compare CAPER with static position embeddings vs. temporal position embeddings to validate the position embedding design choice
  3. Vary GCN layer depth (1-3 layers) to find optimal aggregation depth for Mechanism 3

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can CAPER be adapted to handle the inductive setting where new users, companies, and positions appear during the prediction phase?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges that CAPER is currently designed for the transductive setting and mentions that it can leverage GCN's inductive ability but leaves sophisticated design for inductive setting as future work.
- Why unresolved: The paper only briefly mentions the possibility of using GCN's inductive ability for new nodes but doesn't provide any concrete methods or experiments for handling truly unseen entities in the CTP problem.
- What evidence would resolve it: A proposed architecture or methodology for extending CAPER to the inductive setting, along with experimental results comparing its performance against the current transductive approach.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of using different time granularities (e.g., months, quarters) on the performance of CAPER for career trajectory prediction?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the granularity of a timestamp is year in their dataset and conducts an additional experiment with 6-month granularity, but doesn't extensively explore other granularities.
- Why unresolved: The paper only briefly mentions the possibility of using different time granularities but doesn't provide a comprehensive analysis of how varying granularities might affect the model's performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study comparing CAPER's performance across multiple time granularities (e.g., monthly, quarterly, yearly) with detailed analysis of trade-offs between granularity and prediction accuracy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of CAPER change when considering positions that do change significantly over time, contrary to the paper's assumption?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges that some positions may change significantly over time (e.g., data scientists) but assumes most positions have static properties and leaves identification of such positions as future work.
- Why unresolved: The paper makes an assumption about position characteristics being mostly static but doesn't explore scenarios where this assumption doesn't hold, nor does it propose methods to identify and handle such dynamic positions.
- What evidence would resolve it: An experimental study identifying positions that change significantly over time and evaluating CAPER's performance when these positions are treated as dynamic rather than static, along with methods to automatically detect such positions.

## Limitations

- Limited ablation studies to isolate individual component contributions
- Comparison with only 11 competitors without detailed descriptions
- Real-world dataset details remain undisclosed, affecting generalizability assessment

## Confidence

- High confidence: The ternary relationship modeling mechanism is well-founded and addresses a clear gap in existing methods
- Medium confidence: The temporal evolution modeling shows promise but requires more rigorous ablation studies
- Low confidence: The claim of 6.80% and 34.58% improvements lacks sufficient context about baseline methods and dataset characteristics

## Next Checks

1. Conduct detailed ablation studies comparing CAPER with variants that disable individual components (TKG modeling, GCN aggregation, GRNN evolution tracking) to quantify their individual contributions
2. Test CAPER on additional career trajectory datasets from different platforms to assess generalizability beyond the single dataset used
3. Implement and compare against state-of-the-art temporal knowledge graph methods from other domains to establish CAPER's relative positioning in the broader literature
