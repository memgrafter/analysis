# Explorations in Texture Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.09543
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09543
- Reference count: 8
- This paper investigates texture learning in CNNs by building texture-object associations using a pretrained ResNet50 model.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates texture learning in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by building texture-object associations. The authors use a pretrained ResNet50 model to classify texture images from the Describable Textures Dataset (DTD) as ImageNet object classes, measuring the strength of associations between texture classes and object classes. Their analysis reveals three types of results: expected and strongly present associations (e.g., honeycombed textures strongly associated with honeycomb objects), not expected but strongly present associations (e.g., polka-dotted and dotted textures strongly associated with bib objects), and expected but not present associations (e.g., scaly textures not associated with fish or reptile objects). The findings demonstrate that investigating texture learning can uncover unexpected biases in models and enable new methods for interpretability.

## Method Summary
The method involves using a pretrained ResNet50 model to classify texture images from the Describable Textures Dataset (DTD) as ImageNet object classes. For each texture class, the effect size is calculated as the ratio of texture samples classified as a specific object class. This creates an association table showing which object classes each texture is most strongly linked to. The analysis then categorizes these associations into expected/strongly present, not expected/strongly present, and expected/not present relationships based on manual inspection of the ImageNet training data.

## Key Results
- Honeycombed textures were classified as the honeycomb object 73.1% of the time, demonstrating strong expected associations
- Polka-dotted and dotted textures were strongly associated with bib objects (24.5% and 18.4% respectively), revealing unexpected biases
- Scaly texture images were not associated with any fish or reptile objects, showing expected associations that were absent

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Texture-object associations can reveal model biases that are not apparent from standard accuracy metrics.
- Mechanism: By inputting texture-only images from DTD into a model trained on ImageNet objects, the method measures how strongly certain textures are associated with specific object classes. Strong unexpected associations (like polka-dotted textures linked to bibs) indicate that the model has learned texture-based shortcuts rather than shape-based recognition.
- Core assumption: The model's texture bias is consistent across different datasets (ImageNet-trained model applied to DTD textures).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our analysis demonstrates that investigations in texture learning enable new methods for interpretability and have the potential to uncover unexpected biases."
  - [section] "This finding demonstrates that texture learning analysis may be a fruitful direction for uncovering biases in models."
  - [corpus] Weak corpus match - most related papers focus on texture synthesis rather than texture-object bias analysis.
- Break condition: If the model's texture bias varies significantly between datasets or if texture representations are not transferable across domains.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Effect size calculation reveals the strength of texture-object associations by measuring classification frequency.
- Mechanism: For each texture-object pairing, the effect size is computed as the ratio of texture samples classified as the object class. Higher ratios indicate stronger associations, allowing researchers to identify which textures the model relies on most heavily.
- Core assumption: Classification confidence is proportional to the strength of the learned association between texture and object.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "the effect size for texture class A and object class B represents how many samples belonging to texture class A were predicted to be object class B"
  - [section] "Thus, higher effect sizes correspond to stronger texture-object associations."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence - this is a novel methodological contribution.
- Break condition: If the model's softmax outputs are not reliable indicators of association strength, or if classification confidence is influenced by factors other than learned associations.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Investigating expected vs. unexpected associations provides insight into model generalization capabilities.
- Mechanism: By categorizing results into expected/strongly present, not expected/strongly present, and expected/not present, researchers can understand whether models generalize textures appropriately or learn dataset-specific shortcuts.
- Core assumption: The distinction between expected and unexpected associations is meaningful for understanding model behavior.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We divide into three types based on (a) how expected the relationship between texture and object is... and (b) the strength of the association that emerged in our results."
  - [section] Examples like "honeycombed textures...classified as the honeycomb object 73.1% of the time" (expected/strong) versus "scaly texture images...not associated with any fish or reptile objects" (expected/not present).
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence - this analytical framework appears to be novel.
- Break condition: If the human judgment of "expectedness" is inconsistent or if the three-category system fails to capture important nuances in the data.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Texture bias in CNNs
  - Why needed here: The entire methodology relies on understanding that CNNs prioritize texture over shape, which is the foundational premise for why texture-object associations are meaningful.
  - Quick check question: Why do CNNs show texture bias rather than shape bias like human vision?

- Concept: Effect size and statistical association measurement
  - Why needed here: The method uses effect size ratios to quantify the strength of texture-object associations, which requires understanding of basic statistical measurement concepts.
  - Quick check question: If 50 out of 100 polka-dotted texture samples are classified as bibs, what is the effect size?

- Concept: Dataset domain shift and transfer learning
  - Why needed here: The method applies an ImageNet-trained model to DTD textures, which requires understanding how models transfer knowledge across different data domains.
  - Quick check question: What assumptions are made when applying a model trained on one dataset to evaluate completely different types of data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: DTD texture images → preprocessing (resize, crop, normalize) → ResNet50 model → effect size calculation → association table generation
- Critical path: Texture image preprocessing → model classification → effect size computation → interpretation of associations
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using a fixed ResNet50 model vs. exploring multiple architectures
  - Top-1 classification vs. incorporating confidence scores
  - Manual vs. automated identification of unexpected associations
- Failure signatures:
  - Uniform effect sizes across all texture-object pairs (indicates model not learning texture associations)
  - Perfect correlation with human expectations (may indicate method not revealing new insights)
  - Extremely low effect sizes overall (may indicate poor model performance or inappropriate dataset pairing)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run the full pipeline on a subset of DTD textures (e.g., 5 texture classes) to verify the methodology works
  2. Compare effect sizes between ResNet50 and a different architecture (e.g., VGG16) to test consistency
  3. Manually inspect a few strong unexpected associations in the ImageNet training data to verify the hypothesis generation capability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the strength of texture-object associations vary across different CNN architectures (e.g., ResNet50 vs ResNet152)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors report texture-object associations for both ResNet50 and ResNet152 in Appendix A.3, showing different effect sizes for the same texture-object pairs.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not analyze or compare the differences in associations between the two architectures. It's unclear whether these differences are systematic or random.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative analysis of association strengths across multiple architectures, testing for statistical significance and identifying patterns in architectural differences.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Do texture-object associations persist when models are trained on datasets other than ImageNet, such as CIFAR-100 or domain-specific datasets?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors note that their ResNet50 model was trained on ImageNet and evaluated on DTD textures, but do not explore how training data affects texture learning.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on a single pretrained model and dataset combination, leaving open the question of whether texture biases are dataset-specific or more general.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training and evaluating multiple models on different datasets, then comparing their texture-object associations to identify dataset-dependent patterns.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can texture-object associations be used to detect and mitigate unintended biases in training data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest that their methodology "can highlight and identify specific unwanted biases in models" and provide an example of polka-dot textures being strongly associated with bibs.
- Why unresolved: While the authors demonstrate detection of one bias, they do not propose or test methods for using these associations to actively mitigate biases.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and validating a framework that uses texture-object associations to identify problematic training examples, then retraining models with balanced texture representations.

## Limitations
- Dataset Dependency: The method relies on texture-object associations that may be specific to the DTD-ImageNet pairing rather than universal model properties.
- Subjectivity in "Expectedness": The categorization of results relies on human judgment about whether texture-object relationships "should" exist, introducing potential bias.
- Limited Scope of Analysis: The study focuses on a single pretrained model (ResNet50) and specific texture dataset, limiting generalizability.

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The methodology for computing effect sizes and identifying texture-object associations is clearly specified and reproducible.
- Medium Confidence: The interpretation of unexpected associations as revealing model biases is plausible but requires additional validation.
- Low Confidence: The claim that this approach enables "new methods for interpretability" is aspirational and not empirically demonstrated.

## Next Checks
1. Apply the same methodology to a different texture dataset (e.g., KTH-TIPS) with the same pretrained model to verify whether the same unexpected associations emerge.
2. Run the analysis across multiple architectures (e.g., VGG, Inception, Vision Transformers) to determine if texture-object associations are consistent across different model families.
3. Conduct a systematic examination of the ImageNet training data for the strongest unexpected associations to verify whether they are spurious or reflect legitimate co-occurrences.
