core_contribution: This paper proposes belief change theory as a formal foundation
  for interactive explainable AI (XAI), where users can provide feedback to AI models
  in the form of logical rules. The authors define a novel logic-based formalism to
  represent explanatory information shared between humans and machines, and analyze
  how belief revision postulates can be instantiated to handle different interactive
  XAI scenarios with varying prioritizations of new versus existing knowledge.

# Advancing Interactive Explainable AI via Belief Change Theory

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2408.06875
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06875
- **Reference count**: 10
- **Primary result**: Proposes belief change theory as a formal foundation for interactive explainable AI

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes belief change theory as a formal foundation for interactive explainable AI (XAI), where users can provide feedback to AI models in the form of logical rules. The authors define a novel logic-based formalism to represent explanatory information shared between humans and machines, and analyze how belief revision postulates can be instantiated to handle different interactive XAI scenarios with varying prioritizations of new versus existing knowledge. They argue this approach provides a principled framework for developing interactive explanations that promote transparency, interpretability, and accountability in human-AI interactions. The paper discusses the strengths and weaknesses of applying belief revision postulates to their formalism, pointing to challenges that may require relaxing or reinterpreting some theoretical assumptions.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a logic-based formalism for interactive XAI that incorporates belief change theory. They define a formal system where explanatory information between humans and machines is represented using logical rules, and establish how belief revision postulates can be applied to handle user feedback in different scenarios. The framework allows for systematic analysis of how new information should be integrated with existing knowledge, with different configurations of belief revision postulates corresponding to different priorities in the interactive XAI process.

## Key Results
- Introduces a formal logic-based framework for interactive XAI using belief change theory
- Defines how belief revision postulates can be instantiated to handle various interactive XAI scenarios
- Provides a principled approach for transparency, interpretability, and accountability in human-AI interactions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper argues that belief change theory provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for handling the dynamic nature of interactive XAI systems. By formalizing user feedback as logical rules and applying established belief revision principles, the framework can systematically determine how to update AI models while maintaining consistency with prior knowledge. The approach leverages decades of research in formal logic and belief revision to provide a structured way to handle the inherent uncertainty and evolving understanding in human-AI interactions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Belief Revision Postulates**: Formal rules for updating knowledge bases when new information is received. Needed to provide a principled approach to knowledge integration. Quick check: Can be validated by testing whether they satisfy standard AGM postulates.
- **Logic-based Formalisms**: Mathematical representations using logical rules. Needed to precisely capture explanatory information. Quick check: Can be evaluated by assessing expressiveness and consistency.
- **Interactive XAI Frameworks**: Systems allowing user feedback to influence AI models. Needed to enable human-AI collaboration. Quick check: Can be measured by user satisfaction and model performance improvements.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: User Feedback -> Logical Rule Parser -> Belief Revision Engine -> Updated Model -> Explanation Generator
- **Critical Path**: User feedback is parsed into logical rules, which are then processed by the belief revision engine to update the model, with explanations generated for the user
- **Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades off between strict adherence to belief revision postulates and practical usability, as the theoretical assumptions may not always align with real-world user behavior
- **Failure Signatures**: Inconsistencies may arise when user feedback cannot be accurately captured as logical rules, or when belief revision postulates lead to unintuitive model updates
- **First Experiments**:
  1. Test the logical rule parser with various forms of user feedback
  2. Evaluate the belief revision engine's performance with different configurations of postulates
  3. Conduct user studies to assess the interpretability and usefulness of generated explanations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The framework assumes human feedback can be accurately captured as logical rules, which may oversimplify human reasoning
- Theoretical tensions exist between belief revision postulates and practical implementation
- Real-world applicability and feasibility of the approach remain uncertain

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The paper's identification of the need for more formal foundations in interactive XAI
- **Medium confidence**: The proposed belief change theory framework's theoretical soundness
- **Low confidence**: Practical applicability and real-world implementation feasibility

## Next Checks
1. Conduct user studies to test whether humans naturally express feedback in logical rule formats as assumed by the formalism
2. Implement a prototype system to evaluate how well belief revision postulates handle real interactive XAI scenarios with actual user feedback
3. Compare the performance and user satisfaction of this approach against existing interactive XAI methods in controlled experiments
