# A Black Swan Hypothesis: The Role of Human Irrationality in AI Safety

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2407.18422
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18422
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Introduces spatial black swan (S-BLACK SWAN) events in stationary environments caused by human misperception, with formal MDP framework and convergence proofs

## Executive Summary
This paper challenges the traditional view that black swan events only arise in non-stationary environments by introducing the concept of spatial black swan (S-BLACK SWAN) events. These rare, high-risk occurrences happen in stationary environments due to human misperception of event likelihoods and rewards. The authors formalize this phenomenon using Markov Decision Processes and Cumulative Prospect Theory, proving that while value estimation errors converge to zero over time, a non-zero lower bound on the value perception gap persists. This work provides theoretical foundations for developing algorithms to prevent such events through perception correction.

## Method Summary
The authors formalize spatial black swan events using a Markov Decision Process framework where human misperception is modeled as distortion functions for rewards (u) and probabilities (w). They define S-BLACK SWAN as state-action pairs perceived as impossible but occurring with small probability while offering higher rewards than perceived. The framework proves that while value estimation errors converge to zero over time, a non-zero lower bound on the value perception gap persists, growing with reward distortion and S-BLACK SWAN event frequency. The paper also provides a hitting time theorem showing how often perception correction algorithms must be executed based on misperception magnitude and event frequency.

## Key Results
- Value estimation error converges to zero as trajectory length increases, but value perception gap has a non-zero lower bound
- S-BLACK SWAN events occur when perceived probability of success is zero but actual probability is non-zero, with rewards exceeding distorted expectations
- Theorem 5 provides hitting time calculations showing more frequent corrections are needed for larger reward distortions and higher event probabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Spatial black swan events can occur in stationary environments due to human misperception of event probabilities and rewards.
- **Mechanism:** The paper introduces a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework where human misperception is modeled as distortion functions (u for rewards, w for probabilities) that create gaps between perceived and actual values. These distortions lead to situations where rare high-risk events are perceived as impossible but actually occur, creating suboptimal decisions.
- **Core assumption:** Human decision-making can be modeled using Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) with specific distortion functions for gains/losses and probabilities.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "high-risk, statistically rare events can also occur in unchanging environments due to human misperception of their value and likelihood, which we refer to as S-BLACK SWAN"
  - [section 1] "Hypothesis 1. Black swans can originate from misperceptions of an event's reward and likelihood, even within static environments"
  - [corpus] Weak - the related papers focus on extreme value optimization and rare events but don't directly address stationary environment misperceptions
- **Break condition:** If human perception accurately reflects reality (no distortion), or if the environment is non-stationary (where traditional black swans occur), this mechanism would not explain S-BLACK SWAN events.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** The value perception gap has a non-zero lower bound that persists even with perfect estimation over time.
- **Mechanism:** While value estimation error converges to zero as horizon length increases (Theorem 4, Equation 3), the perception gap between the Human MDP (M†) and ground truth MDP (M) has a fundamental lower bound determined by the extent of reward distortion (Cbs), the number of S-BLACK SWAN events, and their minimum probability of occurrence.
- **Core assumption:** The distortion functions u and w are bounded and satisfy specific convexity/concavity conditions that create persistent perception gaps.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 6.2] "Equation (3) demonstrates that the value estimation error converges to zero as the agent rolls out longer trajectories. However, Equation (4) reveals that the value perception gap has a non-zero lower bound"
  - [theorem 4] "the asymptotic convergence of the value function estimation holds as follows, V π ̂M†(s)→V π M†(s) a.s. as T→∞, ∀s, π∈S×Π"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence in related papers about persistent perception gaps in stationary environments
- **Break condition:** If perception distortion functions approach safe perception functions (u−→u−⋆ and w−→w−⋆), the lower bound would approach zero.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** The frequency of perception correction algorithms depends on the magnitude of misperception and event frequency.
- **Mechanism:** Theorem 5 provides a hitting time theorem showing that larger reward distortion (Rmax−Rbs) and higher minimum probability of S-BLACK SWAN occurrence (ϵmin bs) require more frequent execution of self-perception correction algorithms. The theorem calculates how many steps are needed to encounter S-BLACK SWAN events with at least probability δ.
- **Core assumption:** One-step state reachability under optimal policy is non-zero (Pπ⋆(s′∣s) > 0 for any s, s′∈S).
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 6.2] "Theorem 5 examines S-BLACK SWAN hitting time, showing that larger reward distortion and higher S-BLACK SWAN probability necessitate more frequent updates to human perception functions"
  - [theorem 5] "if the agent takes t steps such that t ≥log( δ pmin )/ log(1−pmax)+ 1, where pmin = Rmax−Rbs 2Rmax ϵmin bs and pmax = Rmax−Rbs 2Rmax ϵbs, it will encounter S-BLACK SWAN with at least probabilityδ ∈(0, 1]"
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers on safe RL focus on constraint-based approaches but don't address perception correction frequency in stationary environments
- **Break condition:** If misperception is minimal or S-BLACK SWAN events are extremely rare, correction frequency would be low.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and value function optimization
  - Why needed here: The entire framework is built on MDPs where agents make sequential decisions, and the paper analyzes how perception distortions affect optimal policy selection
  - Quick check question: What is the Bellman equation for the value function in an MDP with discount factor γ?

- **Concept:** Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) and probability distortion
  - Why needed here: CPT provides the mathematical framework for modeling human misperception through distortion functions u (value) and w (probability), which are central to defining S-BLACK SWAN events
  - Quick check question: How does the probability distortion function w in CPT differ from the value distortion function u in terms of their mathematical properties?

- **Concept:** Concentration inequalities and empirical distribution convergence
  - Why needed here: The proofs rely on Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz (DKW) inequality to show that empirical distributions converge to true distributions, which is crucial for establishing the asymptotic convergence of value estimation
  - Quick check question: What does the DKW inequality state about the relationship between empirical and true cumulative distribution functions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Ground Truth MDP (M) -> Human MDP (M†) -> Human-Estimation MDP (M̂†) -> Perception Correction Module

- **Critical path:**
  1. Agent interacts with environment and collects trajectories
  2. Trajectories are distorted through perception functions u and w
  3. Agent estimates value functions in M̂†
  4. Comparison between M and M† reveals perception gaps
  5. S-BLACK SWAN events are identified based on Definition 4/5
  6. Perception correction algorithms are triggered based on Theorem 5's hitting time

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Conservative vs. aggressive perception correction: Frequent corrections ensure safety but may be computationally expensive
  - Model complexity vs. estimation accuracy: More complex distortion models may better capture human irrationality but are harder to estimate
  - Reward vs. probability distortion emphasis: The framework allows different levels of distortion for rewards and probabilities, requiring careful tuning

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Persistent suboptimal policies despite long training horizons (indicating non-zero perception gap)
  - High frequency of S-BLACK SWAN events in stationary environments (indicating severe misperception)
  - Value estimation errors that don't converge as expected (indicating issues with the distortion model)

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Implement a simple bandit environment where human misperception causes suboptimal choices, verify that π⋆≠π⋆,†
  2. Create a two-state MDP and demonstrate that optimal policies diverge when ∣S∣=3 but not when ∣S∣=2, validating Theorems 2 and 3
  3. Simulate a stationary environment with controlled S-BLACK SWAN events and measure the lower bound on value perception gap as predicted by Theorem 4

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The framework relies heavily on accurate modeling of human misperception through CPT distortion functions, which may not capture full complexity of human irrationality
- Theoretical results assume bounded distortion functions and specific convexity/concavity conditions that may not hold in real-world scenarios
- Lower bound on value perception gap is expressed in terms of abstract parameters (Cbs, Rbs) that may be difficult to estimate in practice

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** The core mechanism that spatial black swan events can occur in stationary environments due to perception distortion is well-supported by the MDP framework and CPT foundations
- **Medium confidence:** The theoretical proofs showing non-zero lower bounds on perception gaps and hitting time calculations are mathematically sound but rely on idealized assumptions about distortion function properties
- **Low confidence:** Practical applicability of the perception correction algorithms in real-world systems with complex human decision-making patterns

## Next Checks
1. Empirical validation of Theorem 4's lower bound prediction using controlled experiments with varying levels of reward distortion (Rmax−Rbs) and S-BLACK SWAN frequency (ϵmin bs)
2. Implementation and testing of the perception correction algorithm in a real-world decision-making system (e.g., autonomous vehicle routing) to measure actual vs. predicted correction frequencies
3. Comparative analysis between the proposed stationary environment approach and traditional non-stationary black swan detection methods across multiple benchmark environments
