# TSCheater: Generating High-Quality Tibetan Adversarial Texts via Visual Similarity
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.02371
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02371
- Reference count: 26
- Addresses lack of research on adversarial attacks for low-resource languages like Tibetan

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TSCheater, a method for generating adversarial Tibetan text by exploiting the visual similarity of Tibetan syllables. The authors construct TSVSDB, a database of visually similar Tibetan syllables using Normalized Cross-Correlation Coefficient, and employ a greedy algorithm-based scoring mechanism to determine optimal substitution order. TSCheater demonstrates superior attack effectiveness, perturbation magnitude, semantic similarity, visual similarity, and human acceptance compared to existing methods on eight victim language models. The work also establishes the first Tibetan adversarial robustness evaluation benchmark called AdvTS.

## Method Summary
TSCheater generates adversarial Tibetan text by leveraging visual similarity between Tibetan syllables. It constructs TSVSDB using CCOEFF NORMED to measure visual similarity between all syllable pairs. The method segments input text into syllables and words, generates substitution candidates from TSVSDB based on visual similarity thresholds, and uses probability-weighted word saliency to determine substitution order. Substitutions are applied sequentially until the language model's classification changes or the attack fails. The approach considers both syllable-level and word-level attacks, with syllable-level offering better visual similarity and perturbation magnitude.

## Key Results
- TSCheater outperforms existing methods on eight victim language models
- Achieves high human acceptance ratings (4-5 out of 5) while maintaining attack effectiveness
- Successfully demonstrates transferability potential to other abugida scripts like Devanagari
- Establishes AdvTS, the first Tibetan adversarial robustness evaluation benchmark

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Visual similarity of Tibetan syllables enables effective adversarial substitutions.
- Mechanism: The method leverages Normalized Cross-Correlation Coefficient (CCOEFF NORMED) to measure visual similarity between Tibetan syllables, identifying visually similar syllables that are semantically related. These substitutions create adversarial examples that maintain visual and semantic similarity while fooling language models.
- Core assumption: Visually similar syllables in abugida scripts like Tibetan have similar semantics, making them effective substitution candidates for adversarial attacks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "TSCheater utilizes a self-constructed Tibetan syllable visual similarity database called TSVSDB to generate substitution candidates"
  - [section]: "In this paper, we propose a simple and sweet Tibetan adversarial text generation method called TSCheater, which considers the characteristic of Tibetan encoding and the feature that visually similar syllables have similar semantics"
  - [corpus]: Weak - The corpus provides related work but doesn't directly validate the visual-semantic relationship claim
- Break condition: If visually similar syllables do not share semantic similarity, or if the visual similarity measure fails to capture meaningful relationships, the attack effectiveness would degrade significantly.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Probability weighted word saliency determines optimal substitution order.
- Mechanism: The method calculates word saliency by measuring classification probability drops when words are replaced with unknown tokens. It then combines this with the probability drop from adversarial substitutions to create a weighted score that determines the order of substitutions, prioritizing changes that maximize attack effectiveness.
- Core assumption: The saliency metric accurately reflects a word's importance to classification, and combining it with adversarial probability drops yields an effective prioritization strategy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Probability weighted word saliency [17] is further proposed, which considers the saliency of both the substituted and the substitution word. We use this metric to determine the substitution order"
  - [section]: "We sort all the scores {H1, H2, ...} corresponding to the original input text x in descending order, then sequentially substitute the syllable si with si* or the word wj with wj*"
  - [corpus]: Weak - No direct corpus evidence supporting the effectiveness of this specific saliency combination approach
- Break condition: If the saliency metric doesn't accurately reflect word importance for the specific classification task, or if the weighted combination doesn't correlate with actual attack success, the substitution ordering would be suboptimal.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The method achieves high transferability to other abugida scripts like Devanagari.
- Mechanism: The approach exploits fundamental properties of abugida scripts (visual similarity of consonant letters, structured syllable formation) rather than language-specific features, making it applicable to other abugida writing systems with similar visual and structural characteristics.
- Core assumption: Other abugida scripts share the visual similarity properties and semantic relationships between visually similar syllables that Tibetan exhibits.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "This method can also be transferred to other abugidas, such as Devanagari script"
  - [section]: "According to the textual features of Tibetan script, many pairs of consonant letters look similar, and the proportion of vowel letters in syllables is small, which leads to the fact that for one syllable, there will be a number of syllables with similar appearance"
  - [corpus]: Weak - The corpus mentions related work but provides no evidence of successful transfer to other abugida scripts
- Break condition: If other abugida scripts don't exhibit the same visual similarity properties, or if their syllable construction rules differ significantly, the method's transferability would fail.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - TSVSDB (Tibetan Syllable Visual Similarity Database) -> Syllable segmentation module -> Word segmentation module -> Substitution candidate generator -> Probability calculator -> Scoring mechanism -> Attack execution engine

- Critical path:
  1. Input text segmentation (syllable and word level)
  2. Visual similarity database lookup for substitution candidates
  3. Probability evaluation for each candidate substitution
  4. Saliency-based scoring and sorting of substitution candidates
  5. Sequential application of substitutions until classification changes or failure

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Granularity tradeoff: Syllable-level attacks offer better visual similarity and perturbation magnitude but may have lower attack effectiveness than word-level attacks
  - Database size vs. accuracy: Larger TSVSDB with more detailed similarity thresholds could improve substitution quality but increases storage and computation requirements
  - Threshold selection: Lower CCOEFF NORMED thresholds increase substitution options but may introduce semantically dissimilar candidates

- Failure signatures:
  - Low attack success rate despite high visual similarity scores
  - Large perturbation magnitude when using syllable-level attacks
  - Inconsistent performance across different victim language models
  - Poor human acceptance ratings despite high visual similarity

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline validation: Run TSCheater on a small dataset with a single victim model to verify the core attack mechanism works before scaling
  2. Granularity comparison: Test both syllable-level and word-level attacks on the same dataset to quantify the tradeoffs mentioned in the design tradeoffs
  3. Visual similarity threshold analysis: Vary the CCOEFF NORMED threshold (e.g., 0.7, 0.8, 0.9) to find the optimal balance between substitution candidate quantity and quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions. However, based on the content, several implicit open questions emerge regarding the transferability to other abugida scripts, the optimal threshold for visual similarity, and the method's performance compared to other low-resource language adversarial attack methods.

## Limitations

- The claim that visually similar Tibetan syllables share semantic relationships lacks empirical validation through human studies or semantic analysis.
- The transferability claim to other abugida scripts like Devanagari is based on theoretical similarity rather than demonstrated results.
- The method's performance may be constrained by the quality and coverage of the TSVSDB, which could limit substitution candidate availability for certain syllables.

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims:**
- The visual similarity measurement approach using CCOEFF NORMED is technically sound and well-established in computer vision
- The adversarial attack methodology (finding substitution candidates, scoring, sequential application) follows established patterns in the field
- The evaluation metrics (ADV, LD, CS, VS) are standard and appropriate for measuring attack effectiveness and perturbation characteristics

**Medium Confidence Claims:**
- The specific effectiveness improvements over baseline methods (though methodologically sound, actual performance may vary with implementation details)
- The human acceptance ratings (while reasonable, could vary based on annotator pool and instructions)
- The claim that syllable-level attacks maintain better semantic coherence than word-level attacks (supported by intuition but not rigorously proven)

**Low Confidence Claims:**
- The transferability to other abugida scripts (no empirical evidence provided)
- The semantic similarity assumption between visually similar syllables (no validation provided)
- The specific threshold values used for CCOEFF NORMED filtering (appears somewhat arbitrary without sensitivity analysis)

## Next Checks

1. **Semantic Similarity Validation**: Conduct a human evaluation study where annotators rate the semantic similarity between original and substituted Tibetan syllables, comparing these ratings against the visual similarity scores to validate the core assumption.

2. **Cross-Script Transferability Test**: Implement TSCheater on a Devanagari text dataset using a pre-constructed Devanagari visual similarity database, measuring attack success rates against Hindi or Marathi language models to empirically test transferability claims.

3. **Threshold Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary the CCOEFF NORMED threshold (0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.95) and measure the impact on substitution candidate quantity, attack success rate, and semantic similarity to identify optimal threshold parameters.
