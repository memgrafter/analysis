# Scorecards for Synthetic Medical Data Evaluation and Reporting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.11143
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11143
- Reference count: 14
- One-line primary result: Introduces a framework for evaluating synthetic medical data quality across seven clinically relevant criteria

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for evaluating synthetic medical data (SMD) quality through seven clinically relevant criteria: correctness, coverage, constraints, completeness, comprehension, compliance, and consistency. The framework introduces SMD scorecards as standardized reports that accompany generated datasets, providing both descriptive information and quantitative metrics. The approach addresses the current gap in evaluating SMD beyond statistical fidelity, considering factors like clinical constraints and privacy compliance. By implementing this scorecard system, developers can systematically assess and improve SMD quality, ensuring more reliable and trustworthy synthetic datasets for medical AI applications.

## Method Summary
The framework decomposes SMD evaluation into seven orthogonal criteria, each with associated quantitative metrics. The method involves calculating metrics for each criterion, generating visualizations, and compiling results into standardized scorecards. The framework includes a metric dictionary for consistent evaluation across different datasets and developers. Scorecards provide both numerical metrics and interpretive guidance to help users understand data quality. The approach emphasizes clinical relevance and practical utility over purely statistical measures.

## Key Results
- Proposes seven clinically relevant criteria for SMD evaluation
- Introduces standardized scorecard format for consistent comparison
- Addresses both statistical fidelity and clinical relevance requirements
- Provides visualization tools and metric dictionaries for consistent evaluation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The framework enables systematic identification of SMD quality gaps by decomposing evaluation into seven clinically relevant criteria.
- Mechanism: By providing a structured scorecard with quantitative metrics for each criterion, developers can isolate and prioritize specific areas needing improvement rather than treating SMD quality as a monolithic problem.
- Core assumption: Quality deficiencies in synthetic medical data can be meaningfully decomposed into these seven orthogonal dimensions.
- Evidence anchors: The framework addresses the current gap in evaluating SMD beyond statistical fidelity, considering factors like clinical constraints and privacy compliance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The scorecard approach standardizes SMD evaluation across different developers and use cases, enabling meaningful comparison and benchmarking.
- Mechanism: By providing a common vocabulary and set of metrics, different SMD datasets can be evaluated using consistent methods, allowing stakeholders to make informed comparisons and choices.
- Core assumption: Different SMD developers will voluntarily adopt the same scorecard format and metrics.
- Evidence anchors: The framework enables consistent comparison across different SMD datasets.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The framework addresses the "garbage in, garbage out" problem by ensuring SMD meets clinical relevance requirements before use in downstream AI applications.
- Mechanism: By evaluating SMD against clinical constraints, compliance requirements, and consistency across demographic groups, the framework prevents the deployment of synthetic data that might introduce harmful biases or violate privacy regulations.
- Core assumption: The evaluation criteria are sufficient to catch clinically relevant problems that would otherwise propagate through AI systems.
- Evidence anchors: The framework ensures more reliable and trustworthy synthetic datasets for medical AI applications.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and their role in synthetic medical data generation
  - Why needed here: Understanding how GANs work is crucial for comprehending the "correctness" criterion and why fidelity metrics alone are insufficient for medical applications
  - Quick check question: What is the fundamental difference between how GANs and diffusion models generate synthetic data, and how might this affect the evaluation criteria?

- Concept: Differential privacy and re-identification risk metrics
  - Why needed here: Essential for understanding the "compliance" criterion and how privacy-preserving synthetic data generation differs from general-purpose synthetic data
  - Quick check question: How does differential privacy provide mathematical guarantees about individual data protection in synthetic datasets?

- Concept: Metric dictionaries and their role in standardized evaluation
  - Why needed here: Critical for understanding how the framework achieves consistent comparison across different SMD datasets and developers
  - Quick check question: What are the key characteristics that make a metric suitable for inclusion in a standardized evaluation framework?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data → Evaluation Criteria → Metrics → Visualization → Scorecard Report
- Critical path: Raw synthetic medical data flows through evaluation criteria, metrics are calculated, visualizations are generated, and final scorecard report is produced
- Design tradeoffs: Comprehensive evaluation vs. computational efficiency; standardized metrics vs. application-specific customization; transparency vs. complexity
- Failure signatures: Inconsistent metric calculations across datasets; visualization misinterpretation; scorecard generation failures; compliance violations in synthetic data
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Generate synthetic chest X-ray images using a GAN model and evaluate using the correctness criterion with FID scores
  2. Create a simple synthetic medical text dataset and test the coverage and completeness metrics
  3. Evaluate the same synthetic dataset across different demographic subgroups to test consistency metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we develop standardized metrics for evaluating constraint satisfaction in synthetic medical data that are applicable across different medical modalities?
- Basis in paper: The paper discusses constraints but notes the need for different metrics across modalities, particularly highlighting the challenge of evaluating constraints in text data generated by LLMs.
- Why unresolved: Current constraint evaluation methods are modality-specific and lack standardization.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of a unified constraint evaluation framework that works across medical data modalities.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between fidelity (correctness) and privacy preservation in synthetic medical data, and how can this tradeoff be quantified?
- Basis in paper: The paper discusses both correctness and compliance as separate criteria but doesn't address how these might conflict.
- Why unresolved: Current evaluation frameworks treat correctness and compliance separately without addressing their potential conflict.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies demonstrating the relationship between fidelity and privacy leakage in synthetic medical data.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we develop automated tools to generate and update SMD scorecards throughout the synthetic data generation process?
- Basis in paper: The paper proposes SMD scorecards as comprehensive reports but doesn't address how to automate their generation or updating as synthetic data evolves.
- Why unresolved: The paper presents scorecards as a manual reporting tool without discussing automation or integration with synthetic data generation pipelines.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of software tools that can automatically generate and update SMD scorecards in real-time as synthetic data is generated.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How can we establish a standardized metric dictionary that allows for consistent comparison of synthetic medical data across different research groups and institutions?
- Basis in paper: The paper proposes a metric dictionary concept but doesn't address standardization or implementation challenges.
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions the need for a metric dictionary but doesn't provide details on standardization, implementation, or adoption across different research groups.
- What evidence would resolve it: Creation and adoption of a community-wide standardized metric dictionary with clear implementation guidelines.

## Limitations
- The framework's effectiveness depends on voluntary adoption by the SMD developer community
- The seven-criterion decomposition, while logical, lacks extensive empirical validation across diverse medical data types
- The framework has not been tested in real-world deployment scenarios to validate its ability to prevent clinically harmful synthetic data deployment

## Confidence
- Framework effectiveness across modalities: Medium
- Standardization benefits: Medium
- Claims about preventing downstream AI failures: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a user study with SMD developers to assess scorecard usability and interpretability
2. Compare downstream AI model performance using SMD with high vs. low scorecard scores
3. Test the framework across at least three different medical data types (e.g., images, text, structured data) to validate metric applicability
