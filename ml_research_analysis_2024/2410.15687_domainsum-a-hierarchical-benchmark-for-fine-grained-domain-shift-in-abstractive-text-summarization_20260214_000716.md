# DomainSum: A Hierarchical Benchmark for Fine-Grained Domain Shift in Abstractive Text Summarization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.15687
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15687
- Authors: Haohan Yuan; Haopeng Zhang
- Reference count: 10
- Key outcome: DomainSum reveals that genre shifts are most challenging for models, while topic shifts lead to more uniform changes across summarization measures

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces DomainSum, a hierarchical benchmark designed to capture fine-grained domain shifts in abstractive text summarization. The authors categorize domain shifts into three levels: genre, style, and topic, and construct a 3×5 benchmark using high-quality public datasets. They perform comprehensive analysis of domain shift using eight summarization domain characteristic measures, including length, compression, density, coverage, diversity, and abstractiveness. The results show that topic shifts lead to more uniform changes, while genre shifts cause more variation in these measures. The authors evaluate the domain generalization capabilities of commonly used pre-trained language models (PLMs) and large language models (LLMs) on DomainSum, finding that topic shifts are easier for models to generalize while genre shifts are most challenging.

## Method Summary
DomainSum constructs a hierarchical benchmark by categorizing domain shifts into three levels: genre (broad structural differences), style (linguistic patterns), and topic (vocabulary and thematic content). The benchmark uses six high-quality summarization datasets (CNN/DailyMail, Arxiv, Reddit, SAMSum, WikiHow, and news articles) organized into 3 levels with 5 domains each. The paper evaluates both PLMs (BART, PEGASUS-X) and LLMs (GPT-4o mini, Llama3.1-8B/70B, Mistral-7B, Gemma1.1-7B) using zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings. Evaluation metrics include ROUGE scores (ROUGE-1/2/L), BERTScore F1 scores, and domain characteristic measures such as length, compression, density, coverage, diversity, and abstractiveness. Data sampling ensures fairness across datasets of different sizes.

## Key Results
- Topic shifts lead to more uniform changes across summarization measures, while genre shifts cause more variation
- LLMs like Llama3.1-8B demonstrate better generalization potential than PLMs, particularly for style and topic shifts
- Genre shifts are the most challenging for models to handle, followed by style shifts, while topic shifts lead to the most stable cross-domain performance
- The correlation patterns between summarization measures and model performance differ significantly across genre, style, and topic levels

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Hierarchical categorization of domain shifts (genre, style, topic) enables fine-grained measurement of summarization performance variations
- Mechanism: By decomposing domain shift into three granular levels, the benchmark captures both broad structural differences (genre) and subtle linguistic variations (style, topic), allowing models to be evaluated on their ability to generalize across different types of distributional shifts
- Core assumption: Domain shifts in summarization follow a hierarchical structure where genre changes affect overall document structure, style changes affect linguistic patterns, and topic changes affect vocabulary and emphasis
- Evidence anchors: The distinct correlation patterns across genre, style, and topic levels demonstrate that summarization performance is influenced by different aspects of the data distribution

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Topic shifts are easier for models to generalize compared to genre shifts due to more uniform changes across text characteristics
- Mechanism: Topic shifts primarily affect vocabulary and thematic content while maintaining similar structural and stylistic properties, whereas genre shifts require fundamental adaptations in document structure, length, and summarization strategies
- Core assumption: The difficulty of domain generalization correlates with the magnitude of distributional differences across summarization measures like density, coverage, and abstractiveness
- Evidence anchors: The Topic Shift shows the most consistent and balanced distribution across measures, while the Genre Shift displays the most extreme variations in density and coverage

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Large language models demonstrate better generalization potential than PLMs despite potentially lower absolute performance scores
- Mechanism: LLMs leverage their broader pretraining and in-context learning capabilities to maintain more stable performance across different domains, particularly for style and topic shifts where distributional changes are less dramatic
- Core assumption: Model size and pretraining scope positively correlate with cross-domain generalization ability, even when fine-tuning data is limited
- Evidence anchors: Llama3.1-8B demonstrates better generalization potential, particularly in style and topic shifts, where its performance remains more stable across different domains

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Domain shift in machine learning
  - Why needed here: Understanding how distributional differences between training and test data affect model performance is fundamental to interpreting benchmark results
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes covariate shift from concept shift in domain adaptation?

- Concept: Abstractive vs extractive summarization
  - Why needed here: The benchmark focuses on abstractive summarization, which requires understanding how models generate novel content versus selecting existing text
  - Quick check question: How do compression ratio and abstractiveness measures differ between abstractive and extractive summarization approaches?

- Concept: Hierarchical text classification
  - Why needed here: The benchmark's hierarchical structure mirrors classification approaches that organize concepts into nested categories
  - Quick check question: How might hierarchical classification techniques inform the design of multi-level domain shift benchmarks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data ingestion -> Measure computation -> Benchmark analysis -> Model evaluation -> Correlation analysis
- Critical path: Data loading → measure computation → hierarchical analysis → model training/evaluation → performance comparison → correlation analysis
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using existing datasets ensures quality but limits control over domain definitions
  - Sampling fixed numbers of instances enables fair comparisons but may reduce statistical power
  - Hierarchical structure provides granularity but increases complexity of analysis
- Failure signatures:
  - Inconsistent measure distributions across levels suggest incorrect domain categorization
  - Poor cross-domain performance may indicate insufficient fine-tuning or inadequate model capacity
  - Weak correlations between measures and performance suggest missing relevant evaluation metrics
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify hierarchical structure by comparing measure distributions across all three levels using ANOVA or similar statistical tests
  2. Test in-domain performance by fine-tuning BART on each domain and measuring ROUGE/BERTScore improvements
  3. Evaluate cross-domain generalization by training on one domain and testing on others within the same hierarchical level

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different summarization measures (e.g., length, compression, density, coverage, diversity, and abstractiveness) influence model performance across various domain shifts?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions that the correlation patterns between summarization measures and model performance differ significantly across genre, style, and topic levels
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies these correlations, it does not provide a detailed analysis of how each measure specifically influences model performance in different domain shift scenarios
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis showing the impact of each summarization measure on model performance across different domain shifts, potentially through controlled experiments or ablation studies

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the hierarchical structure of domain shifts (genre, style, and topic) affect the generalization ability of models in real-world applications?
- Basis in paper: The paper demonstrates that genre shifts are the most challenging for models to handle, followed by style shifts, while topic shifts lead to the most stable cross-domain performance
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore how these hierarchical domain shifts translate to real-world applications, where models may encounter more complex and mixed domain shifts
- What evidence would resolve it: Real-world case studies or experiments where models are tested on mixed domain shifts to evaluate their generalization ability in practical scenarios

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the potential benefits and limitations of using large language models (LLMs) versus pre-trained language models (PLMs) for domain adaptation in abstractive summarization?
- Basis in paper: The paper compares the performance of LLMs (e.g., Llama3.1-8B) and PLMs (e.g., BART) on DomainSum, showing that while LLMs do not always outperform PLMs in absolute scores, they demonstrate better generalization potential
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the trade-offs between using LLMs and PLMs for domain adaptation, such as computational costs, fine-tuning efficiency, and scalability
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study that evaluates the performance, computational costs, and scalability of LLMs and PLMs for domain adaptation in various real-world summarization tasks

## Limitations

- The hierarchical categorization of domain shifts remains the most significant theoretical claim requiring empirical validation across additional domains and tasks
- The mechanistic explanations for why certain domain shifts are easier than others rely on correlational evidence rather than causal analysis
- The sampling methodology for creating balanced datasets across different domains is not fully specified, which could affect reproducibility

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The benchmark construction methodology and evaluation pipeline are well-documented and reproducible
- **Medium Confidence:** The hierarchical structure of domain shifts is supported by measure distributions but requires further validation
- **Low Confidence:** The generalization advantage of LLMs over PLMs is observed but may be model-dependent rather than a general principle

## Next Checks

1. Conduct statistical tests (e.g., ANOVA, hierarchical clustering) on measure distributions across all three levels to confirm that the proposed hierarchical structure is not an artifact of the selected domains
2. Evaluate additional PLM and LLM architectures across the same benchmark to determine whether the observed generalization patterns are consistent or specific to the tested models
3. Apply the DomainSum benchmark to a different NLP task (e.g., sentiment analysis or question answering) to verify whether the hierarchical domain shift framework generalizes beyond summarization
