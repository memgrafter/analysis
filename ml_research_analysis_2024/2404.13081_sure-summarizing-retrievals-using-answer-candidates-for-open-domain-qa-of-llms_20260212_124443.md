# SuRe: Summarizing Retrievals using Answer Candidates for Open-domain QA of LLMs
arXiv ID: 2404.13081
Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13081
Reference count: 40
Key outcome: Up to 4.6% EM and 4.0% F1 improvement over standard prompting for open-domain QA

## Executive Summary
SuRe is a framework that improves open-domain question answering with LLMs by summarizing retrieved passages for each potential answer candidate. The approach generates multiple answer candidates and creates candidate-specific summaries of retrieved passages, which are then evaluated for validity and informativeness to select the most plausible answer. Experiments show significant improvements over standard prompting approaches across diverse QA datasets, with gains of up to 4.6% in exact match and 4.0% in F1 score.

## Method Summary
The SuRe framework addresses open-domain QA by first generating multiple answer candidates using LLM prompting, then constructing candidate-specific summaries of retrieved passages. These summaries are evaluated for both validity (whether they support the candidate) and relative informativeness compared to other candidates. The final answer is selected based on combined evaluation scores. The method is tested zero-shot across multiple QA datasets (Natural Questions, WebQuestions, 2WikiMulti-hopQA, HotpotQA) using various retrieval methods (BM25, DPR, Contriever) and LLMs (ChatGPT, GPT-4, LLaMA2-chat).

## Key Results
- Up to 4.6% improvement in Exact Match (EM) over standard prompting approaches
- Up to 4.0% improvement in F1 score across diverse QA datasets
- Framework generalizes well across different retrieval methods and LLM architectures
- Generated summaries serve as more informative rationales compared to generic summaries

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by breaking down the complex QA task into more manageable subtasks through answer candidate generation and conditional summarization. By creating candidate-specific summaries, the model can focus on relevant context for each potential answer rather than being overwhelmed by all retrieved information. The dual evaluation of validity and informativeness helps filter out incorrect answers while identifying the most well-supported candidates.

## Foundational Learning
- Open-domain QA with retrieval augmentation: Combines information retrieval with language models to answer questions using external knowledge sources
  - Why needed: Standard LLMs have limited knowledge and cannot access up-to-date information
  - Quick check: Verify retrieval quality by checking if relevant passages are returned for sample questions
- Candidate generation and selection: Creates multiple potential answers and uses evaluation criteria to select the best one
  - Why needed: Questions often have multiple plausible answers, and direct generation can be error-prone
  - Quick check: Count the number of unique candidates generated and their diversity
- Zero-shot prompting: Uses LLMs without fine-tuning, relying solely on prompt engineering
  - Why needed: Avoids the computational cost and data requirements of model training
  - Quick check: Test prompts on held-out examples to ensure they work without task-specific training

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map:** Question -> Retrieval -> Answer Candidates -> Candidate Summaries -> Evaluation -> Final Answer
**Critical path:** The most important sequence is: retrieval quality -> answer candidate generation -> summary informativeness -> final answer selection
**Design tradeoffs:** Zero-shot prompting vs. fine-tuning, candidate quantity vs. quality, summary length vs. informativeness
**Failure signatures:** Poor retrieval quality leading to wrong candidates, summaries missing key information, evaluation scores not distinguishing between candidates
**First experiments:**
1. Verify retrieval pipeline returns relevant passages for sample questions
2. Test answer candidate generation with simple questions
3. Evaluate summary generation for a single candidate before scaling to multiple candidates

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
**Open Question 1:** How does the proposed framework perform in multilingual settings?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on English QA datasets and LLMs
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the performance of the framework on non-English datasets or LLMs trained on multiple languages
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results on multilingual QA datasets and evaluation of the framework with multilingual LLMs

**Open Question 2:** What is the impact of the framework on LLMs with different architectures or sizes?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper experiments with a few LLMs (ChatGPT, GPT-4, LLaMA2-chat) but does not systematically analyze the effect of different architectures or sizes
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate how the framework's performance varies with different LLM architectures or sizes
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of the framework's performance with LLMs of varying architectures and sizes

**Open Question 3:** How does the framework handle questions requiring complex reasoning or multiple steps?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates the framework on QA datasets with varying levels of complexity but does not specifically focus on complex reasoning or multi-step questions
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the framework's ability to handle questions that require complex reasoning or multiple steps to answer
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results on datasets with questions requiring complex reasoning or multiple steps, and analysis of the framework's performance on such questions

## Limitations
- Heavy reliance on specific LLM APIs without detailed implementation specifications, making exact reproduction challenging
- Evaluation framework focuses primarily on EM and F1 metrics without exploring computational efficiency or latency
- Relative performance gains across different retrieval methods and LLM configurations not thoroughly analyzed

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core methodology of generating candidate-specific summaries and using them for answer selection is clearly described and well-justified
- **Medium confidence**: The reported performance improvements are convincing but depend on specific API implementations that are not fully disclosed
- **Medium confidence**: The claim about generated summaries being more informative rationales than generic summaries is supported but could benefit from more rigorous qualitative analysis

## Next Checks
1. Verify the framework's robustness across different retrieval methods by conducting ablation studies comparing BM25, DPR, and Contriever performance with and without SuRe
2. Conduct a thorough error analysis on the QA datasets to identify specific types of questions where SuRe provides the most benefit
3. Implement a controlled reproduction study using the described methodology but with publicly available LLMs to assess the approach's accessibility and practicality outside commercial API settings
