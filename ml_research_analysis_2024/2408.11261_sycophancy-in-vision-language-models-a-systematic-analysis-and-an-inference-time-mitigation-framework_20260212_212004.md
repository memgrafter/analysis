# Sycophancy in Vision-Language Models: A Systematic Analysis and an Inference-Time Mitigation Framework

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.11261
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11261
- Reference count: 40
- The paper presents the first systematic analysis of sycophancy in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), revealing that these models are significantly influenced by leading or deceptive prompts, leading to biased outputs and hallucinations.

## Executive Summary
This paper systematically analyzes sycophancy in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where models are unduly influenced by leading or deceptive prompts, resulting in biased outputs and hallucinations. The authors construct a benchmark with leading queries across multiple datasets and evaluate five prominent LVLMs, showing performance degradation and model-specific behavioral patterns. To mitigate sycophancy, they propose a training-free, inference-time framework consisting of query neutralization, sycophancy-aware contrastive decoding, and adaptive logits refinement. Experiments demonstrate that this framework effectively reduces sycophancy across all evaluated models while maintaining or improving performance on neutral prompts.

## Method Summary
The paper analyzes sycophancy in LVLMs by constructing a benchmark with leading queries across multiple datasets (POPE, AMBER, RealworldQA, ScienceQA, MM-Vet) and evaluating five prominent LVLMs. To mitigate sycophancy, the authors propose a training-free, inference-time framework consisting of three components: a query neutralizer that transforms leading queries using an LLM backbone, a sycophancy-aware contrastive decoding mechanism that recalibrates token distributions by contrasting responses to neutralized and leading queries, and an adaptive logits refinement module integrating plausibility filtering and sentiment scaling. Experiments demonstrate that this framework effectively reduces sycophancy across all evaluated models while maintaining or improving performance on neutral prompts.

## Key Results
- The framework reduces sycophancy across all evaluated LVLMs, with improvement rates of 18.15%, 11.71%, 14.71%, 11.31%, and 8.33% for Qwen-VL, CogVLM2, InternVL-1.5, LLaVA-NeXT, and mPLUG-Owl-2.1 respectively
- The framework maintains or improves performance on neutral prompts while effectively mitigating biased outputs from leading queries
- Different LVLM architectures exhibit varying degrees of sycophancy susceptibility, with some models showing up to 27% performance degradation when exposed to leading prompts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Contrastive decoding between neutralized and leading query outputs suppresses sycophantic token distributions.
- Mechanism: Compute token distributions for both original leading query and neutralized query, then subtract the leading query's logits weighted by α from the neutral query's logits, reducing alignment with user bias.
- Core assumption: The difference in output distributions between leading and neutralized queries primarily reflects sycophantic bias rather than multimodal content variation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We then introduce a sycophancy-aware contrastive decoding mechanism that dynamically recalibrates token-level output distributions by contrasting responses to neutralized and leading queries."
  - [section 3.3] "The intuition is: when the two distributions diverge, the discrepancy is likely caused by query-induced bias, not by new visual information."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus support for contrastive decoding in LVLM sycophancy context.
- Break condition: If neutral and leading queries yield similar output distributions (low divergence), contrastive decoding cannot distinguish sycophancy from genuine multimodal evidence.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Adaptive logits refinement prevents over-suppression of plausible tokens while scaling down sentiment-driven outputs.
- Mechanism: Apply dynamic plausibility filtering based on entropy thresholds to truncate implausible tokens, then scale token probabilities by sentiment intensity of the leading query.
- Core assumption: Sycophantic outputs are correlated with both implausible token sequences and high sentiment intensity in leading prompts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Finally, an adaptive logits refinement module further modifies the contrasted logits by integrating both a adaptive plausibility filter and query sentiment scaler"
  - [section 3.4] "APF dynamically truncates the output vocabulary at each decoding step, allowing only tokens whose original probability exceeds a data-driven threshold."
  - [section 3.4.2] "We apply the sentiment score to reweight the token probabilities after SACD and APF."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus support for sentiment scaling in LVLM sycophancy mitigation.
- Break condition: If sentiment intensity poorly correlates with sycophancy in a specific model or domain, sentiment scaling may incorrectly suppress valid responses.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Dynamic α coefficient based on Jensen-Shannon Divergence automatically adjusts correction strength per query.
- Mechanism: Compute JSD between leading and neutralized query output distributions, then scale α proportionally to divergence magnitude.
- Core assumption: Query-induced bias magnitude varies across examples, requiring per-instance adjustment rather than fixed correction strength.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3.2] "We propose a dynamically tuned α coefficient based on the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) between the output distribution"
  - [section 3.3.2] "If the difference is large, αdyn will be increased, more strongly suppressing sycophantic tokens."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus support for JSD-based adaptive tuning in LVLM sycophancy context.
- Break condition: If JSD poorly reflects actual sycophancy severity due to other sources of distribution divergence, adaptive tuning may over-correct or under-correct.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contrastive decoding between multiple prompts
  - Why needed here: Sycophancy arises when models align with user bias rather than visual evidence, requiring comparison of biased vs neutral prompt responses
  - Quick check question: How does subtracting leading query logits from neutral query logits help reduce sycophancy?

- Concept: Sentiment analysis and intensity scoring
  - Why needed here: Sycophantic responses correlate with emotional or strongly biased prompts, requiring sentiment-based probability scaling
  - Quick check question: Why would higher sentiment intensity in a query increase the likelihood of sycophantic output?

- Concept: Dynamic thresholding based on entropy
  - Why needed here: Fixed vocabulary truncation risks either too much or too little filtering depending on model uncertainty, requiring entropy-adaptive thresholds
  - Quick check question: How does output distribution entropy inform the strictness of plausibility filtering?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Query Neutralizer → Sycophancy-Aware Contrastive Decoding → Adaptive Logits Refinement → Final Output
- Critical path: Leading query → Neutralizer (LLM backbone) → Both queries → LVLM inference → Contrastive decoding (α-adjusted) → Plausibility filtering (entropy-based) → Sentiment scaling → Output
- Design tradeoffs: Dual decoding increases computational cost but provides robust sycophancy mitigation; fixed vs adaptive parameters trade simplicity for effectiveness
- Failure signatures: Over-suppression of valid responses when neutral and leading queries yield similar outputs; incorrect sentiment scaling when sentiment intensity poorly correlates with sycophancy; inadequate correction when JSD underestimates bias severity
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline evaluation: Run LVLM on POPE with leading queries to establish sycophancy baseline metrics (CTR, EIR, ECR, PIR)
  2. Ablation study: Test framework without sentiment scaling to measure its individual contribution to sycophancy reduction
  3. Oracle comparison: Replace automated neutralizer with ground-truth neutral queries to establish upper performance bound

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does sycophancy in LVLMs generalize to languages other than English, and what cultural or linguistic factors might influence susceptibility?
- Can sycophancy mitigation be effectively integrated with end-to-end training approaches to further improve robustness?
- How does sycophancy manifest in multimodal reasoning tasks involving dynamic or temporal data, such as video understanding or real-time decision-making?

## Limitations
- The framework relies on LLM-based query neutralization, which may introduce semantic drift and cannot guarantee perfect neutralization without manual verification
- Performance evaluation depends on synthetic leading prompts, which may not fully capture real-world sycophancy scenarios
- The training-free approach may be less effective than fine-tuning-based methods that could achieve deeper model alignment

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The identification of sycophancy as a significant issue in LVLMs, supported by systematic benchmarking across multiple datasets and models
- Medium Confidence: The effectiveness of the proposed inference-time framework, based on controlled experiments showing performance improvements
- Medium Confidence: The contrastive decoding mechanism's ability to suppress sycophantic outputs, though the exact contribution of each component remains somewhat unclear

## Next Checks
1. Test framework generalization on real-world user queries collected from actual applications to verify performance beyond synthetic prompts
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the individual contributions of contrastive decoding, plausibility filtering, and sentiment scaling components
3. Evaluate framework performance across additional LVLM architectures beyond the five tested models to assess broader applicability
