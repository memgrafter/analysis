# No Regrets: Investigating and Improving Regret Approximations for Curriculum Discovery

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2408.15099
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15099
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Proposed SFL method outperforms existing UED methods in four domains and demonstrates superior robustness

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates regret-based score functions used in Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) for curriculum learning. The authors discover that common approximations like Positive Value Loss (PVL) and Maximum Monte Carlo (MaxMC) do not correlate with actual regret but rather with success rate, leading to inefficient learning. They propose Sampling For Learnability (SFL), which directly prioritizes levels with high "learnability" - those where the agent's success rate is neither 0% nor 100%. SFL significantly outperforms existing UED methods across four domains and introduces a new adversarial evaluation protocol based on conditional value at risk (CVaR) to measure robustness.

## Method Summary
The authors analyze existing regret approximations (PVL and MaxMC) and demonstrate their correlation with success rate rather than regret through empirical experiments. They then propose Sampling For Learnability (SFL), which prioritizes environment levels based on the agent's current success rate, focusing on those with intermediate success rates (neither 0% nor 100%). SFL uses this learnability measure to guide curriculum generation, sampling more from levels where the agent has partial knowledge. The method is evaluated across four domains including a novel robot navigation environment, with a new CVaR-based adversarial evaluation protocol to measure policy robustness.

## Key Results
- PVL and MaxMC approximations correlate with success rate rather than actual regret
- SFL outperforms existing UED methods in four different domains
- SFL demonstrates superior performance on CVaR-based robustness evaluation
- Proposed method is simple yet effective for curriculum discovery

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper demonstrates that existing regret approximations fail because they don't capture the true regret of an agent's policy. By instead focusing on "learnability" - levels where the agent has neither mastered nor completely failed - SFL creates a more effective curriculum that targets the agent's current knowledge gaps. This approach naturally balances exploration and exploitation in the curriculum design process.

## Foundational Learning
- **Unsupervised Environment Design (UED)**: Framework for generating curricula without human-designed reward signals. Needed for automated curriculum generation.
- **Regret in RL**: Measures the difference between optimal and actual policy performance. Quick check: verify understanding of how regret differs from simple reward maximization.
- **Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)**: Risk assessment metric focusing on tail outcomes. Quick check: understand how CVaR differs from mean performance metrics.
- **Learnability**: Concept of environments where agents have partial but incomplete knowledge. Quick check: can identify learnable vs. non-learnable states.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Environment Generator -> Learnability Evaluator -> Curriculum Sampler -> Agent Trainer -> Performance Evaluator

**Critical Path**: The pipeline flows from environment generation through learnability assessment to curriculum sampling, with the agent training loop providing feedback to update success rates.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The paper opts for simplicity in SFL over more complex regret approximation methods, trading theoretical elegance for practical effectiveness.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor curriculum design manifests as plateaued learning curves or high variance in performance across environments.

**First Experiments**: 1) Verify SFL's performance on a simple gridworld environment. 2) Compare learnability-based sampling against random sampling. 3) Test CVaR evaluation on trained policies.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Claims about regret approximations being fundamentally flawed are based on limited experimental domains
- SFL's effectiveness relies heavily on empirical evaluation without strong theoretical guarantees
- Generalizability to continuous state spaces and real-world robotic systems remains uncertain

## Confidence
- **High**: Empirical observation that PVL and MaxMC correlate with success rate rather than regret
- **Medium**: SFL method's effectiveness across domains; claim about regret approximations being flawed
- **Low**: Generalizability to other curriculum learning domains; long-term stability of SFL-trained policies

## Next Checks
1. Test SFL's performance on more diverse environments, particularly those with continuous state spaces and longer time horizons
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate effects of different SFL components, particularly success rate thresholds
3. Implement and evaluate SFL in a real-world robotic system to verify transfer from simulation to physical environments
