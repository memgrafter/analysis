# MIRe: Enhancing Multimodal Queries Representation via Fusion-Free Modality Interaction for Multimodal Retrieval

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2411.08334
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08334
- **Reference count**: 22
- **Primary result**: MIRe achieves strong zero-shot performance across four multimodal retrieval benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing methods

## Executive Summary
MIRe addresses the text-dominant issue in multimodal retrieval by enabling textual queries to attend to visual embeddings without fusing them during alignment. The method introduces query-guided attentive pooling to integrate visual information while preserving distinct representations for each modality. A pre-training dataset is constructed by transforming concise question-answer pairs into extended passages to better simulate real-world retrieval tasks. Experiments show that MIRe achieves strong zero-shot performance across four multimodal retrieval benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing methods.

## Method Summary
MIRe is a multimodal retrieval framework that uses query-guided attentive pooling to allow textual queries to attend to visual embeddings without direct fusion during alignment. The approach employs late interaction to preserve token-level embeddings for fine-grained matching, and uses a response-to-passage conversion strategy to transform concise QA pairs into extended passages for pre-training. The model achieves strong zero-shot performance by mitigating over-reliance on textual features while maintaining effective visual-text integration.

## Key Results
- MIRe achieves strong zero-shot performance across four multimodal retrieval benchmarks
- Significantly outperforms existing methods in multimodal retrieval tasks
- Ablation studies confirm effectiveness in mitigating over-reliance on textual features

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: MIRe enables textual queries to attend to visual embeddings without feeding text-driven signals back into the visual representations, mitigating the text-dominant issue.
- Mechanism: The query-guided attentive pooling module uses textual embeddings as queries to compute attention scores over visual patch embeddings, then aggregates visual information based on its relevance to the textual tokens. Crucially, the attended visual output is computed without a residual connection back to the text, preventing direct fusion during alignment.
- Core assumption: Separating modality interaction from fusion during alignment allows the model to learn complementary visual-text relationships without one modality overwhelming the other.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our method allows the textual query to attend to visual embeddings while not feeding text-driven signals back into the visual representations."
  - [section]: "Unlike the standard cross-attention mechanism, we apply mean-pooling along the sequence dimension without a residual connection, yielding h visual embeddings."
  - [corpus]: Weak - the corpus doesn't contain direct evidence about this specific architectural choice. The related papers focus on different multimodal approaches without this specific fusion-free design.
- Break condition: If visual embeddings become too dependent on textual context during attention computation, or if mean-pooling discards too much visual detail needed for retrieval.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Response-to-passage conversion transforms concise QA pairs into extended passages, creating more realistic retrieval tasks that require integrating both modalities.
- Mechanism: The conversion process retrieves top-k passages using the response as a query, then inserts the response between retrieved passages to create an extended passage. This forces the model to distinguish relevant information within noisy, document-like contexts rather than matching short answers.
- Core assumption: Real-world retrieval requires finding relevant information within longer documents, not just matching concise answers.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "To bridge this gap, we transform query-response pairs into a format suitable for multimodal retrieval tasks via response-to-passage conversion"
  - [section]: "This conversion strategy yields training data that more closely mimic the complexity and noise of real-world documents."
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus evidence doesn't directly validate this specific conversion approach. Related work focuses on different pre-training strategies.
- Break condition: If retrieved passages are too contextually dissimilar from the response, making the combined passage confusing rather than realistic.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using late interaction mechanism preserves token-level embeddings for both queries and passages, enabling more fine-grained matching compared to single-vector retrieval.
- Mechanism: The retrieval model generates low-dimensional embeddings for tokens in both query and passage, then computes relevance scores using MaxSim operation that matches each query token with its most relevant document token.
- Core assumption: Fine-grained token-level matching captures semantic relationships better than aggregated single-vector representations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Late interaction (Khattab and Zaharia, 2020) is a retrieval strategy that preserves token-level embeddings for both queries and passages, enabling more fine-grained matching"
  - [section]: "This mechanism defers the aggregation of embeddings to the scoring phase, retaining token-level signals."
  - [corpus]: Moderate - ColBERTv2 (mentioned in implementation) is a well-established late-interaction approach with demonstrated effectiveness in text retrieval.
- Break condition: If token-level embeddings become too sparse or if MaxSim fails to capture long-range dependencies important for retrieval.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cross-attention mechanisms in multimodal models
  - Why needed here: Understanding how standard cross-attention works (query from one modality, keys/values from another) is essential to grasp why MIRe's approach differs and why it helps mitigate text dominance
  - Quick check question: In standard cross-attention, what are the three components (Q, K, V) typically derived from, and how does MIRe modify this?

- Concept: Contrastive learning with in-batch negative sampling
  - Why needed here: The training objective uses contrastive loss with in-batch negatives, requiring understanding of how positive/negative samples are defined and how temperature scaling affects learning
  - Quick check question: How does the contrastive loss formulation in equation (7) treat passages in the same batch as negatives for a given query?

- Concept: Vision transformer patch embeddings and CLS tokens
  - Why needed here: The model uses both global CLS embeddings and token-level patch embeddings from ViT, requiring understanding of how visual information is represented at different granularities
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between global embeddings (Vg) and token-level embeddings (Vm) in the vision encoder, and why does MIRe use both?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Image → ViT → Vg, Vm → MLP → Eg → Query-guided Attentive Pooling → Em → [Eg; Em] → MaxSim with textual embeddings → Relevance score
- Critical path: Image → ViT → Vg, Vm → MLP → Eg → Query-guided Attentive Pooling → Em → [Eg; Em] → MaxSim with textual embeddings → Relevance score
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Fusion-free during alignment vs. direct fusion: Fusion-free prevents text dominance but may require more sophisticated integration later
  - Mean-pooling without residual vs. standard cross-attention: Simpler aggregation but may lose some fine-grained interactions
  - Response-to-passage conversion complexity vs. simpler pre-training: More realistic but requires additional retrieval infrastructure
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor retrieval performance on E-VQA: Likely indicates insufficient visual understanding or over-reliance on textual cues
  - Degradation when removing Et during inference: Shows text embeddings are still crucial for semantic coherence
  - Faster loss convergence with text fusion (w/ Residual): Indicates optimization speed vs. generalization tradeoff
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare retrieval performance with and without query-guided attentive pooling on a small validation set
  2. Test response-to-passage conversion by evaluating retrieval on converted vs. original QA pairs
  3. Measure attention distribution across visual patches for different query types to verify query-guided behavior

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the performance gain from MIRe's modality interaction persist when fine-tuning on specialized domains such as medical or legal documents?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors acknowledge in the limitations section that MIRe has not been tested on specialized domains where multimodal content may exhibit more complex and domain-specific features.
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates MIRe on general-domain benchmarks and does not explore its effectiveness in specialized domains with complex multimodal content.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing MIRe's performance against baselines on multimodal retrieval tasks in specialized domains such as medical or legal documents would demonstrate whether the modality interaction approach generalizes beyond general-domain benchmarks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does MIRe perform when integrated into retrieval-augmented generative (RAG) frameworks for downstream generation tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors mention in the limitations section that they have not explored synergy with RAG frameworks, though they believe retrieval improvements would benefit such methods based on related work showing stronger retrievers enhance downstream generation.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses solely on retrieval performance and does not validate MIRe's effectiveness when used as part of a complete RAG pipeline for generation tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results comparing generation quality (e.g., answer accuracy, coherence) in RAG-based question answering systems using MIRe versus traditional retrievers would demonstrate whether MIRe's retrieval improvements translate to better downstream generation.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the response-to-passage conversion (R2P) mechanism maintain effectiveness when applied to dynamically changing knowledge sources or continuously updated information?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors note in the limitations section that their current data construction method focuses on retrieval from large yet homogeneous corpora, and adapting to more diverse or dynamically changing knowledge sources may require additional techniques.
- Why unresolved: The current R2P approach was validated only on static Wikipedia-based corpora, and the paper does not address how well it adapts to knowledge sources that change over time or have different characteristics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments showing retrieval performance when using R2P on both static and dynamically updated knowledge sources would reveal whether the approach maintains effectiveness across different types of information environments.

## Limitations
- Limited validation on specialized domains with complex multimodal content
- No exploration of integration with retrieval-augmented generative frameworks
- Response-to-passage conversion effectiveness not tested on dynamically changing knowledge sources

## Confidence
**Confidence: Medium** - The paper demonstrates strong empirical performance across four benchmarks, but several architectural decisions lack rigorous ablation studies. The fusion-free approach's effectiveness depends heavily on the query-guided attentive pooling mechanism, yet the paper doesn't fully explore alternative pooling strategies or quantify the contribution of each design choice.

**Confidence: Low** - The response-to-passage conversion process introduces significant complexity and potential noise. While the paper claims this creates more realistic retrieval scenarios, there's limited analysis of how conversion quality affects downstream performance. The reliance on ColBERTv2 for passage retrieval during dataset construction could propagate any biases or limitations from that model.

**Confidence: Medium** - The late-interaction mechanism's benefits are well-established in text retrieval literature, but its specific advantages for multimodal queries require more investigation. The paper doesn't adequately address how token-level matching performs when visual and textual modalities have different semantic granularities or when one modality provides redundant information.

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation of Fusion-Free Design**: Conduct controlled experiments comparing MIRe with a variant that allows direct text-visual fusion during alignment, measuring both retrieval performance and attention distribution patterns to quantify the text-dominant issue's severity.

2. **Conversion Quality Analysis**: Evaluate retrieval performance using different response-to-passage conversion strategies (varying k values, alternative passage sources, or simpler concatenation methods) to determine the optimal balance between realism and noise.

3. **Cross-Modality Attention Patterns**: Visualize and analyze the attention scores produced by query-guided attentive pooling across different query types and image complexities, validating that visual information is appropriately weighted relative to textual cues.
