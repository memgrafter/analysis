# A Multimodal Approach to The Detection and Classification of Skin Diseases

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.13855
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13855

- Primary result: 91.2% accuracy achieved on multimodal skin disease classification using 36,995 images and 260 text narratives

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a multimodal deep learning system for classifying 26 types of skin diseases using both skin images and patient symptom narratives. The authors propose a new dataset containing 36,995 images and 260 text narratives, then develop a baseline CNN-based image classifier achieving 80.1% accuracy, and introduce a novel "Chain of Options" fine-tuning strategy for LLMs that incrementally narrows down diagnosis options during training. When combining the optimized image model with a fine-tuned Llama-7B LLM, the system achieves 91.2% accuracy on the multimodal classification task, outperforming previous methods and demonstrating the value of incorporating both visual and textual patient information for skin disease diagnosis.

## Method Summary
The study combines computer vision and natural language processing techniques to create a multimodal skin disease classification system. The authors first develop a baseline CNN-based image classifier trained on 36,995 skin images. They then introduce a novel "Chain of Options" fine-tuning strategy for LLMs, which incrementally narrows down diagnosis options during training rather than using standard fine-tuning approaches. Finally, they combine the optimized image model with a fine-tuned Llama-7B LLM to create the multimodal system that achieves 91.2% accuracy on the classification task.

## Key Results
- 91.2% accuracy achieved on multimodal skin disease classification task
- 80.1% accuracy baseline from CNN-based image classifier alone
- Novel "Chain of Options" fine-tuning strategy introduced for LLM optimization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The multimodal approach leverages complementary information from visual and textual sources. Skin images provide direct visual evidence of disease manifestations, while patient symptom narratives offer contextual information about onset, progression, and associated symptoms that may not be visually apparent. The "Chain of Options" fine-tuning strategy allows the LLM to learn progressive elimination of diagnosis options, mimicking clinical reasoning processes. The integration of these modalities enables the system to capture both explicit visual patterns and implicit symptom relationships that improve diagnostic accuracy.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multimodal deep learning**: Combines different data types (images and text) to leverage complementary information sources - needed for comprehensive disease understanding
- **CNN-based image classification**: Extracts visual features from skin images - needed for identifying disease-specific visual patterns
- **LLM fine-tuning strategies**: Adapts pre-trained language models to specific tasks - needed for incorporating clinical reasoning patterns
- **Chain of Options fine-tuning**: Progressive narrowing of diagnosis options during training - needed to mimic clinical diagnostic reasoning
- **Multimodal fusion techniques**: Combines outputs from different model types - needed to leverage complementary strengths

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Image CNN -> Feature Extraction -> Classification -> Fusion Layer; Text LLM -> Symptom Processing -> Diagnosis Ranking -> Fusion Layer; Fusion Layer -> Final Classification

**Critical Path**: Image acquisition → CNN feature extraction → Text narrative input → LLM symptom processing → Multimodal fusion → Final diagnosis classification

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Accuracy vs. computational efficiency: Using both image and text modalities increases accuracy but requires more processing resources
- Model complexity vs. interpretability: Advanced fine-tuning strategies improve performance but may reduce transparency
- Dataset size vs. generalization: Larger dataset improves performance but may not capture rare disease variations

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Low image quality or unusual skin tones may cause CNN misclassification
- Incomplete or inconsistent symptom narratives may lead to LLM errors
- Mismatched feature scales between image and text modalities can cause fusion layer instability
- Domain shift in new patient populations may reduce generalization

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Ablation study comparing multimodal vs. single-modal (image-only) performance
2. Cross-validation across different skin tone distributions
3. Testing system performance on rare disease cases

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dataset covers only 26 skin disease types out of potentially hundreds of dermatological conditions
- "Chain of Options" fine-tuning strategy lacks comparison to other approaches
- Reported accuracy achieved without external validation on independent clinical populations
- Integration method combining CNN and LLM outputs not fully detailed

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The technical implementation of the CNN-based image classifier and basic multimodal fusion approach

**Medium confidence**: The specific contribution of the "Chain of Options" fine-tuning strategy to overall performance

**Medium confidence**: The absolute accuracy numbers without external validation or comparison to clinical gold standards

## Next Checks

1. External validation on independent clinical datasets with diverse patient populations and skin tones
2. Ablation studies comparing "Chain of Options" fine-tuning against standard fine-tuning and prompt engineering approaches
3. Clinical validation study comparing model predictions against board-certified dermatologists' diagnoses on real patient cases
