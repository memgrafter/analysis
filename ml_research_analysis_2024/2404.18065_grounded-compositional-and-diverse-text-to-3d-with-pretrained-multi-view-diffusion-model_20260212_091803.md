# Grounded Compositional and Diverse Text-to-3D with Pretrained Multi-View Diffusion Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.18065
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18065
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: T3 Score II of 2.53/5.0, CLIP R-Precision of 62.73%, and frequency of Janus issues of 17.15% on benchmark of 100 text prompts

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Grounded-Dreamer, a two-stage method for generating high-fidelity 3D assets from complex text prompts while preserving compositional accuracy. The approach leverages a pre-trained multi-view diffusion model and introduces an attention refocusing mechanism to improve text-image alignment during 4-view image generation. A hybrid optimization strategy combining sparse-view NeRF with Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss is used in the second stage to achieve high-fidelity 3D reconstruction while preserving compositional priors. The method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in compositional accuracy, text-image alignment, and view consistency, while also enabling diverse 3D generation from the same text prompt.

## Method Summary
Grounded-Dreamer is a two-stage approach that first generates compositionally accurate 4-view images using a pre-trained multi-view diffusion model with an attention refocusing mechanism, then reconstructs high-fidelity 3D assets using a hybrid optimization strategy combining sparse-view NeRF with SDS loss. The attention refocusing mechanism optimizes latents to ensure cross-attention layers attend to all subject tokens across views, while the hybrid optimization uses sparse-view NeRF for initial geometry and texture, followed by SDS-based refinement with a warm-start timestep schedule. The method achieves superior compositional accuracy and view consistency compared to baselines while enabling diverse 3D generation from the same prompt.

## Key Results
- T3 Score II of 2.53/5.0 and CLIP R-Precision of 62.73% on benchmark of 100 text prompts
- Frequency of Janus issues reduced to 17.15% compared to higher rates in baseline methods
- FID score of 115.94, demonstrating improved textural quality and view consistency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Attention refocusing during 4-view image generation improves compositional accuracy without retraining the diffusion model.
- Mechanism: Optimizes noisy latents using a loss that encourages cross-attention layers to attend to all subject tokens across all four views by aggregating attention maps and computing a loss that strengthens the most neglected subject token.
- Core assumption: Optimizing latents with attention refocusing can guide the multi-view diffusion model to generate compositionally correct 4-view images without violating multi-view consistency or causing out-of-distribution latents.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we then introduce an attention refocusing mechanism to encourage text-aligned 4-view image generation, without the necessity to re-train the multi-view diffusion model"
  - [section] "To design an more effective paradigm for composition control in Text-to-3D, we thus first adapt attention refocusing mechanism into compositionally correct 4-view generation"
- Break condition: If attention refocusing causes latents to become out-of-distribution or breaks multi-view consistency, generated images may become corrupted or inconsistent.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Hybrid optimization combining sparse-view NeRF with SDS loss achieves high-fidelity 3D reconstruction while preserving compositional priors.
- Mechanism: First uses sparse-view NeRF with image reconstruction loss to establish coarse geometry and texture, then gradually introduces SDS loss with warm-start timestep schedule to refine details while preserving compositional priors.
- Core assumption: Coarse geometry and texture from sparse-view NeRF can serve as good initialization for SDS-based refinement, and warm-start schedule can prevent drastic content changes violating compositional priors.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We further propose a hybrid optimization strategy to encourage synergy between the SDS loss and the sparse RGB reference images"
  - [section] "When the rough compositional geometry, and the associated texture emerge from the early few-shot NeRF training, we marry sparse-view NeRF with SDS-based 3D distillation to enable high-fidelity 3D generation, while preserving the compositional priors"
- Break condition: If SDS loss introduced too early or with inappropriate timestep schedule, may lead to geometric distortions or violations of compositional priors.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using pre-trained multi-view diffusion model for SDS loss improves textural quality and view consistency compared to standard 2D diffusion model.
- Mechanism: Uses pre-trained multi-view diffusion model (MVDream) for both 4-view image generation and as SDS loss backbone, leveraging multi-view consistency learned by MVDream during both stages.
- Core assumption: Multi-view consistency learned by MVDream can be effectively transferred to 3D reconstruction process through SDS loss, leading to better textural quality and view consistency.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We adopt an optimization-based reconstruction framework that leverages both the 4-view reference images, and a pre-trained multi-view diffusion model for priors-augmented reconstruction"
  - [section] "We use the pre-trained MVDream-T2I model for SDS loss, without doing any fine-tuning or re-training"
- Break condition: If multi-view consistency of MVDream is insufficient or SDS loss with MVDream not properly balanced with image reconstruction loss, textural quality and view consistency may not improve compared to standard 2D diffusion model.

## Foundational Learning

  - Why needed here: Method relies on pre-trained multi-view diffusion model for both 4-view image generation and as SDS loss backbone in 3D reconstruction.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of score function in diffusion model, and how is it used in SDS loss for 3D reconstruction?

- Concept: Cross-attention in diffusion models
  - Why needed here: Attention refocusing mechanism relies on optimizing cross-attention layers to attend to all subject tokens across four views.
  - Quick check question: How does cross-attention mechanism work in diffusion model, and why is it important for compositional accuracy?

- Concept: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and optimization-based 3D reconstruction
  - Why needed here: Method uses hybrid optimization strategy combining sparse-view NeRF with SDS-based 3D distillation for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction.
  - Quick check question: What is role of NeRF representation in method, and how does optimization process work to refine 3D reconstruction?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Text prompt -> Multi-view diffusion model with attention refocusing -> 4 compositionally correct views -> Sparse-view NeRF with image reconstruction loss -> SDS loss with warm-start schedule -> High-fidelity 3D asset

- Critical path:
  1. Text prompt fed into pre-trained multi-view diffusion model
  2. Attention refocusing mechanism optimizes latents to generate 4 compositionally correct views
  3. Sparse-view NeRF with image reconstruction loss establishes coarse geometry and texture
  4. SDS loss with warm-start timestep schedule refines details while preserving compositional priors
  5. High-fidelity 3D asset outputted

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using pre-trained multi-view diffusion model vs. training new model from scratch
  - Optimizing latents with attention refocusing vs. training new model with compositional priors
  - Sparse-view NeRF with image reconstruction loss vs. SDS loss alone for 3D reconstruction

- Failure signatures:
  - Corrupted or inconsistent 4-view images due to attention refocusing issues
  - Geometric distortions or violations of compositional priors due to SDS loss issues
  - Poor textural quality or view consistency due to issues with pre-trained multi-view diffusion model

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test attention refocusing mechanism on simple text prompt with single subject to verify generation of compositionally correct 4-view images.
  2. Test hybrid optimization strategy on simple 3D shape (e.g., sphere) to verify preservation of shape while refining details.
  3. Test use of pre-trained multi-view diffusion model for SDS loss on simple 3D scene to verify improvement in textural quality and view consistency compared to standard 2D diffusion model.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does attention refocusing mechanism scale when applied to text prompts with significantly more compositional elements than current benchmark?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Authors mention method is designed to handle complex compositional prompts and compare performance on 100 text prompts divided into compositional-objects and compositional-animals categories, stating attention refocusing ensures each subject token is precisely represented across all views.
- Why unresolved: Current benchmark only includes 100 text prompts with relatively simple compositional elements; paper doesn't provide evidence of method's performance on text prompts with significantly higher number of compositional elements or more complex spatial relationships between multiple subjects.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results demonstrating method's performance on text prompts with much larger number of compositional elements (e.g., 10+ subjects with intricate spatial relationships) and comparison of computational resources required as complexity of prompts increases.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is impact of using different multi-view diffusion models as backbone for SDS loss on final 3D generation quality and compositional accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Authors conduct ablation study comparing method using MVDream-T2I with variant using SD v2.1 for SDS loss, showing improved results with MVDream-T2I, mentioning pre-trained multi-view diffusion model is used for SDS loss without fine-tuning.
- Why unresolved: While paper shows comparison between MVDream-T2I and SD v2.1, doesn't explore other potential multi-view diffusion models or investigate impact of fine-tuning multi-view diffusion model on SDS loss performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing method's performance using various multi-view diffusion models (both fine-tuned and non-fine-tuned) as SDS loss backbone, with metrics on compositional accuracy, view consistency, and 3D generation quality.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does method perform when generating 3D assets from text prompts describing abstract or non-physical concepts?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Paper focuses on generating 3D assets from text prompts describing physical objects and scenes with specific compositional elements, relying on spatial relationships and attributes of physical objects to generate accurate 3D representations.
- Why unresolved: Paper doesn't provide evidence of method's ability to generate 3D assets from text prompts describing abstract or non-physical concepts, which may not have clear spatial relationships or physical attributes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results demonstrating method's performance on text prompts describing abstract or non-physical concepts (e.g., "a dream," "the concept of time," "a feeling of happiness") and qualitative analysis of generated 3D assets in terms of interpretability and relevance to given prompts.

## Limitations
- Attention refocusing mechanism lacks detailed implementation specifics needed for faithful reproduction
- Method's performance inherently tied to capabilities of pre-trained multi-view diffusion model (MVDream)
- Janus issue rate of 17.15% remains significant, indicating compositional inconsistencies still occur
- User study sample size (12 participants) is relatively small for drawing definitive conclusions

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Hybrid optimization strategy combining sparse-view NeRF with SDS loss is well-established in literature, implementation details sufficient to understand approach, quantitative metrics computed using standard methods
- **Medium Confidence**: Attention refocusing mechanism shows promise but lack of detailed implementation specifics and relatively small user study sample size reduce confidence in claimed improvements
- **Low Confidence**: Claim of enabling diverse 3D generation from same text prompt supported by qualitative examples but lacks quantitative metrics to measure diversity

## Next Checks

1. Reproduce attention refocusing mechanism on simple text prompt with single subject (e.g., "a red cube") and verify generation of compositionally correct 4-view images, comparing generated views with and without attention refocusing to quantify improvements in compositional accuracy

2. Test method's performance using different pre-trained diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion, MVDream variants) to understand sensitivity to choice of diffusion model backbone, validating whether claimed improvements are specific to MVDream or generalize to other models

3. Develop and apply quantitative metrics to measure diversity of 3D assets generated from same text prompt, including metrics like Chamfer distance between point clouds or cosine distance between feature embeddings, comparing diversity achieved by Grounded-Dreamer with baseline methods to provide concrete evidence for diversity claims
