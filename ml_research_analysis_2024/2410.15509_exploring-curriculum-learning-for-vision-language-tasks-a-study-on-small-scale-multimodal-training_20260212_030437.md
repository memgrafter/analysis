# Exploring Curriculum Learning for Vision-Language Tasks: A Study on Small-Scale Multimodal Training

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2410.15509
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15509
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Curriculum learning improves vision-language model performance in data-limited settings, especially when combined with text pretraining

## Executive Summary
This study investigates curriculum learning for vision-language models (VLMs) in scenarios with limited data availability. The authors develop a custom Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagger to score image-caption pairs by difficulty and train four variants each of GIT and Flamingo models: two baseline models (trained only on image-caption data or with additional text pretraining) and two curriculum learning models. The research demonstrates that curriculum learning can enhance VLM performance across multimodal tasks, particularly when combined with text pretraining, and shows consistent benefits for smaller-parameter models on text-only tasks. These findings suggest curriculum learning is a valuable approach for improving VLM performance when large-scale training data is unavailable.

## Method Summary
The study implements a custom PoS tagger trained on 100M words (50M from varied text corpora + 50M from image-caption pairs) to assign difficulty scores to image-caption pairs. These scores are used to create four difficulty phases via quartile-based pacing. The authors train four model variants for each of two VLM architectures (GIT and Flamingo): a caption-only baseline, a text-plus-caption baseline, a caption-only curriculum learning model, and a text-plus-caption curriculum learning model. Training uses 2 epochs per difficulty phase with learning rate 1e-5, batch size 32, and Adam optimizer. Text pretraining runs for 20 epochs on text-only data for T+C variants. The approach is evaluated across multimodal tasks (Winoground, VQAv2, DevBench) and text-only tasks (BLiMP, (Super)GLUE, EWOK).

## Key Results
- Curriculum learning improves multimodal task performance in several cases, particularly when combined with text pretraining
- For text-only tasks, curriculum learning consistently benefits smaller-parameter models
- Effects vary by model architecture and task type, with no universal improvement across all configurations
- The custom PoS-based difficulty scoring successfully enables effective curriculum learning in limited data regimes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Curriculum learning works by presenting training examples in an order from easy to difficult, allowing models to build foundational knowledge before tackling more complex concepts. In vision-language tasks, this approach helps models first learn basic associations between simple visual elements and language before progressing to more abstract or complex relationships. The PoS-based difficulty scoring captures linguistic complexity, which correlates with the cognitive load required to process and relate visual and textual information. By structuring training this way, models can develop more robust representations and avoid being overwhelmed by complex examples early in training.

## Foundational Learning
- **Part-of-Speech tagging**: Needed to assess linguistic complexity of captions; quick check: tagger accuracy on held-out data
- **Vision-language alignment**: Required for models to learn cross-modal relationships; quick check: alignment loss convergence
- **Difficulty-based data ordering**: Core mechanism for curriculum learning; quick check: distribution of examples across difficulty phases
- **Multimodal pretraining**: Establishes foundational representations; quick check: pretraining loss curves
- **Transfer learning**: Enables knowledge application across tasks; quick check: performance gains on downstream tasks

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Text corpus → WordPiece tokenizer → PoS tagger → Difficulty scores → Curriculum scheduler → VLM training → Task-specific evaluation

**Critical Path**: Difficulty scoring → Curriculum scheduling → Model training → Evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs**: Custom PoS tagger vs. pretrained language models for difficulty scoring; smaller training data with curriculum learning vs. larger data without curriculum; computational cost of curriculum scheduling vs. potential performance gains

**Failure Signatures**: Poor curriculum performance due to suboptimal difficulty scoring (check PoS tagger accuracy); training instability (monitor validation loss curves); curriculum collapse (verify difficulty distribution across phases)

**First Experiments**: 1) Train and evaluate PoS tagger on held-out data; 2) Verify difficulty score distribution across quartiles; 3) Run single difficulty phase training to establish baseline performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Custom PoS tagger may not capture all aspects of multimodal task complexity
- Small-scale training regime (100M words) may not represent real-world applications
- Focus on two specific VLM architectures limits generalizability to other models
- Evaluation metrics may not capture all aspects of real-world performance
- Findings constrained by specific datasets and tasks chosen for evaluation

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: POS-based difficulty scoring methodology and curriculum implementation are well-specified and reproducible
- **Medium Confidence**: Conclusions about curriculum learning effectiveness are supported by experimental results but may vary with implementation details
- **Low Confidence**: Generalizability to other VLM architectures and larger-scale training scenarios remains uncertain

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-architecture validation**: Test curriculum learning approach on additional VLM architectures beyond GIT and Flamingo
2. **Difficulty scoring refinement**: Evaluate alternative difficulty scoring methods (semantic similarity, visual complexity) against PoS-based scoring
3. **Scaling study**: Experiment with varying amounts of training data to understand relationship between curriculum learning effectiveness and data availability
