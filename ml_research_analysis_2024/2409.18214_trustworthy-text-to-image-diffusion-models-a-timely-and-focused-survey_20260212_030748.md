- Authors: Yi Zhang; Zhen Chen; Chih-Hong Cheng; Wenjie Ruan; Xiaowei Huang; Dezong Zhao; David Flynn; Siddartha Khastbir; Xingyu Zhao
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Comprehensive survey of 98 papers on trustworthy T2I DMs covering robustness, fairness, security, privacy, explainability, and factuality

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive taxonomy of trustworthy Text-to-Image Diffusion Models, systematically organizing six key non-functional properties (robustness, fairness, security, privacy, factuality, explainability) and four means to study them (falsification, enhancement, verification & validation, assessment). The authors review 98 papers, identifying key findings including a focus on worst-case robustness and the use of spellcheckers for defense, while highlighting critical gaps such as the need for semantic distance metrics and dynamic backdoor triggers. The work establishes a structured framework for understanding trustworthiness in T2I DMs and proposes concrete future research directions.

## Method Summary
The survey methodology employs qualitative research analysis, using a search function to identify relevant papers while excluding those not meeting specific criteria (publication language, retrieval ability, page count, duplication, peer review status). The authors systematically reviewed and refined 98 papers covering trustworthy T2I DMs, analyzing solutions, identifying trends, and discussing limitations across the six non-functional properties and four means of study. The approach provides a structured taxonomy while synthesizing findings from the existing literature to guide future research directions.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Text encoder (e.g., CLIP's Text Encoder) -> Cross-attention -> U-Net denoising -> Autoencoder (VAE) -> Image output
- Critical path:
  - Text input → Text encoder → Cross-attention → U-Net denoising → Autoencoder → Image output
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Balancing model performance with trustworthiness considerations
  - Trade-off between robustness and model complexity
  - Balancing fairness and diversity in generated images
- Failure signatures:
  - Adversarial examples exploiting text encoder vulnerabilities
  - Backdoor attacks manipulating model outputs
  - Privacy breaches through data leakage or memorization
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the robustness of a T2I DM against adversarial text inputs.
  2. Assess the fairness of a T2I DM by analyzing generated images for bias.
  3. Test the privacy of a T2I DM by attempting membership inference attacks.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can semantic distance in text be effectively quantified to enable binary and maximum radius robustness for T2I DMs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that existing research focuses on worst-case robustness, leaving binary and maximum radius robustness largely unexplored due to the difficulty in defining a small norm-ball region for text inputs with the same semantic meaning.
- Why unresolved: Quantifying semantic distance in text is challenging, as it is closely tied to semantic similarity, which is difficult to measure.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of a metric that accurately measures semantic distance in text, enabling the application of binary and maximum radius robustness definitions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can dynamic backdoor triggers be designed and implemented to improve the security of T2I DMs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights that existing backdoor attacks focus on static triggers, which are inflexible and easily detectable, and suggests investigating dynamic triggers that display random patterns and locations.
- Why unresolved: Designing dynamic triggers is complex, as they need to be generated by specific systems and exhibit random patterns and locations, making them harder to detect.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful implementation and testing of dynamic backdoor triggers in T2I DMs, demonstrating their effectiveness and the challenges in detection.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the underlying causes of memorization in T2I DMs, and how can a unified analytical framework be developed to better understand this phenomenon?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that while current mitigation strategies for memorization are effective, they rely on specific detection methods, and there is a lack of in-depth analysis of the underlying causes of memorization.
- Why unresolved: Memorization in T2I DMs is complex, involving interactions between the model's training process, the data, and the generation mechanisms, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact causes.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study that identifies the key factors contributing to memorization in T2I DMs and proposes a unified framework for analyzing and mitigating this phenomenon.

## Limitations

- Survey methodology's exact search parameters are not fully specified, potentially introducing selection bias
- Temporal scope (papers up to 2023) may miss recent developments in this rapidly evolving field
- Assessment of trustworthiness properties relies heavily on reported results in surveyed papers, lacking independent verification

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- The taxonomy structure covering six non-functional properties and four means is well-supported by the corpus and aligns with established AI trustworthiness frameworks
- The identification of key trends (e.g., focus on worst-case robustness, use of spellcheckers for defense) is corroborated by multiple papers in the survey

**Medium Confidence:**
- The gap analysis and future research directions are logically derived from the reviewed literature but represent interpretations that may evolve with new research
- The characterization of current limitations in fairness metrics and semantic distance measures is based on available evidence but could benefit from broader empirical validation

**Low Confidence:**
- The relative importance assigned to different non-functional properties may shift as real-world deployment experiences accumulate
- The assessment of which properties are most challenging to address is preliminary and may change with technological advances

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical Validation of Robustness Claims**: Implement and test the spellchecker-based defense mechanisms against the identified adversarial attack patterns to verify the reported effectiveness rates.

2. **Fairness Metric Expansion**: Design and execute experiments to validate the proposed semantic distance metrics for fairness assessment across diverse datasets and cultural contexts.

3. **Cross-Property Interference Analysis**: Systematically evaluate how enhancements for one property (e.g., robustness) affect other properties (e.g., privacy or factuality) to identify potential trade-offs not yet documented in the literature.
