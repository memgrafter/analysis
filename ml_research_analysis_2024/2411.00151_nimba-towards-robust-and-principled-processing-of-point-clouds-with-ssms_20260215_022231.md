# NIMBA: Towards Robust and Principled Processing of Point Clouds With SSMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.00151
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00151
- Authors: Nursena Köprücü; Destiny Okpekpe; Antonio Orvieto
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: Up to 1.5% higher accuracy on ModelNet40 compared to transformer-based and other Mamba models

## Executive Summary
NIMBA introduces a spatially-aware reordering strategy for processing unordered 3D point clouds with state space models (SSMs) like Mamba. The core innovation addresses the challenge of converting unordered point clouds into sequences that preserve spatial relationships while being suitable for sequential processing. By eliminating the need for positional embeddings and sequence replication, NIMBA achieves superior accuracy and robustness on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Method Summary
NIMBA processes point clouds through a preprocessing pipeline that uses Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) and k-nearest neighbors (kNN) to create patches, followed by a spatially-aware reordering strategy that preserves 3D spatial relationships in the 1D sequence. This reordering makes positional embeddings redundant while eliminating the need for sequence replication. The method uses a Mamba-based architecture with 384 dimensions, 12 encoder layers, and 6 heads, trained with AdamW optimizer and cosine scheduler for 300 epochs on datasets including ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and ShapeNetPart.

## Key Results
- Achieves 1.5% higher accuracy on ModelNet40 compared to transformer-based models
- Improves accuracy by 3.2% on the OBJ-BG variant of ScanObjectNN
- Demonstrates superior robustness to noise and data transformations compared to existing approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: NIMBA's spatially-aware reordering strategy preserves 3D spatial relationships in the 1D sequence fed to Mamba.
- Mechanism: The reordering strategy orders centers based on their 3D proximity, ensuring consecutive points in the sequence are spatially close. This allows Mamba to capture spatial relationships through sequential processing without positional embeddings.
- Core assumption: Spatial proximity in 3D space can be effectively translated to sequential proximity in 1D while preserving meaningful relationships.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "NIMBA proposes a spatially-aware reordering strategy that preserves distances between points in the sequence"
  - [section] "NIMBA strategy is based on the concept of local proximity preservation"
- Break condition: If the reordering threshold r is set too high or too low, the sequence becomes either too similar to the original order or computationally expensive to generate, breaking the spatial relationship preservation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Removing positional embeddings from Mamba-based point cloud models is viable when using NIMBA's reordering strategy.
- Mechanism: Traditional Mamba models for point clouds use positional embeddings because the sequence construction doesn't preserve spatial relationships. NIMBA's reordering makes positional information redundant since spatial relationships are already encoded in the sequential order.
- Core assumption: The sequential order created by NIMBA contains sufficient spatial information to replace explicit positional embeddings.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "our method does not require positional embeddings"
  - [section] "NIMBA achieves these improvements without employing positional embeddings"
- Break condition: If the reordering strategy fails to maintain meaningful spatial relationships, positional embeddings would become necessary again for adequate performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: NIMBA's efficiency improvements come from avoiding sequence replication while maintaining or improving accuracy.
- Mechanism: PointMamba replicates the sequence 3 times (along x, y, and z axes) to capture different views, while NIMBA processes a single sequence with length N, eliminating redundancy.
- Core assumption: A single spatially-aware sequence can capture the necessary information that PointMamba captures through 3 separate sequences.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "NIMBA... eliminates the need for... sequence replication"
  - [section] "The method results in the sequence length being tripled, introducing redundancy"
- Break condition: If certain spatial relationships are only captured through axis-specific ordering, NIMBA might miss important features that PointMamba's replication captures.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba
  - Why needed here: Understanding how Mamba processes sequential data and its linear complexity advantage over transformers is crucial for grasping why point cloud preprocessing is necessary.
  - Quick check question: What is the computational complexity of Mamba compared to transformers with respect to sequence length?

- Concept: Point cloud representation and preprocessing
  - Why needed here: Understanding how point clouds are represented as unordered sets and the preprocessing steps (FPS, kNN) is essential for understanding the challenge of converting them to sequences.
  - Quick check question: Why can't Mamba process raw point clouds directly without any preprocessing?

- Concept: Positional embeddings in transformers vs. SSMs
  - Why needed here: Understanding the role of positional embeddings in transformers and why they're typically needed in SSMs for non-sequential data helps explain NIMBA's innovation.
  - Quick check question: Why do transformers need positional embeddings while Mamba doesn't need them for text processing?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input: Point cloud (N points in 3D space) -> Preprocessing: FPS + kNN to create patches -> NIMBA reordering: Spatially-aware ordering of centers -> Embedding layer: Patch and center embeddings -> Mamba layers: Sequential processing of reordered points -> Task head: Classification/segmentation output

- Critical path: Point cloud → Preprocessing → NIMBA reordering → Embedding → Mamba layers → Task head

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Sequence length vs. spatial relationship preservation (threshold r selection)
  - Computational cost of reordering vs. performance gain
  - Model complexity vs. efficiency (positional embeddings vs. reordering)

- Failure signatures:
  - Performance degradation when r is set incorrectly
  - Training instability if preprocessing parameters are mismatched
  - Suboptimal results if point cloud density is too low for meaningful reordering

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation study: Compare NIMBA with and without positional embeddings on ModelNet40
  2. Robustness test: Apply rotation and jittering noise to test NIMBA's spatial relationship preservation
  3. Efficiency measurement: Compare training time and memory usage between NIMBA and PointMamba on ScanObjectNN

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the choice of proximity threshold r in NIMBA's reordering strategy affect model performance and computational efficiency across different point cloud datasets and tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses choosing r = 0.8 as a balance between quality of reordered sequence and computational cost, but suggests this choice is crucial and affects the final ordering.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests r = 0.8 on specific datasets without exploring how different values of r impact performance across various point cloud tasks and dataset characteristics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic ablation studies varying r across multiple datasets (synthetic, real-world, noisy) and tasks (classification, segmentation, completion) to establish optimal thresholds for different scenarios.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can NIMBA's spatially-aware reordering strategy be effectively combined with other efficient attention mechanisms like linear attention or hierarchical approaches to further improve performance on large-scale point clouds?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that NIMBA eliminates the need for positional embeddings and sequence replication, but notes limitations when replacing Mamba with Mamba2 or integrating into hybrid architectures.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests NIMBA with the basic Mamba architecture and doesn't explore combinations with other efficient attention variants or hybrid approaches that could leverage NIMBA's reordering benefits.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing NIMBA with various attention mechanisms (linear attention, hierarchical attention, hybrid models) on large-scale point cloud datasets like ScanNet with millions of points.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the theoretical relationship between NIMBA's proximity-based ordering and the model's ability to capture spatial relationships in point clouds, and how does this compare to attention-based models that use positional embeddings?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper claims NIMBA maintains 3D spatial structure without positional embeddings, contrasting with other works that show performance drops when positional embeddings are removed.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates empirical success, it doesn't provide theoretical analysis of why the proximity-based ordering works or how it relates to the spatial relationship capture compared to positional embeddings.
- What evidence would resolve it: Mathematical analysis or visualization studies showing how NIMBA's ordering preserves spatial relationships compared to random ordering or positional embedding approaches, possibly through metrics like neighborhood preservation or feature similarity.

## Limitations
- Implementation details for the NIMBA reordering algorithm are not fully specified, particularly the threshold selection mechanism
- The architectural differences between NIMBA and the PointMamba baseline are not clearly defined
- Efficiency claims regarding reduced computational complexity lack empirical runtime or memory usage validation

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: NIMBA achieves state-of-the-art results on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets, with specific accuracy improvements reported (1.5% on ModelNet40, 3.2% on OBJ-BG variant).
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that NIMBA eliminates the need for positional embeddings is supported by experimental results, but the mechanism by which the reordering strategy encodes spatial information is not fully explained.
- **Low Confidence**: The efficiency claims regarding reduced computational complexity are not empirically validated with runtime or memory usage comparisons to baseline methods.

## Next Checks
1. **Implementation Verification**: Replicate the NIMBA reordering strategy on a small synthetic dataset to verify that the spatial relationship preservation mechanism works as described, testing different threshold values for r.
2. **Ablation Study Extension**: Perform additional ablation studies isolating the contribution of reordering versus other architectural changes by testing NIMBA with and without the sequence replication elimination.
3. **Robustness Quantification**: Systematically measure NIMBA's robustness to noise and transformations by quantifying performance degradation across different noise levels and transformation types, comparing against transformer-based baselines.
