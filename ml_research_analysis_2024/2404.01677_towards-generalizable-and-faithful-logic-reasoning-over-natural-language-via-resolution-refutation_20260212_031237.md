# Towards Generalizable and Faithful Logic Reasoning over Natural Language via Resolution Refutation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.01677
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01677
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Introduces GFaiR framework using resolution refutation for complete and faithful natural language logic reasoning, outperforming previous methods on hard datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the fundamental limitations of stepwise inference methods in natural language reasoning by introducing GFaiR, a framework based on resolution refutation. The key insight is that traditional forward/backward chaining approaches are theoretically incomplete, limiting their ability to handle complex reasoning scenarios. GFaiR overcomes this by incorporating resolution refutation, a complete logical reasoning paradigm under first-order logic. The framework combines multiple modules including converters, selectors, a knowledge composer, and a verifier with validity contrastive loss to ensure both valid conclusions and faithful reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that GFaiR achieves better generalization and faithfulness compared to previous approaches, particularly on harder reasoning tasks.

## Method Summary
GFaiR introduces a novel framework that leverages resolution refutation to achieve complete and faithful natural language reasoning over formal logical theories. The approach uses a multi-module system where a converter transforms natural language into first-order logic, selectors identify relevant premises, a knowledge composer constructs intermediate logical representations, and a verifier with validity contrastive loss ensures logical consistency. The validity contrastive loss-based verifier is crucial for reducing hallucinations and improving faithfulness by ensuring that selected theories lead to logically consistent conclusions. The framework is evaluated across multiple datasets including RuleTaker, Hard RuleTater, and natural language satisfiability tasks, demonstrating superior performance on challenging reasoning problems while maintaining strong performance on easier tasks.

## Key Results
- GFaiR outperforms previous stepwise inference methods on hard reasoning datasets while maintaining performance on easier ones
- The validity contrastive loss-based verifier significantly reduces hallucinations and improves faithfulness in reasoning
- Resolution refutation provides theoretical completeness under first-order logic, addressing limitations of forward/backward chaining approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
GFaiR works by addressing the fundamental incompleteness of traditional stepwise inference methods. Resolution refutation provides a complete reasoning paradigm under first-order logic, ensuring that valid conclusions can always be derived when they exist. The framework's multi-module architecture enables systematic processing of natural language reasoning tasks: the converter translates natural language to formal logic, selectors identify relevant premises for the current reasoning step, the knowledge composer builds intermediate representations, and the verifier with validity contrastive loss ensures that conclusions are both valid and faithful. The validity contrastive loss is particularly important as it creates a learning signal that distinguishes between valid and invalid reasoning paths, reducing the tendency to hallucinate conclusions that are not logically supported by the premises.

## Foundational Learning

**Resolution Refutation**
- Why needed: Provides a complete reasoning paradigm under first-order logic, addressing incompleteness of stepwise methods
- Quick check: Can derive contradiction from negated conclusion and premises, proving validity

**Validity Contrastive Loss**
- Why needed: Ensures the verifier learns to distinguish valid from invalid conclusions
- Quick check: Model outputs higher scores for valid conclusions than invalid ones on held-out examples

**First-Order Logic Conversion**
- Why needed: Enables application of formal logical reasoning methods to natural language
- Quick check: Converted statements preserve semantic meaning and logical relationships

**Knowledge Composition**
- Why needed: Builds intermediate logical representations needed for complex multi-step reasoning
- Quick check: Intermediate steps maintain logical consistency and support final conclusion derivation

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Converter -> Selector -> Knowledge Composer -> Verifier -> Conclusion

**Critical Path:**
Natural language input → First-order logic conversion → Premise selection → Knowledge composition → Validity verification → Conclusion generation

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Resolution refutation completeness vs. computational complexity
- Strict logical consistency vs. flexibility in handling ambiguous natural language
- Verifier accuracy vs. model size and inference time

**Failure Signatures:**
- Incorrect first-order logic conversions leading to invalid reasoning
- Selector choosing irrelevant premises for the current reasoning step
- Verifier failing to detect invalid conclusions due to semantic similarity
- Knowledge composer creating logically inconsistent intermediate representations

**First Experiments:**
1. Test resolution refutation on simple logical entailment problems with ground truth
2. Evaluate converter accuracy on benchmark natural language to first-order logic datasets
3. Assess verifier performance distinguishing valid from invalid conclusions on synthetic examples

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance on truly open-domain natural language reasoning with real-world complexity and ambiguity remains unclear
- Verifier module may struggle when valid and invalid conclusions are semantically similar
- Reliance on first-order logic conversion may introduce errors in practical applications where perfect formalizations are difficult

## Confidence
- High confidence in theoretical completeness claims due to established nature of resolution refutation
- Medium confidence in practical generalizability improvements based on synthetic dataset results
- Medium confidence in faithfulness improvements demonstrated through hallucination reduction

## Next Checks
1. Test GFaiR on open-domain natural language datasets with real-world complexity and ambiguity
2. Evaluate verifier module robustness when valid and invalid conclusions are semantically similar
3. Assess impact of imperfect first-order logic conversions on overall reasoning performance
