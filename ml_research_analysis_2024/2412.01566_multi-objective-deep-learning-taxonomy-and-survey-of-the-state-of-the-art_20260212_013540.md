# Multi-objective Deep Learning: Taxonomy and Survey of the State of the Art

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.01566
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01566
- Reference count: 40
- Authors: Sebastian Peitz; Sedjro Salomon Hotegni
- This paper provides a comprehensive survey of multi-objective deep learning, introducing a taxonomy based on training algorithms and decision maker needs.

## Executive Summary
This survey presents a comprehensive taxonomy of multi-objective deep learning approaches, categorizing methods based on their training algorithms and decision maker requirements. The authors systematically review approaches across supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and generative modeling domains. They identify key challenges and opportunities in the field, highlighting the growing importance of multi-objective optimization in deep learning applications.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a systematic approach to categorize multi-objective deep learning methods, organizing them into three main categories based on their optimization strategies: methods solving a single scalarized objective (including weighting methods, epsilon-constraint methods, and continuation methods), methods solving multiple objectives simultaneously (including MGDA, MOEAs, and other multi-objective optimizers), and methods learning a parametrized policy (including deep reinforcement learning approaches). The authors also distinguish between methods that require active user interaction and those that produce Pareto sets automatically.

## Key Results
- MGDA has emerged as the most popular approach due to its efficiency and compatibility with existing gradient-based training techniques
- MOEAs face significant challenges in high-dimensional deep learning problems due to computational costs
- Multi-objective optimization shows promise in emerging areas like physics-informed machine learning and neural architecture search

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Multi-objective deep learning works by extending traditional single-objective optimization frameworks to handle multiple competing objectives simultaneously. This is achieved through various strategies including scalarization (converting multiple objectives into a single objective), direct multi-objective optimization (maintaining multiple objectives throughout training), and policy learning approaches (learning to balance objectives through reinforcement learning).

## Foundational Learning
1. **Multi-objective optimization theory**: Essential for understanding Pareto optimality and trade-off surfaces
   - Why needed: Provides theoretical foundation for evaluating and comparing solutions
   - Quick check: Can you define Pareto optimality and explain its significance?

2. **Gradient-based optimization**: Critical for understanding MGDA and its variants
   - Why needed: Most deep learning methods rely on gradient descent
   - Quick check: Can you explain how gradients are computed for multiple objectives?

3. **Evolutionary algorithms**: Important for understanding MOEA approaches
   - Why needed: Provides alternative to gradient-based methods
   - Quick check: Can you describe how genetic algorithms work in multi-objective optimization?

4. **Scalarization techniques**: Key for methods that convert multiple objectives to single objectives
   - Why needed: Many practical implementations use scalarization
   - Quick check: Can you explain weighted sum and epsilon-constraint methods?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Multi-objective deep learning framework -> Objective functions -> Optimization algorithm -> Solution set (Pareto front)

**Critical Path:**
Problem formulation -> Objective function definition -> Algorithm selection -> Training -> Solution analysis

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Computational efficiency vs solution quality
- User interaction requirements vs automation
- Solution diversity vs convergence speed
- Scalability to high-dimensional problems

**Failure Signatures:**
- Convergence to suboptimal solutions
- Inability to find diverse solutions
- Computational infeasibility for large-scale problems
- Poor generalization across different objective combinations

**First Experiments:**
1. Implement a simple weighted sum approach on a synthetic multi-objective classification problem
2. Apply MGDA to a standard multi-task learning benchmark
3. Compare different scalarization methods on a regression problem with multiple loss functions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The survey identifies several open questions in multi-objective deep learning, including the need for better methods to handle high-dimensional problems, more effective interactive methods for decision making, and the development of challenging benchmark problems to evaluate different approaches. The authors also highlight the need for methods that can better handle conflicting objectives and provide more interpretable trade-offs between solutions.

## Limitations
- Limited coverage of recent advancements in multi-objective deep learning (2022-2024)
- Lack of standardized benchmark problems for comprehensive evaluation
- Insufficient attention to interactive methods and high-dimensional problem-solving
- Limited quantitative comparison of method performance across different domains

## Confidence

**High Confidence:**
- Taxonomy structure and categorization of existing approaches
- MGDA's popularity and MOEAs' computational limitations are well-supported

**Medium Confidence:**
- Coverage of recent advancements and emerging applications
- Performance claims based on limited recent publications

**Low Confidence:**
- Comparative analysis of method performance lacks quantitative benchmarks
- Difficulty assessing relative effectiveness across different scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a systematic literature review to identify recent publications (2022-2024) that may have introduced new multi-objective deep learning approaches not covered in the survey
2. Implement and benchmark the major approaches (MGDA, MOEAs, scalarization) on a standardized set of multi-objective deep learning problems to validate performance claims
3. Develop a comprehensive benchmark suite for multi-objective deep learning that includes high-dimensional problems and interactive methods to address current evaluation limitations
