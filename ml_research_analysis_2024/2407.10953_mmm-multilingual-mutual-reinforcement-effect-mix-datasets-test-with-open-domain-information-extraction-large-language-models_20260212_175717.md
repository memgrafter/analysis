# MMM: Multilingual Mutual Reinforcement Effect Mix Datasets & Test with Open-domain Information Extraction Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.10953
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10953
- Reference count: 33
- Primary result: Achieved F1 scores ranging from 42-96% across different languages and tasks using OIELLM trained on MMM multilingual dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Multilingual Mutual Reinforcement Effect Mix (MMM) dataset, a multilingual extension of Japanese-exclusive MRE mix datasets covering English, Japanese, and Chinese across 21 sub-datasets. The authors developed a dataset translation framework leveraging LLMs to translate the original Japanese datasets, significantly reducing manual annotation time while maintaining quality. Using the MMM dataset, they trained an Open-domain Information Extraction Large Language Model (OIELLM) with a unified input-output framework, achieving performance improvements over baseline models.

## Method Summary
The authors created MMM by translating Japanese MRE mix datasets into English and Chinese using an LLM-assisted framework that combines rule-based label translation, in-context learning with GPT-3.5-Turbo, and post-filtering with manual calibration. They also constructed a new open-domain Named Entity Recognition dataset (TCONER) to expand task coverage. OIELLM was trained on LLaMA3-8B and LLaMA3-13B backbones using a unified input-output schema with task-specific instruction words, enabling multitask learning across 21 subtasks through the Mutual Reinforcement Effect framework.

## Key Results
- OIELLM achieved F1 scores ranging from 42-96% across different languages and tasks
- LLaMA3-13B outperformed LLaMA3-8B on most subtasks
- OIELLM demonstrated performance improvements over baseline models (USA-7B, GIELLM-13B-jp)
- Model showed varying performance across languages, with English generally performing best

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLM-based translation framework significantly reduces manual annotation time while maintaining quality
- Mechanism: Rule-based matching for labels (text-level and word-level) is applied first to handle consistent labeling across datasets, followed by in-context learning with GPT-3.5-Turbo to translate text and entities. Post-filtering removes low-quality translations, and manual calibration ensures final quality
- Core assumption: LLMs can reliably translate structured datasets when given clear formatting constraints and examples
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we also propose a method for dataset translation assisted by Large Language Models (LLMs), which significantly reduces the manual annotation time required for dataset construction by leveraging LLMs to translate the original Japanese datasets"
  - [section] "Using a rule-based approach for label translation is not only quick and precise but also simplifies the subsequent translation of text and entities"
- Break condition: If LLMs fail to adhere to formatting constraints or if rule-based filtering removes too much data, the pipeline fails to produce usable translations

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Unified input-output format for OIELLM enables effective multitask learning across diverse IE subtasks
- Mechanism: Each task is prefixed with a task instruction word (e.g., /NER) in the input, and the output is structured to contain both text-level labels and word-level label-entity pairs in a consistent format. This allows the model to learn interdependencies between tasks
- Core assumption: A single sequence-to-sequence model can generalize across structured IE tasks when input and output formats are standardized
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Utilizing this expanded dataset, we developed a unified input-output framework to train an Open-domain Information Extraction Large Language Model (OIELLM)"
  - [section] "Each text processed is prefixed with task-specific instruction words, which define the task type and guide the model's subsequent output generation"
- Break condition: If task instructions are ambiguous or if the model cannot maintain the output structure, performance degrades

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: MRE framework improves IE performance by modeling mutual reinforcement between text-level and word-level tasks
- Mechanism: Joint training on both classification and entity extraction within the same text allows the model to use information from one task to reinforce the other, mimicking human comprehension
- Core assumption: Text-level labels and word-level entities contain complementary information that can be leveraged during training
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The Mutual Reinforcement Effect (MRE) introduces a novel approach in multitasking IE, emphasizing task interconnections to enhance performance"
  - [section] "Understanding either part helps reinforce the comprehension of the other"
- Break condition: If tasks are too weakly related, mutual reinforcement provides little benefit and may even interfere

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Sequence-to-sequence modeling for structured outputs
  - Why needed here: OIELLM must generate both text-level labels and word-level label-entity pairs in a single pass, requiring a seq2seq architecture
  - Quick check question: Can the model produce structured outputs that preserve the pairing between labels and entities?

- Concept: In-context learning and few-shot prompting
  - Why needed here: LLMs are used to translate datasets without fine-tuning, relying on example-driven learning to maintain formatting
  - Quick check question: Does the model correctly follow the formatting constraints given in the prompt?

- Concept: Mutual reinforcement effect in multitask learning
  - Why needed here: The core hypothesis is that joint modeling of related tasks improves performance on both
  - Quick check question: Do models trained with MRE outperform models trained on tasks separately?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Dataset translation pipeline (Rule-based label translation -> LLM-based text/entity translation -> Rule-based filtering -> Manual calibration) -> OIELLM model (LLaMA3 backbone -> Unified input-output schema -> Multitask training) -> Evaluation (F1-score calculation)

- Critical path:
  1. Translate MRE mix datasets into target languages using the LLM-assisted framework
  2. Construct TCONER dataset with open-domain NER
  3. Train OIELLM on the unified MMM dataset
  4. Evaluate performance across all subtasks

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Translation quality vs. speed: Rule-based filtering reduces dataset size but improves quality
  - Model size vs. performance: LLaMA3-13B outperforms LLaMA3-8B but requires more resources
  - Task granularity vs. complexity: Including more subtasks increases coverage but may dilute performance

- Failure signatures:
  - Translation pipeline: High data loss after filtering, inconsistent formatting
  - Model training: Degraded F1 scores, inability to generate correct label-entity pairs
  - Evaluation: Zero F1 scores in one or more categories

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run the translation pipeline on a small subset and verify output format and quality
  2. Train OIELLM on a balanced subset of MMM datasets and check convergence
  3. Evaluate OIELLM on held-out data and compare TL, WL, and ALL F1 scores

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- The paper notes that OIELLM's performance on the TCONER open-domain NER task was suboptimal and attributes this to insufficient training data, suggesting this as a future research focus.
- The authors mention that the dataset translation framework resulted in substantial data loss, particularly for Chinese, without analyzing how this affects model performance or whether a different balance between translation quality and dataset size might yield better results.

## Limitations
- The LLM-assisted translation framework lacks transparency in implementation details, particularly regarding rule-based filtering criteria and manual calibration process
- Performance gap between languages (lower scores for Chinese and Japanese) suggests potential issues with translation quality or model multilingual capabilities that are not fully addressed
- The study lacks ablation studies to quantify the specific contribution of the MRE framework versus the multilingual dataset expansion

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The unified input-output framework and basic training methodology (3 epochs, LLaMA3 fine-tuning) are well-specified and reproducible
- **Medium Confidence:** The dataset translation framework's effectiveness is supported by reported results, but lack of implementation details creates uncertainty about reproducibility
- **Medium Confidence:** The claim that MRE improves performance is supported by comparison to baselines, but without ablations or separate task training comparisons, the specific contribution of mutual reinforcement is unclear

## Next Checks
1. Run the translation pipeline on a small subset of Japanese MRE data and manually verify the quality of English/Chinese outputs, checking both format adherence and semantic accuracy
2. Train separate models on individual tasks versus the unified MRE approach to quantify the performance gain from mutual reinforcement, controlling for dataset size and training duration
3. Test whether training on multilingual data improves performance on low-resource languages by training models with and without Japanese/Chinese data and comparing English task performance
