- Authors: Chunhui Zhang; Yawen Cui; Weilin Lin; Guanjie Huang; Yan Rong; Li Liu; Shiguang Shan
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: First comprehensive review of SAM applications in video processing, revealing performance gaps in video-specific tasks compared to specialized models

## Executive Summary
This survey provides the first systematic review of Segment Anything Model (SAM) applications in video processing, analyzing 1,093 research works across video understanding (76.5%), generation (17.6%), and editing (5.9%). The authors identify significant performance gaps between SAM-based methods and state-of-the-art approaches designed for specific video segmentation tasks, primarily due to SAM's image-centric training that ignores temporal dynamics. Key challenges include processing high-dimensional video data, maintaining computational efficiency, and handling temporal consistency across frames. The survey highlights opportunities for large-scale video dataset construction using SAM-generated annotations, parameter-efficient training methods, and multi-modal integration to advance video foundation models.

## Method Summary
The survey systematically reviews 1,093 research works on SAM applications in video processing through literature search and categorization. Papers are organized into three main categories: video understanding (76.5%), video generation (17.6%), and video editing (5.9%), with further subcategories for each domain. The authors evaluate SAM-based methods against state-of-the-art approaches across various video tasks using representative benchmark datasets. Performance analysis focuses on identifying gaps between direct SAM application and specialized video methods, while qualitative analysis examines pros and cons of different approaches. The survey also identifies future research directions and challenges in video foundation model development.

## Key Results
- Video understanding dominates SAM applications with 76.5% of studies, followed by video generation (17.6%) and video editing (5.9%)
- SAM-based methods show significant performance gaps compared to SOTA video segmentation models due to lack of temporal information processing
- Key challenges include high-dimensional data handling, computational efficiency, and maintaining temporal consistency across frames

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: SAM-based methods show significant performance gaps compared to SOTA methods designed for specific video segmentation tasks.
- Mechanism: Direct application of image-trained SAM to video tasks ignores the importance of end-to-end training and finetuning for inherently complex video tasks.
- Core assumption: SAM pre-trained on image data cannot effectively handle the temporal information and dynamic changes inherent in video data without specialized adaptation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "revealing performance gaps in video-specific tasks compared to specialized models"
  - [section] "The SAM-based methods have significant performance gaps compared to the current SOTA methods designed for specific video segmentation tasks. This is because many SAM-based methods directly utilize SAM pre-trained on image data to enhance the ability of object segmentation, ignoring the importance of end-to-end training and finetuning for inherently complex video tasks."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related papers discuss SAM2 improvements but don't directly address this performance gap claim.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: High-quality prompts are crucial for the zero-shot generalization ability of SAM.
- Mechanism: The quality of prompts (e.g., ground-truth bounding boxes) directly influences SAM's ability to generate accurate segmentation masks in video tasks.
- Core assumption: SAM's zero-shot generalization relies heavily on the quality and specificity of input prompts to guide segmentation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Empowered by its remarkable zero-shot generalization, SAM is currently challenging numerous traditional paradigms"
  - [section] "The high-quality of prompt is crucial for the zero-shot generalization ability of SAM. One example is that 'GT Box+SAM' uses reliable ground-truth bounding boxes as prompts and achieves the second best results on DA VIS 2017 val."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related papers mention prompt engineering but don't specifically address zero-shot generalization in video tasks.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Models trained on video data exhibit significant advantages over models trained solely on image data.
- Mechanism: Video-trained models can better handle temporal consistency and coherence across frames, leading to improved performance in video segmentation tasks.
- Core assumption: Video data contains temporal dynamics that are not present in static images, requiring specialized training for effective processing.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "video understanding dominates with 76.5% of studies"
  - [section] "The models (e.g., XMem [101] and VMT [122]) trained on video data exhibit significant advantages over the models trained solely on image data, and the utilization of multi-modal data (e.g., video and image) [125] often leads to improved performance."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related papers discuss SAM2 improvements but don't directly compare video-trained vs. image-trained models.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Temporal information processing in videos
  - Why needed here: Video tasks require handling not just spatial information but also temporal dynamics and relationships between frames.
  - Quick check question: How does temporal information in videos differ from spatial information in images, and why is this important for video segmentation tasks?

- Concept: Zero-shot generalization
  - Why needed here: SAM's ability to perform tasks without task-specific training is crucial for its application in video tasks, but understanding its limitations is important.
  - Quick check question: What is zero-shot generalization, and how does SAM's ability to perform this differ when applied to images versus videos?

- Concept: Prompt engineering
  - Why needed here: The quality of prompts significantly affects SAM's performance in video tasks, making it essential to understand how to create effective prompts.
  - Quick check question: How do different types of prompts (e.g., points, boxes, text) affect SAM's performance in video segmentation tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input video frames → Prompt generation (user clicks, boxes, or automatic detection) → SAM model processing → Temporal consistency module (e.g., XMem) → Output masks for each frame
- Critical path: Prompt generation → SAM processing → Temporal consistency → Output masks
- Design tradeoffs: Balancing between using pre-trained SAM directly (faster but less accurate) vs. end-to-end training on video data (slower but more accurate)
- Failure signatures: 1) Inconsistent masks across frames, 2) Poor performance on complex scenes, 3) High computational cost for real-time applications
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Apply SAM directly to video frames and evaluate mask quality compared to video-specific methods
  2. Test different prompt types (points vs. boxes) on SAM's video segmentation performance
  3. Integrate a temporal consistency module (e.g., XMem) with SAM and measure improvements in mask coherence across frames

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the optimal strategies for leveraging SAM to generate dense mask annotations from video data at scale?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "The substantial achievements of visual foundation models are mainly attributed to the availability of billions of high-quality image data. Nevertheless, considering the huge cost of data collection and annotation, current video tasks are usually limited to relatively small-scale datasets. Leveraging SAM to automatically generate dense mask annotations from videos is a potential solution to achieve data scalability [24]."
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges this as a promising direction but doesn't provide concrete methods or evaluations for large-scale video dataset construction using SAM.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing SAM-based annotation methods against traditional annotation approaches in terms of annotation quality, time efficiency, and scalability across different video domains and tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can video foundation models be effectively trained from scratch given the computational challenges of high-dimensional video data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "Training video foundation models with billions of parameters from scratch inevitably faces significant challenges due to high data dimension and the high computational overhead."
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies this as a challenge but doesn't propose specific architectures or training methodologies for video foundation models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of video foundation models trained from scratch on large-scale video datasets, showing performance improvements over image-based foundation models while maintaining computational efficiency.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the most effective parameter-efficient training methods for adapting SAM to video-specific tasks while maintaining generalization?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "While some efforts to explore new technologies, e.g., adapter [4] and prompt learning [160], by utilizing pre-trained models to promote efficient transfer learning, there remains a pressing need to mitigate training and inference expenses."
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions existing parameter-efficient methods but doesn't evaluate their effectiveness specifically for video tasks or compare them to each other.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic comparison of different parameter-efficient training methods (adapters, prompt learning, LoRA, etc.) on a variety of video tasks, measuring both performance and parameter efficiency trade-offs.

## Limitations

- Literature search methodology and exact search criteria used to identify the 1,093 research works remain unspecified, potentially introducing selection bias
- Categorization of papers into video understanding, generation, and editing categories relies on abstract-level analysis without detailed validation against full-text content
- Performance gap analysis comparing SAM-based methods to state-of-the-art approaches lacks standardized benchmarking protocols across all evaluated tasks

## Confidence

- High confidence in the systematic literature review methodology and identified research trends (76.5% video understanding dominance, 17.6% video generation, 5.9% video editing)
- Medium confidence in performance gap findings, as direct comparative results depend on implementation choices and benchmark selection
- Medium confidence in identified challenges and opportunities, based on qualitative analysis of existing literature rather than empirical validation

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the literature search using multiple academic databases with standardized search terms to verify the 1,093-paper count and category distribution
2. Conduct controlled experiments comparing SAM-based methods with SOTA approaches on standardized video segmentation benchmarks to quantify performance gaps
3. Implement and test the proposed parameter-efficient training and multi-modal integration approaches on representative video datasets to validate claimed opportunities
