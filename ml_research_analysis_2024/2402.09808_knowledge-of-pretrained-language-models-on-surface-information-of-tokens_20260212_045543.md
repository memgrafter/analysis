# Knowledge of Pretrained Language Models on Surface Information of Tokens

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.09808
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09808
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: Pretrained language models contain partial knowledge of token surface features, particularly token length and substrings, but not token constitution, with decoder-side bottlenecks limiting practical utilization during generation tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether pretrained language models (PLMs) possess knowledge about the surface-level characteristics of tokens they process. The authors examine three aspects of token surface information: length, substrings, and constitution. Through systematic experiments using MLPs to extract this information from various PLM embeddings, they find that embeddings contain knowledge of token length and substrings but not token constitution. The study reveals an important bottleneck on the decoder side that limits how effectively PLMs can utilize this surface information during generation tasks. These findings suggest that PLMs do not fully acquire surface knowledge, which could impact performance on tasks requiring detailed surface information processing.

## Method Summary
The authors conduct experiments using multiple pretrained language models including BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2. They train multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to extract three types of surface information from subword and word embeddings: token length, substrings, and token constitution. The experimental design involves both encoder and decoder models, with separate analyses for subword and word-level tokenization schemes. The researchers evaluate the success of information extraction by measuring how accurately the MLPs can recover the surface features from the embeddings. They also examine generation tasks to identify bottlenecks in utilizing extracted surface information during decoding processes.

## Key Results
- PLM embeddings contain knowledge of token length and substrings but not token constitution
- Subword embeddings show better performance in encoding surface information than word embeddings
- A bottleneck exists on the decoder side that limits practical utilization of acquired surface information during generation tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism underlying PLMs' partial knowledge of surface information appears to stem from the training objectives and architecture design. Token length and substrings are more directly related to the distributional patterns that PLMs learn during pretraining, as these features influence word frequency and co-occurrence statistics. The inability to extract token constitution information suggests that the models do not form explicit representations of how tokens are composed from smaller units. The decoder-side bottleneck indicates that while surface information may be present in embeddings, the generation process itself imposes constraints on how effectively this information can be utilized.

## Foundational Learning
- **Pretrained Language Models**: Neural networks trained on large text corpora to capture language patterns (why needed: core subject of investigation; quick check: understanding BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2 architectures)
- **Subword Tokenization**: Methods like BPE and WordPiece that split words into smaller units (why needed: affects how surface information is represented; quick check: familiarity with tokenization schemes)
- **Multi-Layer Perceptrons**: Simple neural networks used to extract information from embeddings (why needed: primary tool for probing surface knowledge; quick check: understanding MLP architecture and training)
- **Embedding Spaces**: Vector representations where tokens are mapped (why needed: source of surface information; quick check: grasp of how embeddings capture linguistic features)
- **Decoder Bottlenecks**: Limitations in how generation processes utilize information (why needed: key finding about practical constraints; quick check: understanding autoregressive generation mechanisms)

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Input text -> Tokenization -> Embedding layer -> MLP classifier -> Surface information extraction -> Generation module -> Output
Critical path: Tokenization → Embedding → MLP → Surface information → Generation bottleneck
Design tradeoffs: The study balances between probing surface information and practical generation utility, revealing that information presence doesn't guarantee effective utilization
Failure signatures: Inability to extract token constitution information; bottleneck in decoder-side generation
First experiments: (1) Test MLP extraction accuracy on token length across different tokenization schemes; (2) Measure substring extraction performance for subword vs word embeddings; (3) Identify generation bottlenecks by comparing encoder-only vs decoder models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results may not generalize across all PLM architectures beyond BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2
- Analysis focuses on specific surface information types, potentially missing other relevant features
- The study doesn't fully explore how different tokenization schemes affect surface information representation

## Confidence
High: Claims about token length and substring knowledge being extractable from embeddings
Medium: Conclusions about token constitution knowledge absence and decoder-side bottlenecks
Low: Generalizability across different PLM architectures and tokenization schemes

## Next Checks
(1) Test additional PLM architectures beyond BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2 to assess result generalizability
(2) Examine whether surface information knowledge transfers across different tokenization schemes (BPE, WordPiece, SentencePiece)
(3) Conduct ablation studies to isolate specific components of embeddings that encode surface information
