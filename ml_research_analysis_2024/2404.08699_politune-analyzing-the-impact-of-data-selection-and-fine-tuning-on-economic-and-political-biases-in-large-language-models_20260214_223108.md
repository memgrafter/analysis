# PoliTune: Analyzing the Impact of Data Selection and Fine-Tuning on Economic and Political Biases in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.08699
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08699
- Reference count: 27
- Primary result: Demonstrates that parameter-efficient fine-tuning can embed political ideologies into LLMs by modifying only a small fraction of parameters

## Executive Summary
PoliTune introduces a systematic methodology for analyzing and implementing political and economic biases in Large Language Models through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The framework uses social media datasets to create left-leaning and right-leaning content, applies instruction tuning with generated prompts, and employs LoRA-based fine-tuning to align models with specific ideologies. The study evaluates the effectiveness of this approach using GPT Scores and Political Compass tests on Llama3 and Mistral models.

## Method Summary
The methodology employs social media datasets (Truth Social for right-leaning, Reddit Politosphere for left-leaning) filtered using Mixtral-8x7B. Instruction generation is performed using the same model to create aligned prompts. Mistral-7B-v0.2 is fine-tuned using LoRA (rank 16, alpha 32) with the generated instruction dataset. Evaluation involves GPT-4 scoring on a 0-20 scale for ideological bias and Political Compass testing for multidimensional ideological positioning.

## Key Results
- PoliTune successfully embeds political ideologies into LLMs by modifying only a small subset of parameters using LoRA
- Instruction tuning with carefully curated datasets proves more effective for achieving ideological bias than unstructured datasets
- The combination of GPT Scores and Political Compass Evaluation provides comprehensive assessment of ideological biases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: PoliTune demonstrates that parameter-efficient fine-tuning can successfully embed ideological biases into LLMs by modifying only a small fraction of parameters.
- Mechanism: By using LoRA to fine-tune a pre-trained LLM on a carefully curated and annotated dataset, PoliTune can align the model with specific political ideologies without requiring full model retraining.
- Core assumption: Modifying a small subset of parameters is sufficient to capture and represent complex ideological biases present in the training data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "PoliTune employs Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, which allow for the alignment of LLMs with targeted ideologies by modifying a small subset of parameters."
  - [section 2.2]: "LoRA allows for the efficient customization of LLMs to new tasks while minimizing the additional computational overhead."
- Break condition: If the ideological bias is too complex or nuanced to be captured by modifying only a small subset of parameters, the mechanism may break down.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The use of instruction tuning with a carefully curated dataset is more effective in achieving ideological bias compared to using unstructured datasets.
- Mechanism: By generating instructions that align with the content and ideological leaning of each sample in the filtered dataset, PoliTune ensures that the fine-tuned model's outputs are directed towards the desired ideology.
- Core assumption: The generated instructions accurately capture the essence of the sample's ideological leaning and effectively guide the model's output.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We introduce a systematic method for using the open-source LLM Llama3-70B for dataset selection, annotation, and synthesizing a preferences dataset for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align the model with a given political ideology."
  - [section 3.2]: "By fine-tuning our model using the instruction dataset, we are able to steer the LLM towards the desired political ideology."
- Break condition: If the generated instructions fail to accurately represent the ideological leaning of the samples or if the model fails to effectively utilize the instructions, the mechanism may break down.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The combination of GPT Scores and Political Compass Evaluation provides a comprehensive assessment of the ideological biases in fine-tuned LLMs.
- Mechanism: GPT Scores offer a straightforward, quantitative measure of bias, while the Political Compass Evaluation provides a multidimensional analysis of the model's ideological positioning, allowing for a better understanding of the models' alignments.
- Core assumption: The scoring criteria used by GPT-4 and the Political Compass test accurately capture and represent the ideological biases present in the model's responses.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3.1]: "This scale is designed to categorize the model's bias, with a score of 0 indicating a strong left-leaning bias, 10 representing a neutral standpoint, and 20 reflecting a strong right-leaning bias."
  - [section 3.3.2]: "This method allows us to plot the model's ideological shifts on the grid to visualize its alignment across both dimensions."
- Break condition: If the scoring criteria or the Political Compass test fail to accurately capture the nuances of the ideological biases, the mechanism may break down.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, such as LoRA and adapters
  - Why needed here: PoliTune relies on PEFT techniques to efficiently fine-tune LLMs and embed ideological biases without requiring full model retraining.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between LoRA and adapter-based PEFT techniques, and how do they impact the fine-tuning process?

- Concept: Dataset selection, annotation, and instruction generation
  - Why needed here: PoliTune emphasizes the importance of using a carefully curated and annotated dataset with generated instructions to effectively align LLMs with specific ideologies.
  - Quick check question: How does the process of generating instructions that align with the ideological leaning of each sample contribute to the effectiveness of the fine-tuning process?

- Concept: Evaluation metrics for assessing ideological bias in LLMs
  - Why needed here: PoliTune employs GPT Scores and Political Compass Evaluation to quantitatively and qualitatively assess the ideological biases present in the fine-tuned LLMs.
  - Quick check question: How do the GPT Scores and Political Compass Evaluation complement each other in providing a comprehensive assessment of the model's ideological alignment?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Dataset selection and cleaning -> Instruction generation -> Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (LoRA) -> Evaluation (GPT Scores and Political Compass)

- Critical path: Dataset selection and cleaning → Instruction generation → LoRA fine-tuning → Evaluation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Balancing the complexity of the ideological bias with the efficiency of PEFT techniques
  - Ensuring the quality and representativeness of the curated dataset
  - Choosing appropriate evaluation metrics that accurately capture the ideological biases

- Failure signatures:
  - Inability to effectively embed the desired ideological bias despite fine-tuning
  - Evaluation metrics indicating a lack of alignment with the targeted ideology
  - Model generating outputs that contradict the intended ideological leaning

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Fine-tune a small language model (e.g., BERT) on a simple, binary ideological dataset using LoRA and evaluate its alignment using GPT Scores.
  2. Generate instructions for a subset of the curated dataset and assess their quality and alignment with the samples' ideological leaning.
  3. Conduct a Political Compass Evaluation on a fine-tuned LLM and compare the results with the GPT Scores to identify any discrepancies or insights.

## Limitations

- The study relies on specific social media platforms (Truth Social and Reddit Politosphere) that may introduce platform-specific biases not representative of broader political discourse
- GPT-4 is used throughout the pipeline as both filtering tool and evaluation metric, creating potential circularity
- The framework focuses primarily on U.S. political ideologies, limiting applicability to other political contexts

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The technical implementation of LoRA-based fine-tuning and the overall methodology for dataset curation and instruction generation. The controlled experimental design and clear metrics (GPT Scores, Political Compass) provide reliable evidence for the specific claims made about the PoliTune methodology.

**Medium Confidence:** The claims about the effectiveness of PEFT in embedding ideological biases, as these depend on the quality and representativeness of the source data. While the methodology is sound, the actual capture of complex ideological nuances through parameter modification remains partially validated.

**Low Confidence:** The broader claims about the implications of ideologically-aligned LLMs for society, as these extend beyond the scope of the technical validation provided and require additional ethical and social impact studies.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Platform Validation:** Test the PoliTune methodology using datasets from multiple social media platforms and traditional news sources to verify the robustness of ideological alignment across different content sources.

2. **Independent Evaluation:** Implement an independent evaluation framework using multiple scoring models and human evaluators to verify the GPT Scores and Political Compass results, addressing potential circularity concerns.

3. **Transferability Test:** Assess the performance of PoliTune when applied to different base models and political contexts (e.g., European political systems) to evaluate the generalizability of the methodology beyond the tested U.S.-centric setup.
