# Reconsidering the Performance of GAE in Link Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.03845
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03845
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Optimized GAE achieves new SOTA Hits@100 of 78.41% on ogbl-ppa dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper re-evaluates the effectiveness of Graph Autoencoders (GAEs) for link prediction, demonstrating that properly optimized GAEs can achieve state-of-the-art performance comparable to or better than more complex graph neural network models. The authors systematically explore GAEs by applying principled architectural enhancements and meticulous hyperparameter tuning, revealing that GAEs inherently possess the ability to capture pairwise neighborhood information, especially when initialized with unique, orthogonal node representations. Their Optimized GAE model, featuring linear message passing, residual connections, and strategic input representations, achieves a new SOTA Hits@100 score of 78.41% on the large-scale ogbl-ppa dataset and shows an average 6.4% improvement over the strong NCN baseline across multiple datasets.

## Method Summary
The Optimized GAE architecture combines linear message passing (removing non-linear activations between MPNN layers), initial residual connections in both encoder and decoder to preserve original node information, and a deep MLP decoder with residual connections. The model uses orthogonal initialization for learnable embeddings when input features are less informative, determined by the Structure-to-Feature Dominance Index (𝐼𝑆/𝐹). Training employs binary cross-entropy loss with 1:3 negative sampling ratio, optimized via Bayesian hyperparameter tuning across learning rate, batch size, dropout, and network depth.

## Key Results
- Optimized GAE achieves new SOTA Hits@100 score of 78.41% on ogbl-ppa dataset
- Average 6.4% improvement over NCN baseline across multiple datasets
- Linear message passing, residual connections, and orthogonal initialization each contribute 1.4-1.8% performance gains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Optimized GAE achieves SOTA by leveraging pairwise neighborhood information that emerges from orthogonal input embeddings
- Mechanism: When node embeddings are initialized orthogonally, the dot product in the decoder naturally computes weighted common neighbor counts, capturing structural similarity without explicit pairwise modules
- Core assumption: Learnable embeddings remain approximately orthogonal during training and input features have meaningful norms
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "GAEs inherently possess the ability to capture pairwise neighborhood information, especially when initialized with unique, orthogonal node representations"
  - [section]: "This expansion shows how the GAE score for a potential link (i,j) is formed... For k=1, this sum is (A^2)_{ij}, which is a weighted common neighbor count between nodes i and j"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - related papers focus on augmenting GAEs but don't specifically discuss orthogonal initialization's role in capturing pairwise structure
- Break condition: If embeddings collapse from orthogonality during training, or if node feature norms are uninformative (all similar magnitude), the pairwise structure capture degrades significantly

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Linear message passing preserves structural information that non-linear activations would destroy
- Mechanism: Removing non-linear activations between MPNN layers maintains the linearity of propagated features, allowing dot products to directly encode structural relationships like common neighbors
- Core assumption: Structural information is primarily linear and can be captured through successive linear transformations without activation functions
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our Optimized GAE model, featuring linear message passing, residual connections, and strategic input representations"
  - [section]: "Standard GNN designs often apply non-linear activations after the convolution operation, resulting in updates like H^(l+1) = σ(Conv_{l+1}(H^l, A)). Such intermediate non-linearities can disrupt the direct structural information encoded in dot products"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - related work on linear GNNs exists but doesn't explicitly connect linear propagation to link prediction performance in GAEs
- Break condition: If the underlying graph structure requires non-linear processing to capture important features, or if node features themselves contain non-linear relationships that need to be preserved

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Strategic residual connections prevent information loss and stabilize training of deep MLPs
- Mechanism: Initial residual connections in both encoder and decoder preserve original node information through multiple layers, preventing the "dilution" effect of repeated aggregation and enabling deeper architectures
- Core assumption: The original node features contain important information that would otherwise be lost through successive message passing
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our approach also introduces a flexible input strategy and key architectural optimizations"
  - [section]: "This approach keeps access to the original node attributes throughout the network, preventing them from being diluted by multiple aggregation steps"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - residual connections are well-studied in deep learning but their specific impact on GAE link prediction is not addressed in related work
- Break condition: If the original node features are redundant or uninformative compared to aggregated neighborhood information, or if the graph has very simple structure that doesn't require deep processing

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph neural networks and message passing
  - Why needed here: Understanding how GAEs encode graph structure through message passing is fundamental to grasping why architectural changes matter
  - Quick check question: What information does a single GCN layer aggregate from a node's neighbors?

- Concept: Link prediction task formulation
  - Why needed here: Link prediction requires understanding how node representations are used to predict edge existence, which is central to GAE's decoder design
  - Quick check question: How does a GAE use node embeddings to predict whether an edge exists between two nodes?

- Concept: Expressiveness of graph neural networks
  - Why needed here: The paper's theoretical analysis hinges on understanding what graph structures GNNs can distinguish, which relates to the 1-WL test equivalence
  - Quick check question: What does it mean for a GNN to be as expressive as the 1-WL test?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input layer → Linear MPNN (shallow) → Residual preservation → MLP (deep) → Dot product → Edge prediction → BCE loss

- Critical path: Input → Linear MPNN (shallow) → Residual preservation → MLP (deep) → Dot product → Edge prediction → BCE loss

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Linear vs non-linear message passing: Linear preserves structural information but may miss non-linear patterns
  - Shallow encoder vs deep decoder: Prevents oversmoothing while maintaining capacity
  - Learnable embeddings vs raw features: Learnable provides flexibility but requires more data; raw features leverage existing information

- Failure signatures:
  - Performance drops with non-orthogonal embeddings: Check embedding orthogonality after training
  - Degradation with deeper MPNN layers: Likely oversmoothing; reduce encoder depth
  - Poor performance on feature-rich graphs with learnable embeddings: May need to rely on raw features instead

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare performance with orthogonal vs random initialization of learnable embeddings on a small dataset
  2. Test linear vs non-linear message passing on the same dataset
  3. Evaluate impact of removing residual connections from either encoder or decoder

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the principles of optimizing GAE be extended to dynamic graphs and heterogeneous graphs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that parallel research addresses challenges in dynamic graphs (e.g., TGAT) and heterogeneous graphs (e.g., RGCN), and suggest that the power and efficiency of their Optimized GAE makes it a strong candidate for future extension to these domains.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on static, homogeneous link prediction tasks. Dynamic and heterogeneous graphs introduce new challenges such as temporal dependencies and multiple edge types that are not addressed in the current study.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and evaluating an Optimized GAE variant for dynamic graphs (e.g., incorporating temporal message passing) or heterogeneous graphs (e.g., handling multiple edge types) and demonstrating performance improvements on benchmark datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do the learnable node embeddings in Optimized GAE evolve during training, and what is their impact on the model's interpretability?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors observe that learnable embeddings often remain close to orthogonal after training, reflecting the role of common neighbor information. However, the specific evolution and interpretability aspects are not deeply explored.
- Why unresolved: While the paper mentions the importance of orthogonal initialization and its impact on performance, it does not provide a detailed analysis of how embeddings change during training or how this affects interpretability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analyzing the trajectory of learnable embeddings during training, visualizing their relationships, and interpreting how they capture structural and feature information to improve link prediction.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of different negative sampling strategies on the performance of Optimized GAE, and how can they be optimized?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses a 1:3 negative sampling ratio for training but does not explore the impact of different negative sampling strategies or their optimization.
- Why unresolved: Negative sampling is crucial for training link prediction models, and different strategies can significantly impact performance. The paper does not investigate how varying the ratio or using different sampling techniques affects Optimized GAE.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimenting with different negative sampling strategies (e.g., varying ratios, using degree-based sampling) and analyzing their impact on Optimized GAE's performance across various datasets.

## Limitations
- Theoretical analysis relies on assumptions about embedding orthogonality maintenance during training that aren't empirically verified
- Extensive hyperparameter tuning required suggests the method may not be as straightforward to deploy as presented
- Limited exploration of directed graph scenarios where structural patterns differ significantly from undirected graphs

## Confidence
**High Confidence**: The empirical results showing SOTA performance on multiple datasets are well-supported by the data. The ablation studies clearly demonstrate that each architectural component (linear message passing, residual connections, orthogonal initialization) contributes to performance gains.

**Medium Confidence**: The theoretical mechanism explaining why orthogonal embeddings enable pairwise neighborhood capture is plausible but relies on assumptions about embedding behavior during training that aren't fully validated. The claim that linear message passing is superior for capturing structural information is supported empirically but lacks theoretical justification for why non-linearities would be detrimental in this specific context.

**Low Confidence**: The practical guidelines for deployment (e.g., when to use learnable vs raw features based on 𝐼𝑆/𝐹) are based on a heuristic that wasn't extensively validated across diverse graph types. The claim that these optimizations make GAEs competitive with sophisticated GNN baselines may not generalize to all graph learning tasks beyond link prediction.

## Next Checks
1. **Orthogonality Monitoring**: Track the orthogonality of learnable embeddings throughout training using metrics like the condition number of the embedding matrix. This would validate whether the theoretical mechanism depends on maintaining approximate orthogonality during optimization.

2. **Directed Graph Extension**: Apply the optimized GAE architecture to a suite of directed graph datasets and compare performance against the undirected results. This would test whether the pairwise neighborhood capture mechanism generalizes beyond undirected structural patterns.

3. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary the 𝐼𝑆/𝐹 threshold and evaluate how often the heuristic correctly predicts when learnable embeddings will outperform raw features. This would validate whether the input representation strategy provides reliable guidance across diverse graph structures.
