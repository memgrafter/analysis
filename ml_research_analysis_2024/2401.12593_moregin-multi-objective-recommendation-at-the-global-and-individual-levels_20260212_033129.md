# MOReGIn: Multi-Objective Recommendation at the Global and Individual Levels

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.12593
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12593
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves perfect disparate visibility reduction (ΔTotal=0.0000) while maintaining competitive NDCG scores

## Executive Summary
MOReGIn introduces a post-processing approach that addresses the critical gap in Multi-Objective Recommender Systems by simultaneously considering global provider fairness and individual user calibration. Unlike existing methods that focus on either global or individual perspectives in isolation, MOReGIn aggregates items into genre-continent buckets and performs three-phase re-ranking to ensure both fairness objectives. The approach demonstrates significant improvements in reducing visibility disparities and genre miscalibration while maintaining recommendation effectiveness across two real-world datasets.

## Method Summary
MOReGIn employs a post-processing framework that transforms recommendation lists through bucket-based aggregation. Items are grouped by pairing their genres with continents of production, creating a two-dimensional categorization system. The method then executes a three-phase re-ranking process that first addresses global provider fairness by ensuring proportional representation, then calibrates individual user preferences to match their historical genre consumption patterns, and finally optimizes for relevance within the constrained fair and calibrated space. This approach preserves the initial recommendation quality while enforcing multi-objective constraints through systematic re-ranking rather than end-to-end optimization.

## Key Results
- Achieves perfect disparate visibility reduction (ΔTotal=0.0000) compared to baselines
- Significantly improves genre calibration at individual level (ΔGenre improved)
- Maintains competitive NDCG scores (0.3057 for BPRMF in Movies dataset)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method's effectiveness stems from its systematic approach to constraint satisfaction through bucket-based aggregation. By pairing genres with production continents, MOReGIn creates a granular control mechanism that allows independent adjustment of both fairness dimensions. The three-phase re-ranking ensures that constraints are satisfied sequentially: global fairness is established first to create a balanced foundation, individual calibration is then applied to personalize within the fair space, and final relevance optimization preserves recommendation quality. This structured approach prevents the typical trade-offs between objectives by treating them as hierarchical constraints rather than competing optimization targets.

## Foundational Learning
- **Bucket-based aggregation**: Why needed - Enables granular control over both fairness dimensions simultaneously; Quick check - Verify that bucket creation captures meaningful category combinations
- **Post-processing re-ranking**: Why needed - Preserves initial recommendation quality while adding fairness constraints; Quick check - Measure NDCG degradation after re-ranking
- **Three-phase constraint satisfaction**: Why needed - Prevents trade-offs between objectives by treating them hierarchically; Quick check - Validate each phase's contribution to final metrics
- **Genre-continent pairing**: Why needed - Creates a natural two-dimensional fairness space; Quick check - Ensure categories are meaningful and non-redundant

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Initial recommendations -> Bucket aggregation -> Phase 1 (global fairness) -> Phase 2 (individual calibration) -> Phase 3 (relevance optimization) -> Final recommendations
- **Critical path**: The three-phase re-ranking sequence where each phase builds upon the previous one's output
- **Design tradeoffs**: Post-processing simplicity vs. potential accuracy gains from end-to-end optimization; manual bucket definition vs. automatic category discovery
- **Failure signatures**: Poor initial recommendations leading to degraded final quality; inappropriate bucket definitions causing category sparsity; phase ordering issues where calibration interferes with fairness
- **First experiments**: 1) Test bucket creation with different genre-continent pairings, 2) Validate phase independence by running them in isolation, 3) Measure impact of phase ordering on final metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Post-processing nature may reduce overall accuracy compared to integrated approaches
- Manual bucket definitions introduce potential biases and may not generalize across domains
- Limited evaluation on only two specific datasets restricts generalizability

## Confidence
- High confidence: Perfect disparate visibility reduction and individual calibration improvements
- Medium confidence: Preservation of NDCG scores across different baselines
- Medium confidence: Result significance given limited dataset diversity

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate MOReGIn on additional diverse datasets from different recommendation domains (e-commerce, news, job recommendations) to test generalizability
2. Conduct longitudinal studies to assess performance stability when provider compositions and user preferences change over time
3. Compare MOReGIn against end-to-end multi-objective optimization methods to quantify the trade-off between post-processing simplicity and potential accuracy gains from integrated approaches
