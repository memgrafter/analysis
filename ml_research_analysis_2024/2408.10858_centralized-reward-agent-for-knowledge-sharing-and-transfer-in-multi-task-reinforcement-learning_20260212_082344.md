# Centralized Reward Agent for Knowledge Sharing and Transfer in Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.10858
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10858
- Reference count: 16
- Primary result: CenRA significantly outperforms baselines in sparse-reward multi-task RL through centralized knowledge reward generation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CenRA (Centralized Reward Agent), a novel framework for multi-task reinforcement learning that addresses the challenge of sparse rewards through a centralized reward agent. The approach employs a centralized reward agent (CRA) that learns to generate dense, task-specific knowledge rewards from multiple distributed policy agents. The CRA distills shared knowledge across tasks and distributes it to guide individual learning, with an information synchronization mechanism that balances knowledge transfer by considering task similarity and agent performance. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements in learning efficiency, stability, and knowledge transferability across multiple domains including Meta-World, 2DMaze, 3DPickup, and MujocoCar.

## Method Summary
The CenRA framework addresses sparse-reward challenges in multi-task reinforcement learning by introducing a centralized reward agent (CRA) that learns to generate dense, task-specific knowledge rewards from multiple distributed policy agents. The CRA distills shared knowledge across tasks and distributes it to guide individual learning. An information synchronization mechanism balances knowledge transfer by considering task similarity and agent performance. The framework uses an off-policy actor-critic approach for the CRA, with DQN for discrete tasks and SAC for continuous tasks. Policy agents receive augmented rewards combining environmental and scaled knowledge rewards. The framework includes a concatenated replay buffer from all policy agents and employs similarity weights (calculated via cross-attention on hidden features) and performance weights (based on recent reward averages) to balance knowledge transfer across tasks.

## Key Results
- CenRA significantly outperforms baselines in learning efficiency, stability, and knowledge transferability across Meta-World, 2DMaze, 3DPickup, and MujocoCar domains
- The method effectively guides learning in sparse-reward environments through meaningful auxiliary rewards
- Knowledge transfer to new tasks demonstrates the framework's ability to generalize learned knowledge across domains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The centralized reward agent framework works by leveraging knowledge distillation across multiple tasks to create dense, informative rewards where environmental rewards are sparse. The CRA learns to identify and encode transferable knowledge patterns from diverse task experiences, then generates auxiliary rewards that guide policy agents toward successful strategies. The information synchronization mechanism ensures efficient knowledge transfer by weighting task similarities and performance metrics, preventing knowledge dilution across dissimilar tasks. This approach transforms the sparse learning signal problem into a dense reward learning problem, accelerating convergence and improving stability across all tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-task reinforcement learning**: Learning multiple related tasks simultaneously to share knowledge - needed for establishing the distributed policy agent framework
- **Knowledge distillation**: Transferring learned representations from one model to another - needed for the CRA to learn from multiple policy agents
- **Sparse reward environments**: Scenarios where successful outcomes receive minimal feedback - needed to understand the problem being addressed
- **Cross-attention mechanisms**: Computing similarity between task representations - needed for the information synchronization component
- **Off-policy actor-critic methods**: Reinforcement learning algorithms that separate policy and value function learning - needed for implementing the CRA
- **Auxiliary reward signals**: Additional rewards beyond environment feedback to guide learning - needed for understanding how knowledge rewards function

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Policy agents (DQN/SAC) -> Concatenated replay buffer -> CRA (off-policy actor-critic) -> Knowledge rewards -> Policy agents

**Critical Path:** Policy agents generate experiences → Experiences stored in shared replay buffer → CRA samples and learns knowledge rewards → Knowledge rewards augment policy agent training → Improved policy agent performance → Better experiences for CRA

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework balances centralized knowledge sharing with task-specific learning needs through the information synchronization mechanism. This tradeoff prevents knowledge dilution while enabling effective transfer. The choice between DQN and SAC depends on task discreteness, with continuous tasks requiring more sophisticated policy gradient methods.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor knowledge reward quality manifests as rewards that don't correlate with meaningful progress toward goals. Imbalanced task learning shows high variance in episodic returns across tasks. Slow convergence indicates improper CRA update frequency or knowledge reward weighting.

**First Experiments:**
1. Train CenRA on 2DMaze domain with varying numbers of tasks to validate knowledge reward quality through visualization
2. Compare learning curves of individual policy agents with and without knowledge rewards on a single task
3. Test knowledge transfer capability by training on subset of Meta-World tasks, then evaluating on held-out tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Network architecture details are underspecified beyond stating "same network architectures across all experiments"
- Information synchronization mechanism implementation details (attention mechanism specifics, averaging window size) are not fully specified
- Sampling strategy and knowledge reward integration into policy updates lack precise implementation details

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Overall conceptual framework, multi-task domains, and general experimental setup are clearly specified
- **Medium confidence**: Information synchronization mechanism description is sufficient for functional implementation, though exact hyperparameters may affect results
- **Low confidence**: Network architecture details, specific hyperparameter values, and cross-attention mechanism implementation are insufficient

## Next Checks
1. Verify implemented network architectures match the original specifications once released, particularly focusing on hidden layer sizes and attention mechanism dimensions
2. Visualize knowledge rewards in the 2DMaze domain to confirm they correctly guide agents toward key and door locations
3. Test trained CRA on held-out tasks from each domain not seen during training to validate knowledge transferability claims
