# An Empirical Study of Data Ability Boundary in LLMs' Math Reasoning
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.00799
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00799

- Key outcome: MMOS approach achieves SOTA performance with lower construction costs

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the data-driven boundaries of mathematical reasoning abilities in large language models through systematic identification of minimal optimal data sets. The authors develop a data strategy that discovers which reasoning paths are essential for maximizing math reasoning performance and demonstrate that combining these optimal sets from different data types yields cumulative improvements. Their MMOS approach achieves state-of-the-art results on base models while significantly reducing construction costs compared to alternative methods.

The study also addresses numerical robustness in LLMs, finding that modern models have largely overcome previous vulnerabilities to numerical variations. The authors provide an Auto Problem Generator that enables both robustness testing and educational applications, offering practical tools for the research community.

## Method Summary
The authors employ a systematic empirical approach to identify minimal optimal sets of reasoning paths that maximize mathematical reasoning ability in LLMs. They conduct controlled experiments mixing different data types to determine which combinations yield the best performance gains. The MMOS (Minimal Optimal Set) approach involves iteratively pruning data sets to find the smallest subset that maintains peak performance, then combining these optimal subsets across different reasoning domains. The methodology includes extensive evaluation on mathematical reasoning benchmarks and comparative analysis against alternative data construction methods to quantify cost-benefit improvements.

## Key Results
- MMOS approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on series base models with significantly lower construction costs
- Mixing minimal optimal sets from different data types produces cumulative enhancements across multiple reasoning abilities
- Numerical robustness issues that previously plagued LLMs are largely resolved in current models
- Auto Problem Generator provides practical tool for robustness testing and educational applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by identifying the fundamental reasoning paths that contribute most to mathematical problem-solving, then optimizing the data distribution to focus on these critical elements. By systematically eliminating redundant or non-essential training data while preserving performance, the approach achieves efficiency gains without sacrificing capability. The cumulative enhancement from mixing optimal sets suggests that different reasoning abilities have complementary data requirements that can be strategically combined.

## Foundational Learning
- **Data efficiency optimization**: Understanding how to maximize model performance with minimal training data is crucial for practical deployment and cost management. Quick check: Compare training curves with full vs. minimal optimal data sets.
- **Reasoning path identification**: The ability to isolate which specific reasoning patterns drive performance enables targeted data collection and model improvement. Quick check: Validate that removing identified paths reduces performance.
- **Cross-ability data mixing**: Demonstrates that different reasoning skills can be enhanced simultaneously through strategic data combination rather than requiring separate training regimes. Quick check: Test cumulative vs. independent improvements across abilities.
- **Numerical robustness assessment**: Provides framework for evaluating how models handle variations in numerical presentation and edge cases. Quick check: Test model performance across diverse numerical formats.
- **Cost-benefit analysis in model development**: Establishes methodology for quantifying construction cost reductions while maintaining or improving performance. Quick check: Calculate computational savings vs. performance trade-offs.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Data Collection -> Minimal Optimal Set Identification -> Cross-ability Mixing -> Performance Evaluation -> Auto Problem Generator
Critical path: The most critical sequence is Minimal Optimal Set Identification -> Cross-ability Mixing, as this directly determines the efficiency and effectiveness of the MMOS approach.
Design tradeoffs: The paper balances model performance against data construction costs, choosing to prioritize efficiency while maintaining state-of-the-art results rather than maximizing absolute performance.
Failure signatures: Performance degradation when critical reasoning paths are removed, or when data mixing disrupts complementary relationships between different ability types.
First experiments:
1. Test baseline performance with full data set before any optimization
2. Validate that removing identified non-essential paths maintains performance
3. Confirm cumulative enhancement by testing mixed optimal sets vs. individual sets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Narrow scope focused exclusively on mathematical reasoning limits generalizability to other domains
- Claims about numerical robustness being "no longer prevalent" lack detailed methodology for establishing this conclusion
- Insufficient comparative analysis of actual construction cost savings versus alternative approaches

## Confidence
High: Core empirical findings about data efficiency and performance optimization
Medium: Claims about generalizability beyond mathematical reasoning
Low: Assertions about construction cost reduction compared to alternatives

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-domain experiments to verify whether minimal optimal data sets identified for math reasoning transfer to other reasoning tasks like logical or common-sense reasoning
2. Perform extensive robustness testing across diverse numerical formats and edge cases to independently verify claims about numerical robustness resolution
3. Implement detailed cost-benefit analysis comparing MMOS construction costs with alternative approaches across multiple model scales and training scenarios
