## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.18426
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18426
- Reference count: 40

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TriviaHG, a large-scale dataset for automatic hint generation from factoid questions. The authors propose a framework that employs Large Language Models to generate hints for questions from the TriviaQA dataset, resulting in 160,230 hints corresponding to 16,645 questions. They also introduce an automatic evaluation method to assess the convergence and familiarity quality attributes of hints. The dataset and evaluation method were validated through human annotation and by having humans answer questions using the provided hints, with success rates of 96%, 78%, and 36% for questions with easy, medium, and hard answers, respectively. The proposed automatic evaluation methods showed a strong correlation with annotators' results, demonstrating the feasibility of employing automatic evaluation for hint assessment.

## Method Summary
The framework consists of two main modules: Question Sampling Module and Hint Generation Module. The Question Sampling Module filters TriviaQA questions to those 6-20 words with question marks and Wikipedia answers, then classifies questions using fine-tuned RoBERTa and performs stratified sampling. The Hint Generation Module uses Copilot to generate hints by prompting for answers first, validating against ground truth, then requesting 10 hints per question while avoiding answer leakage. Generated hints are filtered to remove those with lexical similarity to answers or high similarity to questions, retaining questions with at least 5 hints. The automatic evaluation method uses candidate generation/evaluation (HICOS) and Wikipedia page view analysis (HIFAS) to assess hint quality.

## Key Results
- Successfully generated 160,230 hints for 16,645 TriviaQA questions
- Human evaluation showed success rates of 96%, 78%, and 36% for answering questions with easy, medium, and hard answers respectively
- Automatic evaluation metrics (HICOS, HIFAS) demonstrated strong correlation (0.815-0.892) with human judgments
- Filtered dataset to questions with at least 5 hints, resulting in 16,645 question-hint pairs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Automatic hint generation can maintain or enhance cognitive reasoning skills by providing progressive guidance rather than final answers.
- Mechanism: Hints scaffold the reasoning process, encouraging users to engage in active thinking and self-directed learning rather than passively receiving answers from LLMs.
- Core assumption: Users will engage with hints as intended rather than treating them as a shortcut to the answer.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This study addresses such needs by proposing hints (instead of final answers or before giving answers) as a viable solution."
  - [section 1] "Hints are clues that guide individuals towards a solution without explicitly providing the answer [15]. They promote thinking, reasoning, and memorization skills..."
- Break condition: If hints become overly specific or reveal the answer, they lose their scaffolding effect and may reduce cognitive engagement.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Large Language Models can generate high-quality hints when provided with appropriate prompts and filtered appropriately.
- Mechanism: LLMs leverage their knowledge base to generate contextually relevant hints, which are then filtered to remove answer leakage and redundancy.
- Core assumption: LLMs can distinguish between helpful hints and answers when properly prompted.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2.1] "We utilize LLMs to generate hints for the questions, specifically selecting Copilot as our preferred choice."
  - [section 3.2.2] "We take the following steps: (1) For identifying potential answer leakages... (2) We utilize the SentenceTransformers framework [47] for identifying similar hints..."
- Break condition: If filtering mechanisms fail, hints may contain answer leakage or be too similar to the original question, reducing their effectiveness.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Automatic evaluation metrics can reliably assess hint quality attributes (convergence and familiarity) using LLMs and Wikipedia page view data.
- Mechanism: HICOS uses LLM-based candidate evaluation to measure how effectively hints narrow down answer possibilities, while HIFAS uses Wikipedia page view normalization to measure entity recognition.
- Core assumption: LLM-based candidate evaluation and Wikipedia popularity are valid proxies for hint convergence and familiarity quality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.1.3] "Equation to calculate the HICOS of the hint... if the hint is valid for the answer, we compute the score based on the results for other candidate answers."
  - [section 4.2] "We employ the spaCy library for extracting named entities from the hints... we leverage the Pageview API to retrieve the number of views for the Wikipedia pages..."
- Break condition: If LLM evaluations don't correlate well with human judgment, or if Wikipedia popularity doesn't reflect actual entity familiarity, the metrics lose validity.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Factoid question classification
  - Why needed here: To properly categorize questions and generate appropriate hints for different types (person, location, entity, etc.)
  - Quick check question: What coarse-grained classes are used to categorize questions in TriviaHG?

- Concept: Entity recognition and popularity measurement
  - Why needed here: To assess the familiarity quality of hints by measuring how well-known entities mentioned in hints are
  - Quick check question: How is the familiarity quality attribute (HIFAS) calculated in the evaluation method?

- Concept: Automatic evaluation metrics for text generation
  - Why needed here: To provide scalable, consistent evaluation of hint quality without requiring human annotation for every hint
  - Quick check question: What are the two main quality attributes measured by the automatic evaluation method?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Question Sampling Module → Hint Generation Module → Automatic Evaluation Module → Human Evaluation Validation
- Critical path: Generate questions → Generate hints → Filter hints → Evaluate automatically → Validate with human evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: LLM-based hint generation vs. potential answer leakage vs. human curation effort; automatic evaluation vs. potential misalignment with human judgment
- Failure signatures: High answer leakage in hints (indicated by search engine success rates), poor correlation between automatic and human evaluations, low human success rates when using hints
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test hint generation with different LLM prompts and filtering thresholds to optimize for minimal answer leakage
  2. Evaluate correlation between automatic HICOS/HIFAS metrics and human judgments across different hint types
  3. Compare hint effectiveness across different question difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) to identify patterns in hint utility

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different hint quality attributes (relevance, readability, ambiguity) impact the effectiveness of hints in facilitating question answering?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses five quality attributes for hints (relevance, readability, ambiguity, convergence, and familiarity) but focuses mainly on automating the evaluation of convergence and familiarity. It mentions that relevance and readability will be the focus of future work.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of how these other quality attributes affect hint effectiveness. It only briefly mentions that relevance and readability will be considered in future work.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study comparing the impact of different hint quality attributes on user performance in answering questions, using controlled experiments with hints varying in these attributes.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal number of candidate answers to generate for evaluating hint convergence quality across different datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that 11 candidate answers yielded the closest correlation to human results for the TriviaHG dataset, but notes that this number could vary for other datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tested this on the TriviaHG dataset and suggests that the optimal number might differ for other datasets, but does not provide a method for determining this number for new datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments on multiple datasets to determine the correlation between the number of candidate answers and evaluation accuracy, potentially leading to a general guideline or method for selecting the optimal number.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can educational value be incorporated into the hint generation and evaluation process?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the current approach focuses solely on generating hints and assessing their usefulness in assisting humans to answer questions, without explicitly considering the educational values of hints.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not propose a method for incorporating or evaluating the educational value of hints, only noting this as a limitation and future work direction.
- What evidence would resolve it: A framework for evaluating hints based on their potential to enhance learning outcomes, tested through experiments measuring knowledge retention or skill improvement after using hints.

## Limitations

- The evaluation of hint quality relies heavily on proxy metrics (HICOS, HIFAS) that show correlation with human judgments but may not fully capture nuanced aspects of hint effectiveness
- The filtering mechanisms for answer leakage and hint similarity use specific thresholds that may not generalize across different question domains or LLM models
- The study demonstrates strong correlations between automatic and human evaluations, but these are based on limited samples (50 questions)

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The dataset collection methodology (160,230 hints from 16,645 questions) and basic human evaluation results showing success rates of 96%, 78%, and 36% for easy/medium/hard answers
- **Medium Confidence**: The automatic evaluation metrics (HICOS, HIFAS) showing strong correlations with human judgments, though based on limited validation samples
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability of the hint generation approach across different domains beyond TriviaQA, and the long-term effectiveness of hints in actual learning scenarios

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Domain Validation**: Test the hint generation framework on non-TriviaQA datasets (e.g., educational or technical domains) to assess generalizability of both the dataset and evaluation metrics

2. **Longitudinal Learning Impact**: Conduct studies measuring actual learning outcomes when users engage with hints over extended periods, rather than just immediate question-answering success rates

3. **Ablation Studies on Evaluation Metrics**: Systematically remove components of HICOS and HIFAS (e.g., Wikipedia page views, specific candidate evaluation methods) to determine which elements contribute most to correlation with human judgment
