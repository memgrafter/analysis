# German Tourism Knowledge Graph

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.09587
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09587
- Reference count: 8
- Key outcome: Large-scale tourism knowledge graph with 500K+ instances across 16 German states, updated daily by regional organizations

## Executive Summary
This work presents the German Tourism Knowledge Graph (GTKG), a comprehensive tourism knowledge graph covering 16 German federal states. The GTKG integrates tourism-related data including events, points of interest, lodging, trails, and local businesses, totaling over 500K instances. Data is provided daily by regional tourism organizations and enriched with external sources like charging stations and public transport stops. The system uses schema.org-based domain specifications encoded as SHACL shapes for data quality validation, and is publicly accessible via a REST API supporting SPARQL queries.

## Method Summary
The GTKG is built using semantic web technologies, with regional tourism organizations providing daily data updates that are transformed using RML mappings to conform to ODTA schema extensions. Each instance undergoes SHACL validation against domain specifications before being loaded into the knowledge graph. The system includes an API layer supporting SPARQL queries and search functionality, with instances available for download in RDF serialization. The architecture also features geo-linking enrichment of external data sources and a URI dereferencer for individual instance access.

## Key Results
- Integration of over 500K instances across tourism-related types (events, points of interest, lodging, trails, local businesses)
- Daily data updates maintained by 16 regional marketing organizations
- Public access via REST API supporting SPARQL queries and search widget
- Data quality ensured through SHACL validation against ODTA domain specifications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Schema-based domain specifications with SHACL validation ensure data quality and consistency across 16 regional sources. Regional marketing organizations use RML mappings to convert internal metadata to schema.org-based types, then validate instances against SHACL shapes from ODTA before loading into GTKG. Core assumption: All regional sources can map their data to the ODTA schema extensions reliably. Break condition: If regional sources cannot conform to ODTA schema or SHACL validation fails consistently, data quality will degrade.

### Mechanism 2
Integration of external data sources (charging stations, public transport stops) via geo-linking enriches the tourism knowledge graph. External datasets are linked to GTKG POIs using geospatial distance calculations, configured via the API's enrichment module. Core assumption: External data sources provide accurate geospatial coordinates that can be matched to GTKG POI locations. Break condition: If external datasets have poor geospatial accuracy or inconsistent coordinate systems, geo-linking will produce incorrect associations.

### Mechanism 3
Stakeholder-driven development and daily updates by regional organizations ensure GTKG remains current and relevant. Regional marketing organizations directly maintain their data contributions, with daily synchronization to the central GTKG. Core assumption: Regional organizations have sufficient resources and motivation to update their data daily. Break condition: If regional organizations reduce update frequency or quality due to resource constraints, the graph will become outdated.

## Foundational Learning

- RDF/SPARQL basics
  - Why needed here: GTKG uses RDF serialization and SPARQL for querying; understanding these is essential for working with the data
  - Quick check question: How would you write a SPARQL query to find all lodging businesses in Berlin?

- SHACL constraints and validation
  - Why needed here: Data quality relies on SHACL validation against domain specifications; knowing SHACL is crucial for schema development
  - Quick check question: What SHACL constraint would you use to ensure a property is required for a specific class?

- Schema.org extensions and domain specifications
  - Why needed here: GTKG extends schema.org with tourism-specific types via ODTA; understanding how to create and use these extensions is key
  - Quick check question: How does ODTA extend schema.org for tourism-specific use cases?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Regional data sources → RML mappings → SHACL validation → GTKG triple store → API layer (SPARQL + search) → GUI widgets + URI dereferencer
- Critical path: Data ingestion → validation → storage → API access → client applications
- Design tradeoffs: Centralized validation ensures consistency but requires regional sources to conform to schema; daily updates provide freshness but increase maintenance burden
- Failure signatures: SHACL validation errors indicate schema mapping issues; API timeouts suggest storage or query optimization problems
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Query the GTKG API for lodging businesses in a specific state and validate response format
  2. Test SHACL validation on sample data against ODTA domain specifications
  3. Run the geo-linking enrichment process on a small subset of POIs with external charging station data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What are the performance metrics and scalability limits of the GTKG when handling concurrent API requests? Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper describes the GTKG's REST API supporting SPARQL queries and mentions daily updates, but does not discuss performance characteristics or scalability testing. Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the architecture and availability of the GTKG but does not provide any benchmarking data or performance evaluation. What evidence would resolve it: Load testing results showing query response times, concurrent user limits, and database performance metrics under different stress conditions.

### Open Question 2
How does the GTKG handle data conflicts when multiple regional marketing organizations provide contradictory information about the same entity? Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that 16 regional marketing organizations provide data daily but does not describe conflict resolution mechanisms. Why unresolved: The data integration process from multiple sources is described, but the paper does not address how inconsistencies between sources are managed. What evidence would resolve it: Documentation of conflict resolution policies, version control mechanisms, or data reconciliation processes used when regional data conflicts occur.

### Open Question 3
What is the user adoption rate and satisfaction level for the GTKG among different stakeholder groups? Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions internal chatbot testing and hackathon applications but does not provide user metrics or adoption statistics. Why unresolved: While the paper describes technical features and access methods, it lacks information about actual usage patterns and user feedback. What evidence would resolve it: Analytics data showing API usage statistics, user surveys, or case studies documenting how different organizations are utilizing the GTKG in practice.

## Limitations

- Specific RML mapping configurations for integrating 16 regional sources with ODTA schemas are not detailed
- Technical architecture and deployment specifics of the GTKG API remain unspecified
- Lack of performance metrics, scalability testing, and user adoption data

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Integration of over 500K instances with daily updates is verifiable via public API
- **Medium Confidence**: SHACL validation ensures data quality, but effectiveness lacks quantitative metrics
- **Low Confidence**: Regional organizations' ability to maintain daily updates is assumed but not empirically validated

## Next Checks

1. Query the GTKG API for lodging businesses in a specific state and validate response format and data accuracy
2. Test SHACL validation on sample data against ODTA domain specifications to identify potential schema mapping issues
3. Run the geo-linking enrichment process on a small subset of POIs with external charging station data to evaluate accuracy
