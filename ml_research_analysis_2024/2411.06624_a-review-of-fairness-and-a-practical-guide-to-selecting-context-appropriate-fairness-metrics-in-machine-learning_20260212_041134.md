# A Review of Fairness and A Practical Guide to Selecting Context-Appropriate Fairness Metrics in Machine Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.06624
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06624
- Reference count: 40
- This paper reviews fairness in machine learning and provides a practical guide for selecting context-appropriate fairness metrics.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of defining and measuring fairness in machine learning due to philosophical, cultural, and political contexts, as well as proliferating regulatory requirements. The authors develop a flowchart-based framework to guide the selection of contextually appropriate fairness measures based on twelve criteria, including model assessment criteria, model selection criteria, and data bias considerations. The framework was validated using three machine learning applications: prisoner recidivism, CV evaluation, and political spam filtering. The paper also reviews fairness literature in the context of machine learning and links it to core regulatory instruments to assist policymakers, AI developers, researchers, and other stakeholders in appropriately addressing fairness concerns and complying with relevant regulatory requirements.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a systematic literature review to identify fairness metrics and develops a decision flowchart based on twelve contextual criteria for selecting appropriate fairness measures. The framework considers model assessment criteria, design considerations, data characteristics, and fairness requirements. The authors validate their approach through three case studies: prisoner recidivism prediction, CV evaluation for hiring, and political spam filtering. The methodology involves mapping contextual factors to specific fairness metrics and testing the framework's effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

## Key Results
- Developed a flowchart to guide selection of contextually appropriate fairness measures based on twelve criteria
- Validated the framework using three machine learning applications: prisoner recidivism, CV evaluation, and political spam filtering
- Identified the need for context-specific fairness metrics to comply with regulatory requirements and address diverse fairness concerns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by systematically mapping contextual factors to appropriate fairness metrics through a decision flowchart. This approach acknowledges that fairness definitions vary widely due to philosophical, religious, cultural, social, historical, political, legal, and ethical factors. By incorporating twelve specific criteria, the framework ensures that fairness metrics are selected based on the unique characteristics of each application, including model assessment needs, design considerations, data properties, and regulatory requirements. This systematic approach helps avoid the "portability trap" of applying one-size-fits-all solutions to diverse fairness challenges.

## Foundational Learning
- **Fairness Metric Selection**: Understanding that different contexts require different fairness metrics based on specific criteria; why needed to avoid inappropriate metric application, quick check: can you map contextual factors to appropriate metrics?
- **Bias Interaction**: Recognizing how data bias, algorithm bias, and user interaction biases interact throughout the AI development lifecycle; why needed to understand comprehensive fairness challenges, quick check: can you identify bias interaction patterns in a given scenario?
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Linking fairness metrics to specific regulatory requirements to ensure compliance; why needed to meet legal obligations, quick check: can you identify relevant regulations for a specific ML application?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Twelve criteria -> Decision flowchart -> Context-appropriate fairness metrics

**Critical Path:** Identify contextual factors → Apply decision flowchart → Select fairness metrics → Validate through case study

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework prioritizes regulatory compliance and context-appropriateness over universal applicability, accepting that metrics may not be transferable across different contexts.

**Failure Signatures:** 
- Incorrect mapping of contextual criteria to fairness metrics
- Overlooking base rate differences or fairness metric incompatibilities
- Misapplication of Western-centric fairness definitions in non-Western contexts

**First Experiments:**
1. Apply the twelve criteria to a simple binary classification problem and select appropriate fairness metrics
2. Validate the decision flowchart using a simulated dataset with known fairness issues
3. Test the framework's effectiveness in identifying appropriate metrics for a new ML application not covered in the original case studies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**
- Question: What is the most effective way to develop and validate context-appropriate fairness metrics for generative AI models, given their unique characteristics and outputs?
- Basis in paper: The paper acknowledges that fairness assessment in generative AI is beyond its scope and notes the need for future research in this area.
- Why unresolved: Generative AI models have distinct characteristics (e.g., text-to-image generation) that don't fit traditional fairness metric categories, and current methods are not well-suited for these applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Research demonstrating validated fairness metrics specifically designed for generative AI models, tested across multiple domains and validated against human judgments of fairness.

**Open Question 2**
- Question: How can fairness metrics be effectively designed and implemented to account for cultural and philosophical differences in fairness perceptions across diverse global contexts?
- Basis in paper: The paper emphasizes that fairness definitions vary widely due to philosophical, religious, cultural, social, historical, political, legal, and ethical factors, and warns against the "portability trap" of applying one-size-fits-all solutions.
- Why unresolved: Most fairness research has been conducted by Western researchers, potentially creating Euro-centric biases in fairness definitions and metrics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of fairness metric effectiveness across different cultural contexts, with input from diverse stakeholders in each culture.

**Open Question 3**
- Question: What are the most effective methods for measuring and mitigating the interaction effects between different types of biases (data, algorithm, and user interaction) in AI systems?
- Basis in paper: The paper introduces a new bias interaction loop that incorporates model context and discusses the complex ways biases interact throughout the AI development lifecycle.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies bias interaction patterns, it doesn't provide specific methods for measuring or mitigating these interactions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies demonstrating successful bias interaction measurement and mitigation techniques, with measurable improvements in fairness outcomes.

## Limitations
- The framework relies on subjective interpretation of the twelve contextual criteria, which may vary significantly across different organizational and cultural settings
- Validation through three case studies represents a limited scope of real-world applications and may not capture edge cases or complex intersectionality issues
- The systematic literature review may have missed emerging fairness metrics published after the review cutoff

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the systematic identification of fairness criteria and their relevance to regulatory compliance
- **Medium confidence** in the practical applicability of the decision flowchart across diverse contexts
- **Low confidence** in the framework's ability to handle nuanced fairness scenarios involving multiple protected attributes

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework with additional case studies involving multiple protected attributes and intersectional fairness considerations
2. Conduct stakeholder workshops to validate the interpretability and practical utility of the twelve criteria across different organizational contexts
3. Perform sensitivity analysis on the decision flowchart to assess how changes in criterion weighting affect the final fairness metric selection
