# A prototype-based model for set classification

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2408.13720
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13720
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Prototype-based model for set classification using adaptive chordal distance with relevance factors on Grassmann manifold

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a prototype-based model for set classification that addresses the limitations of existing methods on the Grassmann manifold. The approach learns a set of subspace prototypes and relevance factors to capture class characteristics while automating dimensionality selection. This results in a transparent classifier that quantifies the impact of each input vector on its decision, offering both performance and explainability advantages over transformer-based models while requiring fewer computational resources.

## Method Summary
The method represents variable-length sets as fixed-dimensional subspaces via SVD, placing them on the Grassmann manifold. It learns prototype subspaces and relevance factors that weight canonical correlations in the chordal distance metric, enabling automatic dimensionality selection. The model uses stochastic gradient descent to optimize prototypes and relevances simultaneously, with a nearest prototype classification strategy that provides computational efficiency. Explainability is achieved through decomposition of the distance into contributions from individual input vectors and their elements.

## Key Results
- Achieves comparable or better performance than transformer-based models with significantly fewer parameters
- Provides element-level precision in identifying impact of input vectors on predictions
- Demonstrates efficiency in both computations and memory cost during test phase
- Shows effectiveness across diverse image and text datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The adaptive chordal distance with relevance factors enables automatic dimensionality selection while preserving class separability. Relevance factors λ_k weight the contribution of each canonical correlation to the distance, with SGD updating both prototypes and relevances during training. Irrelevant or noisy dimensions receive low weights, effectively reducing effective dimensionality without manual tuning.

### Mechanism 2
Intrinsic explainability arises from decomposing the adaptive distance into contributions from individual input vectors and their elements. Using SVD, each principal vector is expressed as a weighted sum of input vectors, allowing the distance to be rewritten as a sum over input vectors and their elements, revealing their impact on classification.

### Mechanism 3
NPC strategy during inference provides computational efficiency by avoiding storage/access to all training examples. Classification depends only on distances to p prototypes rather than N training examples, reducing storage from O(N) to O(p) and prediction complexity from O(N·d²) to O(p·d²).

## Foundational Learning

- **SVD and low-rank approximation**: Represents variable-length sets as fixed-dimensional subspaces on the Grassmann manifold
  - Quick check: Given X = UΣV^T, what matrix P spans the subspace generated by X's columns?
- **Grassmann manifold geometry**: Provides the mathematical framework for defining distances between subspaces
  - Quick check: What geometric structure do d-dimensional subspaces of R^D form?
- **Canonical correlation and principal angles**: Define the chordal distance used to compare subspaces
  - Quick check: How are principal angles computed from two orthonormal matrices P₁ and P₂?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: SVD preprocessing -> Prototype layer -> Distance computation -> Classification -> Explainability
- **Critical path**: 1. SVD preprocessing → 2. Prototype initialization → 3. SGD optimization (update prototypes and relevances) → 4. NPC prediction → 5. Attribution analysis
- **Design tradeoffs**: Dimensionality d vs computational cost; Number of prototypes p vs accuracy; Learning rates η_W vs η_λ
- **Failure signatures**: All relevance factors converge to zero; Prototypes collapse to single point; Attribution scores uniform across inputs
- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Train on ETH-80 with d=5, p=8, monitor cost function and accuracy over epochs; 2. Test explainability by computing attribution scores for sample images and visualizing pixel importance; 3. Compare performance and explainability with GRLGQ baseline on same dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the performance of AChorDS-LVQ compare to transformer-based models when applied to datasets with longer documents than those tested in this study? The paper tested on Arxiv-4 with documents averaging 6000 words but didn't test on longer texts.

### Open Question 2
What is the impact of using different word embedding models (e.g., BERT embeddings) on the performance of AChorDS-LVQ for document classification? The paper tested with Word2Vec and GloVe but didn't explore BERT embeddings.

### Open Question 3
How does the interpretability of AChorDS-LVQ compare to other intrinsically interpretable models, such as decision trees or logistic regression, in terms of providing insights into the model's decision-making process? The study didn't compare interpretability to other models.

## Limitations
- Specific implementation details of SGD optimization and exact updating rules for prototypes and relevance factors are not specified
- The exact form of the monotonically increasing function ϕ used in the cost function is not defined
- Optimal selection strategies for user-defined dimensionality d are not discussed

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Core mathematical framework using SVD for subspace representation and adaptive chordal distance with relevance factors; explainability mechanism through SVD decomposition
- **Medium Confidence**: Convergence properties of SGD optimization and generalization performance across datasets
- **Low Confidence**: Claim about significant computational efficiency compared to transformer models due to unclear comparison methodology

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study**: Systematically vary the number of prototypes p and dimensionality d to identify optimal configurations and understand their impact on performance and explainability.

2. **Computational Benchmark**: Implement a fair comparison with transformer-based models on the same hardware, measuring both inference time and memory usage for identical classification tasks.

3. **Robustness Analysis**: Test the model's sensitivity to noisy inputs and its ability to maintain performance when relevance factors are initialized uniformly versus learned from data.
