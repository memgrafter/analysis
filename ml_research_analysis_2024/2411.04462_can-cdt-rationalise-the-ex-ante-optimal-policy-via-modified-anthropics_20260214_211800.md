## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether causal decision theory (CDT) can be reconciled with ex ante optimal policies in Newcomblike decision problems through modified anthropic reasoning. The authors propose that by modeling the environment as running simulations of the agent, CDT can incorporate anthropic considerations that align its recommendations with ex ante optimal policies. They develop several approaches including global simulation models, local approximations, and a general framework called Generalised Generalised Thirding (GGT) that updates self-locating beliefs based on environmental simulation patterns.

The key insight is that when agents reason about their own existence using modified anthropic principles that account for how the environment simulates them, CDT can produce the same recommendations as ex ante optimal decision theories. The authors prove that under conditions of continuity or differentiability of dependence functions, the resulting CDT policies include the ex ante optimal policies. This work bridges a significant gap between CDT's traditional shortcomings in Newcomblike problems and the desiderata of ex ante optimality.

## Method Summary
The authors explore several approaches to reconcile CDT with ex ante optimal policies by modifying how agents reason about their own existence. They start with a global simulation model where the environment explicitly runs multiple copies or simulations of the agent. This is then approximated locally, where the agent only needs to consider local simulation effects rather than the entire global structure. The most general approach, Generalised Generalised Thirding (GGT), updates self-locating beliefs based on how the environment's simulation patterns depend on the agent's actions.

The mathematical framework characterizes the relationship between an agent's actions and the environment's simulation behavior through dependence functions. When these functions are continuous or differentiable, the modified CDT can recover ex ante optimal policies. The authors prove these results in Theorems 2, 3, and 4, with Corollary 4 establishing the main reconciliation result. They also analyze limitations where discontinuous dependence functions or lack of independent randomization prevent compatibility with ex ante optimal policies.

## Key Results
- CDT can be modified to include ex ante optimal policies when dependence functions are continuous or differentiable (Theorems 2, 3, and 4)
- The Generalised Generalised Thirding (GGT) framework provides a general approach for updating self-locating beliefs based on environmental simulation patterns
- Under certain conditions, the modified CDT policies exactly match ex ante optimal policies (Corollary 4)
- Discontinuous dependence functions and lack of independent randomization can prevent reconciliation with ex ante optimal policies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The reconciliation works by modifying how CDT agents reason about their own existence through anthropic considerations. Traditional CDT fails in Newcomblike problems because it doesn't account for how its existence might depend on its own decisions. By modeling the environment as running simulations of the agent, the modified CDT can update its self-locating beliefs based on how these simulations relate to its actions. This creates a bridge between causal reasoning and the kind of evidential reasoning that ex ante optimal policies naturally employ.

The mechanism relies on dependence functions that characterize how the environment's simulation behavior changes with the agent's actions. When these functions have favorable mathematical properties (continuity or differentiability), the resulting belief updates align CDT's recommendations with ex ante optimal policies. The GGT framework provides the most general approach, showing that under broad conditions, modified CDT can achieve ex ante optimality.

## Foundational Learning
- Causal Decision Theory (CDT): A decision theory that evaluates actions based on their causal consequences rather than evidential correlations. Needed to understand the baseline theory being modified; check by verifying that actions are evaluated through causal intervention rather than correlation.
- Anthropic Reasoning: The study of how agents should reason about their own existence and indexical information. Needed because the reconciliation relies on modifying self-locating beliefs; check by examining how probability assignments change based on existence conditions.
- Newcomblike Problems: Decision problems where outcomes depend on predictions of the agent's behavior. Needed as the motivating class of problems; check by identifying prediction elements and their impact on payoffs.
- Simulation Models: Representations where the environment runs copies or approximations of the agent. Needed for the core mechanism; check by verifying how agent copies influence outcome probabilities.
- Dependence Functions: Mathematical functions characterizing how environmental behavior depends on agent actions. Needed for the formal proofs; check by examining continuity and differentiability properties.
- Ex Ante Optimality: Policies that maximize expected utility before uncertainty is resolved. Needed as the target criterion; check by verifying optimization over decision rules rather than individual actions.

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Agent -> Decision Rule -> Environment Simulation -> Outcome
- Critical path: Decision selection → Anthropic belief update → Causal evaluation → Action implementation
- Design tradeoffs: Global simulation accuracy vs. local approximation tractability; mathematical generality vs. practical implementability
- Failure signatures: Discontinuous dependence functions → policy divergence; lack of randomization → suboptimal convergence
- First experiments:
  1. Test modified CDT on transparent Newcomb problem with varying prediction accuracy
  2. Evaluate performance on counterfactual mugging with different simulation depths
  3. Compare global vs. local simulation approaches on medical Newcomb problems

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Discontinuous dependence functions can prevent compatibility with ex ante optimal policies
- The approach requires agents to have independent randomization capabilities
- The mathematical assumptions about continuity and differentiability may not hold in all decision problems
- It's unclear whether the simulation models capture all relevant Newcomblike scenarios

## Confidence
- High confidence in the mathematical proofs for Theorems 2, 3, and 4 under stated conditions
- Medium confidence in the general applicability to Newcomblike problems, given the demonstrated limitations
- Low confidence in claims about universal reconciliation between CDT and ex ante optimal policies

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on decision problems with discontinuous dependence functions to quantify the failure modes
2. Evaluate whether alternative simulation models beyond the ones considered could expand the range of compatible problems
3. Investigate practical implementation of the randomization requirements for real-world decision-making agents
