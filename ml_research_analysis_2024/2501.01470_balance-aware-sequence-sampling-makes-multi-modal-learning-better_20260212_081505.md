# Balance-aware Sequence Sampling Makes Multi-modal Learning Better

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2501.01470
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01470
- Reference count: 18
- Key outcome: BSS improves multi-modal classification accuracy by up to 3.37% on Kinetics-Sounds dataset through balance-aware sample sequencing.

## Executive Summary
Balance-aware Sequence Sampling (BSS) addresses modality imbalance in multi-modal learning by optimizing sample sequences rather than model objectives. The method evaluates each sample's balance degree using a multi-perspective measurer based on prediction similarity and training loss, then employs either a heuristic scheduler (curriculum learning-based) or a learning-based scheduler to dynamically adjust training sequences from balanced to imbalanced samples. Experiments on six datasets show BSS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 3.37%/2.89% improvements in accuracy and MAP metrics on Kinetics-Sounds, and demonstrates robustness when using pre-trained models like CLIP.

## Method Summary
BSS introduces a novel approach to multi-modal learning that focuses on optimizing the training sequence of samples rather than the learning objective itself. The method uses a measurer that computes a balance score for each sample based on prediction similarity between modalities and their individual losses. Two scheduler types are implemented: a heuristic scheduler using curriculum learning principles with a root pacing function, and a learning-based scheduler that dynamically updates sample scores every few epochs using momentum. The approach is tested across three multi-modal tasks (Audio-Video, Image-Text, RGB-Depth) on six benchmark datasets, showing consistent improvements over existing methods.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 3.37% improvement in accuracy and 2.89% improvement in MAP on Kinetics-Sounds dataset
- Demonstrates effectiveness across three multi-modal tasks: Audio-Video, Image-Text, and RGB-Depth
- Shows robustness when using pre-trained models like CLIP
- Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on all six tested datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
BSS works by addressing the fundamental issue of modality imbalance through curriculum learning principles. Instead of treating all samples equally or focusing solely on loss minimization, it recognizes that some samples naturally exhibit better balance between modalities than others. By initially training on more balanced samples and progressively introducing harder, more imbalanced samples, the model learns more robust cross-modal representations. The learning-based scheduler further refines this by dynamically updating sample priorities based on their current difficulty, allowing the training process to adapt to the model's evolving capabilities.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-modal fusion strategies** (Concatenation vs Sum): Different fusion approaches affect how modalities interact and influence the final prediction
- **Curriculum learning pacing functions**: Understanding how to gradually increase training difficulty through mathematical functions
- **Balance degree measurement**: Quantifying how well different modalities agree on predictions for each sample
- **Dynamic sampling strategies**: Methods for adjusting training data distribution during learning
- **Multi-perspective evaluation**: Using both prediction similarity and loss information to assess sample quality
- **Momentum-based score updating**: Techniques for smoothing and stabilizing dynamic priority updates

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Input Data -> Measurer (Balance Score Calculation) -> Scheduler (Heuristic/Learning-based) -> Sampled DataLoader -> Multi-modal Model -> Loss Computation

**Critical Path:** The core workflow involves computing balance scores for all training samples, then using these scores to construct a weighted sampling distribution that prioritizes more balanced samples early in training.

**Design Tradeoffs:** Heuristic scheduler offers simplicity and stability but less adaptability, while learning-based scheduler provides dynamic adaptation but requires more computational overhead for periodic score updates.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor initial score correlation leading to biased early training, or overly peaked sampling distributions causing insufficient exposure to challenging samples.

**First Experiments:**
1. Implement BSS-L scheduler with initial scoring on randomly initialized weights
2. Compare performance with and without 1-epoch burn-in training phase
3. Test temperature-controlled softmax in learning-based scheduler to control sampling diversity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Initial scoring mechanism reliability is unclear, with ambiguity about whether pre-trained encoders or burn-in epochs should be used
- Fusion architecture details are underspecified, particularly projection head dimensions for concatenation-based fusion
- The method requires periodic full-dataset evaluation every few epochs, increasing computational overhead

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Core methodology and conceptual framework for addressing modality imbalance
- **Medium Confidence:** Implementation details for learning-based scheduler
- **Low Confidence:** Complete reproduction requiring assumptions about initial scoring setup and fusion architecture

## Next Checks
1. Implement a 1-epoch burn-in training phase with random sampling before applying BSS to establish baseline initial scores
2. Test the correlation between initial balance scores and actual sample losses across multiple random seeds
3. Implement a temperature-controlled softmax in the learning-based scheduler and measure its effect on effective sample diversity
