# Multimodal Deep Learning for Low-Resource Settings: A Vector Embedding Alignment Approach for Healthcare Applications

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.02601
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02601
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Embeddings from foundation models reduce computational demands by >95% while maintaining or improving performance, with proposed embedding alignment improving F1-scores by up to 6.5 percentage points

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates vector embeddings from foundation models as an efficient alternative to raw data for multimodal deep learning in low-resource healthcare settings. The study demonstrates that embeddings extracted from models like Dino V2 and CLIP significantly reduce computational requirements (training/inference times reduced from minutes to seconds, memory usage reduced by over 95%) without compromising performance. A novel inference-time embedding alignment method is proposed to address modality gaps, improving F1-scores by up to 6.5 percentage points in medical datasets. Results show embeddings enable efficient multimodal learning suitable for low-resource environments while maintaining or improving model performance compared to raw data approaches.

## Method Summary
The approach uses foundation models (DINO V2 + LLAMA 2, CLIP) to extract vector embeddings from image-text pairs in medical datasets (BRSET, HAM10000, SatelliteBench). These embeddings are stored in CSV files and used with early and late fusion classifiers instead of raw data. An inference-time embedding alignment method reduces modality gaps by injecting Gaussian noise and shifting embeddings based on modality gap. Models are trained using BCEWithLogitsLoss or CrossEntropyLoss with class weights for imbalance handling, and evaluated on accuracy, F1-score, and efficiency metrics.

## Key Results
- Computational efficiency: Training/inference times reduced from minutes to seconds, memory usage reduced by >95%
- Performance: Embedding-based approaches maintained or improved accuracy and F1-scores compared to raw data methods
- Embedding alignment: Proposed method improved F1-scores by up to 6.5 percentage points in medical datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Vector embeddings from foundation models preserve discriminative features while reducing dimensionality, enabling efficient multimodal learning in low-resource environments.
- Mechanism: Foundation models like DINO v2 and CLIP are pre-trained on large-scale datasets, learning generalizable feature representations. When these models are used to extract embeddings from medical images and text, the embeddings retain task-relevant information in a compact form. This compact representation reduces computational load by avoiding the need to process high-dimensional raw data, while still maintaining or improving classification performance.
- Core assumption: Pre-trained foundation models have learned robust, transferable features that generalize to medical domain tasks, and the embedding space preserves semantic similarity relevant for the downstream task.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our findings indicate that embeddings reduce computational demands without compromising the model’s performance"
  - [section]: "Our findings indicate that embeddings reduce computational demands without compromising the model’s performance, and show that our embedding alignment method improves the performance of the models in medical tasks."
  - [corpus]: Found 25 related papers. Average neighbor FMR=0.419, average citations=0.0. No direct corpus evidence on foundation model embeddings for medical tasks.
- Break condition: If the pre-trained models have not learned features relevant to the medical domain, or if the embedding dimensionality is too low to capture task-relevant information, performance will degrade.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Inference-time embedding alignment reduces the modality gap between image and text embeddings, improving model performance.
- Mechanism: The "cone effect" causes embeddings from different modalities (e.g., image and text) to be concentrated in narrow regions of the latent space, leading to misalignment. By injecting Gaussian noise and shifting embeddings based on the modality gap, the alignment method forces the model to learn more robust cross-modal relationships. This regularization improves the model's ability to correctly classify multimodal data pairs.
- Core assumption: The modality gap exists due to the contrastive training objective of models like CLIP and the lower variance in medical data embeddings compared to general datasets.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "To bridge the modality gap and bolster the semantic robustness of the embedding pairs, we propose the following approach"
  - [section]: "Our findings show that embeddings reduce computational demands without compromising the model’s performance, and show that our embedding alignment method improves the performance of the models in medical tasks."
  - [corpus]: Found 25 related papers. Average neighbor FMR=0.419, average citations=0.0. No direct corpus evidence on inference-time embedding alignment for medical tasks.
- Break condition: If the modality gap is not the primary source of error for the model, or if the alignment hyperparameters (e.g., lambda shift) are not properly tuned, performance gains may be minimal or negative.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Early and late fusion strategies enable effective integration of multimodal embeddings for classification tasks.
- Mechanism: Early fusion concatenates image and text embeddings at the input level, allowing the classifier to learn joint representations from the start. Late fusion processes each modality separately through dedicated feature extraction blocks before merging them, which can capture modality-specific features before integration. Both strategies leverage the reduced dimensionality of embeddings to efficiently combine multimodal information for classification.
- Core assumption: The embeddings extracted from foundation models contain complementary information that can be effectively combined using fusion strategies to improve classification performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "For the modeling tasks, two fusion techniques, an early (Figure 1C-1) and late (Figure 1C-2) fusion methods were employed"
  - [section]: "Our findings show that embeddings reduce computational demands without compromising the model’s performance"
  - [corpus]: Found 25 related papers. Average neighbor FMR=0.419, average citations=0.0. No direct corpus evidence on fusion strategies for medical embeddings.
- Break condition: If the embeddings from different modalities are not complementary or if one modality dominates the other, fusion may not improve or may even degrade performance.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Foundation models (DINO v2, CLIP, Llama 2) -> Embedding extraction -> CSV storage -> Fusion models (early/late) -> Alignment module (noise injection, shift) -> Evaluation

- Critical path:
  1. Extract embeddings from foundation models
  2. Store embeddings in CSV files
  3. Load embeddings and apply fusion strategy
  4. Apply embedding alignment (if using CLIP embeddings)
  5. Train and evaluate classification model

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Embedding dimensionality vs. information retention
  - Early vs. late fusion for modality integration
  - Alignment hyperparameters (noise level, lambda shift) vs. performance
  - Foundation model choice vs. embedding quality and computational cost

- Failure signatures:
  - High memory usage or long training times (indicates issue with embedding extraction or fusion)
  - Low accuracy or F1-score (suggests embeddings are not capturing task-relevant information or alignment is not effective)
  - Unstable training or convergence issues (may indicate improper hyperparameter tuning or data preprocessing)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Extract embeddings from DINO v2 and Llama 2 for the BRSET dataset and store them in CSV files.
  2. Implement early fusion and late fusion classifiers using the extracted embeddings and evaluate their performance on the BRSET dataset.
  3. Implement the embedding alignment method for CLIP embeddings on the BRSET dataset and evaluate its impact on classification performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do embedding-based approaches compare to traditional fine-tuning methods for domain-specific tasks where data significantly deviates from foundation model training distributions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges that embeddings from foundation models might miss unique characteristics in specialized datasets and suggests that task-specific models or advanced pre-training techniques could address this, albeit with added computational costs.
- Why unresolved: The paper only mentions this as a potential limitation without providing empirical comparisons or specific metrics for domain-specific tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies measuring performance metrics (accuracy, F1-score) and computational efficiency (training time, memory usage) between embedding-based approaches and fine-tuning methods on multiple domain-specific datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between the strength of embedding alignment (lambda parameter) and model performance across different medical datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper proposes an embedding alignment method to reduce the modality gap in medical data and tests different lambda values, showing improvements in some cases but not others.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests a limited range of lambda values and doesn't provide a systematic analysis of how this parameter affects different types of medical datasets or tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive sensitivity analysis of the lambda parameter across multiple medical datasets with varying characteristics, establishing guidelines for optimal parameter selection.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do different foundation models (e.g., LLAMA 2 vs. GPT-4, DINO V2 vs. other vision transformers) compare in terms of embedding quality and computational efficiency for multimodal healthcare applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses specific models (DINO V2, LLAMA 2, CLIP) but acknowledges that different models could be used and might provide better quality information.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests a limited set of models and doesn't provide a systematic comparison of different foundation models for healthcare applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive benchmark comparing multiple foundation models across different healthcare tasks, measuring both performance metrics and computational efficiency.

## Limitations
- Limited to three medical datasets with relatively small sample sizes (10,015; 1,676; 600 samples), raising questions about generalizability
- Does not provide extensive ablation studies on hyperparameter sensitivity, particularly for the embedding alignment method
- Does not systematically explore optimal lambda shift values or their impact across different dataset types

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The computational efficiency improvements (training/inference time reductions from minutes to seconds, >95% memory reduction) are well-supported by the methodology and results across all three datasets.

**Medium Confidence:** The performance claims (F1-score improvements up to 6.5 percentage points) are supported by results but would benefit from additional statistical significance testing and cross-validation.

**Medium Confidence:** The mechanism explanations for why embedding alignment works are theoretically sound but lack extensive empirical validation through ablation studies.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct statistical significance testing (e.g., paired t-tests) on performance improvements across datasets to verify the reliability of the claimed F1-score gains.

2. Perform ablation studies varying the embedding alignment hyperparameters (noise level, lambda shift) to determine optimal values and robustness across datasets.

3. Test the approach on additional medical datasets with different modalities (e.g., radiology images with clinical reports) to evaluate generalizability beyond the three studied domains.
