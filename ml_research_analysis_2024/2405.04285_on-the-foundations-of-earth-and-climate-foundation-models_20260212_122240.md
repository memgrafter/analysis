# On the Foundations of Earth and Climate Foundation Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.04285
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04285
- Reference count: 40
- This paper defines eleven key features for ideal Earth and climate foundation models and analyzes gaps in current approaches.

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes a comprehensive framework for developing ideal Earth and climate foundation models (FMs) by identifying eleven essential features including geolocation embedding, scale awareness, and physical consistency. The authors systematically analyze existing EO and climate FMs, revealing critical gaps in geographical representation, multi-sensor integration, and time-series modeling capabilities. The work provides a roadmap toward achieving these ideal FMs through dynamic encoding, multimodal learning, and continual pre-training while emphasizing the importance of standardized benchmarking and addressing challenges like energy efficiency and interpretability.

## Method Summary
The framework proposes developing foundation models with eleven key features through a systematic approach involving data preprocessing, dynamic encoding, spatial-temporal modeling, multimodal fusion, and task-specific adaptation. The method emphasizes self-supervised pre-training on massive unlabeled Earth data, incorporating geolocation embeddings and scale awareness to handle the diverse nature of Earth observation data. The approach includes continual pre-training for carbon-minimized FMs and focuses on integrating physical consistency and uncertainty quantification. The methodology requires collecting diverse EO and climate datasets with geographical balance, designing architectures that support multimodal inputs, and establishing standardized benchmarking suites for evaluation.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Geolocated embeddings improve feature representation for localized Earth phenomena.
- Mechanism: Encoding latitude/longitude coordinates directly into the model allows it to learn spatial correlations and distinguish geographically similar but distinct events.
- Core assumption: Earth data inherently contains strong spatial dependencies that can be captured by explicit geolocation features.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Embedding geolocation into the FM, either in a hard-coded way by importing the latitude and longitude as inputs, or in a smoother manner by contrasting features according to their geographical distances, can improve feature representation or even facilitate the study of localized events, such as heatwaves or hurricanes."
  - [section] "Geolocation embedding: EO and climate data are linked to a geolocation. Embedding geolocation into the FM, either in a hard-coded way by importing the latitude and longitude as inputs, or in a smoother manner by contrasting features according to their geographical distances, can improve feature representation or even facilitate the study of localized events, such as heatwaves or hurricanes."
- Break condition: If the spatial dependencies are weak or noise dominates, geolocation encoding may not yield improvement and could add unnecessary complexity.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multisensor data integration enables richer representations by capturing complementary information across modalities.
- Mechanism: The model learns joint feature representations across different sensors (e.g., optical, SAR, hyperspectral) while preserving modality-specific characteristics, allowing it to leverage diverse Earth observations.
- Core assumption: Different sensors capture complementary aspects of Earth processes that can be combined to form a more complete understanding.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The FM must be capable of learning general feature representations across all data sources while retaining the unique characteristics of each source."
  - [section] "Multisensory: Multi-source and multisensory EO and climate data offer complementary information in order to serve various tasks. The FM must be capable of learning general feature representations across all data sources while retaining the unique characteristics of each source."
- Break condition: If sensor data is highly redundant or calibration between sensors is poor, integration may not provide meaningful benefits and could introduce noise.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Self-supervised pre-training on massive unlabeled Earth data enables task-agnostic representations.
- Mechanism: The model learns general feature representations from large amounts of unlabeled data, which can then be adapted to various downstream tasks with minimal labeled data.
- Core assumption: Large-scale unlabeled Earth data contains sufficient structure and patterns to learn meaningful general representations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "FMs are proving to be a glimmer of hope in this context. This section delves into the critical reasons underpinning the need for FMs in the Earth and climate sciences, illustrating their potential to revolutionize our understanding of the Earth system towards its sustainable management."
  - [section] "The primary allure of FMs lies in their ability to harness the vast, often unlabeled, reservoirs of EO and climate data by means of learning general representations from them 7."
- Break condition: If the unlabeled data is too heterogeneous or lacks coherent structure, self-supervised learning may fail to produce useful general representations.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Self-supervised learning
  - Why needed here: Earth observation and climate data are abundant but largely unlabeled, making supervised learning impractical for training foundation models.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between self-supervised learning and supervised learning in the context of Earth observation data?

- Concept: Multimodal learning
  - Why needed here: Earth systems involve multiple data types (optical, SAR, hyperspectral, meteorological) that need to be integrated for comprehensive understanding.
  - Quick check question: How does multimodal learning differ from single-modality learning when dealing with Earth observation data?

- Concept: Scale awareness
  - Why needed here: Earth observation data spans multiple spatial scales from sub-meter to hundreds of kilometers, requiring models to handle scale variations.
  - Quick check question: Why is scale awareness important for Earth observation foundation models compared to traditional computer vision models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing → Dynamic encoding → Spatial-temporal modeling → Multimodal fusion → Task-specific adaptation → Inference/forecasting
- Critical path: The foundation model processes multimodal inputs through an encoder that handles geolocation embedding and scale awareness, then applies spatial-temporal modeling before multimodal fusion and task-specific adaptation for downstream applications.
- Design tradeoffs: Larger models can capture more complex patterns but require more computational resources; multimodal integration increases representational power but adds architectural complexity; geolocation encoding improves spatial understanding but may introduce noise if not properly handled.
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on geographically diverse regions suggests imbalanced training data; failure to generalize across sensors indicates insufficient multimodal learning; temporal artifacts suggest inadequate temporal modeling.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test geolocation embedding effectiveness by training with and without latitude/longitude coordinates on a simple classification task.
  2. Evaluate multimodal integration by comparing single-sensor vs. multi-sensor performance on the same downstream task.
  3. Assess scale awareness by testing the model's ability to handle inputs at different spatial resolutions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can foundation models be designed to effectively handle the spatial resolution gap between Earth observation and climate data while maintaining accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies a clear gap in spatial resolution between EO and climate domains, with EO models operating at high resolution and climate models at lower resolution, and discusses the need for a unified approach.
- Why unresolved: Current models operate at different scales, and bridging this gap requires novel architectures that can integrate data from both domains without losing critical information.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful development and validation of a model that seamlessly integrates high-resolution EO data with lower-resolution climate data, demonstrating improved forecasting and analysis capabilities across both domains.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What strategies can be employed to ensure geographical balance in training datasets for Earth foundation models, particularly for underrepresented regions like oceans and polar areas?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights that existing models often oversample data-rich regions and undersample underrepresented areas, which is critical for ecology, climatology, and oceanography.
- Why unresolved: Current pre-training datasets tend to focus on medium- to high-resolution RGB and MSI data, neglecting diverse geographical regions and data types.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of a comprehensive pre-training dataset that includes balanced representation of all geographical regions and data types, validated by improved model performance in underrepresented areas.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can foundation models incorporate physical consistency and uncertainty quantification to enhance their reliability in extreme Earth events?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies the need for models to incorporate physical laws and quantify uncertainty, especially when dealing with extreme events where data scarcity and unexpected situations can impact performance.
- Why unresolved: While some progress has been made, integrating these features into foundation models remains underexplored, particularly in the context of extreme events.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of a foundation model that successfully integrates physical consistency and uncertainty quantification, validated by its performance in predicting and analyzing extreme Earth events with high accuracy and reliability.

## Limitations
- The effectiveness of geolocation embeddings and proposed mechanisms lacks comprehensive experimental validation across diverse Earth observation tasks
- The roadmap toward ideal FMs contains several speculative elements, particularly regarding dynamic encoding techniques and continual pre-training feasibility
- The framework relies heavily on future developments in dynamic encoding, multi-modal learning, and continual pre-training without detailed implementation guidance

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The identification of eleven key features for ideal Earth and climate foundation models represents a systematic analysis of current literature and demonstrates a clear understanding of existing limitations in the field. The discussion of benchmarking requirements and the need for standardized evaluation metrics is well-grounded in current research practices.

**Medium Confidence**: The proposed mechanisms for geolocation embedding and multisensor integration are theoretically justified but require empirical validation. The assumptions about spatial dependencies and sensor complementarity are reasonable but may not hold universally across all Earth observation scenarios.

**Low Confidence**: The roadmap toward ideal FMs contains several speculative elements, particularly regarding the effectiveness of dynamic encoding techniques and the feasibility of continual pre-training for carbon-minimized models. The energy-efficient adaptation strategies and adversarial defense mechanisms are discussed at a conceptual level without detailed implementation guidance.

## Next Checks

1. **Geolocation Embedding Validation**: Conduct controlled experiments comparing model performance with and without geolocation embeddings across multiple Earth observation tasks and geographic regions to quantify the actual impact on feature representation quality.

2. **Multisensor Integration Assessment**: Implement and test the proposed multimodal learning architecture using diverse sensor combinations (optical, SAR, hyperspectral) to evaluate whether the model successfully learns complementary representations without introducing modality-specific noise or calibration issues.

3. **Scale Awareness Testing**: Design experiments that systematically vary input spatial resolutions to assess the model's ability to maintain performance across different scales, identifying potential limitations in handling extreme scale variations or transitions between spatial regimes.
