- This scoping review systematically examined explainable and interpretable deep learning methods for healthcare NLP, analyzing 42 papers published between 2018-2022

## Executive Summary
This scoping review systematically examines explainable and interpretable deep learning (XIAI) methods for healthcare natural language processing (NLP). The analysis of 42 papers published between 2018-2022 reveals that attention mechanisms are the most prevalent emerging interpretable technique. The review identifies significant challenges including the lack of global modeling process exploration, absence of best practices, and insufficient systematic evaluation and benchmarks. Key opportunities include using attention mechanisms for multi-modal interpretability in personalized medicine and combining deep learning with causal logic. The findings suggest that adoption of these techniques in healthcare requires dedicated in-house expertise and collaboration with domain experts, end-users, and policymakers.

## Method Summary
The study conducted a systematic scoping review following PRISMA guidelines, searching four major databases (Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, ACM) for papers published between 2018-2022. The search targeted studies combining natural language processing, healthcare applications, and explainable/interpretable deep learning methods. After applying inclusion/exclusion criteria, 42 papers underwent full-text evaluation. The review categorized XIAI methods by functionality (model-, input-, output-based) and scope (local, global), analyzing challenges and opportunities across different deep learning architectures and healthcare NLP tasks.

## Key Results
- Attention mechanisms emerged as the most prevalent interpretable technique in healthcare NLP XIAI research
- The majority of studies employed local rather than global interpretability methods, with only 5 papers addressing global approaches
- Major challenges include lack of global modeling exploration, absence of best practices, and insufficient systematic evaluation and benchmarks
- Opportunities exist in multi-modal interpretability using attention mechanisms and combining deep learning with causal logic for enhanced transparency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Attention mechanisms can combine and interpret multi-modal data (text, images, genetics, clinical history) for personalized medicine
- Mechanism: Attention mechanisms are versatile and can be integrated with multiple deep learning structures (CNN, RNN, BERT, Transformers). By simultaneously modeling information from different data modalities, attention heatmaps can highlight influential parts across modalities, enabling interpretable multi-modal representations
- Core assumption: Attention weights can effectively capture relevant cross-modal interactions and that these interactions are meaningful for medical decision-making
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "One important opportunity is to use attention mechanisms to enhance multi-modal XIAI for personalized medicine"
  - [section]: "A major opportunity identified is the versatility of attention mechanisms to be combined with multiple DL structures (e.g., CNN [64], RNN [63], BERT [65] and full Transformers) [70]. Another translational opportunity identified via the use of attention mechanisms is to simultaneously model and interpret information from variable multi-modal data (e.g., text, images, genetics, clinical history) [80]"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - the corpus doesn't directly address multi-modal applications, suggesting this remains an opportunity rather than established practice
- Break condition: If attention weights don't correlate meaningfully with cross-modal importance, or if multi-modal integration doesn't improve clinical outcomes compared to single-modality approaches

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Combining DL with causal logic can enhance inherent interpretability of XIAI
- Mechanism: Causal modeling identifies cause-effect relationships between variables that determine model decision-making. By understanding these causal paths, DL models can be designed to be more transparent about their reasoning process, moving beyond correlational patterns to true causal understanding
- Core assumption: Causal relationships can be reliably extracted from healthcare data and that these relationships meaningfully improve model interpretability
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Additionally, combining DL with causal logic holds promise"
  - [section]: "Causality is an emerging topic in DL which aims to improve model interpretability, fairness and generalization [86, 87]. The fundamental aim of causal DL is to unravel causal relationships between variables which determine the model's decision-making process [86]"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - while causality is mentioned in related works, there's limited direct evidence of successful implementation in the reviewed papers
- Break condition: If causal relationships cannot be reliably established from observational healthcare data, or if causal models don't provide additional interpretability beyond existing XAI methods

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Bringing humans into the DL loop (domain experts, end-users, policymakers, patients) can democratize XIAI methods
- Mechanism: Collaborative involvement of stakeholders throughout the XIAI development process ensures methods address real-world needs, are evaluated with appropriate metrics, and are designed for practical usability rather than just technical performance
- Core assumption: Stakeholder involvement will lead to more practical and usable XIAI methods that can be adopted in clinical settings
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Bringing 'humans into the DL loop' [83, 84]: domain experts, end-users, policymakers and patients will be able to contribute to the XIAI method design, development and evaluation. This collective approach can potentially lead to the emergence of robust and ready-to-use XIAI methods across different NLP and medical tasks"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - the corpus contains related work on human-AI collaboration but doesn't specifically validate this mechanism in healthcare NLP contexts
- Break condition: If stakeholder involvement slows development without improving practical utility, or if conflicting stakeholder perspectives prevent consensus on XIAI approaches

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Difference between Explainable AI (XAI) and Interpretable AI (IAI)
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly distinguishes these concepts, with IAI focusing on designing inherently interpretable models and XAI providing post-hoc explanations
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the key difference between a model that is interpretable by design versus one that requires explanation after training?

- Concept: Attention mechanisms in deep learning
  - Why needed here: Attention mechanisms are identified as the most prevalent emerging IAI technique and are central to many proposed solutions
  - Quick check question: How do attention mechanisms help models learn long-range interactions, and why is this particularly useful for NLP tasks?

- Concept: Multi-modal learning
  - Why needed here: The paper identifies opportunities for attention mechanisms to enhance multi-modal XIAI for personalized medicine
  - Quick check question: What challenges arise when combining different data types (text, images, genetics) in a single model, and how might attention mechanisms help address these?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: XIAI methods consist of three main paradigms: model-based (external explanation modules like LIME, SHAP, t-SNE), input-based (feature importance and knowledge graphs), and output-based (attention mechanisms). These can be applied to different DL architectures (CNN/RNN
