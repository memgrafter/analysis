# TopoBench: A Framework for Benchmarking Topological Deep Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.06642
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06642
- Reference count: 29
- TopoBenchmarkX is an open-source framework that standardizes benchmarking for topological deep learning (TDL).

## Executive Summary
TopoBenchmarkX introduces a modular, open-source framework designed to standardize benchmarking for topological deep learning. By modularizing the TDL pipeline into data, model, and training modules, the framework enables standardized evaluation and comparison of models across diverse topological domains. Its unique ability to lift graph data to higher-order structures like simplicial and cell complexes supports richer data representations. Benchmarking twelve models on twenty-two datasets across four tasks showed that higher-order neural networks generally outperformed graph neural networks, though GNNs excelled in node regression tasks. Ablation studies revealed that readout strategies and architectural choices are critical to model performance.

## Method Summary
The framework modularizes the TDL pipeline into three main components: data modules (loading, transforming, preprocessing), model modules (neural networks, loss, optimizer, evaluator), and training modules (model, trainer, callbacks, logger). A key innovation is the ability to lift graphs to higher-order topological domains (simplicial complexes, cell complexes), enabling richer data representations and cross-domain comparisons. The modular design allows for flexible experimentation and systematic benchmarking across diverse TDL architectures and datasets.

## Key Results
- Higher-order neural networks (on hypergraphs, simplicial and cell complexes) outperformed graph neural networks on sixteen of the tested datasets.
- Graph neural networks excelled in seven datasets, especially for node regression tasks.
- Ablation studies showed readout strategies and architectural choices significantly impact performance.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's ability to lift graphs to higher-order topological domains allows models to capture more complex relational structures, leading to improved performance on datasets where simple graph representations are insufficient. The modular pipeline design ensures standardized inputs and outputs, facilitating fair and reproducible comparisons across different TDL methods.

## Foundational Learning
- **Topological domains (simplicial, cell complexes):** Allow richer representation of data than simple graphs. Quick check: Can the domain capture multi-way relationships?
- **Model modularization (data, model, training):** Enables flexible experimentation and standardized benchmarking. Quick check: Are all components reusable across tasks?
- **Readout strategies:** Critical for aggregating node-level information to graph-level predictions. Quick check: Does the readout match the task (node vs. graph classification)?
- **Higher-order lifting:** Transforms graphs to capture multi-way interactions. Quick check: Does the lifted domain better represent the dataset's structure?
- **Cross-domain standardization:** Enables fair comparison across different TDL methods. Quick check: Are inputs/outputs consistently formatted?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map:** Data Module -> Model Module -> Training Module
- **Critical path:** Data loading → lifting to higher-order domain → model training → evaluation
- **Design tradeoffs:** Flexibility vs. reproducibility; higher-order lifting vs. computational cost
- **Failure signatures:** Poor performance may stem from inappropriate domain choice, readout strategy, or insufficient data preprocessing
- **First experiments:** 1) Benchmark GNN vs. higher-order model on a simple graph dataset. 2) Vary readout strategies on a node classification task. 3) Lift a graph to a simplicial complex and retrain the model.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation covers only twelve TDL models and twenty-two datasets, which may not represent the full diversity of real-world structures or emerging architectures.
- Performance gains may depend on specific hyperparameters, data preprocessing, and readout strategies not exhaustively controlled.
- Comparative advantages were shown mainly on non-graph domains, leaving open the question of performance when lower-order structures suffice.

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the modular framework design and its ability to lift data to higher-order topological domains.
- **Medium confidence** in the general performance trends favoring higher-order neural networks on complex datasets, given limited model and dataset coverage.
- **Medium confidence** in the importance of readout strategies and architectural choices, as demonstrated in ablation studies but not exhaustively explored.

## Next Checks
1. Benchmark additional TDL architectures and a broader set of real-world datasets, especially those with mixed or evolving topological structures.
2. Conduct ablation studies isolating the effects of readout strategies, optimizer choices, and data preprocessing on model performance.
3. Perform cross-validation to assess the stability and generalizability of reported performance differences across domains.
