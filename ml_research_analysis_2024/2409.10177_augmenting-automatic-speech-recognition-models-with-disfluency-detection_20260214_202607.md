# Augmenting Automatic Speech Recognition Models with Disfluency Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.10177
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10177
- Authors: Robin Amann; Zhaolin Li; Barbara Bruno; Jan Niehues
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: 81.62% accuracy and 80.07% F1-score on disfluency detection

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an inference-only method to augment any CTC-based ASR model with disfluency detection capabilities. The approach modifies the forced alignment algorithm to generate word-level timestamps and identify alignment gaps that may contain disfluent speech or silence. An additional classification model then detects these disfluencies, achieving strong performance metrics. The system demonstrates ability to recover words missed by ASR transcription, showing potential for downstream applications in speech disorder analysis and language proficiency assessment.

## Method Summary
The method employs a modified CTC-based forced alignment algorithm to predict word-level timestamps and capture disfluent speech patterns. During inference, the system processes audio through the ASR model to generate alignments, then identifies gaps between aligned words that may contain disfluencies or silence. A secondary classification model analyzes these gaps to detect disfluent speech. The approach is designed to be model-agnostic, theoretically compatible with any CTC-based ASR architecture without requiring retraining.

## Key Results
- 81.62% accuracy and 80.07% F1-score on disfluency detection task
- Successfully captured 74.13% of words initially missed by ASR transcription
- Pipeline demonstrated potential for analyzing speech disorders and language proficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging the temporal structure of speech through modified forced alignment. By identifying gaps between properly aligned words, the system can isolate regions where disfluencies typically occur. The secondary classifier then focuses specifically on these high-probability regions rather than processing the entire audio stream, making the detection more efficient and targeted.

## Foundational Learning

**Forced Alignment**: Process of mapping speech audio to word sequences with precise timing information. Needed to establish baseline word boundaries and identify gaps where disfluencies might occur. Quick check: Verify alignment accuracy on clean speech before applying disfluency detection.

**CTC-based ASR Models**: Connectionist Temporal Classification enables sequence modeling without requiring pre-segmented training data. Required because the method claims compatibility with any CTC-based architecture. Quick check: Confirm CTC output format matches alignment algorithm expectations.

**Disfluency Types**: Repetitions, corrections, and filled pauses that interrupt speech flow. Essential to understand what patterns the classifier must detect. Quick check: Review labeled dataset to verify coverage of disfluency types.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Audio -> CTC ASR Model -> Modified Forced Alignment -> Gap Detection -> Classification Model -> Disfluency Labels

**Critical Path**: The modified forced alignment step is critical, as it generates the word timestamps that define where disfluencies can occur. Errors here propagate through the entire pipeline.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Model-agnostic design sacrifices optimization for specific ASR architectures. Inference-only approach avoids retraining costs but may miss opportunities for joint optimization.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor alignment quality leads to incorrect gap identification. Classification model may miss disfluencies if gaps are too short or if disfluencies blend with surrounding speech.

**First Experiments**:
1. Test modified forced alignment on clean, well-formed speech to establish baseline performance
2. Evaluate gap detection on speech with known disfluencies to verify isolation capability
3. Run classification model on isolated disfluency segments to test detection accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Validation conducted on single, potentially domain-specific dataset without clear diversity characterization
- Conflates ASR transcription recovery with disfluency detection tasks in performance claims
- No ablation studies across different ASR architectures to verify model-agnostic claims
- Open-set disfluency detection claims questionable given evaluation on scripted corpora
- Computational overhead and real-time feasibility unaddressed

## Confidence

**Major claim clusters confidence:**
- Disfluency detection accuracy: Medium (limited to one dataset)
- ASR transcription recovery: Low (conflation of tasks)
- Model-agnostic applicability: Low (no architectural validation)
- Open-set detection capability: Low (evaluation scope unclear)

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the pipeline across multiple ASR architectures (non-CTC models) and acoustic domains to verify claimed model-agnostic performance
2. Test on truly spontaneous speech data with diverse disfluency types not present in training data to assess open-set capabilities
3. Conduct ablation studies comparing forced alignment modifications against standard approaches to quantify the specific contribution of the proposed changes
