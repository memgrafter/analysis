# Value Internalization: Learning and Generalizing from Social Reward

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.14681
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14681
- Authors: Frieda Rong; Max Kleiman-Weiner
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: ISR models prevent unlearning of socialized behaviors and enable generalization to out-of-distribution tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses how social rewards acquired during development persist and generalize when the social partner is no longer present. The authors introduce value internalization, where a caregiver's social rewards train an internal social reward (ISR) model that generates internal rewards when social rewards are unavailable. The approach enables agents to maintain goal-directed behavior after social feedback is removed and to generalize learned values to new situations. The ISR framework provides a computational model for how humans might internalize social values that guide behavior across diverse contexts without requiring continuous external supervision.

## Method Summary
The method involves training an agent through socialization with a caregiver who provides social rewards. During this phase, an internal social reward (ISR) model learns to predict the caregiver's reward function by observing state-action pairs and corresponding social rewards. Once trained, the ISR model generates internal rewards that approximate the original social feedback, allowing the agent to maintain learned behaviors when the caregiver is absent. The ISR model uses the same neural network architecture as the policy network and is trained to predict rewards given state and action inputs. This creates a self-supervised system where internalized rewards sustain socialized behaviors without requiring ongoing social feedback.

## Key Results
- Agents with ISR models maintain performance when social rewards are removed, while baseline agents unlearn the behavior
- ISR models enable generalization to tasks with more obstacles than seen during socialization
- ISR models show strong correlation between predicted and actual rewards during socialization (0.74-0.99)
- Agents without ISR unlearn within 10 episodes after social rewards are removed, while those with ISR maintain performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: An internal social reward (ISR) model enables agents to maintain goal-directed behavior after social rewards are removed.
- Mechanism: During socialization, the ISR model learns to predict the caregiver's social rewards. When the caregiver is absent, the ISR generates internal rewards that approximate the original social feedback, sustaining the learned behavior.
- Core assumption: The ISR model can generalize its reward predictions to new states and actions encountered after socialization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "social feedback trains an internal social reward (ISR) model that generates internal rewards when social rewards are unavailable"
  - [section] "The ISR model is a deep neural network using the same architecture as the policy network. The network takes in the state and action and predicts reward."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus papers focus on reward modeling and human feedback but do not explicitly discuss internalization mechanisms for maintaining behavior after feedback removal.
- Break condition: If the ISR model fails to generalize reward predictions to new states, the agent will lose the internalized values and revert to baseline behavior.

## Foundational Learning
- Social reward prediction: Why needed - to model how agents learn to anticipate social feedback in different situations. Quick check - test whether the ISR model can accurately predict rewards for state-action pairs not seen during training.
- Value generalization: Why needed - to understand how learned social values transfer to new contexts. Quick check - evaluate performance on tasks with novel obstacle configurations beyond the socialization environment.
- Reward function learning: Why needed - to capture the computational process of inferring reward structures from social feedback. Quick check - measure the correlation between predicted and actual rewards during socialization.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Socialization Phase: Environment/State-Action -> Policy Network -> Behavior -> Caregiver -> Social Reward -> ISR Model
Autonomous Phase: Environment/State-Action -> Policy Network -> ISR Model -> Internal Reward -> Behavior

### Critical Path
The critical path is: State-Action pairs during socialization → ISR model training → Internal reward generation during autonomy → Sustained behavior maintenance. The ISR model must accurately learn the reward function during socialization for the agent to maintain behaviors during autonomy.

### Design Tradeoffs
The paper uses a simple MLP architecture for both policy and ISR models, prioritizing computational efficiency and ease of implementation over potentially more expressive but complex architectures. This choice assumes that the relationship between states, actions, and social rewards can be captured by a relatively simple function approximator.

### Failure Signatures
If the ISR model fails to generalize, agents will unlearn socialized behaviors within 10 episodes after social rewards are removed, performing at baseline levels. Poor reward prediction correlation (below 0.7) during socialization indicates the ISR model is not learning the reward function effectively.

### First 3 Experiments to Run
1. Test ISR model performance on increasingly complex gridworld environments with more obstacles and longer time horizons
2. Evaluate ISR model robustness to noisy or inconsistent social feedback from the caregiver
3. Compare ISR model performance against alternative reward modeling approaches like inverse reinforcement learning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the complexity and structure of social feedback (e.g., praise, correction, demonstration) affect the quality of value internalization compared to simple reward signals?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that human social feedback is richer and often requires computation to interpret correctly, contrasting with the simple reward signals used in the study.
- Why unresolved: The paper uses only direct reward signals for simplicity, but acknowledges that real social feedback is more complex.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical comparisons of ISR performance using different types of social feedback (corrections, demonstrations, language) would show which structures are most effective for value internalization.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the optimal conditions for the transition from socialization to autonomy in value internalization, and how does this affect long-term value stability?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the challenge of determining when a learner is ready for independence, suggesting a framework based on the marginal benefit of improving the ISR versus the cost of additional social feedback.
- Why unresolved: The paper only briefly mentions this as a theoretical framework without empirical testing of different transition conditions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments varying the duration and intensity of socialization, then measuring value stability and performance during autonomous phases, would identify optimal transition conditions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does value internalization scale to more complex environments with higher-dimensional state spaces and longer time horizons?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses simple 5x5 grid navigation tasks, but value internalization's effectiveness in more complex domains is unknown.
- Why unresolved: The experimental environments are deliberately simplified, and the paper does not test generalization to more complex tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing ISR models in environments with larger state spaces, more complex reward structures, and longer time horizons would reveal scalability limitations and potential adaptations needed.

## Limitations
- The ISR model's effectiveness is demonstrated primarily on simple gridworld navigation tasks, with untested performance in more complex, high-dimensional environments
- The framework assumes a single caregiver providing consistent social rewards, not addressing real-world scenarios with multiple social partners and potentially conflicting feedback
- The MLP architecture used for the ISR model may be overly simplistic for capturing nuanced reward functions in more complex environments

## Confidence
**High Confidence**: The ISR model successfully prevents unlearning of socialized behaviors when social rewards are removed; The ISR model enables generalization to tasks with more obstacles than seen during socialization; The correlation between predicted and actual rewards during socialization indicates successful learning of the reward function

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that the ISR model maintains goal-directed behavior after social rewards are removed, as this is demonstrated only in controlled gridworld environments; The assertion that value internalization enables generalization, as the complexity of generalization tasks is limited

**Low Confidence**: The mechanism by which the ISR model generalizes reward predictions to entirely new state-action spaces beyond those encountered during socialization; The ability of the framework to handle multiple caregivers with potentially conflicting reward signals

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-task transfer validation**: Test the ISR model on entirely different task domains (e.g., robotic manipulation, language-based tasks) to evaluate whether value internalization generalizes beyond the navigation tasks used in the paper.

2. **Temporal generalization test**: Evaluate ISR model performance on tasks requiring long-term planning and credit assignment over extended time horizons (100+ steps) to test whether internalized rewards remain effective over longer temporal scales.

3. **Multi-caregiver stress test**: Implement scenarios with multiple caregivers providing inconsistent or conflicting social rewards to test whether the ISR model can handle real-world complexity in social feedback and still produce coherent internalized reward signals.
