# Enterprise Benchmarks for Large Language Model Evaluation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.12857
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12857
- Reference count: 34
- Key outcome: Presents systematic framework for evaluating LLMs on enterprise-specific tasks using 25 curated datasets across finance, legal, climate/sustainability, and cybersecurity domains

## Executive Summary
This work introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing large language models (LLMs) in enterprise contexts by curating and adapting 25 publicly available datasets across four key business domains. The framework extends Stanford's HELM evaluation harness with domain-specific benchmarks and task-specific prompts, enabling practitioners to systematically assess LLM performance for specialized enterprise applications. Through extensive experimentation on 13 widely used LLMs, the authors demonstrate significant performance variation across models and tasks, underscoring the critical importance of selecting appropriate models based on specific enterprise requirements.

## Method Summary
The authors systematically curated 25 publicly available datasets from finance, legal, climate and sustainability, and cybersecurity domains, adapting them for LLM evaluation. They extended Stanford's HELM evaluation harness to incorporate domain-specific benchmarks and developed task-specific prompts for each evaluation scenario. The framework was then used to test 13 widely deployed LLMs across all tasks, measuring performance variation and identifying strengths and weaknesses in different enterprise contexts. The entire framework, including prompts and evaluation methodologies, was open-sourced to facilitate broader adoption and enable other practitioners to conduct similar assessments.

## Key Results
- Model performance varies significantly across tasks and domains, with no single model excelling at all enterprise-specific challenges
- Granite.13b.instruct.v2 and Llama2.70b.chat demonstrate superior performance in legal classification and question answering tasks
- Flan-ul2 and Llama2.70b show strong performance in climate and cybersecurity evaluation tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its systematic approach to domain-specific evaluation, combining carefully curated datasets with task-specific prompts that reflect real enterprise scenarios. By extending an established evaluation harness (HELM) and focusing on practical business applications, the framework provides meaningful insights into how different models perform in specialized contexts. The use of publicly available datasets ensures reproducibility while the domain-specific adaptation ensures relevance to enterprise use cases.

## Foundational Learning
- Domain-specific dataset curation - Needed because general benchmarks don't capture enterprise requirements; quick check: dataset coverage across all four business domains
- Task-specific prompt engineering - Required for consistent evaluation across models; quick check: prompt effectiveness across different model architectures
- HELM evaluation harness extension - Essential for standardized measurement; quick check: framework compatibility with new evaluation tasks

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Dataset curation -> Prompt adaptation -> HELM harness extension -> LLM testing -> Performance analysis
Critical path: Dataset selection → Prompt development → Model evaluation → Results aggregation
Design tradeoffs: Broad dataset coverage vs. depth of domain expertise; Standardized prompts vs. task-specific optimization
Failure signatures: Model performance degradation on specialized tasks; Inconsistent results across similar domains
First experiments: 1) Test framework on additional enterprise datasets, 2) Evaluate multilingual model performance, 3) Assess impact of prompt optimization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance variation may be influenced by specific prompts that weren't extensively validated across all models
- Selection of 25 datasets may not comprehensively represent all enterprise scenarios, limiting generalizability
- Evaluation focuses exclusively on English-language tasks, potentially missing multilingual enterprise requirements

## Confidence
- High: Systematic framework design and dataset curation methodology
- High: Experimental methodology and results showing model performance variation
- Medium: Generalizability of findings to all enterprise contexts
- Medium: Optimal model selection recommendations

## Next Checks
1. Conduct prompt optimization experiments to assess impact of different prompt formulations on model performance across all tasks
2. Expand evaluation to include multilingual datasets and non-English speaking enterprise contexts
3. Validate framework effectiveness by applying to additional enterprise-specific datasets not included in original curation
