# Towards Personalized Evaluation of Large Language Models with An Anonymous Crowd-Sourcing Platform

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.08305
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08305
- Reference count: 13
- Primary result: Introduces BingJian, an anonymous crowdsourcing platform for personalized LLM evaluation that addresses limitations of existing benchmarking methods

## Executive Summary
This paper presents BingJian, an anonymous crowd-sourcing platform designed to evaluate large language models through personalized human-computer interaction. The platform addresses the limitations of traditional benchmarking by enabling users to anonymously compare model responses and select the better answer, while collecting demographic data to analyze how different user groups perceive model performance. By employing a competitive ELO rating system and supporting both centralized and decentralized evaluation modes, BingJian provides a more nuanced understanding of LLM capabilities across diverse user backgrounds and preferences.

## Method Summary
The BingJian platform collects user profiles including age, gender, profession, and education, then presents users with questions to which multiple models have provided responses. Users compare two model responses side-by-side without knowing which model generated which response, selecting the better answer and providing a rating on a 1-5 scale. The platform uses an ELO rating system to dynamically update model scores based on these pairwise comparisons. It supports both centralized evaluation using curated question banks and decentralized evaluation through user-submitted questions, while incorporating personalized evaluation scenarios that account for individual user characteristics to reveal how model performance varies across different demographic groups.

## Key Results
- Introduces a competitive scoring mechanism where users rank model responses anonymously
- Implements personalized evaluation scenarios leveraging user demographic information
- Employs ELO rating system to dynamically adjust model scores based on user selections
- Supports both centralized (curated questions) and decentralized (user-submitted questions) evaluation modes
- Enables comprehensive assessment of model capabilities including generative and discriminative abilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Anonymous head-to-head ranking of model outputs produces more reliable performance signals than traditional benchmarking.
- **Mechanism:** Users compare two model responses to the same question without knowing which model generated which response. This double-blind comparison reduces brand bias and encourages honest evaluation based on content quality.
- **Core assumption:** Users can reliably distinguish between better and worse responses when presented side-by-side, and their collective judgments approximate objective quality.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "BingJian employs a competitive scoring mechanism where users participate in ranking models based on their performance"
  - [section] "responses from different models are presented to users, who then are encouraged to select the most appropriate answer"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no corpus papers directly support the effectiveness of anonymous pairwise comparison for LLM evaluation
- **Break condition:** If user preferences are highly heterogeneous or influenced by factors unrelated to response quality (such as response length or formatting), the collective ranking may not reflect true model capabilities.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Personalized evaluation scenarios reveal model performance variations across different user demographics.
- **Mechanism:** The platform collects user profile information (age, gender, profession, education) and analyzes how these characteristics correlate with evaluation patterns. This enables identification of which models perform better for specific user segments.
- **Core assumption:** User demographic characteristics influence preferences for response styles and content, creating meaningful patterns in evaluation data.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Furthermore, our platform introduces personalized evaluation scenarios, leveraging various forms of human-computer interaction to assess large language models in a manner that accounts for individual user preferences and contexts"
  - [section] "we aim to delve into this personal data to uncover the cognitive relationships between humans and LLMs"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no corpus papers provide direct evidence for demographic-based evaluation preferences in LLM assessment
- **Break condition:** If demographic characteristics show no meaningful correlation with evaluation patterns, or if the personalization analysis reveals only noise rather than actionable insights.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** The ELO rating system provides a dynamic, competitive scoring mechanism that fairly ranks models based on user comparisons.
- **Mechanism:** Models start with initial ELO ratings. When users select between two model responses, the winner gains points and the loser loses points based on the expected outcome calculated from their current ratings. This creates a continuous adjustment of model rankings.
- **Core assumption:** Model performance can be represented as a single scalar value that changes based on pairwise comparisons, and the ELO formula appropriately models the probability of one model outperforming another.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "To ensure a fair evaluation of model capabilities, BingJian employs an ELO rating system [8] that adjusts model scores based on user selections"
  - [section] "we initialize models with ELO ratings, in which winners gain ELO points while losers lose points, ensuring a continuous adjustment of model rankings based on relative model performance"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no corpus papers validate ELO systems specifically for LLM evaluation, though they exist for chess and educational systems
- **Break condition:** If model performance varies significantly across different question types or contexts, a single ELO rating may not adequately capture the multidimensional nature of LLM capabilities.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Crowdsourcing evaluation methodology
  - **Why needed here:** The platform relies on collecting evaluation data from many users to build a comprehensive assessment of LLM capabilities across diverse perspectives
  - **Quick check question:** What are the key differences between centralized benchmarking and crowdsourced evaluation, and what are the trade-offs of each approach?

- **Concept:** ELO rating system mathematics
  - **Why needed here:** The platform uses ELO ratings to dynamically rank models based on user comparisons, requiring understanding of the underlying formula and its properties
  - **Quick check question:** Given two models with ELO ratings of 1200 and 1400, what is the expected probability that the higher-rated model wins a comparison?

- **Concept:** Personalized recommendation systems
  - **Why needed here:** The platform includes a question recommendation system that suggests questions based on user history to improve engagement and evaluation coverage
  - **Quick check question:** What are the key components of a recommendation system, and how would you evaluate its effectiveness in the context of LLM evaluation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** User authentication and profile management → Question database and recommendation engine → Model invocation service → Comparison interface → ELO rating calculation → Data analysis and visualization → Personalized insights generation
- **Critical path:** User submits question → Platform invokes two models → Platform displays responses anonymously → User selects preferred response → ELO rating updates → Data stored for analysis
- **Design tradeoffs:** Centralized question bank provides consistency but risks data leakage; decentralized question submission enables broader evaluation but introduces quality control challenges; anonymous comparisons reduce bias but prevent detailed per-model analysis
- **Failure signatures:** Inconsistent ELO ratings across similar questions may indicate model performance instability; demographic analysis showing no patterns may suggest insufficient data or ineffective personalization; low user engagement may indicate poor user experience or lack of clear value proposition
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Deploy with a small set of pre-vetted questions and two models to validate the basic comparison interface and ELO calculation
  2. Add user profile collection and test the personalization correlation analysis with simulated demographic groups
  3. Implement the decentralized question submission feature and test with a closed user group to validate quality control mechanisms

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the BingJian platform be adapted to evaluate models for languages other than English, particularly those with complex scripts or limited training data?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on English language models and does not discuss multilingual evaluation or the challenges of evaluating models for less-resourced languages.
- Why unresolved: The platform's effectiveness for languages with different linguistic structures, limited data availability, or complex scripts remains unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing the platform for a diverse set of languages, including those with limited resources, and comparing evaluation results across languages to assess the platform's adaptability and identify potential challenges.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the BingJian platform be extended to evaluate the ethical implications of large language models, such as bias, fairness, and potential for misuse?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] While the paper focuses on evaluating model capabilities, it does not explicitly address ethical considerations or provide mechanisms to assess bias, fairness, or potential misuse of LLMs.
- Why unresolved: The platform's current design does not incorporate ethical evaluation metrics or safeguards against biased or harmful outputs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Integrating ethical evaluation metrics into the platform, such as bias detection algorithms or fairness assessments, and analyzing model outputs for potential ethical concerns to ensure responsible AI development.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the BingJian platform be used to evaluate the long-term societal impact of large language models, considering factors such as job displacement, information manipulation, and shifts in human-AI interaction?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on evaluating model capabilities but does not address the broader societal implications of LLM deployment.
- Why unresolved: The platform's current design does not incorporate mechanisms to assess the long-term societal consequences of LLM adoption.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting longitudinal studies using the platform to track societal changes resulting from LLM deployment, analyzing job market trends, information ecosystem shifts, and evolving human-AI interaction patterns to understand the broader impact of LLMs.

## Limitations

- The effectiveness of anonymous pairwise comparison for reliably measuring LLM quality lacks empirical validation
- Claims about demographic personalization revealing meaningful patterns in model performance lack supporting evidence
- The application of ELO ratings to LLM evaluation may not adequately capture the multidimensional nature of model capabilities

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The basic crowdsourcing methodology and comparison interface can be implemented as described
- **Medium confidence**: The competitive scoring mechanism using ELO ratings is technically feasible but its effectiveness for LLM evaluation requires validation
- **Low confidence**: The claims about personalized evaluation revealing meaningful patterns in model performance across user demographics lack supporting evidence

## Next Checks

1. **Validate ELO system effectiveness**: Conduct a controlled experiment comparing model rankings from ELO-based scoring against rankings from established benchmarks to assess whether the crowdsourcing approach produces consistent results
2. **Test demographic correlation significance**: Analyze evaluation data to determine whether user demographic characteristics show statistically significant correlations with model preferences, or whether observed patterns are merely noise
3. **Assess comparison reliability**: Implement inter-rater reliability measures and test whether pairwise comparisons produce consistent rankings when the same comparisons are repeated with different user groups
