# Algorithmic Drift: A Simulation Framework to Study the Effects of Recommender Systems on User Preferences

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.16478
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16478
- Reference count: 6
- Primary result: Simulation framework effectively detects algorithmic drift in recommender systems under varying user behaviors

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a simulation framework for studying how recommender systems affect user preferences over time, a phenomenon termed "algorithmic drift." The framework models user-recommender interactions using behavioral parameters: resistance (tendency to pick items outside recommendations), inertia (tendency to follow recommendations), and randomness (external influences). It simulates T interaction steps across B independent trials, building probabilistic user-item graphs that capture drift tendencies. Two novel metrics—Algorithmic Drift Score (ADS) and Delta Target Consumption (DTC)—quantify preference shifts toward target categories (e.g., harmful content). Experiments on synthetic datasets with collaborative filtering (RecVAE) show the framework effectively detects drift under varying user behaviors and population compositions, validating its utility for controlled evaluation of recommendation algorithms before deployment.

## Method Summary
The simulation framework generates synthetic user-item interaction data using Dirichlet distributions with power-law parameters, creating datasets with specified user categories (non-radicalized, semi-radicalized, radicalized) and item categories (harmful/neutral). The RecVAE collaborative filtering model is trained for 100 epochs using Recbole library with 80/10/10 train/validation/test splits. The simulation runs T=100 interaction steps across B=50 trials, where users interact with recommendations based on behavioral parameters (resistance γ, inertia δ, randomness η). At each step, the recommender updates based on new interactions, creating a feedback loop. ADS and DTC metrics are calculated to quantify drift toward target categories across different user population compositions.

## Key Results
- Framework successfully detects algorithmic drift under varying resistance (γ∈{0.0,0.05,0.1}), inertia (δ∈{0.5,0.75,1.0}), and randomness (η∈{0.01,0.03,0.05,0.1}) parameters
- ADS and DTC metrics effectively quantify preference shifts toward target categories across user categories
- Population composition significantly affects drift magnitude, with semi-radicalized users showing highest drift toward harmful content

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The simulation framework effectively models algorithmic drift by capturing the feedback loop between user choices and recommender system updates.
- Mechanism: At each simulation step, the user's choice is influenced by both the recommender's suggestions and their own resistance/inertia parameters, while the recommender updates based on the new interaction history. This creates a closed-loop system where preferences can evolve over time.
- Core assumption: The feedback loop between user behavior and recommender system updates is the primary driver of preference drift.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The framework models user-recommender interactions using behavioral parameters: resistance (tendency to pick items outside recommendations), inertia (tendency to follow recommendations), and randomness (external influences)."
  - [section] "An important aspect of our formulation consists in accounting for the 'feedback loop' effect described in the literature [Chaney et al., 2018], where user choices are influenced by the recommendations provided, and the algorithm relies on the user's past interactions rather than aligning with their true interests."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - The corpus contains related papers on simulation frameworks but lacks direct evidence about feedback loops in this specific framework.
- Break condition: If the feedback loop is not properly implemented or if user preferences do not evolve over time, the framework will fail to capture algorithmic drift.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The framework can detect and quantify algorithmic drift under varying user behaviors and population compositions.
- Mechanism: By simulating different scenarios with varying resistance, inertia, and randomness parameters, as well as different population compositions, the framework can measure how these factors affect the extent of algorithmic drift.
- Core assumption: Different user behaviors and population compositions will lead to different levels of algorithmic drift.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Experiments on synthetic datasets with collaborative filtering (RecVAE) show the framework effectively detects drift under varying user behaviors and population compositions, validating its utility for controlled evaluation of recommendation algorithms before deployment."
  - [section] "Following from these assumptions, we introduce the concept of 'algorithmic drift', in order to characterize how the recommendation algorithm contributes in changing user leanings."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - The corpus contains related papers on simulation frameworks but lacks direct evidence about varying user behaviors and population compositions in this specific framework.
- Break condition: If the framework cannot accurately measure drift under different scenarios, it will fail to validate its utility for controlled evaluation.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The proposed metrics (ADS and DTC) effectively quantify the extent of algorithmic drift.
- Mechanism: ADS measures the tendency of users to follow pathways of items belonging to a target category, while DTC quantifies the change in user consumption of a target category before and after interacting with recommendations.
- Core assumption: The metrics accurately capture the deviation of user preferences towards target categories over time.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Additionally, we introduce two novel metrics for quantifying the algorithm's impact on user preferences, specifically in terms of drift over time."
  - [section] "To quantify the extent of this phenomenon induced by the recommender system, we define the Algorithmic Drift Score (ADS) over the probabilistic graph Gu of a user u."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - The corpus contains related papers on metrics but lacks direct evidence about ADS and DTC in this specific framework.
- Break condition: If the metrics do not accurately measure drift or if they are not sensitive to changes in user preferences, the framework will fail to quantify algorithmic drift effectively.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Feedback loops in recommender systems
  - Why needed here: Understanding how user choices and recommender system updates influence each other is crucial for modeling algorithmic drift.
  - Quick check question: How does the feedback loop between user behavior and recommender system updates contribute to algorithmic drift?

- Concept: Behavioral parameters (resistance, inertia, randomness)
  - Why needed here: These parameters determine how users interact with recommendations and influence the extent of algorithmic drift.
  - Quick check question: How do resistance, inertia, and randomness parameters affect user choices and the resulting algorithmic drift?

- Concept: Metrics for quantifying drift (ADS and DTC)

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  User model (behavioral parameters) -> RecVAE recommender -> Simulation framework (T steps, B trials) -> ADS/DTC metrics -> Results analysis

- Critical path:
  1. Initialize user-item interactions and behavioral parameters
  2. Train recommender system on initial data
  3. Simulate user-recommender interactions over multiple steps and trials
  4. Update user-item interactions and recommender system based on simulated choices
  5. Calculate ADS and DTC metrics for each user
  6. Aggregate results and analyze drift across different scenarios

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Computational complexity vs. simulation accuracy: Increasing the number of steps and trials improves accuracy but also increases computation time.
  - Synthetic data vs. real-world data: Synthetic data allows for controlled experiments but may not fully capture real-world complexities.
  - Metric granularity vs. interpretability: More detailed metrics may provide better insights but can be harder to interpret.

- Failure signatures:
  - Lack of drift detection: If the framework fails to detect drift under scenarios where it should occur, there may be issues with the feedback loop implementation or metric calculations.
  - Inconsistent results: If results vary significantly across multiple runs of the same scenario, there may be issues with the simulation's stochastic elements or data generation process.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline scenario: Simulate a scenario with low resistance, high inertia, and no randomness to establish a baseline for algorithmic drift.
  2. Varying resistance: Simulate scenarios with different resistance levels to understand how user hesitancy affects drift.
  3. Population composition: Simulate scenarios with different proportions of non-radicalized, semi-radicalized, and radicalized users to analyze how population makeup influences drift.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would the simulation framework perform when extended to dynamic item catalogs where new items are continuously introduced during the simulation?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper assumes a fixed item catalog, but mentions this as a potential future extension direction.
- Why unresolved: The current framework and metrics are validated only on static datasets, leaving the effectiveness in dynamic environments untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Running the framework on datasets with time-varying item sets and comparing drift detection accuracy before and after extension.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent do contextual factors (e.g., time of day, user location) influence the algorithmic drift observed in the simulation?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper does not account for contextualization in its user model, though it suggests this as a future research direction.
- Why unresolved: The current model treats all interactions uniformly without considering situational contexts that may affect user choices.
- What evidence would resolve it: Incorporating contextual features into the simulation and measuring changes in ADS and DTC across different contexts.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the framework perform when applied to ideological axes other than harmful/neutral content, such as political spectrum or cultural preferences?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest adapting the methodology to study other recommendation system weaknesses like diversity and serendipity, and mention ideological axes as a potential extension.
- Why unresolved: Experiments are limited to a binary harmful/neutral categorization, leaving performance on multi-dimensional ideological spaces unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the framework to datasets with multi-dimensional item categorization and comparing drift patterns across different axes.

## Limitations

- The framework relies on synthetic data generation, which may not fully capture real-world complexity of user preferences and recommendation dynamics
- While experiments show effectiveness on synthetic datasets, validation on real-world data remains limited
- The behavioral parameters (resistance, inertia, randomness) are simplified abstractions that may not fully represent actual user behavior

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The core mechanism of modeling feedback loops between user choices and recommender updates is well-established
- Medium Confidence: The simulation framework's ability to detect drift under varying conditions is demonstrated but requires further validation on real-world datasets
- Medium Confidence: The proposed metrics (ADS and DTC) show promise but their sensitivity and specificity need further testing across diverse scenarios

## Next Checks

1. **Real-world validation**: Test the framework on actual user interaction data from deployed recommender systems to verify synthetic results hold in practice
2. **Parameter sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary behavioral parameters across wider ranges to understand threshold effects and non-linear relationships
3. **Cross-metric comparison**: Compare ADS and DTC metrics against alternative drift detection methods to validate their effectiveness and identify potential blind spots
