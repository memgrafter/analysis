# Prospector Heads: Generalized Feature Attribution for Large Models & Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.11729
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11729
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Novel feature attribution method for large models and high-dimensional data

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces prospector heads, a novel feature attribution method designed for large models and high-dimensional data. The approach equips any encoder with a two-layer module that learns class-specific patterns in token embeddings, enabling interpretable visualizations of attribution across diverse data types including sequences, images, and graphs. The method demonstrates significant improvements over baseline attribution methods, achieving up to 26.3 points higher mean localization AUPRC, while maintaining robustness to coarse supervision.

## Method Summary
Prospector heads is a modular feature attribution framework that adds a two-layer module to any encoder (including foundation models). Layer I quantizes token embeddings into spatially resolved concepts, while Layer II applies graph convolution over concept frequencies to generate attribution scores. This design enables the method to capture class-specific patterns across diverse data modalities - text, images (pathology), and graphs (protein structures). The approach is evaluated across these domains, demonstrating superior performance compared to standard baselines and robustness when trained with coarse supervision rather than pixel-level labels.

## Key Results
- Outperforms baselines by up to 26.3 points in mean localization AUPRC
- Demonstrates robust performance with coarse supervision instead of requiring detailed labels
- Enables interpretable visualizations of class-specific patterns across text, pathology images, and protein structure graphs
- Successfully adapts foundation models for attribution tasks in biomedical domains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by creating a bridge between high-dimensional embeddings and interpretable attributions through a two-stage process. First, Layer I clusters embeddings into concepts that capture meaningful patterns in the data. Then Layer II aggregates these concepts using graph convolution, which naturally handles the spatial relationships inherent in the data. This approach allows the model to learn class-specific attribution patterns that generalize across different data modalities while maintaining spatial coherence in the resulting visualizations.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Feature Attribution Methods** - Why needed: To understand which input features most influence model predictions; Quick check: Can identify relevant regions in input data
2. **Graph Convolution Networks** - Why needed: To aggregate information from spatially related concepts; Quick check: Maintains local structure while enabling global pattern recognition
3. **Token Embeddings** - Why needed: High-dimensional representations capturing semantic information; Quick check: Can be clustered into meaningful concepts
4. **Concept Quantization** - Why needed: To reduce dimensionality while preserving interpretability; Quick check: Creates discrete, meaningful patterns from continuous embeddings
5. **Spatial Resolution** - Why needed: To maintain location information for attribution; Quick check: Attribution maps align with input features
6. **Coarse Supervision** - Why needed: To enable training with limited fine-grained labels; Quick check: Performance degrades gracefully with label coarseness

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Encoder -> Layer I (Quantization) -> Layer II (Graph Convolution) -> Attribution Scores

**Critical Path:** Input embeddings → Concept clustering → Graph-based aggregation → Attribution visualization

**Design Tradeoffs:** The two-layer design balances expressiveness (capturing complex patterns) with interpretability (maintaining spatial coherence), while the modular approach allows adaptation to different encoder types without retraining the base model.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor concept clustering leading to noisy attributions, graph convolution failing to capture spatial relationships, or mismatch between learned concepts and true class-specific patterns.

**First Experiments:**
1. Test concept clustering quality on a simple text dataset with known keywords
2. Validate graph convolution preserves spatial relationships on synthetic image data
3. Compare attribution quality between fine and coarse supervision on a small pathology dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited comparison to newer attribution methods beyond standard baselines
- Coarse supervision evaluation only tested in a single experimental setup
- No quantitative user studies validating improved trust or decision-making
- Shallow evaluation of graph applications compared to text and image domains

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Core method functionality | High |
| Superiority over baselines | Medium |
| Interpretability enables trust | Medium |
| Generalization to new data types | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies comparing full prospector heads against versions without graph convolution (Layer II) or with alternative quantization approaches (Layer I) to isolate key contributors to performance gains
2. Extend evaluation to additional data types (e.g., time series, point clouds) and compare against recent attribution methods like Integrated Gradients with varying baseline choices
3. Perform expert user studies in at least one scientific domain (e.g., pathology) to validate whether the visualizations actually improve decision-making and trust compared to standard attribution methods
