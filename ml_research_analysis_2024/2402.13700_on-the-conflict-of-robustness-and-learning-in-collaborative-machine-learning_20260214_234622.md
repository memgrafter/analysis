# On the Conflict of Robustness and Learning in Collaborative Machine Learning
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.13700
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13700
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Current robust aggregators in collaborative ML fail to provide robustness against strategic adversaries, showing a fundamental conflict between robustness and learning.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the effectiveness of robust aggregators in collaborative machine learning (CML) against strategic adversaries. The authors analyze two main types of robust aggregators—distance-based and behavior-based—and demonstrate their limitations in providing robustness without compromising learning. The study concludes that robustness and learning are fundamentally at odds in CML, as existing aggregators cannot guarantee robustness without preventing learning.

## Method Summary
The authors study the effectiveness of robust aggregators in collaborative ML by analyzing two main types: distance-based and behavior-based aggregators. They demonstrate that distance-based aggregators are ineffective against strategic adversaries who can craft updates that appear benign by staying close to a reference point. Behavior-based aggregators are only effective if the local data of participants is representative of the entire dataset, limiting the benefits of collaboration. Empirical results on MNIST and real-world applications (health and autonomous driving) support these findings.

## Key Results
- Distance-based aggregators fail to provide robustness because adversaries can craft updates that appear benign by staying close to a reference point.
- Behavior-based aggregators are only effective if the local data of participants is representative of the entire dataset, limiting the benefits of collaboration.
- Robustness and learning are fundamentally at odds in CML, and existing aggregators cannot guarantee robustness without preventing learning.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper's analysis reveals that robust aggregators in CML are ineffective against strategic adversaries due to the inherent conflict between robustness and learning. Distance-based aggregators rely on metrics like L2-distance, which can be manipulated by adversaries who craft updates that appear benign. Behavior-based aggregators evaluate updates based on their impact on model behavior, but their effectiveness is limited by the assumption of representative local data. This fundamental conflict arises because achieving robustness often requires sacrificing the ability to learn from diverse and non-representative data.

## Foundational Learning
- **Collaborative Machine Learning (CML):** A framework where multiple participants contribute to training a shared model. Understanding CML is essential for analyzing the impact of robust aggregators on learning and robustness.
- **Robust Aggregators:** Mechanisms designed to combine model updates while mitigating the influence of malicious participants. Their effectiveness is critical for ensuring the integrity of the learning process.
- **Strategic Adversaries:** Participants who craft updates to manipulate the learning process while appearing benign. Analyzing their behavior is key to understanding the limitations of robust aggregators.
- **Distance-based Metrics:** Measures like L2-distance used to evaluate the similarity of updates. These metrics can be exploited by adversaries to craft deceptive updates.
- **Behavior-based Evaluation:** Assessing updates based on their impact on model behavior. This approach is effective only when local data is representative of the entire dataset.
- **Representative Data:** The assumption that local data of participants reflects the overall dataset. This assumption is crucial for the effectiveness of behavior-based aggregators.

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map:** CML Framework -> Robust Aggregators -> Model Updates -> Training Process
- **Critical Path:** Data Collection -> Model Updates -> Robust Aggregation -> Model Training -> Evaluation
- **Design Tradeoffs:** Distance-based aggregators are simple but vulnerable to strategic adversaries; behavior-based aggregators are more robust but require representative data.
- **Failure Signatures:** Ineffective robustness, compromised learning, and inability to handle strategic adversaries.
- **First Experiments:** 1) Test distance-based aggregators against strategic adversaries. 2) Evaluate behavior-based aggregators with non-representative data. 3) Analyze the impact of partial adversarial participation on robust aggregators.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The assumption that all participants can be malicious simultaneously may not reflect real-world scenarios.
- The study focuses on specific aggregator types but does not exhaustively explore all possible robust aggregation mechanisms.
- The effectiveness of behavior-based aggregators heavily depends on the assumption of representative local data, which may not hold in highly heterogeneous datasets.

## Confidence
- High: The empirical results demonstrating the ineffectiveness of distance-based aggregators against strategic adversaries are well-supported.
- Medium: The claim that behavior-based aggregators only work with representative data is reasonable but may not account for all scenarios.
- Medium: The conclusion about the fundamental conflict between robustness and learning is thought-provoking but may benefit from broader exploration of aggregation techniques.

## Next Checks
1. Test the proposed attack strategies against a wider range of robust aggregators, including median-based and trimmed mean approaches, to validate the generality of the findings.
2. Investigate the impact of partial adversarial participation (i.e., only a subset of participants are malicious) on the effectiveness of existing robust aggregators.
3. Explore hybrid aggregation mechanisms that combine distance-based and behavior-based approaches to determine if they can achieve both robustness and learning in CML.
