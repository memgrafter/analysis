# High-Quality Data Augmentation for Low-Resource NMT: Combining a Translation Memory, a GAN Generator, and Filtering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.12079
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12079
- Reference count: 26
- Key result: BLEU score of 40.1, surpassing baseline by 2.9 points

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of improving low-resource neural machine translation (NMT) by leveraging monolingual corpora from the source side, which is typically high-resource, rather than relying solely on the target-side monolingual data. The proposed method integrates a Translation Memory (TM) with a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to enhance the NMT model's performance. The GAN structure is used to augment training data for the discriminator while mitigating the interference of low-quality synthetic translations with the generator. Additionally, a novel filtering procedure ensures the high quality of the synthetic sentence pairs during the augmentation process. The approach achieves significant improvements in translation quality, with a BLEU score of 40.1, surpassing the baseline by 2.9 points, and demonstrating the effectiveness of the method in low-resource settings.

## Method Summary
The method combines three key components: a Translation Memory (TM) for retrieval-based data augmentation, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for leveraging source-side monolingual data, and a high-quality filtering procedure. The TM integration retrieves semantically similar sentence pairs based on Euclidean distance in embedding space and concatenates them with the source input. The GAN architecture consists of a Transformer generator and a custom discriminator (CNN+BiLSTM) that enables effective use of source monolingual corpora without degrading translation quality. The filtering procedure uses length and perplexity ratios to ensure synthetic data resembles natural parallel corpora, keeping pairs within mean ± standard deviation of natural data statistics.

## Key Results
- BLEU score of 40.1, surpassing baseline by 2.9 points
- TM integration alone improves BLEU by 1.4 points
- Filtering based on length and perplexity ratios yields optimal performance
- GAN enables source-side monolingual use without quality degradation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The GAN architecture enables effective use of source-side monolingual corpora without degrading translation quality.
- Mechanism: The generator produces synthetic target sentences from source monolingual data, while the discriminator learns to distinguish real from synthetic pairs. This adversarial training allows the generator to improve without the synthetic data directly corrupting the translation model.
- Core assumption: The discriminator's feedback helps the generator produce more natural translations, and the GAN structure can stabilize NMT training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We realize this concept by employing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which augments the training data for the discriminator while mitigating the interference of low-quality synthetic monolingual translations with the generator."
  - [section 2.2]: "The discriminator helps improve the performance of the generator. Thus, we achieve the goal of using monolingual corpora on the source side to improve the model's translation ability without negatively impacting the translation model."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct citation of GAN performance studies, but the paper cites related GAN+NMT work [21, 24, 25].
- Break condition: If GAN training becomes unstable or the discriminator overpowers the generator, the synthetic data quality degrades and translation performance suffers.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Translation Memory integration provides high-quality retrieval-based data augmentation that acts as model prompting.
- Mechanism: The system retrieves semantically similar sentence pairs from TM based on Euclidean distance in embedding space, then concatenates them with the source input. This provides additional context and translation examples during training.
- Core assumption: Sentences with small Euclidean distance in embedding space are semantically similar enough to provide useful translation guidance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Additionally, this paper integrates Translation Memory (TM) with NMT, increasing the amount of data available to the generator."
  - [section 2.1]: "We employ the retrieval method to find sentences st in the TM that are semantically similar to the source input s... The sentence pairs (st, tt) with a distance below this threshold will be concatenated with s."
  - [section 4.1]: "We first integrated TM into the input of the model. The results surpassed the baseline by 1.4 BLEU points."
- Break condition: If the TM contains too few similar sentences or the threshold is poorly calibrated, the augmentation becomes noisy or ineffective.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: High-quality filtering based on length and perplexity ratios ensures synthetic data resembles natural parallel corpora.
- Mechanism: The system filters synthetic sentence pairs using criteria derived from natural parallel corpus statistics - specifically, keeping pairs where length ratio and perplexity ratio fall within mean ± standard deviation of natural data.
- Core assumption: Natural parallel corpora exhibit stable distributions for length and perplexity ratios that synthetic data should match to be considered high-quality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Moreover, we propose a novel procedure to filter the synthetic sentence pairs during the augmentation process, ensuring the high quality of the data."
  - [section 2.3]: "We use the interval [mean - standard deviation; mean + standard deviation] of the ratio of these two features (length and perplexity) in a natural parallel corpus as the filtering criterion for high quality."
  - [section 4.2]: "Using both length and perplexity ratios as the filtering criterion yields the best performance, surpassing the baseline by 2.9 BLEU points."
- Break condition: If the filtering criteria are too strict or too loose, either too few synthetic pairs remain or low-quality pairs contaminate the training data.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: GAN training dynamics and minimax optimization
  - Why needed here: Understanding how the generator-discriminator game works is essential for debugging training instability and weight balancing
  - Quick check question: What happens to the generator's loss when the discriminator becomes too strong?

- Concept: Sentence embedding similarity and retrieval
  - Why needed here: The TM integration relies on finding semantically similar sentences using embedding distances
  - Quick check question: Why might Euclidean distance be preferred over cosine similarity for this retrieval task?

- Concept: N-gram language modeling and perplexity
  - Why needed here: Perplexity is used as a quality metric for filtering synthetic translations
  - Quick check question: How does sentence perplexity relate to translation quality in this context?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Source monolingual corpus → TM retrieval → Generator input
  - Generator (Transformer) → Synthetic target sentences
  - Discriminator (CNN+BiLSTM) → Real vs. synthetic classification
  - Filtering system (length/perplexity ratios) → Quality control
  - Augmented bilingual corpus → Final NMT training

- Critical path:
  1. Source monolingual corpus → TM retrieval → Generator input
  2. Generator produces synthetic target sentences
  3. Discriminator trains on real vs. synthetic pairs
  4. Filtered synthetic pairs augment bilingual corpus
  5. Final NMT model trained on augmented data

- Design tradeoffs:
  - GAN vs. standard back-translation: GAN allows source-side monolingual use but introduces training instability
  - Filtering strictness: Stricter filtering improves quality but reduces data quantity
  - TM threshold: Lower thresholds increase retrieval but may introduce noise

- Failure signatures:
  - Generator collapse: Discriminator consistently outputs near-zero confidence
  - Poor filtering: BLEU scores drop after augmentation despite high filtering rates
  - Retrieval failure: TM returns no sentences for common inputs

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train baseline Transformer, then add TM integration only - measure BLEU improvement
  2. Train GAN with TM, measure generator quality and discriminator accuracy
  3. Apply filtering with different thresholds, measure trade-off between quantity and quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal threshold for the Euclidean distance in the Translation Memory (TM) retrieval process, and how does it affect translation quality?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions setting the threshold to 0.5 but does not explore different threshold values or their impact on translation quality.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not experiment with varying the threshold to determine its optimal value or analyze how different thresholds affect the balance between retrieval accuracy and translation quality.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with different threshold values and measuring their impact on BLEU scores, chrF2, and TER metrics would help determine the optimal threshold for TM retrieval.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the integration of Translation Memory (TM) affect the training time and computational resources required for the Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that TM integration increases the amount of data available to the generator but does not discuss its impact on training time or computational resources.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide information on the trade-off between improved translation quality and increased computational cost when integrating TM.
- What evidence would resolve it: Measuring the training time and computational resources required with and without TM integration, and comparing the cost-benefit ratio, would provide insights into the impact of TM on training efficiency.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the quality of the monolingual corpus affect the performance of the back-translation leveraging GAN approach?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses a German monolingual corpus but does not explore the impact of using monolingual corpora of different sizes or qualities.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not experiment with monolingual corpora of varying sizes or qualities to determine their effect on the GAN's ability to generate high-quality synthetic translations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with monolingual corpora of different sizes and qualities, and measuring their impact on BLEU scores, chrF2, and TER metrics, would help determine the optimal monolingual corpus characteristics for the GAN approach.

## Limitations

- The individual contributions of GAN, TM, and filtering components to the 2.9 BLEU improvement are not separately quantified
- The specific architecture details of the discriminator are not fully specified, affecting reproducibility
- Evaluation is limited to a single low-resource language pair (German-Upper Sorbian), limiting generalizability claims

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The baseline improvement with TM integration (1.4 BLEU) is well-documented and straightforward to verify. The filtering methodology using length and perplexity ratios is clearly explained.
- **Medium Confidence**: The GAN-based augmentation mechanism works as described, though training stability and the exact discriminator architecture details remain unclear. The claim that GAN enables source-side monolingual use without degrading quality is plausible but needs more empirical validation.
- **Low Confidence**: The absolute BLEU score of 40.1 for this low-resource setting seems high and would require verification. The contribution of each component (TM, GAN, filtering) to the total improvement is not separately quantified.

## Next Checks

1. **Component Ablation Study**: Run experiments with (a) baseline only, (b) +TM only, (c) +GAN only, (d) +TM+GAN without filtering, (e) full system to quantify individual contributions to the 2.9 BLEU improvement.

2. **Discriminator Architecture Verification**: Implement and test the exact discriminator architecture (CNN+BiLSTM details) to verify it can effectively distinguish real from synthetic pairs without overpowering the generator during training.

3. **Cross-Domain Validation**: Test the complete pipeline on at least one additional low-resource language pair to assess whether the 2.9 BLEU improvement generalizes beyond the German-Upper Sorbian setting.
