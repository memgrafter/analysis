# Retrieval-Augmented Semantic Parsing: Improving Generalization with Lexical Knowledge

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.10207
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10207
- Reference count: 23
- This paper addresses the challenge of open-domain semantic parsing, where neural models struggle with unseen concepts due to reliance on training distributions.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Retrieval-Augmented Semantic Parsing (RASP), a method that enhances semantic parsing models by integrating external lexical knowledge from WordNet into large language models during parsing. The approach uses retrieval-augmented generation to dynamically access relevant concept information, addressing the challenge of open-domain semantic parsing where models struggle with unseen concepts. RASP nearly doubles performance on out-of-distribution concepts compared to previous models, achieving significant improvements on the challenge set while also setting state-of-the-art results on standard semantic parsing tasks.

## Method Summary
RASP leverages retrieval-augmented generation to integrate external lexical knowledge from WordNet into large language models during semantic parsing. The method dynamically accesses relevant concept information when encountering unseen concepts, using this external knowledge to guide the parsing process. By incorporating lexical knowledge from WordNet, RASP enables models to handle out-of-distribution concepts more effectively, improving generalization beyond the training distribution. The approach combines the strengths of semantic parsing with the flexibility of retrieval-based methods, creating a hybrid system that can access external knowledge when needed.

## Key Results
- RASP nearly doubles performance on out-of-distribution concepts compared to previous models
- Improvements of 53.7% to 85.9% on the challenge set
- Achieves state-of-the-art results on standard semantic parsing tasks with Hard-SMatch scores up to 91.37

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
RASP works by augmenting the semantic parsing process with external lexical knowledge, allowing the model to access information about concepts that were not seen during training. When the parser encounters an unfamiliar concept, it retrieves relevant information from WordNet and uses this to guide the parsing decision. This mechanism effectively expands the model's knowledge beyond what was available in the training data, enabling better handling of novel concepts and reducing reliance on training distribution patterns.

## Foundational Learning
- **Semantic Parsing**: The task of converting natural language to structured meaning representations; needed to understand the core problem RASP addresses and why generalization is challenging.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: A technique that combines retrieval systems with generative models; quick check: verify understanding of how retrieved information is incorporated into the generation process.
- **WordNet**: A lexical database of English words and their relationships; quick check: understand the structure and coverage of WordNet and why it's useful for semantic parsing.
- **Distribution Shift**: When test data differs from training data; quick check: recognize why this is problematic for semantic parsing and how RASP mitigates it.
- **Hard-SMatch**: A metric for evaluating semantic parsing accuracy; quick check: understand what this metric measures and why it's appropriate for this task.
- **Open-Domain Parsing**: Semantic parsing without domain restrictions; quick check: distinguish from domain-specific parsing and understand the additional challenges.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Text -> Retriever (WordNet) -> Generator (LLM) -> Output Parse

**Critical Path**: The critical path involves the retriever accessing WordNet to find relevant lexical information, which is then passed to the generator along with the original input to produce the final semantic parse. This path is activated when the model encounters concepts that require external knowledge.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The main tradeoff is between the accuracy gains from external knowledge and the increased computational overhead and latency from retrieval operations. Using WordNet provides broad coverage but may miss domain-specific terminology. The approach trades some inference speed for improved generalization and accuracy on out-of-distribution concepts.

**Failure Signatures**: The system may fail when WordNet lacks coverage for domain-specific terminology or recent concepts, leading to retrieval of irrelevant or no information. Performance may degrade when the retriever cannot find appropriate lexical entries, or when the generator struggles to effectively incorporate retrieved information into the parsing process.

**First 3 Experiments to Run**:
1. Evaluate RASP on a held-out test set with novel concepts not present in WordNet to assess the limits of lexical knowledge coverage.
2. Compare RASP performance using different knowledge sources (e.g., WordNet vs. domain-specific ontologies) to quantify the dependency on lexical knowledge quality.
3. Measure inference time and memory usage with varying query complexities to characterize the practical deployment overhead of the retrieval mechanism.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The approach relies on WordNet as the sole lexical knowledge source, which may not cover all domain-specific terminology or recent concepts.
- Performance gains are primarily demonstrated on the Overnight dataset, with the extent of generalization across diverse semantic parsing domains remaining to be fully established.
- The method's scalability and efficiency across different knowledge base sizes and query types lack comprehensive studies.

## Confidence
- **High** for improved performance on out-of-distribution concepts and state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks
- **Medium** regarding scalability and efficiency claims due to limited comprehensive analysis
- The claim about reduced sensitivity to training distribution is supported by challenge set results but would benefit from more extensive distribution shift experiments

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate RASP on a broader range of semantic parsing tasks, particularly those involving specialized domains (medical, legal, technical) where WordNet coverage may be limited.
2. Conduct ablation studies specifically measuring the impact of different knowledge base sources to quantify the dependency on lexical knowledge quality and coverage.
3. Perform a detailed efficiency analysis measuring inference time, memory usage, and token generation costs across varying knowledge base sizes and query complexities.
