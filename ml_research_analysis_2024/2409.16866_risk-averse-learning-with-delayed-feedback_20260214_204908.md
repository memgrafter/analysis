core_contribution: This paper investigates risk-averse online learning with delayed
  feedback, using Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) as the risk measure. The key challenge
  addressed is that decisions made in real-world scenarios may not yield immediate
  feedback due to inherent delays, complicating risk assessment and management.

# Risk-averse learning with delayed feedback

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.16866
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16866
- Reference count: 23
- This paper proposes risk-averse online learning algorithms that handle delayed feedback using Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) optimization

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of risk-averse online learning when feedback from decisions is delayed. The authors develop two zeroth-order optimization algorithms (one-point and two-point methods) that can estimate CVaR gradients using multiple samples under perturbed actions, even with delayed feedback. The key innovation is mapping received feedback to virtual time slots based on reception order, allowing the algorithms to function under random but bounded delays.

## Method Summary
The authors propose two risk-averse learning algorithms based on zeroth-order optimization that handle delayed feedback. Both algorithms estimate CVaR gradients using multiple samples under perturbed actions at each time slot. The algorithms map received feedback to virtual time slots based on reception order, allowing them to function when feedback is delayed but bounded. The two-point method uses gradient estimates based on function evaluations at two perturbed points, while the one-point method uses a single perturbed point.

## Key Results
- The two-point algorithm achieves better performance (smaller regret bound) than the one-point algorithm for all parameter settings
- The one-point algorithm achieves sublinear regret when delays satisfy specific upper bounds
- The two-point algorithm achieves sublinear regret with minimal restrictions on delay
- Numerical experiments show the two-point algorithm outperforms one-point in tracking desired values with lower variance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithms work by maintaining estimates of the CVaR gradient despite delayed feedback. When feedback arrives late, it's mapped to the appropriate virtual time slot based on when it was received, allowing the algorithm to continue updating using the most recent available information. The two-point method's superior performance stems from its more accurate gradient estimation, which provides better direction for optimization even with delayed information.

## Foundational Learning

### Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)
Why needed: CVaR provides a coherent risk measure for optimization under uncertainty, capturing tail risk better than variance alone.
Quick check: CVaR is the expected value of outcomes in the worst α-fraction of cases, where α is the risk level.

### Zeroth-order optimization
Why needed: Allows gradient estimation without explicit gradient information, essential when only function values are available.
Quick check: Uses function evaluations at perturbed points to estimate gradients through finite differences.

### Virtual time slots
Why needed: Enables proper alignment of delayed feedback with the correct decision epoch.
Quick check: Feedback received at time t is mapped to the appropriate virtual time slot based on the delay realization.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Feedback Reception -> Virtual Time Mapping -> Gradient Estimation -> CVaR Update -> Action Selection

### Critical Path
1. Receive delayed feedback
2. Map feedback to virtual time slot
3. Compute perturbed function evaluations
4. Estimate CVaR gradient
5. Update action selection

### Design Tradeoffs
- One-point vs two-point methods: Accuracy vs computational cost
- Number of samples per time slot: Variance reduction vs computational overhead
- Delay handling mechanism: Simplicity vs robustness to extreme delays

### Failure Signatures
- High variance in performance indicates insufficient samples or excessive delays
- Sublinear regret failure suggests delay bounds are violated
- Poor tracking of desired values indicates gradient estimation errors

### First Experiments
1. Test algorithm performance with varying delay distributions
2. Compare one-point and two-point methods across different risk levels
3. Evaluate sensitivity to number of samples per time slot

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Assumes random but bounded delays, which may not capture all real-world scenarios
- Theoretical analysis relies on specific conditions for delay bounds in the one-point algorithm
- Focuses on zeroth-order optimization methods, which may have higher sample complexity than gradient-based approaches

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The regret bounds for both algorithms and their comparative performance are well-established theoretically

**Medium confidence**: The numerical experiments demonstrating improved tracking and variance reduction, as the dynamic pricing problem represents a specific application case

**Medium confidence**: The relationship between delay parameters, sampling numbers, and performance variance, as this requires extensive parameter sweeps across diverse problem instances

## Next Checks

1. Test algorithm performance under unbounded or adversarial delay patterns to evaluate robustness beyond the assumed bounded delay framework
2. Implement gradient-based risk-averse algorithms for comparison to assess whether zeroth-order methods are optimal when gradient information is available
3. Conduct extensive numerical experiments across diverse risk-averse optimization problems to verify the generality of the observed variance-delay relationship and algorithm performance trends
