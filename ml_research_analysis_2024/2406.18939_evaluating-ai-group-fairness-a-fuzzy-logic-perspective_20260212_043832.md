# Evaluating AI Group Fairness: a Fuzzy Logic Perspective

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18939
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: Framework for continuous group fairness evaluation using fuzzy logic with stakeholder-specific truth values

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a framework for evaluating group fairness in AI systems using fuzzy logic. The key idea is to express definitions of group fairness in Basic fuzzy Logic (BL) using abstract predicates, and then evaluate these definitions using different BL subclasses (e.g. Product, Lukasiewicz logics) based on context-specific stakeholder beliefs. This approach allows for continuous rather than binary fairness evaluation, accommodating uncertainty and context-dependent interpretations. The framework provides standardized evaluation formulas that enable stakeholders to participate in fairness criteria determination without requiring deep expertise in fuzzy logic.

## Method Summary
The method involves expressing fairness definitions in Basic fuzzy Logic (BL) using abstract predicates for discrimination measures. Stakeholder beliefs are collected as truth values for these predicates, which are then evaluated using chosen BL subclasses (Product, Lukasiewicz, Gödel logics). The framework provides standardized forms for common fairness propositions that AI creators can use by plugging in truth values. The evaluation produces continuous truth values for fairness definitions, moving beyond binary fairness assessments to capture nuanced, context-specific interpretations of fairness.

## Key Results
- Fairness definitions can be standardized into mathematical formulas in BL that accommodate stakeholder beliefs
- Continuous truth values provide more nuanced fairness evaluation than binary decisions
- Different BL subclasses (Product vs Lukasiewicz) capture different approaches to uncertainty propagation in fairness contexts
- The framework enables stakeholder involvement in fairness determination while maintaining logical consistency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Fuzzy logic enables continuous fairness evaluation instead of binary decisions.
- Mechanism: Truth values in [0,1] replace probabilities, allowing partial fairness states and nuanced stakeholder beliefs.
- Core assumption: Stakeholder beliefs can be meaningfully mapped to truth values without requiring exact probabilistic grounding.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Evaluation produces continuous instead of binary truth values by choosing the logic subclass and truth values for predicates that reflect uncertain context-specific beliefs"
  - [section 3]: "Truth values are not necessarily probabilities, but we adopt the same symbol because they can model probabilities in some logic"
- Break condition: If stakeholder beliefs cannot be reliably quantified or stakeholders cannot agree on truth value interpretations.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Separating definitions from context allows reusability and consistent evaluation.
- Mechanism: Abstract BL definitions are written once and then evaluated with context-specific truth values, avoiding redefinition per scenario.
- Core assumption: Fairness definitions can be meaningfully separated from their evaluation context without loss of meaning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Here we decouple definitions of group fairness both from the context and from relaxation-related uncertainty"
  - [section 3]: "Definitions transcribe context-independent concerns into formal language"
- Break condition: If context-dependent interpretations fundamentally alter the meaning of fairness definitions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Standardized evaluation formulas enable easy adoption without requiring deep BL expertise.
- Mechanism: Common propositions are converted to closed-form expressions that AI creators can use by plugging in truth values.
- Core assumption: The standardization covers enough common fairness concerns to be practically useful.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we create a standardization of what group fairness evaluation should look like under commonly accepted propositions"
  - [section 3.3]: "standardized forms of predicate truth values"
- Break condition: If stakeholder beliefs or fairness concerns fall outside the standardized propositions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Basic fuzzy Logic (BL) and its subclasses**: These logics provide the mathematical foundation for continuous fairness evaluation
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes Product logic from Lukasiewicz logic in terms of truth value degradation?

- **Measures of discrimination in AI fairness**: These provide the base predicates that fuzzy logic evaluates
  - Quick check question: How does disparate impact differ from disparate mistreatment?

- **Stakeholder belief elicitation**: Context-specific truth values depend on stakeholder input
  - Quick check question: What methods could reliably capture stakeholder fairness beliefs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: BL Definition Module -> Truth Value Elicitation Layer -> Logic Subclass Selector -> Evaluation Engine -> Standardization Interface
- **Critical path**: BL Definition → Logic Subclass Selection → Truth Value Collection → Evaluation Computation → Fairness Output
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Precision vs interpretability: More complex BL expressions increase expressiveness but reduce stakeholder understanding
  - Context independence vs context sensitivity: Balancing reusable definitions with meaningful local adaptation
  - Automation vs human input: Reducing stakeholder burden vs maintaining meaningful participation
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Stakeholders cannot agree on truth values → evaluation stalls
  - Logic subclass choice doesn't match context needs → misleading fairness assessments
  - Standardization doesn't cover stakeholder concerns → incomplete evaluation
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Test basic Lukasiewicz evaluation with synthetic stakeholder data
  2. Compare fairness outcomes across different logic subclasses with same input
  3. Validate standardization against known fairness definitions from literature

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific stakeholder beliefs or social contexts would lead to choosing Lukasiewicz logic over other BL subclasses for fairness evaluation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that Lukasiewicz logic is chosen when injecting more uncertain hypotheses would eventually lead to fully erroneous statements (with zero truth values).
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide concrete examples of stakeholder beliefs or social contexts that would specifically lead to this choice.
- What evidence would resolve it: Real-world case studies or examples where stakeholders explicitly chose Lukasiewicz logic based on their beliefs about how uncertainty should propagate in fairness evaluations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we effectively gather and quantify stakeholder beliefs about group membership and discrimination to use in the fuzzy logic framework?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that gathering stakeholder beliefs is crucial but acknowledges challenges in this process.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed methodology for gathering and quantifying these beliefs.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study demonstrating successful methods for gathering and quantifying stakeholder beliefs, along with results showing how these beliefs impact fairness evaluations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the fuzzy logic framework handle complex, multidimensional fairness concerns that involve multiple protected attributes and their intersections?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that fairness concerns may span several sensitive groups and measures of discrimination.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed explanation of how the framework handles complex, multidimensional scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: A case study or theoretical analysis demonstrating how the framework can be applied to complex, real-world scenarios involving multiple protected attributes and their intersections.

## Limitations

- The framework assumes stakeholder beliefs can be meaningfully mapped to truth values, but lacks validation of this translation process in practice.
- The standardization claims to cover "commonly accepted propositions" but does not empirically validate this coverage against real-world fairness concerns.
- The paper does not address how to handle disagreements between stakeholders or situations where truth values are fundamentally irreconcilable.

## Confidence

- Confidence: Medium - The framework assumes stakeholder beliefs can be meaningfully mapped to truth values, but lacks validation of this translation process in practice.
- Confidence: Low - The standardization claims to cover "commonly accepted propositions" but does not empirically validate this coverage.

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical Stakeholder Testing**: Conduct user studies with diverse stakeholder groups to validate whether the fuzzy logic framework produces interpretable and actionable fairness assessments that align with stakeholder intuitions.

2. **Context Sensitivity Validation**: Test the framework across multiple real-world AI deployment contexts (healthcare, hiring, criminal justice) to verify that logic subclass selection meaningfully captures context-specific fairness requirements.

3. **Coverage Completeness Assessment**: Systematically catalog fairness concerns from AI ethics literature and stakeholder interviews to measure what percentage of concerns are captured by the standardized propositions versus requiring custom formulation.
