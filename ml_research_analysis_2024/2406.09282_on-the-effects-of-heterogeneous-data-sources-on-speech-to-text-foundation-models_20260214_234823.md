# On the Effects of Heterogeneous Data Sources on Speech-to-Text Foundation Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.09282
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09282
- Reference count: 0
- Improves ST performance and achieves comparable ASR results while using 15% less training data

## Executive Summary
This work addresses data heterogeneity challenges in training open-source speech-to-text models using 25 diverse public datasets. The authors introduce two key strategies: data filtering through proxy tasks to remove low-quality misaligned examples, and punctuation/capitalization restoration using an open LLM to standardize text formatting. The resulting OWSM v3.2 model demonstrates improved speech translation performance while maintaining comparable automatic speech recognition results with reduced training data requirements. Long-form speech recognition particularly benefits from the filtering approach, showing reduced deletion errors and better alignment with written language conventions.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a two-pronged approach to manage data heterogeneity in speech-to-text model training. First, they implemented a data filtering strategy using proxy tasks, where automatic speech recognition systems identify and remove low-quality or misaligned examples from the training corpus. Second, they employed an open LLM to restore punctuation and capitalization in the text data, standardizing formatting across diverse datasets. These methods were applied to 25 heterogeneous public datasets to train the OWSM v3.2 model, with the filtering strategy enabling a 15% reduction in training data while maintaining performance levels.

## Key Results
- OWSM v3.2 improves speech translation (ST) performance over previous versions
- Achieves comparable automatic speech recognition (ASR) results while using 15% less training data
- Long-form speech recognition benefits particularly from data filtering, with reduced deletion errors
- LLM-enhanced outputs show better alignment with written language, demonstrated by lower perplexity scores and improved case/punctuation-sensitive metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of the proposed approach stems from addressing two critical sources of noise in heterogeneous training data. Data filtering removes examples that would otherwise introduce harmful patterns during training, particularly important for long-form speech where deletion errors can compound. The LLM-based text standardization creates consistency across diverse data sources, reducing model confusion from varying punctuation and capitalization conventions. Together, these strategies improve the signal-to-noise ratio in training data, allowing the model to learn more robust representations while requiring less data overall.

## Foundational Learning
- Data heterogeneity management: Why needed - Diverse datasets introduce inconsistent patterns that can degrade model performance; Quick check - Evaluate performance degradation when training on mixed vs. homogeneous datasets
- Proxy task filtering: Why needed - Automatic identification of low-quality examples prevents harmful training signals; Quick check - Compare model performance with and without filtered examples on validation sets
- LLM-based text standardization: Why needed - Consistent formatting across datasets reduces model confusion and improves generalization; Quick check - Measure perplexity scores before and after text standardization

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: 25 heterogeneous datasets -> Data filtering proxy task -> LLM text standardization -> OWSM v3.2 training pipeline
- Critical path: Data preprocessing (filtering + standardization) -> Model training -> Evaluation on ST and ASR tasks
- Design tradeoffs: Reduced training data size vs. computational overhead of LLM preprocessing; Potential bias toward written language conventions vs. natural speech patterns
- Failure signatures: Performance degradation on languages with limited training data; Over-standardization masking important speech-specific features
- First experiments: 1) Ablation study comparing filtered vs. unfiltered training data performance, 2) Evaluation of LLM-standardized vs. original text on perplexity metrics, 3) Domain-specific testing on medical/legal datasets to assess generalization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Data filtering reliability depends on the assumption that ASR systems can accurately identify low-quality examples, which may be imperfect for languages with limited training data
- LLM-based punctuation and capitalization restoration may introduce bias toward written language conventions that don't reflect natural speech patterns
- Evaluation focuses primarily on perplexity and case/punctuation-sensitive metrics, potentially overlooking other quality dimensions like semantic preservation

## Confidence
- High confidence: ASR performance comparisons between model versions, basic data filtering methodology
- Medium confidence: Long-form speech recognition improvements, LLM-enhanced text quality metrics
- Low confidence: Generalization across all languages and domains, computational efficiency claims

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of data filtering versus LLM text standardization to overall performance improvements
2. Test model performance on domain-specific datasets (medical, legal, technical) to assess generalization beyond the heterogeneous training mix
3. Measure the computational overhead of LLM-based text preprocessing relative to training time savings from reduced dataset size
