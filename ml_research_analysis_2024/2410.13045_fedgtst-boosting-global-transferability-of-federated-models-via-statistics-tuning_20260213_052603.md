# FedGTST: Boosting Global Transferability of Federated Models via Statistics Tuning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2410.13045
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13045
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Proposes FedGTST method that improves federated model transferability to target domains by controlling cross-client Jacobian norms and variances through a novel client-server exchange protocol.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of improving the transferability of federated learning models to target domains while preserving privacy and reducing communication overhead. The authors propose FedGTST, a method that enhances global transferability by controlling cross-client Jacobian norms and variances through a novel client-server exchange protocol. The approach introduces regularization to align local Jacobian norms with a global guide norm, thereby increasing the average Jacobian norm and reducing variance. The method only communicates scalar Jacobian norms, minimizing communication costs and preserving privacy.

## Method Summary
FedGTST is a federated learning method that improves model transferability to target domains by controlling cross-client Jacobian norms and variances. The method uses a guide norm from the server to regularize local training, where clients align their local Jacobian norms to this guide norm. This increases the average Jacobian norm across clients and reduces variance. The server computes the guide norm as the maximum of received norms from clients, and only scalar Jacobian norms are communicated, preserving privacy and minimizing overhead. A subset of clients performs both regularized and standard training to generate surrogate norms, preventing premature decrease in local Jacobian norms.

## Key Results
- FedGTST outperforms baselines such as FedSR and FedIIR, achieving up to 9.8% higher accuracy in some cases.
- The method only communicates scalar Jacobian norms, minimizing communication costs and preserving privacy.
- Theoretical analysis shows that larger cross-client averaged Jacobian norms and smaller variances lead to tighter bounds on target loss, improving transferability.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Increasing cross-client averaged Jacobian norm while reducing cross-client Jacobian variance leads to tighter bounds on target loss, improving transferability.
- Mechanism: The method uses a guide norm (γ) from the server to regularize local training. Clients align their local Jacobian norms to this guide norm, which increases the average Jacobian norm across clients and reduces variance.
- Core assumption: The cross-client averaged Jacobian norm and variance are key indicators of transferability, and controlling them through regularization improves model performance on target domains.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our findings are based on the first direct measure of transferability, which equals the loss on the target domain incurred by the pretrained federated model."
  - [section] "Two FL-specific factors, a small cross-client Jacobian variance and larger cross-client Jacobian norm are indicative of good transferability."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct mentions of Jacobian norms or variances in related papers, suggesting this is a novel contribution.
- Break condition: If the guide norm is poorly chosen (e.g., too small), it may not effectively increase the Jacobian norm or reduce variance, limiting the method's effectiveness.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Communicating only scalar Jacobian norms (not full gradients) reduces communication overhead while preserving privacy.
- Mechanism: Clients compute their local Jacobian norms and send them to the server. The server broadcasts the maximum norm as the guide norm. This avoids sharing full gradient information.
- Core assumption: Sharing scalar norms instead of full gradients is sufficient to guide regularization while maintaining privacy and reducing communication costs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The method only communicates scalar Jacobian norms, minimizing communication costs and preserving privacy."
  - [section] "We suggest to only communicate scalars, more precisely, Jacobian norms, which introduces a negligible communication overhead in the overall model exchange protocol."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence in related papers, but the claim aligns with general federated learning principles of minimizing communication.
- Break condition: If the maximum norm is not representative of the overall client distribution, the guide norm may not effectively align local Jacobians, reducing regularization benefits.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Surrogate norms (choosing the maximum of regularized and standard Jacobian norms) prevent premature decrease in local Jacobian norms, ensuring the averaged norm increases.
- Mechanism: A subset of clients performs both regularized and standard training, then transmits the larger norm as a surrogate. This prevents the regularization from reducing the Jacobian norm too much.
- Core assumption: Regularization can inadvertently decrease local Jacobian norms, so using surrogate norms ensures the averaged norm remains sufficiently large.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This is achieved through subtractions of global norms of Jacobians (gradients) communicated by the server."
  - [section] "We mitigate such a decrease by forcing a small portion of the clients to implement both regularized training and standard training... The client then chooses the larger norm... as a surrogate norm for transmission."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct mentions of surrogate norms in related papers, indicating this is a novel approach.
- Break condition: If the subset of clients using standard training is too small or unrepresentative, the surrogate norm may not effectively boost the averaged Jacobian norm.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Federated Learning (FL)
  - Why needed here: The paper's method operates in a federated setting where multiple clients collaborate to train a global model without sharing local data.
  - Quick check question: What is the primary challenge in federated learning that this method addresses, and how does it differ from centralized learning?

- Concept: Transfer Learning (TL)
  - Why needed here: The method aims to improve the transferability of federated models to target domains, which is a key aspect of transfer learning.
  - Quick check question: How does the paper define transferability, and why is it important for federated learning models?

- Concept: Jacobian Norms and Variance
  - Why needed here: The method controls cross-client Jacobian norms and variance to improve transferability, so understanding these concepts is crucial.
  - Quick check question: What role do Jacobian norms and variance play in the theoretical bounds on target loss, and how does the method manipulate them?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Clients -> Server (send Jacobian norms) -> Clients (receive guide norm)
- Critical path:
  1. Clients receive guide norm from server.
  2. Clients perform regularized training and compute Jacobian norms.
  3. Subset of clients also performs standard training to generate surrogate norms.
  4. Clients send norms to server.
  5. Server computes and broadcasts new guide norm.
  6. Repeat for multiple rounds.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Communication overhead vs. accuracy: Communicating only norms reduces overhead but may lose some gradient information.
  - Privacy vs. performance: The method preserves privacy by not sharing full gradients but relies on norms to guide regularization.
  - Local computation vs. global performance: Surrogate norms require additional local computation but improve global transferability.
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor transferability: If the guide norm is not effectively increasing the averaged Jacobian norm or reducing variance.
  - High communication costs: If the method deviates from communicating only norms.
  - Privacy leaks: If full gradients are inadvertently shared instead of norms.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the method on a simple non-IID dataset (e.g., MNIST with class imbalance) to verify basic functionality.
  2. Compare the method's performance with FedAVG and FedSR on a standard transfer task (e.g., CIFAR10 to SVHN) to validate improvements.
  3. Measure communication overhead and privacy preservation by logging the size of exchanged data and checking for gradient information leaks.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Does FedGTST's performance advantage persist with non-convex loss functions beyond the convex assumptions made in the theoretical analysis?
- **Open Question 2**: How does FedGTST's performance scale with extremely large numbers of clients (e.g., 1000+) compared to the tested range of 10-100 clients?
- **Open Question 3**: What is the impact of using different aggregation strategies (e.g., weighted averaging based on data size) instead of simple averaging in FedGTST?
- **Open Question 4**: How does FedGTST perform when clients have highly imbalanced data distributions (e.g., power-law class distributions) compared to the balanced non-IID distributions tested?

## Limitations
- The experimental validation is limited to specific datasets and models, raising questions about generalizability to other federated learning scenarios and target domains.
- The privacy claims rely on the assumption that scalar norms are sufficient to guide regularization without leaking sensitive information, which requires further scrutiny.
- The method's performance advantages are demonstrated on a limited set of datasets, and its effectiveness on more diverse or complex tasks remains to be seen.

## Confidence
- **High**: The core mechanism of using Jacobian norms to improve transferability is theoretically grounded and aligns with existing federated learning principles.
- **Medium**: The experimental results show consistent improvements over baselines, but the sample size and diversity of datasets are limited.
- **Low**: The privacy claims and communication overhead benefits are based on the assumption that scalar norms are sufficient, which may not hold in all scenarios.

## Next Checks
1. **Generalizability Test**: Apply FedGTST to a broader range of federated learning tasks, including different model architectures and target domains, to assess its robustness and scalability.
2. **Privacy Analysis**: Conduct a formal privacy analysis to verify that communicating only scalar Jacobian norms does not inadvertently leak sensitive information about the local data distributions.
3. **Communication Overhead Measurement**: Measure the actual communication overhead in practice, including the size of exchanged data and the impact on training time, to validate the claimed benefits.
