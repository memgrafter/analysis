core_contribution: This paper proposes InfoRE, a method that improves reasoning in
  large language models by first reorganizing context information to uncover logical
  relationships and prune irrelevant content before reasoning. The method uses MindMap
  structure to extract multi-hop logical relationships from plain text and employs
  a BERT-based pruning model trained with reinforcement learning to remove noise.

# Information Re-Organization Improves Reasoning in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.13985
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13985
- Reference count: 40
- Improves reasoning in LLMs by 4% average F1 score through context reorganization

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces InfoRE, a method that enhances reasoning capabilities in large language models by first reorganizing context information to uncover logical relationships and prune irrelevant content. The approach uses MindMap structures to extract multi-hop logical relationships from plain text, followed by a BERT-based pruning model trained with reinforcement learning to remove noise. Experiments across multiple LLMs (Llama2-70B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4) on claim verification, question answering, and reading comprehension tasks demonstrate an average 4% improvement in F1 scores compared to standard methods, validating the effectiveness of context reorganization for reasoning tasks.

## Method Summary
InfoRE employs a two-step process to improve LLM reasoning: extraction and pruning. The extraction phase uses large language models to transform raw contextual content into a MindMap structure that captures multi-hop logical relationships. The pruning phase employs a BERT-based model trained with reinforcement learning (PPO) to identify and remove irrelevant information from the MindMap. The re-organized context is then used for downstream reasoning tasks. The method was tested across three reasoning tasks (claim verification, question answering, and reading comprehension) using multiple LLM sizes, showing consistent improvements in F1 scores compared to baseline approaches.

## Key Results
- 4% average improvement in F1 scores across all tested reasoning tasks
- Consistent performance gains across multiple LLM sizes (Llama2-70B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4)
- Effective noise reduction through RL-based pruning of irrelevant logical relationships

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
InfoRE improves reasoning by restructuring contextual information into a more explicit logical format before the reasoning task. By extracting multi-hop relationships through MindMap structures, the method surfaces implicit connections that may not be readily apparent in raw text. The subsequent pruning step removes irrelevant information that could distract or mislead the reasoning process. This pre-processing approach reduces the cognitive load on the LLM during reasoning by presenting a cleaner, more organized representation of the relevant logical relationships, allowing the model to focus on the essential connections needed to answer questions or verify claims.

## Foundational Learning
- **MindMap structures**: Visual representations of logical relationships between concepts, needed for extracting multi-hop connections from text; quick check: can the MindMap capture all relevant relationships in a sample document
- **Reinforcement learning for pruning**: Using reward signals to train models to remove irrelevant information; quick check: does the pruning model consistently improve reasoning performance on held-out data
- **Multi-hop reasoning**: Reasoning that requires multiple inference steps across different pieces of information; quick check: can the method correctly answer questions requiring 2+ logical connections
- **Context reorganization**: Restructuring information presentation to improve comprehension and reasoning; quick check: does the reorganized context improve human understanding compared to raw text
- **BERT-based filtering**: Using transformer models to identify and remove irrelevant content; quick check: does the BERT model accurately distinguish between relevant and irrelevant relationships

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Context -> MindMap Extraction -> Pruning Model -> Re-organized Context -> Reasoning LLM

**Critical Path**: The MindMap extraction and pruning steps are critical, as errors in either will propagate to the reasoning phase. The pruning model's quality directly impacts the final reasoning performance.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades computational overhead (two additional processing steps) for improved reasoning accuracy. The choice of MindMap structure balances expressiveness with tractability for the pruning model.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Poor extraction quality results in incomplete logical relationships
- Over-pruning removes relevant information, under-pruning leaves too much noise
- Inconsistent pruning across similar contexts indicates reward function issues

**First 3 Experiments to Run**:
1. Test extraction quality by comparing MindMap completeness against human-annotated logical relationships
2. Evaluate pruning effectiveness by measuring reasoning performance with different pruning thresholds
3. Assess generalizability by applying the method to a new reasoning task with different logical structures

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the InfoRE method's performance scale with increasing complexity of multi-hop reasoning tasks beyond the tested datasets?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper tests on various multi-hop reasoning tasks but does not explore performance on more complex scenarios.
- Why unresolved: The current experimental scope is limited to specific datasets, leaving the method's robustness to more intricate reasoning chains unverified.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing on datasets with deeper reasoning chains or more complex logical structures would provide insights into scalability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the specific impacts of different MindMap structures on the reasoning performance of InfoRE?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using MindMap structures but does not explore alternative structures or their comparative effectiveness.
- Why unresolved: The choice of MindMap is justified, but the potential benefits of other structures are not explored, leaving their impact on performance unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments using different information reorganization structures would clarify the optimal choice for various tasks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the quality of the pruning model affect the overall reasoning accuracy in InfoRE?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses a BERT-based pruning model trained with reinforcement learning but does not detail its quality assessment or alternatives.
- Why unresolved: The effectiveness of the pruning model is crucial for InfoRE's success, yet its quality assessment and potential improvements are not discussed.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating the pruning model's performance independently and comparing it with other pruning techniques would provide clarity on its impact.

## Limitations
- Method relies on LLM-based extraction, which may introduce variability in MindMap quality across runs
- Reinforcement learning component may be sensitive to reward shaping and could over-prune useful information
- Evaluation focuses primarily on F1 scores, potentially missing other aspects of reasoning quality

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: General framework of context reorganization as pre-processing step is well-supported
- **Medium confidence**: Specific implementation details (MindMap extraction and RL-based pruning) are effective but individual contributions are not fully isolated
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability to domains beyond tested claim verification, QA, and reading comprehension tasks

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic ablation tests to quantify individual contributions of extraction and pruning steps
2. Test the method on additional reasoning tasks with different logical structures (e.g., mathematical reasoning)
3. Evaluate performance under adversarial conditions with deliberately misleading context
