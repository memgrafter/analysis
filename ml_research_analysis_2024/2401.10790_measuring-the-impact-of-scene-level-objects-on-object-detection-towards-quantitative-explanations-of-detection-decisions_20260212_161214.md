# Measuring the Impact of Scene Level Objects on Object Detection: Towards Quantitative Explanations of Detection Decisions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.10790
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10790
- Reference count: 35
- Key outcome: Novel black-box method quantitatively measures scene-level object impact on detection accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a quantitative black-box explainability method for object detection models that measures how scene-level objects affect detection performance. The approach compares model accuracies across test datasets with controlled presence of specific scene-level objects, providing measurable insights into context reliance. An experiment with a YOLOv8 model detecting emergency vehicles demonstrated that buildings significantly improved detection accuracy (63.00% to 83.33%) while people had no measurable impact. This method offers a global, quantitative alternative to traditional heatmap-based explainability techniques, enabling developers to understand model limitations and context dependencies without requiring access to model internals.

## Method Summary
The method creates controlled test datasets where each set contains specific scene-level objects while maintaining consistent class distributions. A pre-trained YOLOv8 model is fine-tuned on emergency vehicle data for 80 epochs, then evaluated on four test datasets: normal randomized, people-only, buildings-only, and people+buildings. By comparing accuracy differences across these datasets, the contribution of each scene-level object to detection performance becomes quantifiable. The approach measures global performance changes rather than local feature importance, providing objective insights into how context affects detection accuracy.

## Key Results
- Buildings improved detection accuracy from 63.00% to 83.33% in emergency vehicle detection
- People had no measurable impact on detection performance
- The method successfully identified both positive (buildings) and neutral (people) contributions of scene-level objects
- Accuracy differences between test datasets quantitatively revealed context reliance patterns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Comparing model accuracies on test datasets with and without specific scene-level objects quantitatively reveals the model's reliance on contextual features.
- Mechanism: The method creates controlled test datasets where each set contains a specific scene-level object (e.g., buildings or people) while maintaining the same class distribution. By measuring accuracy differences across these datasets, the contribution of each scene-level object to detection performance becomes quantifiable.
- Core assumption: Scene-level objects present in the training data are learned as relevant features that influence detection decisions during inference.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "By comparing the accuracies of a model on test data with and without certain scene level objects, the contributions of these objects to the model's performance becomes clearer."
  - [section 3] "The purpose of this part of the experiment was to analyze the effect of the chosen scene level objects on the performance of the object detection model."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Global quantitative explanations provide more objective insights than traditional heatmap-based explainability methods.
- Mechanism: Instead of highlighting individual pixels or regions that contribute to a detection, this method measures overall model performance changes when entire scene-level objects are present or absent. This provides a macro-level view of how context affects detection accuracy.
- Core assumption: Global performance metrics can effectively capture the impact of scene-level context on model decisions without needing to understand individual feature importance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This approach differs from traditional heatmap-based methods by providing precise, measurable insights into how scene context affects object detection performance."
  - [section 2.3] "Many explainability methods for image tasks...output a heatmap of which areas of the image were most helpful in the decision-making process and which areas were not helpful."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The method can identify both positive and negative contributions of scene-level objects to model performance.
- Mechanism: By comparing accuracy across different test datasets (with and without specific scene-level objects), the method can detect when certain contexts improve performance (positive contribution) or when they introduce confusion or errors (negative contribution).
- Core assumption: Scene-level objects can have varying effects on model performance, not just uniformly positive or negative.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Additionally, this approach is able to pinpoint the positive or negative effects of scene level features the classifier learned to use to make a prediction."
  - [section 4] "The array of results for the different scene level objects demonstrates how this method can recognize both the positive and negative contributions of the context."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Object Detection Fundamentals
  - Why needed here: Understanding how object detection models work (CNNs, R-CNNs, YOLO) is essential to grasp why scene-level context matters and how the proposed method measures its impact.
  - Quick check question: What is the key architectural difference between traditional CNNs and YOLO that makes context more relevant in the latter?

- Concept: Machine Learning Explainability Methods
  - Why needed here: To understand how this quantitative approach differs from traditional explainability methods like heatmaps and LIME, and why it provides a unique perspective on model decisions.
  - Quick check question: What is the main limitation of heatmap-based explainability methods that this quantitative approach addresses?

- Concept: Experimental Design and Statistical Analysis
  - Why needed here: To properly design the experiment with controlled test datasets and interpret the accuracy differences as meaningful indicators of context reliance.
  - Quick check question: Why is it important to maintain the same class distribution across all test datasets when measuring the impact of scene-level objects?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data collection → Annotation → Model training → Creation of controlled test datasets → Accuracy evaluation → Comparison of results across datasets
- Critical path: Data collection → Annotation → Model training → Creation of controlled test datasets → Accuracy evaluation → Comparison of results across datasets
- Design tradeoffs: The method trades detailed feature-level explanations for global quantitative insights. It requires creating multiple test datasets rather than using a single test set, which increases experimental complexity but provides more comprehensive context analysis.
- Failure signatures: If accuracy differences between test datasets are negligible, it may indicate that the model doesn't rely on scene-level context or that the test datasets aren't properly controlled. Large standard deviations in accuracy measurements could suggest insufficient test data or high model variability.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Repeat the experiment with the same dataset but analyze different scene-level objects (e.g., roads, vehicles, vegetation) to verify the method's generalizability.
  2. Apply the method to a different object detection architecture (e.g., Faster R-CNN) to compare context reliance across model types.
  3. Test the method on a different domain (e.g., medical imaging or satellite imagery) to evaluate its applicability beyond emergency vehicle detection.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the quantitative explainability method perform when applied to object detection models trained on datasets with different class distributions or in different domains?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests repeating the experiment with other scene level objects and in an entirely new domain, but does not present results for such experiments.
- Why unresolved: The current study only tested the method on emergency road vehicle detection using buildings and people as scene level objects. Results may vary significantly for other object classes or contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting the same experiment with different object detection tasks (e.g., pedestrian detection, animal detection) and different scene level objects would provide comparative results.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the effectiveness of context reliance in object detection models for specific applications, and when does it hinder rather than help model performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states it does not analyze the usefulness of context reliance and suggests future research into when maintaining this behavior is beneficial versus detrimental.
- Why unresolved: The current study only identified whether context affected performance, not whether that effect was beneficial or harmful for specific use cases.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments comparing model performance with and without context reliance in safety-critical versus non-critical applications would determine optimal approaches.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What specific methods can effectively reduce or eliminate context reliance in object detection models without significantly degrading overall performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions potential solutions like removing context-containing images from training data or using occlusion techniques, but does not present or evaluate any concrete methods.
- Why unresolved: The study focused on identifying context reliance but did not implement or test any interventions to address it.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing and testing various techniques (data augmentation, architectural modifications, training strategies) to reduce context reliance while measuring impact on detection accuracy would provide answers.

## Limitations
- Experimental validation based on single object detection task (emergency vehicles) with limited scene-level objects (buildings, people)
- Small dataset size (394 images) may not be representative of other detection scenarios
- Method assumes controlled test datasets can accurately capture scene-level object impact in complex real-world scenes

## Confidence
- **Medium**: Limited generalizability due to single-task validation, small dataset size, and assumption that accuracy differences fully capture context reliance

## Next Checks
1. Test the method on a larger, more diverse object detection dataset (e.g., COCO or Pascal VOC) with multiple scene-level objects to verify scalability and robustness.
2. Apply the method to different object detection architectures (Faster R-CNN, EfficientDet) to determine if context reliance is architecture-dependent.
3. Conduct ablation studies where scene-level objects are artificially added/removed in controlled image synthesis to validate the accuracy-based measurement approach.
