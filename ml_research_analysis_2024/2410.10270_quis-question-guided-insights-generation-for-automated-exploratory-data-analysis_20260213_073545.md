# QUIS: Question-guided Insights Generation for Automated Exploratory Data Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.10270
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10270
- Reference count: 16
- Primary result: QUIS is a fully automated EDA system that generates insights without predefined goals or human intervention through iterative question generation and statistical analysis

## Executive Summary
QUIS is a fully automated system for exploratory data analysis (EDA) that generates insights without requiring predefined goals or human intervention. It operates in two stages: question generation (QUGen) and insight generation (ISGen). QUGen iteratively creates dataset-specific questions using data semantics, while ISGen analyzes data to produce multiple relevant insights per question through statistical analysis and classical search techniques. The system eliminates the need for manually curated examples or prior training. Human evaluation across three datasets showed QUIS outperformed a purely statistical baseline in relevance, comprehensibility, and informativeness, with consistently higher insight scores. The iterative question generation process also produced more diverse insight cards compared to non-iterative approaches.

## Method Summary
QUIS operates through a two-stage process where QUGen generates questions iteratively using data semantics and previously generated insights as in-context examples, while ISGen analyzes data to produce insights through statistical tests and beam search. The system uses predefined insight patterns (Trend, Outstanding Value, Attribution, Distribution Difference) with scoring functions based on statistical tests like Mann-Kendall and Jensen-Shannon divergence. QUGen refines questions across 10 iterations using sampling temperature t=1.1 and sampling rate s=3, while ISGen employs beam search with width 100 to find meaningful subspaces matching the patterns. The complete pipeline generates Insight Cards containing questions, reasons, breakdown, measure, and insights with natural language descriptions and visualizations.

## Key Results
- QUIS outperformed the ONLYSTATS baseline in human evaluation across three datasets on relevance, comprehensibility, and informativeness
- Iterative question generation produced more diverse insight cards compared to non-iterative approaches
- ISGen successfully identified insights using statistical analysis without requiring prior training or model fine-tuning
- The system generated comprehensive insights covering all four predefined patterns (Trend, Outstanding Value, Attribution, Distribution Difference)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Iterative question generation with in-context examples improves insight coverage and diversity
- Mechanism: QUGen iteratively generates questions using previously generated Insight Cards as in-context examples, refining subsequent generations to be more diverse and comprehensive
- Core assumption: Language models can effectively use in-context examples to generate diverse questions when provided with context from previous iterations
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The QUGen module generates questions in iterations, refining them from previous iterations to enhance coverage without human intervention or manually curated examples"
  - [section 3.1.2]: "QUGen is iterative in nature... uses subset of Insight Cards generated until the current iteration as in-context examples in the prompt for the next iteration"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus contains related work on automated EDA but no direct evidence about iterative question generation with in-context examples

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Statistical analysis with classical search techniques enables insight discovery without requiring model training
- Mechanism: ISGen uses predefined scoring functions based on statistical tests (Mann-Kendall, Kruskal-Wallis, Jensen-Shannon divergence) and beam search to find meaningful insights matching predefined patterns
- Core assumption: Statistical patterns in data can be effectively captured by predefined scoring functions and thresholds without requiring model training
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The ISGen module analyzes data to produce multiple relevant insights in response to each question, requiring no prior training and enabling QUIS to adapt to new datasets"
  - [section 3.2]: "To determine whether a combination of B, M, and S reveals a particular pattern P, the module uses scoring functions based on data statistics and applies appropriate thresholds"
  - [section A]: Detailed scoring functions for Trend, Outstanding Value, Attribution, and Distribution Difference patterns

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Question-driven insight generation produces more relevant and comprehensible insights than purely statistical approaches
- Mechanism: QUIS uses LLM-generated questions based on data semantics to guide the insight generation process, producing insights that are more contextually relevant than those from statistical methods alone
- Core assumption: Questions generated from data semantics provide better guidance for insight discovery than statistical measures alone
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "QUIS is a fully automated EDA system that operates in two stages: insight generation (ISGen) driven by question generation (QUGen)"
  - [section 4]: Human evaluation shows QUIS outperformed ONLYSTATS (purely statistical baseline) in relevance, comprehensibility, and informativeness across two datasets
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus contains related work on automated EDA but no direct evidence comparing question-driven vs. purely statistical approaches

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and insight generation
  - Why needed here: Understanding what constitutes an insight and how EDA systems work is fundamental to grasping QUIS's approach
  - Quick check question: What are the four components of an insight in QUIS (Perspective, Subspace, Pattern)?

- Concept: Statistical pattern detection and scoring functions
  - Why needed here: ISGen relies on statistical tests and scoring functions to identify patterns in data
  - Quick check question: Which statistical test does QUIS use to detect trends in data?

- Concept: Large Language Models and in-context learning
  - Why needed here: QUGen uses LLMs with in-context examples to generate questions iteratively
  - Quick check question: How does QUGen use previously generated Insight Cards to improve subsequent question generation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: QUGen -> ISGen -> Post-processing
- Critical path: QUGen generates questions → ISGen analyzes data based on questions → Post-processing creates final insights with natural language descriptions and visualizations
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Iterative vs. one-shot question generation: Iterative approach improves coverage but increases computation time
  - Statistical vs. LLM-based approaches: Statistical methods are efficient but may miss semantic context; LLM methods capture semantics but are resource-intensive
  - Predefined patterns vs. open-ended discovery: Predefined patterns ensure quality but may limit unexpected findings
- Failure signatures:
  - QUGen produces irrelevant or repetitive questions
  - ISGen fails to find meaningful insights despite valid questions
  - Post-processing generates incorrect or misleading natural language descriptions
  - System performance degrades significantly on larger datasets
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run QUGen on a simple dataset (e.g., Iris) and verify it generates diverse, relevant questions
  2. Test ISGen with a known insight pattern (e.g., trend) and verify it correctly identifies the pattern
  3. Run the complete QUIS pipeline on a medium-sized dataset and evaluate the quality and diversity of generated insights

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would the QUIS system perform on larger, more complex datasets with hundreds of columns and millions of rows?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that ADE systems become increasingly challenging as the number of features increases, and that QUIS is evaluated on three relatively small datasets
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests QUIS on three small datasets (Sales, Adidas Sale, Employee Attrition) without exploring its scalability to larger, more complex datasets
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance evaluation of QUIS on large-scale datasets with hundreds of columns and millions of rows, comparing execution time, memory usage, and insight quality against baseline systems

### Open Question 2
- Question: How sensitive is the QUIS system to the choice of parameters such as sampling temperature, number of iterations, and beam width?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions specific parameter values used in experiments (sampling temperature t=1.1, sampling rate s=3, number of iterations n=10, beam_width=100) but does not explore sensitivity analysis
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any sensitivity analysis or ablation studies to understand how different parameter choices affect the system's performance
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying each parameter independently while keeping others constant, measuring the impact on insight quality, diversity, and computational efficiency

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does QUIS handle real-time data streams where the dataset schema or content changes dynamically?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper describes QUIS as adapting to new datasets but focuses on static tabular data analysis without addressing streaming scenarios
- Why unresolved: The paper does not discuss how the system would handle continuously updating data or schema changes over time
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation of a streaming version of QUIS that can process incremental updates, maintain context across updates, and generate insights in real-time as new data arrives

## Limitations

- System relies on predefined insight patterns which may miss unexpected or novel insights
- Scalability to large datasets (millions of rows) remains untested and potentially problematic
- Performance depends on parameter choices without sensitivity analysis or optimization guidance

## Confidence

- Confidence: Medium - While QUIS demonstrates strong performance on three datasets, the evaluation relies entirely on human judgment without quantitative metrics or statistical significance testing
- Confidence: Medium - The system's reliance on predefined insight patterns represents a fundamental limitation that may miss unexpected findings
- Confidence: Low - The scalability analysis is limited to relatively small datasets without testing on large-scale data or streaming scenarios

## Next Checks

1. **Statistical Significance Testing**: Conduct t-tests or ANOVA on human evaluation scores across the three datasets to determine if QUIS's improvements over ONLYSTATS are statistically significant rather than just qualitatively better

2. **Scalability Benchmark**: Test QUIS on progressively larger datasets (10K, 100K, 1M rows) to identify performance bottlenecks and evaluate whether the iterative question generation process remains effective at scale

3. **Pattern Coverage Analysis**: Systematically catalog insights missed by QUIS that don't fit the four predefined patterns, then measure what percentage of potentially interesting insights are captured by the current pattern set
