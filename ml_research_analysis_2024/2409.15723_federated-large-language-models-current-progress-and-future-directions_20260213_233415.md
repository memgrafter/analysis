## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive overview of federated learning for large language models (FedLLM), focusing on fine-tuning and prompt learning in decentralized settings. It addresses challenges including data and model heterogeneity, privacy and security concerns, and communication efficiency. The paper reviews existing work across multiple domains: federated fine-tuning techniques (such as LoRA, personalization, and parameter-efficient methods), prompt-based learning approaches for reduced communication costs, and applications spanning multilingual processing to medical VQA. Key findings include the effectiveness of parameter-efficient fine-tuning in reducing communication overhead, the potential of prompt learning for privacy-preserving adaptation, and emerging directions such as federated AI agents and synthetic data generation.

## Method Summary
The survey synthesizes existing research on federated learning for large language models by categorizing approaches into fine-tuning techniques and prompt learning methods. It examines how parameter-efficient methods like LoRA reduce communication overhead, how prompt-based approaches enable privacy-preserving adaptation, and how federated learning enables collaborative training without sharing raw data. The methodology involves reviewing literature across multiple domains including multilingual processing, medical applications, and multimodal integration, while identifying key challenges and proposing future research directions.

## Key Results
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA significantly reduce communication overhead in federated learning for large language models
- Prompt-based learning approaches enable privacy-preserving adaptation of LLMs with reduced communication costs
- Federated learning enables collaborative training of LLMs without sharing raw data, addressing privacy concerns in sensitive domains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA significantly reduce communication overhead in federated learning for large language models.
- Mechanism: By freezing most of the model parameters and only training small, low-rank adapter matrices, the number of parameters that need to be transmitted between clients and the server is drastically reduced. This enables efficient fine-tuning of LLMs in resource-constrained federated settings.
- Core assumption: The low-rank adapter matrices capture the necessary domain-specific knowledge without requiring full model updates.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The effectiveness of parameter-efficient fine-tuning in reducing communication overhead"
  - [section 2.3] "Several existing papers have explored parameter-efficient learning methods for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) in federated learning (FL) [80]. These methods address the communication, computation, and storage constraints of edge devices, making federated training more efficient."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct mention of LoRA or parameter-efficient methods in corpus neighbors.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Prompt-based learning approaches enable privacy-preserving adaptation of LLMs in federated settings with reduced communication costs.
- Mechanism: Instead of fine-tuning the entire model, only soft prompts (small trainable parameters) are optimized on each client. These prompts are then aggregated on the server to create a globally effective prompt without sharing raw data or large model updates.
- Core assumption: The prompt space captures sufficient task-specific information to adapt the pre-trained LLM effectively.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the potential of prompt learning for privacy-preserving adaptation"
  - [section 3] "Prompt learning, which fine-tunes soft prompts without altering LLMs, emerges as a promising method to reduce communication costs, as shown in Table 3."
  - [corpus] No direct mention of prompt-based learning in corpus neighbors.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Federated learning enables collaborative training of LLMs without sharing raw data, addressing privacy concerns in sensitive domains.
- Mechanism: Multiple clients train local models on their private data and only share model updates (e.g., gradients or parameters) with a central server. The server aggregates these updates to create a global model that benefits from the collective knowledge without exposing individual data.
- Core assumption: The model updates do not leak sensitive information about the private data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Federated learning offers a solution by allowing multiple clients to collaboratively train LLMs without sharing local data."
  - [section 1] "Federated learning offers a solution by allowing decentralized model training, where participants collaborate without sharing raw data. Instead, only model updates are exchanged, reducing privacy risks while benefiting from a collective, diverse dataset."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct mention of federated learning in corpus neighbors.

## Foundational Learning

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Clients -> Local data, LLM (frozen), parameter-efficient adapters/prompts -> Server -> Global model, aggregation logic, communication protocols -> Communication -> Model updates, gradients, or prompts exchanged between clients and server -> Privacy -> Mechanisms to protect sensitive information during federated training

- Critical path: 1. Initialize global LLM and distribute to clients 2. Clients fine-tune local adapters/prompts on private data 3. Clients send updates to server 4. Server aggregates updates to create new global model 5. Repeat steps 2-4 for multiple rounds

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Communication efficiency vs. model performance
  - Privacy preservation vs. data utility
  - Centralized aggregation vs. decentralized approaches
  - Full model updates vs. parameter-efficient methods

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor model performance despite multiple training rounds
  - Communication bottlenecks or excessive resource consumption
  - Privacy breaches or sensitive information leakage
  - Clients diverging or failing to converge to a common solution

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement and evaluate LoRA-based federated fine-tuning on a small-scale LLM and dataset
  2. Compare the performance and communication overhead of full fine-tuning vs. parameter-efficient methods in a federated setting
  3. Assess the privacy guarantees of federated learning by attempting to reconstruct private data from model updates

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Limitations

- The survey does not provide comprehensive quantitative comparisons of different federated fine-tuning methods
- Privacy guarantees are discussed conceptually without detailed threat model analysis or empirical privacy-utility trade-off measurements
- Real-world deployment challenges are identified but not thoroughly explored with case studies or production-level experiments

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The general framework of federated learning for LLMs and the identification of core challenges (data heterogeneity, privacy concerns, communication efficiency) are well-established in the literature.
- Medium Confidence: The proposed solutions such as LoRA and prompt learning show promise based on related work, but specific performance metrics and comparative studies in federated settings are not extensively validated in this survey.
- Low Confidence: Some emerging directions like federated AI agents and synthetic data generation lack concrete implementation details or empirical validation in the survey context.

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical Validation Study**: Conduct controlled experiments comparing LoRA-based federated fine-tuning against full fine-tuning across different data heterogeneity scenarios, measuring both performance and communication efficiency.

2. **Privacy Analysis Framework**: Implement membership inference attacks on federated model updates to quantify actual privacy leakage, then evaluate whether proposed defense mechanisms (like gradient compression or differential privacy) effectively mitigate these risks.

3. **Cross-Domain Benchmarking**: Create a unified benchmark suite that evaluates federated LLM methods across diverse domains (multilingual, medical, code generation) to assess generalizability and identify domain-specific challenges.
