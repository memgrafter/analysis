# Reduced Effectiveness of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks on Functions with Noise

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.14882
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14882
- Reference count: 33
- KANs show significantly higher sensitivity to noise compared to MLPs

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the performance degradation of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) when training data contains noise, demonstrating that KANs are significantly more sensitive to noise than traditional MLPs. The authors propose two mitigation strategies: kernel filtering and data oversampling. Experiments show that increasing training dataset size is more effective than kernel filtering for improving KAN performance on noisy data, with test loss asymptotically decreasing as O(r^-1/2) when increasing samples by factor r. However, both methods have limitations - kernel filtering requires SNR-dependent parameter tuning, while oversampling increases computational costs significantly. The paper concludes that noise fundamentally diminishes KAN effectiveness, requiring further research to develop robust variants.

## Method Summary
The paper evaluates KAN performance on six synthetic test functions with added Gaussian noise, comparing against MLPs. Two mitigation strategies are proposed: kernel filtering using a Gaussian-like kernel with parameter σ, and data oversampling by increasing training dataset size. The authors systematically test various noise levels and training sample sizes, measuring test loss (RMSE) to quantify performance degradation. They analyze the asymptotic behavior of test loss as a function of training data quantity, finding that it decreases as O(r^-1/2) when increasing samples by factor r. The experiments are conducted across different functions to assess generalizability of the findings.

## Key Results
- KANs exhibit significantly higher sensitivity to noise than MLPs, with test loss increasing substantially even with small amounts of Gaussian noise
- Test loss decreases asymptotically as O(r^-1/2) when training sample size is increased by factor r
- Kernel filtering effectiveness depends on proper σ tuning, which requires knowledge of the signal-to-noise ratio that is typically unknown in practice
- Data oversampling is more effective than kernel filtering but comes with substantial computational cost increases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper doesn't provide a theoretical mechanism explaining why KANs are more sensitive to noise than MLPs. The authors observe that KANs' nested smooth functions struggle with non-smooth functions containing added noise, but don't provide rigorous mathematical proof comparing noise propagation through KAN versus MLP architectures.

## Foundational Learning
- **Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)**: A type of neural network that uses learnable spline functions instead of fixed activation functions. Needed to understand the core architecture being evaluated. Quick check: Verify understanding of how KANs differ from traditional MLPs in their functional composition.
- **Gaussian noise addition**: The process of adding random noise following a normal distribution to training data. Needed to create controlled noisy datasets for evaluation. Quick check: Confirm ability to generate Gaussian noise with specified mean and variance.
- **Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)**: A measure comparing the level of signal power to noise power. Needed to characterize different noise conditions and their impact on model performance. Quick check: Calculate SNR for given signal and noise parameters.
- **Kernel filtering**: A smoothing technique that applies a kernel function to reduce noise in data. Needed to understand one of the proposed mitigation strategies. Quick check: Implement basic kernel filtering with different kernel widths.
- **Asymptotic analysis**: The study of limiting behavior of functions as inputs approach certain values. Needed to understand the O(r^-1/2) relationship between training samples and test loss. Quick check: Verify asymptotic behavior of test loss with increasing training samples.
- **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: A standard metric for measuring prediction accuracy. Needed to quantify model performance across different noise conditions. Quick check: Calculate RMSE between predicted and true values.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Data Generation -> Noise Addition -> KAN Training -> Test Loss Evaluation -> Mitigation Strategy Application -> Performance Comparison

**Critical Path:**
The critical path involves generating clean data, adding controlled noise, training KANs with varying parameters, evaluating test loss, applying mitigation strategies, and comparing performance across different noise levels and training sizes.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- KANs offer more flexible functional representations but are more sensitive to noise
- Kernel filtering can reduce noise but requires SNR-dependent parameter tuning
- Data oversampling improves performance but increases computational costs significantly
- Simpler architectures (MLPs) show better noise robustness but may lack expressive power

**Failure Signatures:**
- KANs failing to converge even on noise-free data indicates issues with network structure or training hyperparameters
- Excessive test loss with kernel filtering suggests inappropriate σ values (either oversmoothing or undersmoothing)
- Insufficient test loss reduction with oversampling may indicate problems with data generation or implementation

**First Experiments:**
1. Implement KAN with specified structure for one test function, train on noise-free data to establish baseline performance
2. Add Gaussian noise to training data with varying SNR levels, train KANs and record test loss degradation
3. Apply kernel filtering with different σ values to noisy data, retrain KANs and compare performance against baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. What is the theoretical explanation for why KANs are more sensitive to noise than MLPs, given their similar functional compositions? The paper observes this phenomenon but doesn't provide rigorous mathematical proof comparing noise sensitivity across architectures.

2. Can we develop an adaptive method to automatically determine the optimal kernel filtering parameter σ without prior knowledge of the signal-to-noise ratio? The paper notes that determining optimal σ is challenging because it depends nonlinearly on SNR, which is typically unknown in real-world applications.

3. Is there a fundamental limit to how much oversampling can improve KAN performance on noisy data, and how does this limit relate to the function's smoothness properties? The paper shows test loss decreases as O(r^-1/2) with increased samples but doesn't explore whether this is the theoretical limit or what determines this rate.

## Limitations
- Experiments focus on synthetic test functions rather than real-world datasets, limiting generalizability
- Proposed mitigation strategies have practical constraints (SNR-dependent parameter tuning, computational costs)
- Claims about KANs being "fundamentally limited" by noise are overstated given narrow scope of test functions examined

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: KANs exhibit greater noise sensitivity than MLPs, and test loss decreases as O(r^-1/2) with increased training samples
- **Medium confidence**: Kernel filtering effectiveness depends on proper σ tuning, but the paper doesn't provide clear guidelines for this optimization
- **Low confidence**: Claims about KANs being "fundamentally limited" by noise are overstated given the narrow scope of test functions examined

## Next Checks
1. Test KANs on real-world noisy datasets (e.g., sensor measurements, image data) to verify if findings extend beyond synthetic functions
2. Implement automated parameter tuning for kernel filtering to reduce dependence on known SNR values
3. Compare computational efficiency of KANs with noise mitigation strategies against standard MLPs across various noise levels to assess practical viability
