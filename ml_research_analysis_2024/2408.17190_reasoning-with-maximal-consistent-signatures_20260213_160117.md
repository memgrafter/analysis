# Reasoning with maximal consistent signatures

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.17190
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17190
- Reference count: 26
- Primary result: Proposes reasoning with maximal consistent subsignatures as an approach to inconsistency-tolerant reasoning

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces reasoning with maximal consistent subsignatures as a method for handling inconsistent knowledge bases. The key innovation is to define maximal consistent subsignatures as maximal sets of propositions whose removal restores consistency through a forgetting operator. This approach provides a signature-based alternative to classical subset-based reasoning, avoiding syntactic dependencies while maintaining similar structural properties. The framework is shown to be a specific instance of Lang and Marquis's forgetting framework and demonstrates interesting connections to paraconsistent logic.

## Method Summary
The method defines maximal consistent subsignatures as maximal sets of propositions such that forgetting the remaining propositions from the knowledge base restores consistency. Two forgetting operators are analyzed: variable elimination (⊟ ve) and naive forgetting (⊟ na). The approach leverages the hitting set duality between minimal inconsistent and maximal consistent subsignatures, enabling dual reasoning perspectives. Inference relations based on these subsignatures are defined and their properties investigated, including compliance with rationality postulates from non-monotonic reasoning. The naive forgetting operator is shown to be equivalent to reasoning in Priest's 3-valued paraconsistent logic.

## Key Results
- Maximal consistent subsignatures provide a syntax-independent alternative to subset-based reasoning
- The hitting set duality carries over from subsets to subsignatures, enabling dual reasoning perspectives
- Reasoning with naive forgetting operator is equivalent to Priest's paraconsistent logic
- Various computational complexity results are established for reasoning tasks (NP, coNP, DP, ΣP₂, ΠP₂)
- New inconsistency measures based on minimal inconsistent and maximal consistent subsignatures are proposed

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Reasoning with maximal consistent subsignatures avoids syntactic dependencies of classical subset-based reasoning
- Mechanism: Instead of tracking maximal consistent subsets of formulas, the method tracks maximal sets of propositions whose removal restores consistency. This abstracts away from formula structure and focuses on the propositional level.
- Core assumption: Forgetting operator preserves consistency restoration and satisfies the five properties in Definition 2
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "a maximal consistent subsignature is a maximal set of propositions such that forgetting the remaining propositions restores consistency"
  - [section]: "reasoning with maximal consistent subsets is highly syntax-dependent... {a, ¬ a, c}| ∼mc i c but {a, ¬ a ∧ c}̸| ∼mc i c"
- Break condition: If forgetting operator violates any of Definition 2 properties, consistency restoration fails

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Hitting set duality between minimal inconsistent and maximal consistent subsignatures enables dual reasoning perspectives
- Mechanism: Minimal inconsistent subsignatures and maximal consistent subsignatures form a hitting set duality, allowing one to be derived from the other. This duality mirrors the subset-based case but at the signature level.
- Core assumption: The forgetting operator satisfies Definition 2 properties that preserve this duality
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we obtain a technical framework that is quite similar to the framework of maximal consistent subsets and minimal inconsistent subsets, but also features some additional interesting properties"
  - [section]: "the classical hitting set duality [17] carries over to maximal consistent subsignatures as well"
- Break condition: If forgetting operator doesn't preserve the duality structure

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Paraconsistent reasoning equivalence provides computational advantage
- Mechanism: Reasoning with maximal consistent subsignatures using the naive forgetting operator is equivalent to Priest's 3-valued paraconsistent logic, enabling use of established paraconsistent reasoning methods
- Core assumption: The naive forgetting operator (⊟ na) properly models the truth-value gap/burst mechanism of Priest's logic
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "using a specific approach to forgetting, reasoning based on forgetting is equivalent to a specific paraconsistent logic, namely Priest's 3-valued logic"
  - [section]: "reasoning with maximal consistent subsignatures based on a naive approach to forgetting is equivalent to reasoning with Priest's paraconsistent logic"
- Break condition: If naive forgetting operator doesn't properly model the paraconsistent semantics

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Forgetting operators and their properties
  - Why needed here: The entire framework depends on specific properties of forgetting operators to restore consistency
  - Quick check question: What are the five required properties of a forgetting operator according to Definition 2?

- Concept: Hitting set duality
  - Why needed here: The duality between minimal inconsistent and maximal consistent subsignatures is a key structural property
  - Quick check question: How does the hitting set duality for subsignatures relate to the duality for subsets?

- Concept: Computational complexity classes (NP, coNP, DP, ΣP₂, ΠP₂)
  - Why needed here: Understanding the complexity results for various reasoning tasks is essential for implementation decisions
  - Quick check question: What complexity class contains problems that are the intersection of an NP and a coNP problem?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Forgetting operator module -> Subs signature analysis module -> Reasoning module
- Critical path: input KB -> projection onto maximal consistent subsignatures -> consistency check -> inference computation
- Design tradeoffs: The naive forgetting operator (⊟ na) provides better consistency restoration but may be more computationally expensive than variable elimination (⊟ ve)
- Failure signatures: Inconsistency persists after forgetting → check forgetting operator properties; hitting set duality violation → check forgetting operator implementation; unexpected inference results → verify subsignature computation
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement and test the two forgetting operators (⊟ ve and ⊟ na) on simple knowledge bases
  2. Verify the hitting set duality holds for computed MISig and MCSig
  3. Compare inference results between the two forgetting operators on inconsistent knowledge bases

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different forgetting operators beyond ⊟ ve and ⊟ na perform in the context of maximal consistent subsignatures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "For future work, we intend to investigate further operators, but for the remainder of this paper, we restrict ourselves to statements on those two operators and some general statements, where such are possible."
- Why unresolved: The paper only analyzes two specific forgetting operators and defers investigation of other operators to future work.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic comparison of various forgetting operators (e.g., those satisfying different properties) applied to maximal consistent subsignatures, measuring their performance on consistency restoration, inference preservation, and computational efficiency.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the framework of maximal consistent subsignatures be extended to stratified knowledge bases or prioritized reasoning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions "A further possible venue for future work is to develop signature-based variants of reasoning methods based on maximal consistent subsets other than the classical approach of Rescher and Manor [18]. For example, Konieczny et al. [9] propose inference relations that only consider some of the maximal consistent subsets of a knowledge base, where the consideration of maximal consistent subsets is determined by a scoring function. Adapting those scoring functions for maximal consistent subsignatures will therefore give rise to further inference relations. Moreover, the reasoning approach of Brewka [5], who considers stratified knowledge bases—i.e. knowledge bases where formulas are ranked according to their preference—, can also be cast into our framework by considering stratified signatures."
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges this as a potential direction but does not explore it.
- What evidence would resolve it: Formal definitions and analysis of stratified signatures and their corresponding reasoning mechanisms, including comparison with existing stratified approaches.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the relationship between the inconsistency measures based on minimal inconsistent and maximal consistent subsignatures and existing measures in the literature?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper defines new inconsistency measures (IMISig, IMISig-C, IMCSig, IP) based on subsignatures and states "We leave a further investigation of the above measures for future work."
- Why unresolved: The paper introduces the measures but does not analyze their properties or compare them to existing measures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing the new measures with established measures (e.g., those based on subsets) on various benchmark knowledge bases, analyzing their behavior in terms of sensitivity to different types of inconsistencies and correlation with human judgments of inconsistency severity.

## Limitations

- The paper only analyzes two specific forgetting operators, leaving open questions about other potential operators
- Practical implementation details for the variable elimination operation are not fully specified
- The equivalence to Priest's paraconsistent logic requires careful implementation verification
- No empirical evaluation of the approach on real-world knowledge bases is provided

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The theoretical framework for maximal consistent subsignatures, their duality with minimal inconsistent subsignatures, and the basic inference relations
- Medium Confidence: The complexity results and their implications for practical implementation, as these depend on specific algorithmic details not fully specified
- Low Confidence: The practical equivalence to Priest's paraconsistent logic, as this requires careful implementation of the naive forgetting operator to verify

## Next Checks

1. **Implement and Verify Forgetting Operators**: Create implementations of both ⊟ ve and ⊟ na operators and test them on simple knowledge bases to verify they satisfy the five required properties from Definition 2. Start with propositional Horn clauses and progress to more complex formulas.

2. **Validate Hitting Set Duality**: Implement algorithms to compute both MISig and MCSig for various knowledge bases and verify the hitting set duality relationship holds in practice. Use small knowledge bases where manual verification is possible.

3. **Test Inference Relation Properties**: Implement the inference relations |∼⊟ i and |∼⊟ w and systematically verify they satisfy the rationality postulates (reflexivity, left logical equivalence, right weakening, cut, cautious monotonicity) across multiple test cases.
