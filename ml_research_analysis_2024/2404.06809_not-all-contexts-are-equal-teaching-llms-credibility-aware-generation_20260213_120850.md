# Not All Contexts Are Equal: Teaching LLMs Credibility-aware Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.06809
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06809
- Reference count: 23
- Key outcome: CAG-7B achieves 0.509 EM on 2WikiMHQA vs. 0.280 for vanilla LLaMA-2-7B

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical challenge in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems: the quality and reliability of retrieved contexts. Existing RAG approaches often suffer from noisy, outdated, or incorrect information that undermines generation reliability. The authors introduce Credibility-aware Generation (CAG), a framework that explicitly incorporates credibility assessments into the generation process by assigning credibility levels to retrieved documents based on relevance, timeliness, and source reliability.

The framework includes a data transformation approach that converts existing QA datasets into credibility-annotated data through multi-granularity annotation and credibility-guided explanation generation. This enables instruction fine-tuning to teach models to generate responses based on credibility assessments. Comprehensive experiments across seven datasets demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods, with CAG models showing particular robustness against increasing noise ratios and strong generalization capabilities.

## Method Summary
The Credibility-aware Generation framework addresses flawed information in RAG by assigning credibility levels to retrieved documents based on three key dimensions: relevance, timeliness, and source reliability. The approach involves transforming existing QA datasets into credibility-annotated data through a multi-step process that includes multi-granularity annotation and credibility-guided explanation generation. This transformed data is then used for instruction fine-tuning to teach LLMs to generate responses that are sensitive to the credibility of their input contexts. The framework includes a comprehensive benchmark covering open-domain QA, time-sensitive QA, and misinformation-polluted scenarios, and demonstrates significant performance improvements over baseline methods across seven datasets.

## Key Results
- CAG-7B achieves 0.509 EM on 2WikiMHQA compared to 0.280 for vanilla LLaMA-2-7B
- CAG exhibits strong robustness against increasing noise ratios, maintaining performance while other methods degrade
- The approach generalizes to unseen scenarios and supports customized credibility for applications like personalized responses
- CAG significantly outperforms retrieval-based, reranking, and credibility-aware baselines across seven datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from explicitly incorporating credibility signals into the generation process rather than treating all retrieved contexts equally. By teaching models to weight information based on its credibility dimensions (relevance, timeliness, source reliability), CAG enables more reliable generation that can distinguish between high-quality and problematic contexts. The data transformation approach creates a training signal that allows models to learn credibility-aware patterns, while the multi-granularity annotation captures credibility at different levels of granularity. This mechanism addresses the fundamental limitation of standard RAG systems that fail to account for the varying quality and reliability of retrieved information.

## Foundational Learning
- Credibility Assessment in RAG: Understanding how to evaluate the quality of retrieved contexts is crucial for building reliable generation systems. Quick check: Can you identify the three dimensions used to assess credibility in this framework?
- Data Transformation for Instruction Tuning: Converting existing datasets into annotated formats enables training models with new capabilities without requiring entirely new data collection. Quick check: What are the two main components of the data transformation process?
- Multi-granularity Annotation: Capturing information at different levels of detail allows for more nuanced understanding and processing. Quick check: Why is multi-granularity annotation important for credibility assessment?
- Noise Robustness in LLMs: Understanding how models maintain performance under varying noise conditions is essential for real-world deployment. Quick check: How does CAG maintain performance under increasing noise compared to baseline methods?
- Cross-lingual Generalization: Assessing whether approaches developed for one language context work in others is critical for broader applicability. Quick check: What limitations exist regarding the framework's applicability to non-English datasets?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Retrieval System -> Credibility Assessment -> Data Transformation -> Instruction Fine-tuning -> Credibility-aware Generation

Critical Path: The core workflow involves retrieving documents, assessing their credibility across relevance, timeliness, and source reliability dimensions, transforming existing QA datasets to include credibility annotations, and fine-tuning models to generate responses based on these credibility signals.

Design Tradeoffs: The framework trades increased computational overhead and annotation complexity for improved generation reliability and robustness. The automatic annotation approach reduces costs but may sacrifice some nuance compared to human annotation. The framework prioritizes accuracy and reliability over speed, which may impact real-time deployment scenarios.

Failure Signatures: Models may fail when credibility signals are ambiguous or conflicting, when noise overwhelms credibility assessments, or when the framework encounters contexts that fall outside the distribution of training data. Performance degradation is most likely in extreme noise conditions or when credibility dimensions are poorly defined.

3 First Experiments:
1. Compare CAG performance against baseline RAG on a simple open-domain QA dataset with controlled noise injection
2. Conduct ablation studies removing individual credibility dimensions to quantify their individual contributions
3. Test framework performance on a non-English dataset to assess cross-lingual generalization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Dependence on high-quality credibility annotations, which are expensive to obtain through human annotation
- Primary evaluation focus on English-language datasets, raising questions about cross-lingual applicability
- Unclear performance under extreme noise conditions beyond tested ratios
- Computational overhead from credibility assessment may impact real-time deployment scenarios

## Confidence
- CAG's effectiveness in improving generation quality: High confidence
- Robustness against noise: Medium confidence
- Generalization to unseen scenarios: Medium confidence
- Framework applicability to personalized contexts: Low confidence

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework's performance on non-English datasets and cross-lingual scenarios to assess generalizability across languages and cultural contexts.

2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of each credibility dimension (relevance, timeliness, source reliability) to overall performance improvements.

3. Evaluate computational overhead and latency impacts of the credibility assessment pipeline in real-time deployment scenarios, comparing against baseline RAG implementations.
