# RW-NSGCN: A Robust Approach to Structural Attacks via Negative Sampling

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2408.06665
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06665
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** RW-NSGCN achieves 79.66% accuracy on Cora and 69.37% on CiteSeer, outperforming existing methods on node classification under topological and weight perturbations.

## Executive Summary
RW-NSGCN addresses topological vulnerabilities and weight instability in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) during node classification. The method integrates Random Walk with Restart (RWR) and PageRank (PGR) for negative sampling, combined with a Determinantal Point Process (DPP)-based GCN for convolution operations. This approach leverages global and local information to manage noise and local variations, while PGR assesses node importance to stabilize the topological structure. Experimental results show significant improvements in classification accuracy and resilience across various attack scenarios.

## Method Summary
RW-NSGCN combines RWR and PGR algorithms for negative sampling and employs a DPP-based GCN for convolution operations. The method first computes shortest-path sets for all nodes, then ranks candidate negative nodes using a composite RWR+PGR score. DPP sampling ensures diversity among negative nodes based on feature and community similarity. In each GCN layer, node embeddings are updated by subtracting λ times the negative aggregation from positive aggregation, producing robust node embeddings that improve classification performance.

## Key Results
- Achieves 79.66% accuracy on Cora and 69.37% on CiteSeer datasets
- Demonstrates greater resilience to topological and weight perturbations
- Significantly outperforms existing methods in classification accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Combining RWR and PageRank improves negative sampling by capturing both local and global node importance.
- Mechanism: RWR explores multi-hop paths from each node, smoothing noise in local neighborhoods, while PageRank evaluates global importance. Their combination yields a composite score for selecting negative samples that are both structurally relevant and globally significant.
- Core assumption: Non-adjacent nodes that are globally important or reachable via meaningful paths are more informative as negative samples than randomly chosen nodes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "RW-NSGCN integrates the Random Walk with Restart (RWR) and PageRank (PGR) algorithms for negative sampling"
  - [section]: "RWR leverages both global and local information to manage noise and local variations, while PGR assesses node importance to stabilize the topological structure"
  - [corpus]: No direct mention of RWR+PageRank integration in corpus papers; weak external support.
- Break condition: If RWR fails to capture meaningful local structure (e.g., in very sparse graphs), the combined score may misrank negative samples.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: DPP-based GCN enforces diversity among negative samples, preventing over-representation of similar nodes.
- Mechanism: DPP uses a kernel matrix built from node feature similarity, community similarity, and central-node-community similarity to sample a subset of negative nodes that are both representative and diverse.
- Core assumption: Diverse negative samples better approximate the true negative space, reducing model bias and over-smoothing.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The DPP-based GCN ensures diversity among negative samples and aggregates their features to produce robust node embeddings"
  - [section]: "The obtained negative samples of DPP are mainly used in the GCN messaging phase... ensuring that the selected node subset is discrete in the feature space"
  - [corpus]: No explicit corpus evidence of DPP in negative sampling for GNNs; weak external support.
- Break condition: If the similarity matrices are poorly computed (e.g., noisy features), DPP may select irrelevant negative samples.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Incorporating information from non-adjacent nodes via shortest-path-based negative sampling captures global graph structure, improving robustness to topological perturbations.
- Mechanism: Shortest-path distances identify non-adjacent nodes; RWR+PageRank scores rank them; DPP selects a diverse subset; these nodes' features are then used in the GCN update.
- Core assumption: Non-adjacent nodes can carry complementary information that mitigates the effect of edge removal or weight changes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "RW-NSGCN integrates... algorithms for negative sampling and employs a Determinantal Point Process (DPP)-based GCN for convolution operations"
  - [section]: "By integrating critical node information from non-neighbor nodes at different distances, nodes can capture multi-scale features and acquire diverse information from local to global perspectives"
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence in corpus papers of using shortest-path-derived non-adjacent nodes for negative sampling; weak external support.
- Break condition: In highly disconnected graphs, shortest-path sets may be empty or uninformative, nullifying this mechanism.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Graph Neural Networks and message passing**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how GCN aggregates neighbor features is prerequisite to seeing why negative sampling and non-adjacent node inclusion matter.
  - Quick check question: In a GCN layer, how are node features updated using the adjacency matrix?

- **Concept: Random Walk with Restart (RWR) and PageRank**
  - Why needed here: RWR and PageRank are the core algorithms for ranking nodes globally and locally; knowing their mechanics is essential to grasp the negative sampling strategy.
  - Quick check question: What is the main difference between RWR and standard PageRank in terms of restart probability?

- **Concept: Determinantal Point Processes (DPP)**
  - Why needed here: DPP is used to enforce diversity in negative samples; understanding how similarity matrices define repulsion is key to the sampling step.
  - Quick check question: In DPP, how does a high similarity between two items affect their joint inclusion probability?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Graph G=(V,E), node features X -> Shortest paths -> Nl(vi) sets -> RWR+PGR scores -> DPP sampling -> Diverse negative nodes -> GCN layers (positive + negative aggregation) -> Updated node embeddings

- **Critical path:**
  1. Build shortest-path sets Nl(vi) for all nodes.
  2. Compute composite RWR+PGR scores for each candidate node.
  3. Construct DPP kernel matrix from similarity measures.
  4. Sample diverse negative nodes via DPP.
  5. In each GCN layer, update node embeddings by subtracting λ × (negative aggregation) from positive aggregation.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Computational cost: Shortest-path computation and DPP sampling can be expensive on large graphs.
  - Parameter tuning: λ balances positive/negative contributions; too high may erase useful signals.
  - Sampling strategy: Using fixed Lmax limits flexibility; adaptive path lengths could improve coverage.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Over-smoothing: High λ or too many negative samples cause node embeddings to collapse.
  - Degenerate DPP: Poorly chosen similarity matrices yield uninformative negative samples.
  - Path sparsity: In disconnected or very sparse graphs, shortest-path sets may be too small to be useful.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Compare classification accuracy with and without the DPP-based negative sampling on Cora.
  2. Test different Lmax values (e.g., 3 vs 5) to find optimal non-adjacent node coverage.
  3. Evaluate robustness under targeted edge-removal attacks, measuring accuracy drop relative to baseline GCN.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the RW-NSGCN model perform under different levels of noise and attack intensity in real-world applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the model's performance under various scenarios with topological and weight perturbations, but does not detail its performance in real-world applications.
- Why unresolved: The experiments conducted were primarily on benchmark datasets (Cora, CiteSeer, and PubMed), which may not fully capture the complexities of real-world data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the model on diverse real-world datasets with varying noise levels and attack intensities, and comparing its performance with existing methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the computational costs associated with the RW-NSGCN model, especially in large-scale networks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the model effectively handles complex graph data, but does not provide a detailed analysis of its computational efficiency.
- Why unresolved: The complexity of the RW-NSGCN model, which integrates multiple algorithms (RWR, PGR, DPP), suggests potential computational challenges that are not addressed.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive analysis of the model's computational time and resource usage on large-scale networks, comparing it with other models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of parameters (e.g., restart probability α, weighting factor β) affect the model's performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions parameter analysis but does not provide detailed insights into how different parameter settings impact the model's effectiveness.
- Why unresolved: The sensitivity of the model to parameter changes is crucial for its practical application, yet the paper does not explore this aspect thoroughly.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting extensive experiments with varying parameter values to identify optimal settings and understanding their impact on model performance.

## Limitations
- The method's reliance on non-adjacent node sampling and DPP diversity may become computationally prohibitive for very large or dynamic graphs.
- Performance is sensitive to the choice of Lmax and similarity metrics used in DPP, with no adaptive tuning provided.
- The absence of direct evidence in the corpus for RWR+PageRank integration or DPP in GNN negative sampling means empirical validation is crucial before adoption.

## Confidence
- **Mechanism 1 (RWR+PageRank):** Medium confidence. The integration is described but not benchmarked against alternative ranking strategies.
- **Mechanism 2 (DPP diversity):** Medium confidence. The diversity rationale is sound, but lack of external validation is a concern.
- **Mechanism 3 (global info from non-adjacent nodes):** Low confidence. The core assumption lacks direct experimental support in the literature.

## Next Checks
1. **Hyperparameter sensitivity:** Systematically vary Lmax, λ, and DPP kernel parameters to assess robustness and identify optimal configurations.
2. **Comparative analysis:** Benchmark against established robust GNN methods (e.g., GRAND, GNNGuard) on the same datasets and attack scenarios.
3. **Scalability test:** Measure runtime and memory usage on graphs with 10k+ nodes to confirm practical applicability.
