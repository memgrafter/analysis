# Synth-SONAR: Sonar Image Synthesis with Enhanced Diversity and Realism via Dual Diffusion Models and GPT Prompting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.08612
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08612
- Reference count: 40
- Proposes Synth-SONAR, a dual diffusion model framework for synthetic sonar image generation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Synth-SONAR, a novel framework for generating synthetic sonar images that addresses the critical challenges of data scarcity and quality in underwater sonar imagery. The approach combines dual diffusion models with GPT-based prompting to create high-quality, diverse synthetic datasets for underwater applications. The framework achieves state-of-the-art results with quantitative metrics showing FID of 3.8, SSIM of 0.381, PSNR of 12.730, and IS of 1.07, demonstrating significant improvements in both diversity and realism of generated sonar images.

## Method Summary
Synth-SONAR employs a three-phase framework: first, it integrates real sonar datasets (Seabed Objects KLSG and SCTD), simulated data from S3Simulator, and style-injected synthetic images to create a comprehensive training dataset. Second, a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) with LoRA fine-tuning is trained on coarse-level sonar images conditioned on GPT-generated prompts. Finally, the coarse images are refined into fine-grained outputs using domain-specific language instructions processed through a Vision-Language Model (VLM). The framework leverages adaptive blending ratio γ for style injection and employs both high-level and low-level text descriptions to guide the generation process.

## Key Results
- Achieves FID of 3.8, SSIM of 0.381, PSNR of 12.730, and IS of 1.07 on synthetic sonar image generation
- Demonstrates significant improvements in diversity and realism compared to existing methods
- Successfully addresses data scarcity issues in underwater sonar imagery applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Dual diffusion model hierarchy improves both diversity and realism in sonar image synthesis.
- Mechanism: The coarse-level model generates low-resolution base structures conditioned on high-level semantic descriptions from GPT prompts, while the fine-level model refines these into high-resolution, detailed sonar images using domain-specific language instructions from a VLM.
- Core assumption: High-level prompts capture the essential structural features needed for sonar realism, and low-level details from VLM improve fine-grained texture and noise patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "A dual text-conditioning sonar diffusion model hierarchy synthesizes coarse and fine-grained sonar images with enhanced quality and diversity."
  - [section] "The next phase involves training a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) ... to generate coarse-level sonar images. Finally, in the final phase, the coarse images are refined into fine-grained outputs using domain-specific language instructions processed through a Vision-Language Model (VLM)"
- Break condition: If either the coarse or fine model fails to preserve sonar-specific features like reverberation or target shadows, the realism degrades even if diversity increases.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: GPT-based prompting provides semantic bridging between text descriptions and sonar image generation.
- Mechanism: GPT is used to generate both high-level (coarse) and low-level (detailed) textual descriptions that guide the diffusion models, enabling controlled generation of sonar scenes with specific object configurations and seabed conditions.
- Core assumption: GPT can produce coherent, domain-appropriate descriptions that map meaningfully to sonar visual features.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "high-level (coarse) and low-level (detailed) text-based sonar generation methods leverage advanced semantic information available in visual language models (VLMs) and GPT-prompting."
  - [section] "In this phase, we generate images from the Phase 2 model using a series of prompts obtained from GPT. These generated images, combined with domain-specific language instructions, are processed through a Visual Language Model (VLM) to obtain low-level descriptions."
- Break condition: If GPT-generated descriptions are inconsistent or misaligned with actual sonar visual patterns, the diffusion models will produce unrealistic or off-target images.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Style injection with adaptive blending ratio γ enhances diversity without sacrificing content fidelity.
- Mechanism: Content images generated from GPT prompts are fused with style features extracted from real sonar images using an attention-based AdaIN mechanism, with γ controlling the balance between content preservation and stylistic adaptation.
- Core assumption: The attention mechanism can effectively align style features with sonar-specific visual characteristics, and the choice of γ allows tuning between realism and diversity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Style injection is a technique in computer vision's image-to-image tasks, that combines content and style features to generate a new image... In this work, style injection is utilized to add more diversity to the real sonar data and to increase the availability of sonar data."
  - [section] "We conduct a comparative study to examine how it impacts the quality of the image produced through style injection... as γ decreases, there is a noticeable improvement in both SSIM and PSNR."
- Break condition: If γ is set too low, style injection may obscure sonar-specific structural cues; if too high, diversity gains are minimal.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Diffusion probabilistic models and denoising processes
  - Why needed here: The framework relies on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) to iteratively transform noise into realistic sonar images conditioned on text prompts.
  - Quick check question: In a DDPM, what does the noise predictor network estimate at each timestep during sampling?

- Concept: Vision-language model integration for semantic grounding
  - Why needed here: VLMs are used to translate sonar images into low-level and high-level textual descriptions that refine and guide the generation process.
  - Quick check question: How does a VLM combine visual features and language embeddings to produce descriptive outputs?

- Concept: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for efficient fine-tuning
  - Why needed here: LoRA enables efficient adaptation of large pre-trained diffusion models to sonar-specific domains without full fine-tuning.
  - Quick check question: In LoRA, what is the mathematical role of the low-rank matrices A and B when updating weight matrices?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data Acquisition -> Phase-1 (Coarse Generation) -> Phase-2 (Fine Generation) -> Evaluation
- Critical path: GPT prompt → Coarse diffusion model → VLM description refinement → Fine diffusion model → High-quality synthetic sonar image
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Balance between diversity (via style injection and diverse prompts) and realism (via careful conditioning and evaluation)
  - Computational cost of fine-tuning large diffusion models versus using LoRA
  - Risk of model hallucination (multiple objects instead of one) versus flexibility in scene composition
- Failure signatures:
  - Low SSIM/PSNR but high FID: Generated images are diverse but lack structural similarity to real sonar data
  - Model produces multiple objects when one is expected: Indicates over-generalization or poor conditioning control
  - Style injection causes loss of sonar-specific features: γ set too low or style reference too dominant
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Generate coarse images from GPT prompts and evaluate SSIM/PSNR against real sonar baselines
  2. Vary γ in style injection and plot SSIM/PSNR curves to find optimal balance
  3. Compare fine-tuned vs. non-fine-tuned diffusion outputs using classification accuracy on downstream tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does Synth-SONAR's performance vary with different underwater environments and object types beyond those tested in the paper?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates Synth-SONAR's effectiveness on specific datasets (Seabed Objects KLSG, SCTD, and S3 Simulator) but does not explore its generalizability to other underwater environments or object types.
- Why unresolved: The paper's experimental setup focuses on a limited set of objects and environments. There is no discussion of how the model might perform with different types of underwater scenes, such as deep-sea trenches, coral reefs, or varying water conditions (e.g., turbidity, salinity).
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing Synth-SONAR on diverse underwater datasets with varying environmental conditions and object types would provide insights into its generalizability and robustness.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the computational requirements and limitations of Synth-SONAR for real-time underwater applications?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions computational constraints but does not provide detailed information on the model's computational efficiency or its suitability for real-time applications in underwater environments.
- Why unresolved: While the paper highlights the use of diffusion models and GPT prompting, it does not discuss the computational cost, latency, or feasibility of deploying Synth-SONAR in real-time underwater scenarios where resources may be limited.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking Synth-SONAR's computational performance, including inference time and resource usage, on various hardware setups would clarify its potential for real-time applications.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of low-level and high-level descriptions impact the quality and diversity of generated sonar images?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions the use of low-level and high-level descriptions generated by GPT and VLM but does not provide a detailed analysis of how different descriptions affect the output.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the sensitivity of the model to variations in the descriptions provided. It is unclear whether certain types of descriptions lead to more accurate or diverse images.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with different sets of descriptions and analyzing their impact on the generated images' quality and diversity would provide insights into the importance of description choice.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What are the potential biases introduced by the style injection technique in Synth-SONAR, and how do they affect the realism of the generated images?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the use of style injection to enhance diversity but does not address potential biases or their impact on the realism of the generated images.
- Why unresolved: The style injection process involves transferring stylistic elements from real sonar images, which could introduce biases related to specific sonar systems or environmental conditions. The paper does not explore how these biases might affect the model's outputs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analyzing the generated images for biases related to specific sonar systems or environmental conditions and comparing them with real images would help identify and quantify any introduced biases.

## Limitations
- Lack of baseline comparisons and statistical significance tests for reported quantitative results
- Insufficient architectural detail on dual diffusion model implementation and VLM integration
- No systematic analysis of style injection parameter sensitivity on sonar-specific feature preservation

## Confidence
- **Low confidence**: State-of-the-art claims and quantitative superiority - insufficient comparative analysis and baseline metrics provided
- **Medium confidence**: Mechanism 1 (dual diffusion hierarchy) - conceptually valid but lacks architectural detail for full validation
- **Medium confidence**: Mechanism 2 (GPT prompting) - plausible approach but effectiveness depends heavily on prompt quality and VLM integration details
- **Low confidence**: Mechanism 3 (style injection with adaptive γ) - theoretical framework provided but practical effectiveness and optimal parameter ranges unclear

## Next Checks
1. **Baseline comparison validation**: Implement direct comparisons against established sonar image synthesis methods (e.g., CycleGAN, Pix2Pix, or standard diffusion models without the dual hierarchy) using identical evaluation metrics and datasets to verify claimed performance improvements.

2. **Feature preservation analysis**: Conduct ablation studies systematically varying γ values (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9) while measuring not just SSIM/PSNR but also sonar-specific feature preservation metrics such as target shadow accuracy, reverberation pattern similarity, and seabed texture fidelity.

3. **Prompt consistency evaluation**: Test the GPT prompting mechanism by generating multiple prompts for identical sonar scenes and measuring output consistency. Evaluate whether the system can reliably produce the same object configuration when given semantically equivalent descriptions, addressing the hallucination concerns mentioned in the limitations section.
