# KAN based Autoencoders for Factor Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.02694
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02694
- Reference count: 0
- KAN-based models achieve R² scores of 11.02%, 11.26%, 11.32% for 1-, 3-, and 6-factor models respectively

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) within an autoencoder architecture for latent factor asset pricing models. KANs replace traditional ReLU activations with learnable spline functions on edges, offering greater flexibility in modeling nonlinear factor exposures and improved interpretability. The model uses KANs to approximate factor exposures as nonlinear functions of asset characteristics, achieving superior performance compared to traditional Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) approaches.

## Method Summary
The KAN-based autoencoder architecture consists of a beta network that maps asset characteristics to factor exposures using KAN layers with learnable spline functions, and a factor network that linearly combines observable characteristic factor returns. The model is trained on monthly individual stock returns from CRSP (1957-2016) using a training-validation-test split (30 years training, 12 years validation, remaining years test). Ridge regression is employed for dimension reduction, and the KAN and factor networks are trained jointly to minimize mean squared error between predicted and actual returns.

## Key Results
- KAN-based models achieve higher R² scores: 11.02%, 11.26%, 11.32% for 1-, 3-, and 6-factor models respectively
- Improved predictive R² scores: 0.203%, 0.203%, 0.214% for 1-, 3-, and 6-factor models
- Higher Sharpe ratios: 0.86, 0.86, and 0.96 for 1-, 3-, and 6-factor models compared to MLP-based models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: KAN-based autoencoders improve latent factor model accuracy by replacing fixed ReLU activations with learnable spline functions on edges.
- Mechanism: KAN replaces fixed activation functions with parameterized spline functions, allowing the network to adaptively learn nonlinear transformations of each input dimension before aggregation.
- Core assumption: The relationship between asset characteristics and factor exposures is nonlinear and can be better approximated by piecewise smooth spline functions than by fixed activations.
- Evidence anchors: "KANs offer greater flexibility in modeling nonlinear factor exposures and improved interpretability."
- Break condition: If the underlying relationship is linear, added complexity may not improve performance and could overfit.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: KAN's compositional structure mitigates the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional asset characteristic spaces.
- Mechanism: The Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem allows KANs to decompose multivariate functions into sums of univariate functions, reducing effective dimensionality.
- Core assumption: The asset characteristic space has underlying structure that can be decomposed into univariate functions.
- Evidence anchors: "KANs are particularly adept at representing nonlinear functions due to their ability to decompose complex functions into simpler ones."
- Break condition: If asset characteristics exhibit complex multivariate interactions that cannot be decomposed into univariate components.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: KAN-based models achieve better out-of-sample prediction by learning more generalizable representations of latent factors.
- Mechanism: By learning adaptive activation functions rather than fixed ones, KANs can capture nuanced patterns while maintaining better generalization to unseen market conditions.
- Core assumption: Market regimes evolve over time, requiring models to adapt to changing patterns rather than rely on fixed transformations.
- Evidence anchors: "the KAN-CA model exhibits superior predictive R² scores of 0.203%, 0.203%, and 0.214% for 1-, 3-, and 6-factor models."
- Break condition: If market conditions change dramatically, generalization performance may degrade.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem
  - Why needed here: Provides theoretical foundation for why KANs can represent multivariate functions efficiently through composition of univariate functions
  - Quick check question: How does the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem enable KANs to handle high-dimensional financial data without exponential parameter growth?

- Concept: Autoencoder Architecture in Finance
  - Why needed here: Understanding how autoencoders can learn latent representations of asset returns and remove noise from financial data
  - Quick check question: What role does the beta network play in the autoencoder framework for asset pricing models?

- Concept: Factor Models and Cross-Sectional Asset Pricing
  - Why needed here: Core understanding of how factor exposures and returns interact in asset pricing theory
  - Quick check question: How does the assumption of linear factor exposures in traditional models differ from the nonlinear approach proposed here?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Z (asset characteristics) → Beta Network (KAN layers) → Factor Network (linear combination) → Predicted Returns → Loss calculation
- Critical path: Z → Beta Network → Factor Network → Predicted Returns → Loss calculation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - KAN vs MLP: KAN offers better interpretability and potentially better performance but requires careful spline function selection
  - Complexity vs interpretability: More complex KAN architectures may capture more patterns but reduce interpretability
  - Training stability: KANs may require different training strategies than traditional MLPs
- Failure signatures:
  - Overfitting: Validation loss increasing while training loss decreases
  - Poor convergence: Spline functions failing to learn meaningful transformations
  - Dimensionality issues: Model struggling with high-dimensional characteristic matrices
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare KAN with MLP on a simple 1-factor model using synthetic data with known nonlinear relationships
  2. Test KAN performance sensitivity to spline function complexity (number of knots, function families)
  3. Evaluate out-of-sample performance stability across different market regimes using rolling window validation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific spline functions and parameterization strategies work best for KAN layers in financial factor modeling applications?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions that "in practice, it is empirically discovered that the KAN network works best in latent space" but does not specify optimal spline configurations
- Why unresolved: KAN is still a relatively novel architecture where optimal configurations remain unexplored
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments comparing different spline basis functions across various financial datasets and market conditions

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the KAN-based autoencoder model perform in real-time decision-making scenarios compared to batch processing?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions "future research may explore the applicability of these models to a wider range of financial instruments and market conditions, their performance in real-time decision-making scenarios"
- Why unresolved: The empirical results focus on retrospective analysis, not online learning or high-frequency trading applications
- What evidence would resolve it: Backtesting the model in a rolling window framework with daily retraining, measuring latency and prediction accuracy under different market regimes

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal number of KAN layers and nodes per layer for balancing model complexity and interpretability?
- Basis in paper: The authors mention "KAN layer" architecture but do not specify optimal depth, noting that "there may exist better architecture for KAN networks to approximate the beta function"
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates KAN outperforms MLPs, it does not systematically explore architectural hyperparameters
- What evidence would resolve it: Grid search experiments varying the number of KAN layers and nodes per layer, measuring R², predictive R², and Sharpe ratios while tracking parameter count and training time

## Limitations

- The paper lacks rigorous theoretical grounding explaining why KAN's spline-based edge activations specifically benefit financial factor modeling
- Empirical results show meaningful improvements but don't establish causality between KAN architecture and performance gains
- The paper doesn't adequately address whether simpler nonlinear alternatives could achieve similar results

## Confidence

- KAN implementation and empirical methodology: **High** confidence
- Claims about KAN's theoretical advantages for factor modeling: **Low** confidence
- Outperformance claims relative to MLP baselines: **Medium** confidence

## Next Checks

1. Conduct an ablation study comparing KAN performance against polynomial regression and kernel-based methods using identical datasets and evaluation protocols.

2. Perform statistical significance testing on the reported performance improvements (R², Sharpe ratios) to determine whether observed differences represent meaningful outperformance.

3. Test model robustness across different market regimes by conducting rolling window analysis and examining performance during distinct economic periods.
