# Facial Expression-Enhanced TTS: Combining Face Representation and Emotion Intensity for Adaptive Speech

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2409.16203
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16203
- **Reference count**: 22
- **Primary result**: Zero-shot TTS model that synthesizes emotionally expressive speech aligned with facial images and modulated by emotion intensity

## Executive Summary
FEIM-TTS introduces a novel zero-shot text-to-speech system that generates emotionally expressive speech aligned with facial images. The model leverages facial features and emotion intensity control to produce speaker-agnostic speech synthesis without requiring labeled datasets. By combining diffusion models with classifier-free guidance, it achieves fine-grained control over emotional expression while maintaining speech quality. The system is trained on LRS3, CREMA-D, and MELD datasets, demonstrating strong performance in naturalness and emotional expressiveness.

## Method Summary
FEIM-TTS employs a score-based diffusion model with classifier-free guidance to synthesize speech from text and facial images. The model uses a Face Network to extract facial features, which are combined with text tokens in a Text Encoder to predict duration tokens. During training, it uses both conditional (emotion present) and unconditional (emotion null token) sampling to learn a distribution that can interpolate emotion intensity during inference. The model is trained on CREMA-D and MELD datasets for emotional speech patterns, and LRS3 for speaker identity information, enabling robust speaker-agnostic synthesis with emotion control.

## Key Results
- Achieves mean opinion score (MOS) of 3.31 for emotional expressiveness
- Demonstrates superior performance in naturalness and preference tests compared to FACE-TTS
- Successfully controls emotion intensity with smooth transitions from neutral to highly emotional speech
- Enhances accessibility for visually impaired users by integrating emotional nuances into TTS

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: FEIM-TTS achieves zero-shot emotional speech synthesis by integrating facial image embeddings with emotion intensity control via classifier-free diffusion guidance.
- Mechanism: The model combines facial features from the Face Network with emotion embeddings in the diffusion model. During training, it uses both conditional (emotion present) and unconditional (emotion null token) sampling to learn a distribution that can interpolate emotion intensity during inference.
- Core assumption: Facial features encode speaker identity and emotional expression cues that can be decoupled and recombined with learned emotion embeddings to produce speaker-agnostic emotional speech.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "synthesizes emotionally expressive speech, aligned with facial images and modulated by emotion intensity"
  - [section 3.1] "Classifier-free diffusion guidance... integrating emotional cues as a conditional input"
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers focus on emotion control but don't directly validate the facial embedding approach
- Break condition: If facial features cannot reliably encode emotional expression or if emotion and speaker identity cannot be disentangled, the model would fail to produce coherent emotional speech aligned with faces.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The linear combination of conditional and unconditional score estimates allows fine-grained control over emotion intensity during sampling.
- Mechanism: During inference, the model weights the conditional score (with emotion embedding) and unconditional score (null token) based on the emotion intensity parameter, enabling smooth transitions from neutral to highly emotional speech.
- Core assumption: The diffusion model has learned meaningful representations for both emotional and neutral speech that can be linearly combined to produce intermediate emotional intensities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "The prediction of scores occurs in the reverse diffusion process... integrating speaker and emotion information"
  - [section 4.3] "Graph illustrating the relationship between emotion intensity and the class prediction probability"
  - [corpus] Moderate - related works on emotion intensity control support this mechanism but don't specifically validate the diffusion-based approach
- Break condition: If the linear interpolation doesn't produce perceptually meaningful emotional variations or if the model overfits to extreme emotion intensities, the controllability would break down.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Training on both labeled (CREMA-D, MELD) and unlabeled (LRS3) datasets enables robust speaker-agnostic speech synthesis with emotion control.
- Mechanism: The conditional training phase learns emotional speech patterns from labeled data, while the unconditional training on LRS3 provides speaker identity information and improves general speech quality without emotional bias.
- Core assumption: Speaker identity and emotional expression are independent factors that can be learned separately and combined effectively during synthesis.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.1] "For the model's conditional training, we partitioned CREMA-D and MELD... For unconditional training, LRS3 was divided"
  - [section 4.2] "This strategic combination of conditional and unconditional training significantly improved our model's ability"
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers don't discuss the dual-dataset training strategy for speaker-agnostic emotion synthesis
- Break condition: If speaker identity and emotion cannot be disentangled or if the unlabeled data introduces conflicting patterns, the synthesis quality would degrade.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Diffusion models and score-based generative modeling
  - Why needed here: The core synthesis mechanism relies on denoising diffusion to generate speech from random noise, conditioned on facial and emotional inputs
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the score function in the reverse diffusion process, and how does classifier-free guidance modify it?

- Concept: Multimodal learning (audio-visual integration)
  - Why needed here: The model must learn meaningful representations from both facial images and text/audio to produce coherent speech aligned with visual cues
  - Quick check question: How does the Face Network extract features from images, and how are these features integrated with text tokens for duration prediction?

- Concept: Emotion intensity control in speech synthesis
  - Why needed here: The key innovation is not just synthesizing emotional speech but providing fine-grained control over emotion intensity through a continuous parameter
  - Quick check question: How does the emotion intensity parameter (0 to 30) affect the linear combination of conditional and unconditional scores during sampling?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Face Network: CNN-based feature extractor for facial images (224×224 pixels)
  - Text Encoder: Processes text tokens and face features to predict duration tokens
  - Duration Predictor: Ensures alignment between speech and text
  - Diffusion Model: Core synthesis component that denoises mel-spectrograms using facial features and emotion embeddings
  - Audio Network: Generates final audio from mel-spectrograms with speaker loss calculation

- Critical path: Face → Face Network → Text Encoder → Diffusion Model → Audio Network → Output Speech
  - The emotion intensity parameter modulates the diffusion process between steps

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using diffusion models provides high-quality synthesis but increases inference time
  - The 10% null embedding probability during training balances conditional and unconditional learning
  - Speaker-agnostic design requires careful disentanglement of identity and emotion features

- Failure signatures:
  - Pronunciation artifacts or mumbling at high emotion intensities (>30)
  - Misalignment between synthesized speech and facial expressions
  - Inability to generate certain emotions (like "Surprise") due to dataset limitations
  - Poor performance on out-of-utterance scripts compared to seen scripts

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test emotion intensity controllability by synthesizing speech at intensities 0, 1, 15, and 30 for a single emotion and validating with SER model
  2. Evaluate speaker identity preservation by generating speech for different faces with the same text and emotion
  3. Compare MCD scores between FEIM-TTS and baseline FACE-TTS on the CREMA-D test set to validate synthesis quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but based on the content, the following questions are raised:

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the model's performance scale with the size and diversity of the training dataset?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that "The absence of 'Surprise' in the CREMA-D dataset and the limited instances of 'Disgust' and 'Fear' in the MELD dataset contributed to their lower MOS scores."
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the impact of dataset size and diversity on the model's performance, nor does it compare performance with larger, more diverse datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training the model on a larger, more diverse dataset and comparing its performance metrics with the current results.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the model effectively generalize to languages and accents beyond English?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The model is trained and evaluated only on English-language datasets (CREMA-D, MELD, LRS3), and there is no mention of testing on non-English languages or accents.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any information on the model's ability to handle languages or accents other than English.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating the model's performance on datasets containing multiple languages and accents.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of emotion intensity parameter settings on the naturalness and intelligibility of the synthesized speech?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses emotion intensity settings (0, 1, and above 1) and their effects on speech generation, but does not provide detailed analysis on how these settings affect naturalness and intelligibility.
- Why unresolved: While the paper mentions emotion intensity control, it does not thoroughly investigate how different settings influence the quality of the synthesized speech.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting detailed experiments to assess the naturalness and intelligibility of speech at various emotion intensity levels.

## Limitations

- Limited dataset coverage for certain emotions (Surprise, Disgust, Fear) affects MOS scores
- Performance may degrade on out-of-utterance scripts not seen during training
- Architecture details (Face Network implementation, diffusion model specifics) are not fully specified

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The overall approach of combining facial features with emotion intensity control is technically sound and builds on established diffusion model principles
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim of achieving speaker-agnostic synthesis through dual-dataset training is plausible but not fully validated through comparative studies
- **Low Confidence**: Specific performance metrics (MOS scores, MCD values) lack detailed experimental conditions and statistical significance testing

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study on Training Strategy**: Compare FEIM-TTS against variants trained only on labeled data (CREMA-D/MELD) or only on unlabeled data (LRS3) to quantify the contribution of the dual-dataset approach

2. **Cross-Dataset Generalization**: Test the model on emotion-labeled datasets not used during training (e.g., IEMOCAP) to evaluate true zero-shot capabilities and speaker generalization

3. **Emotion Intensity Calibration**: Systematically generate speech at emotion intensities from 0 to 30 in increments of 5, then validate using a blind listening test with emotion recognition models to map parameter values to perceived emotional intensity
