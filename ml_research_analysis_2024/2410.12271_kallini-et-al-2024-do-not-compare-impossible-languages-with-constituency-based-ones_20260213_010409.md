# Kallini et al. (2024) do not compare impossible languages with constituency-based ones

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.12271
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12271
- Authors: Tim Hunter

- Key outcome: Kallini et al.'s comparison confounds adjacency with count-based vs constituency-based distinctions

## Executive Summary
This paper identifies a critical confound in Kallini et al. (2024)'s comparison between WordHop and NoHop languages. While Kallini et al. aimed to test whether LLMs show human-like asymmetry between count-based and constituency-based syntactic rules, their WordHop language actually differs from NoHop in two ways: rule type (count-based vs constituency-based) and dependency type (non-adjacent vs adjacent). This means their results don't properly test the fundamental linguistic distinction they intended to examine.

The author explains the theoretical basis for this confound using English verbal inflection patterns and question formation rules, which demonstrate that constituency-based dependencies cannot be reduced to count-based mechanisms. Two alternative experimental designs are proposed that would properly isolate the count-based vs constituency-based distinction while controlling for adjacency effects.

## Method Summary
The paper critiques an existing experimental design comparing learning performance between synthetic languages with different syntactic rule types. The original study trained GPT-2 on WordHop (count-based rules with non-adjacent dependencies) and NoHop (constituency-based rules with adjacent dependencies). The critique proposes two alternative comparisons: (1) WordHop vs a new language with constituency-based rules creating non-adjacent dependencies, and (2) NoHop vs a new language with count-based rules creating adjacent dependencies. These alternatives aim to isolate the fundamental distinction between rule types while controlling for adjacency effects.

## Key Results
- Kallini et al. confounded adjacency vs non-adjacency with count-based vs constituency-based distinctions
- English verbal inflection demonstrates constituency-based rules that cannot be captured by count-based rules
- Two alternative experimental designs are proposed to properly test the count-based vs constituency-based distinction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Kallini et al. confounded adjacency vs non-adjacency with count-based vs constituency-based distinctions
- Mechanism: Their WordHop language has count-based rules creating non-adjacent dependencies, while NoHop has constituency-based rules with adjacent dependencies. This means their comparison actually tests adjacency vs non-adjacency rather than count-based vs constituency-based.
- Core assumption: The linguistic literature consistently shows that count-based rules are absent relative to constituency-based rules specifically for non-adjacent dependencies, not adjacent ones.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "they differ not just in count-based vs constituency-based rules but also in adjacency vs non-adjacency of dependencies"
  - [section 1] "The problem, to a first approximation, is a confound between whether a rule is count-based and whether that rule creates non-adjacent dependencies"
- Break condition: If adjacency itself is the key factor rather than constituency structure, then this confound would invalidate the entire experimental design.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: English verbal inflection patterns demonstrate constituency-based rules that cannot be captured by count-based rules
- Mechanism: The placement of suffixes like '-s' and '-ed' depends on hierarchical structure (subject-verb agreement, question formation) rather than linear position. This shows that constituency-based rules are necessary for natural language patterns.
- Core assumption: The English verbal inflection system provides canonical examples of constituency-based dependencies that must be expressed in hierarchical terms.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2] "The correct generalization can be expressed in terms of hierarchical constituency: given the structural analyses in (6) for the declaratives in (4) and (5), the displaced word is the Aux that is the granddaughter of the root S node"
  - [section 2] "the crucially constituency-sensitive rules underlying both of these phenomena bear on the distribution of English inflected verb forms"
- Break condition: If count-based rules could somehow capture these English patterns, it would undermine the theoretical foundation of the critique.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The proposed alternative comparisons (WordHop vs constituency-based offsets, NoHop vs count-based offsets) would properly isolate the count-based vs constituency-based distinction
- Mechanism: By keeping one language's rule type constant while varying the other's, these comparisons control for adjacency while testing the fundamental difference between rule types.
- Core assumption: The two proposed alternative comparisons provide valid control conditions that isolate the specific linguistic distinction being tested.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3] "The first is to keep WordHop as our representative count-based language, and introduce a constituency-based rule to be the necessary counterpart"
  - [section 3] "The second possibility is to keep NoHop as our representative constituency-based language, and replace one of the constituency-based rules governing the placement of the s and p markers with a count-based rule"
- Break condition: If implementing these alternative comparisons proves practically impossible or introduces new confounds, the critique's solutions may not be viable.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Linguistic theory of possible vs impossible languages
  - Why needed here: The entire critique depends on understanding what makes certain language patterns "humanly impossible" and how this relates to computational mechanisms
  - Quick check question: What is the fundamental distinction between count-based and constituency-based rules in linguistic theory?

- Concept: Hierarchical structure in natural languages
  - Why needed here: The paper's argument relies heavily on constituency-based rules being expressed in terms of hierarchical structure rather than linear position
  - Quick check question: How does the question-formation rule in English demonstrate constituency-based dependencies?

- Concept: Experimental design and confound control
  - Why needed here: Understanding how to properly isolate variables is crucial for evaluating whether Kallini et al.'s experiment actually tests what it claims to test
  - Quick check question: What is a confound in experimental design, and how does adjacency vs non-adjacency create one in this study?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Identify confound -> Explain linguistic theory -> Propose alternatives
- Critical path: First understand the linguistic theory, then identify the confound, then evaluate the proposed solutions
- Design tradeoffs: The proposed alternatives involve balancing theoretical purity with practical implementation feasibility
- Failure signatures: If the new comparisons still show adjacency effects, or if implementing constituency-based offsets proves too complex, the critique's solutions may fail
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement WordHop vs the proposed constituency-based offset language to test if adjacency is the key factor
  2. Implement NoHop vs the proposed count-based offset language to test if rule type alone explains differences
  3. Run control experiments with purely adjacency-based vs purely constituency-based rules to verify the theoretical predictions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Would an LLM show the same asymmetry between count-based and constituency-based rules as humans do, if tested using appropriately constructed synthetic languages?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The author argues that Kallini et al.'s WordHop vs NoHop comparison doesn't properly test this asymmetry because it confounds adjacency with count-based vs constituency-based distinctions
- Why unresolved: Current experiments use flawed comparisons that don't isolate the count-based vs constituency-based distinction
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments using the alternative language pairs proposed in section 3 (WordHop vs constituency-based offset language, or NoHop vs count-based offset language) that show differential learning success

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the composition of two constituency-based dependencies always yield another valid constituency-based dependency?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The author raises this as a subtle concern when discussing the constituency-based offset from position (iii) in section 3
- Why unresolved: The answer depends on theoretical details of linguistically possible dependencies that remain an active research topic
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic testing of various combinations of constituency-based dependencies in synthetic languages

### Open Question 3
- Question: How should we characterize the syntactic category requirements for constituency-based rules to make fair comparisons with count-based rules?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The author notes that the constituency-based pattern in NoHop always has a verb immediately preceding the marker, while the count-based pattern has heterogeneous categories, potentially making it less "predictable"
- Why unresolved: This relates to the theoretical debate about whether English's "affix hopping" is morphological or syntactic
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of constituency-based rules that vary the category of the word adjacent to the marker, allowing controlled comparison with count-based rules

## Limitations

- The critique identifies a theoretical confound without empirical evidence that the proposed alternatives would yield different results
- The practical feasibility of implementing the suggested experimental designs remains untested
- The analysis relies on established linguistic theory without extensive empirical validation in the context of modern neural language models

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The identification of the adjacency vs non-adjacency confound in Kallini et al.'s experimental design
- **Medium confidence**: The linguistic analysis demonstrating why constituency-based rules are necessary for natural language patterns
- **Medium confidence**: The proposed alternative experimental designs

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical validation of confound**: Implement the original Kallini et al. design with systematic variation of adjacency while keeping rule type constant to directly test whether adjacency or rule type drives learning differences.

2. **Implementation feasibility study**: Attempt to implement the proposed alternative comparisons (WordHop vs constituency-based offsets, NoHop vs count-based offsets) to assess practical challenges and whether these designs can be realized with current LLM architectures.

3. **Control condition experiments**: Design experiments that vary adjacency and constituency-based structure independently to isolate their individual contributions to learning difficulty, helping determine whether the confound is the sole explanation for observed patterns.
