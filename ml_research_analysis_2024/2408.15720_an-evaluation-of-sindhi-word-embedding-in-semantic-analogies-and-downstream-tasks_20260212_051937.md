# An Evaluation of Sindhi Word Embedding in Semantic Analogies and Downstream Tasks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.15720
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15720
- Reference count: 0
- Proposed Sindhi embeddings outperform existing fastText on intrinsic and extrinsic tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper constructs a 61-million-word Sindhi corpus from multiple web sources and trains CBoW, Skip-gram, and GloVe word embeddings. The authors evaluate these embeddings intrinsically (nearest neighbors, word pair similarity, WordSim-347) and extrinsically (POS tagging, NER). Skip-gram embeddings achieve the best performance with 0.651 Spearman correlation on WordSim-347, 86.19 F1 on NER, and 97.51 accuracy on POS tagging. The work addresses Sindhi's low-resource status and provides a new benchmark corpus and embeddings for downstream NLP tasks.

## Method Summary
The authors construct a 61-million-word Sindhi corpus from web sources including news, blogs, Wikipedia, books, and tweets. They preprocess the data to remove noise, stop-words, and non-Sindhi vocabulary. Three embedding models (CBoW, Skip-gram, GloVe) are trained with optimized hyperparameters. Intrinsic evaluation uses WordSim-347, nearest neighbors, and word pair similarity tasks. Extrinsic evaluation employs SiPOS and SiNER datasets with neural models. The proposed embeddings are compared against existing Sindhi fastText embeddings.

## Key Results
- Skip-gram achieves 0.651 Spearman correlation on WordSim-347 word similarity task
- Skip-gram embeddings reach 86.19 F1 score on NER task and 97.51 accuracy on POS tagging
- Proposed embeddings outperform existing Sindhi fastText embeddings on both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations
- Visualization shows coherent semantic clusters in embedding space

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Skip-gram's ability to predict context words from a target word results in higher quality embeddings for downstream NLP tasks in low-resource languages.
- Mechanism: Skip-gram maximizes the probability of surrounding context words for a given target word, leading to embeddings that capture semantic and syntactic relationships more effectively than alternatives.
- Core assumption: The distributional hypothesis holds—words appearing in similar contexts have similar meanings—especially in morphologically rich languages like Sindhi.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The evaluation results reveal that continuous-bag-of-words and skip-gram perform better than GloVe and existing Sindhi fastText word embedding on both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation approaches"
  - [section]: "The SG model outperforms CBoW and GloVe in semantic and syntactic similarity by achieving the accuracy of 0.651"
  - [corpus]: Strong, as the corpus is large and diverse enough to provide sufficient context for skip-gram training
- Break condition: If the corpus lacks sufficient context or is too small, skip-gram's advantage diminishes.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Proper preprocessing, including stop-word removal, improves the quality of word embeddings.
- Mechanism: Removing stop-words reduces noise and allows the model to focus on more meaningful word relationships.
- Core assumption: Stop-words are less semantically important and their removal doesn't harm the overall context representation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We design a preprocessing pipeline for the filtration of unwanted text from crawled data"
  - [section]: "The removal of such words can boost the performance of the NLP model"
  - [corpus]: Strong, as the paper explicitly details stop-word removal and its impact on GloVe training
- Break condition: If stop-words are incorrectly removed or essential for context, performance could degrade.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Training on a large, diverse corpus leads to better embeddings that generalize well to downstream tasks.
- Mechanism: A larger corpus provides more context and examples for the model to learn from, capturing a wider range of semantic and syntactic relationships.
- Core assumption: The corpus is representative of the language and covers a variety of domains and styles.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We propose a new word embedding based corpus consisting of more than 61 million words crawled from multiple web resources"
  - [section]: "The large corpus acquired from multiple resources is rich in vocabulary"
  - [corpus]: Strong, as the paper describes a comprehensive corpus acquisition strategy from multiple web sources
- Break condition: If the corpus is biased or unrepresentative, embeddings may not generalize well.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Neural network architectures for word embeddings (Skip-gram, CBoW, GloVe)
  - Why needed here: Understanding these architectures is crucial for evaluating their performance and selecting the appropriate model for a given task.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between Skip-gram and CBoW in terms of their training objectives?

- Concept: Intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation methods for word embeddings
  - Why needed here: These methods are used to assess the quality of the embeddings and their effectiveness in downstream NLP tasks.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation, and why are both important?

- Concept: Low-resource language challenges and corpus construction
  - Why needed here: Sindhi is a low-resource language, so understanding the challenges and strategies for corpus construction is essential for this work.
  - Quick check question: What are some of the specific challenges in building a corpus for a low-resource language like Sindhi?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Corpus acquisition → Preprocessing → Word embedding training (Skip-gram, CBoW, GloVe) → Intrinsic evaluation (WordSim-347, nearest neighbors) → Extrinsic evaluation (POS tagging, NER)
- Critical path: Corpus acquisition → Preprocessing → Word embedding training → Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Larger corpus size vs. preprocessing complexity; Skip-gram vs. CBoW vs. GloVe for different tasks
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on intrinsic evaluation indicates issues with embedding quality; poor performance on extrinsic evaluation suggests embeddings don't capture task-relevant features
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train and evaluate Skip-gram embeddings on a subset of the corpus to verify the pipeline works.
  2. Compare Skip-gram and CBoW embeddings on intrinsic tasks (WordSim-347) to assess their relative performance.
  3. Evaluate the best-performing embeddings on a downstream task (e.g., POS tagging) to measure their practical utility.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the proposed Sindhi word embeddings vary across different domains of the corpus (news, literature, social media)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors evaluate embeddings using a general corpus but do not report domain-specific performance or analyze domain transfer.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not conduct domain-specific evaluations or compare embeddings trained on homogeneous versus heterogeneous text.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training separate embeddings for each domain and evaluating them on domain-specific intrinsic and extrinsic tasks would reveal domain sensitivity.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of removing stop-words versus retaining them during training on downstream task performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors filter stop-words for GloVe training but use sub-sampling for CBoW and SG, without comparing these approaches experimentally.
- Why unresolved: No ablation study is performed to assess the effect of stop-word removal on NER and POS tagging accuracy.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training embeddings with and without stop-word removal and measuring downstream task performance would quantify the impact.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do the proposed embeddings compare to contextualized models like BERT or ELMo when adapted to the Sindhi language?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention future work with BERT and ELMo but do not conduct any comparative experiments.
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates static embeddings and does not benchmark against any contextualized representations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training and evaluating a Sindhi BERT or ELMo model on the same downstream tasks would provide a direct comparison.

## Limitations

- The paper uses a single train/validation split for extrinsic evaluation without reporting variance across multiple runs
- Translation process from English to Sindhi for WordSim-347 word pairs could introduce systematic biases
- No ablation studies are conducted to measure the impact of specific preprocessing steps on final performance

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Intrinsic evaluation results showing Skip-gram superiority (Spearman correlation of 0.651 on WordSim-347) are reliable given the standardized evaluation protocol
- **Medium confidence**: Extrinsic evaluation results are plausible given the model architecture described, but would benefit from cross-validation
- **Medium confidence**: The corpus construction methodology is sound, but the exact impact of preprocessing choices on final performance is difficult to quantify without ablation studies

## Next Checks

1. Perform k-fold cross-validation on SiPOS and SiNER datasets to establish confidence intervals for the extrinsic evaluation metrics
2. Conduct ablation studies to measure the impact of stop-word removal and other preprocessing steps on embedding quality
3. Compare the proposed embeddings against a simple baseline (e.g., random embeddings or frequency-based features) on downstream tasks to confirm they capture meaningful linguistic information beyond trivial patterns
