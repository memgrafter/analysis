# A Novel Word Pair-based Gaussian Sentence Similarity Algorithm For Bengali Extractive Text Summarization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.17181
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17181
- Reference count: 34
- Primary result: WGSS outperformed recent models by 43.2% average ROUGE score improvement (2.5% to 95.4%)

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel clustering-based approach for Bengali extractive text summarization using a Word pair-based Gaussian Sentence Similarity (WGSS) algorithm. The method addresses the limitations of traditional word averaging by calculating semantic relationships between sentences through geometric means of individual Gaussian similarity values of word embedding vectors. The approach clusters semantically similar sentences using spectral clustering and extracts key sentences via TF-IDF ranking, demonstrating strong performance on multiple low-resource languages including Turkish, Marathi, and Hindi.

## Method Summary
The WGSS algorithm represents a significant advancement in handling sentence similarity for extractive summarization by comparing sentences on a word-to-word basis rather than averaging word embeddings. The methodology involves calculating Gaussian similarity values between individual word vectors, then taking geometric means to derive sentence-level similarity scores. This semantic comparison enables more nuanced clustering of related content. The system employs spectral clustering to group semantically similar sentences, followed by TF-IDF ranking to identify and extract the most representative sentences from each cluster. The authors also curated a new high-quality Bengali dataset containing 250 articles with paired summaries to support their evaluation.

## Key Results
- WGSS achieved 43.2% average improvement in ROUGE scores compared to recent models
- Performance gains ranged from 2.5% to 95.4% across different evaluation metrics
- Demonstrated effectiveness on multiple low-resource languages beyond Bengali, including Turkish, Marathi, and Hindi

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The WGSS algorithm works by leveraging Gaussian similarity measures between individual word vectors to capture nuanced semantic relationships that traditional averaging methods miss. By computing geometric means of these individual similarity values, the approach creates a more robust sentence representation that preserves semantic distinctions between words. This enables spectral clustering to group truly semantically similar sentences rather than those that merely share similar averaged embeddings. The subsequent TF-IDF ranking ensures that the most informative sentences from each cluster are selected for the summary, maintaining both coherence and informativeness.

## Foundational Learning
- Gaussian similarity measures: Needed to quantify semantic relationships between individual word vectors; Quick check: Verify that Gaussian kernel parameters are appropriately tuned for the embedding space
- Spectral clustering: Required to group semantically similar sentences based on the WGSS similarity matrix; Quick check: Confirm that the number of clusters is optimized for each dataset
- TF-IDF ranking: Essential for identifying the most representative sentences within each cluster; Quick check: Validate that TF-IDF weights are computed on the original document corpus

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Text preprocessing -> Word embedding generation -> WGSS similarity computation -> Spectral clustering -> TF-IDF ranking -> Summary extraction

Critical path: The most time-critical path is the WGSS similarity computation followed by spectral clustering, as these operations involve pairwise comparisons and eigenvalue decomposition respectively. These steps must complete efficiently to enable practical summarization of longer documents.

Design tradeoffs: The geometric mean approach for sentence similarity provides robustness against outlier words but may underrepresent dominant semantic themes in sentences with highly diverse vocabularies. Spectral clustering offers better separation of semantically distinct content compared to k-means but at higher computational cost.

Failure signatures: Poor performance may manifest as summaries containing redundant information (indicating clustering issues) or missing key content (suggesting TF-IDF ranking problems). Extremely long computation times could indicate scalability issues with the WGSS similarity matrix calculations.

First experiments:
1. Verify WGSS similarity computation produces reasonable values by comparing similarity scores for known paraphrases versus unrelated sentences
2. Test spectral clustering with varying numbers of clusters to find optimal settings for different document types
3. Validate TF-IDF ranking by checking that selected sentences contain the highest weighted terms from their respective clusters

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Validation methodology raises concerns about potential overfitting due to lack of cross-dataset validation
- Computational complexity claims lack supporting benchmarking data or runtime measurements
- Cross-linguistic generalization claims are inadequately supported without detailed methodology for baseline comparisons

## Confidence

WGSS algorithm methodology: Medium
Performance improvements: Medium
Cross-linguistic applicability: Low
Computational efficiency: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of spectral clustering, TF-IDF ranking, and WGSS similarity to overall performance gains
2. Perform cross-dataset validation using standard summarization benchmarks to verify claims are not dataset-specific
3. Execute runtime benchmarks comparing WGSS against established summarization approaches to validate computational complexity claims
