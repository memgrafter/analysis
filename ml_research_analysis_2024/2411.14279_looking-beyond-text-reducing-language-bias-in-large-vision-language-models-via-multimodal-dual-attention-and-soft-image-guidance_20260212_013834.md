# Looking Beyond Text: Reducing Language bias in Large Vision-Language Models via Multimodal Dual-Attention and Soft-Image Guidance

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.14279
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14279
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: LACING framework reduces language bias in LVLMs, achieving 11.8-point boost on LLaVA-Bench and 40% improvement on Object Hallucinations Benchmark

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical problem of language bias in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where models often ignore visual inputs and generate text responses based solely on text inputs, leading to hallucinations. The authors identify two main reasons for this bias: the disparity in training scales between the LLM pretraining stage and multimodal alignment stage, and the learned inference bias due to the short-term dependency of text data. To mitigate this bias, the paper proposes LACING, a systemic framework consisting of Multimodal Dual-Attention Mechanism (MDA) and Soft-Image Guidance (SIG). MDA introduces a parallel dual-attention mechanism that enhances the integration of visual inputs across the model, while SIG introduces a learnable soft visual prompt during training and inference to replace visual inputs, compelling the model to prioritize text inputs. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LACING effectively debiases LVLMs, enhancing visual comprehension and reducing hallucinations without requiring additional training resources or data.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes LACING, a framework addressing language bias in LVLMs through two complementary mechanisms. MDA introduces parallel dual-attention that processes visual and text inputs independently before fusing their attention maps, enabling effective visual input utilization across all layers rather than just the first two. SIG employs a learnable soft visual prompt that replaces visual inputs during training with probability θ, then adjusts output distributions during inference by contrasting original and multimodal-null outputs. The framework is trained jointly with existing LVLM training pipelines without additional data, using 8 A100 GPUs with Deepspeed optimization. The approach is evaluated on LLaVA models with CLIP-ViT-L-14-336 visual encoders and Vicuna-1.5 LLM backbones.

## Key Results
- LACING achieves an 11.8-point boost on LLaVA-Bench compared to baseline LLaVA-1.5
- 40% improvement on Object Hallucinations Benchmark, significantly reducing hallucination rates
- Enhanced visual comprehension demonstrated across multiple benchmarks including MMBench and TextVQA
- Effective debiasing achieved without requiring additional training resources or data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Multimodal Dual-Attention Mechanism (MDA)
MDA enables LVLMs to allocate attention effectively across all layers to visual inputs, not just the first two layers. It introduces a parallel dual-attention mechanism that independently computes attention weights for visual and text tokens, then fuses them to create a final attention map. It maintains causal attention for text while allowing bidirectional attention for visual inputs. The core assumption is that language bias stems partly from the model's inability to effectively process visual inputs in deeper layers due to training data distribution mismatch.

### Mechanism 2: Soft-Image Guidance (SIG)
SIG mitigates the inference bias by compelling the model to prioritize text inputs while maintaining input patterns. It introduces a learnable soft visual prompt that replaces visual inputs with a probability θ during training. During inference, it contrasts output distributions from original and multimodal-null inputs to adjust the final output. The core assumption is that the learned inference bias due to short-term dependency of text data causes LVLMs to focus on adjacent text tokens at the expense of visual information.

### Mechanism 3: Joint Training of LVLM with MDA and SIG
The combination of MDA and SIG addresses language bias from both training and inference perspectives without requiring additional training resources or data. MDA ensures effective attention to visual inputs across all layers during training, while SIG enhances visual guidance during inference by adjusting output distributions based on multimodal-null inputs. The core assumption is that addressing language bias requires interventions at both training (to ensure visual inputs are processed) and inference (to ensure visual inputs guide generation) stages.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Self-attention mechanism in transformers
  - Why needed here: Understanding how LVLMs process multimodal inputs through attention mechanisms is crucial for grasping how MDA modifies this process.
  - Quick check question: How does the standard self-attention mechanism in transformers work, and how is it modified in MDA?

- Concept: Multimodal alignment in LVLMs
  - Why needed here: Understanding how LVLMs align visual and text inputs is essential for comprehending the challenges that lead to language bias.
  - Quick check question: What is multimodal alignment in LVLMs, and why is it challenging to align visual and text inputs effectively?

- Concept: Training data distribution and its impact on model behavior
  - Why needed here: Understanding how differences in training scales between LLM pretraining and multimodal alignment stages contribute to language bias.
  - Quick check question: How does the disparity in training scales between LLM pretraining and multimodal alignment stages affect the behavior of LVLMs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  LLM backbone (Vicuna-1.5) -> Visual encoder (CLIP-ViT-L-14-336) -> MLP adapter -> MDA (parallel dual-attention) -> SIG (soft visual prompt replacement) -> Output generation

- Critical path:
  1. Input visual and text tokens
  2. Visual tokens projected to LLM space via MLP adapter
  3. MDA processes both modalities with parallel dual-attention
  4. SIG may replace visual inputs with soft visual prompt during training
  5. Model generates response, with SIG adjusting output distribution during inference

- Design tradeoffs:
  - MDA increases computational cost due to dual-attention calculation but improves visual comprehension
  - SIG requires careful tuning of replacement probability θ and scaling parameter λ
  - Learnable soft visual prompt adds minimal parameters (0.03-0.02% of total) but requires joint training

- Failure signatures:
  - If MDA fails: Model reverts to ignoring visual inputs in deeper layers, similar to standard LVLMs
  - If SIG fails: Model continues to over-rely on text inputs, leading to hallucinations
  - If both fail: Model performance similar to baseline LLaVA-1.5

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate attention allocation across layers with and without MDA to confirm visual input utilization
  2. Test SIG effectiveness with different replacement probabilities θ to find optimal value
  3. Compare open-ended generation performance with and without SIG to measure hallucination reduction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of LACING vary when applied to different LVLM architectures beyond the LLaVA family?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper primarily evaluates LACING on LLaVA models, noting that "the effectiveness of our approach on other LVLMs with different architectures remains largely unexplored" as a limitation.
- Why unresolved: The study is limited to LLaVA models, and the paper explicitly states that the method's effectiveness on diverse LVLM architectures is untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying LACING to a range of LVLM architectures (e.g., Q-former-based, Resampler-based) and comparing their performance improvements against baselines.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between the scaling parameter λ and the replace probability θ in the Soft-Image Guidance mechanism?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses hyperparameter tuning, noting that "the optimal value for the scaling parameter λ lies between 1.5 and 2.0" and provides a table evaluating different θ values, but does not fully explore their interaction.
- Why unresolved: While individual parameter ranges are discussed, the combined effect and optimal interaction between λ and θ are not fully analyzed.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic grid search or ablation study exploring the joint effects of λ and θ on model performance across multiple benchmarks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does the language bias in LVLMs stem more from the pretraining-distribution dominance or the learned inference bias due to short-term dependency of text data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies two main reasons for language bias: (1) different training scales between pretraining and multimodal alignment, and (2) learned inference bias due to short-term dependency of text data, but does not quantify their relative contributions.
- Why unresolved: The paper proposes a unified solution addressing both factors but does not isolate their individual impacts on language bias.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments isolating each factor (e.g., training with matched scales or using different decoding strategies) to measure their individual contributions to language bias.

## Limitations

- Limited empirical validation of the root causes of language bias, with claims about training scale disparity and text dependency not directly measured
- Dual-attention mechanism increases computational complexity during both training and inference, though overhead is not quantified
- Evaluation focuses primarily on benchmark performance improvements without detailed ablation studies showing individual contributions of MDA and SIG components

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The overall effectiveness of LACING in reducing hallucinations and improving visual comprehension on benchmark datasets (MMBench, TextVQA, LLaVA-Bench, Object Hallucination Benchmark, MM-VET) is well-supported by experimental results.

**Medium Confidence**: The specific mechanisms by which MDA and SIG address language bias have theoretical justification but limited direct empirical validation.

**Low Confidence**: The paper's claims about the root causes of language bias (training scale disparity and short-term text dependency) are presented as established facts but lack direct experimental verification.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study of Individual Components**: Conduct controlled experiments isolating MDA and SIG effects by testing: (a) LLaVA-1.5 with only MDA, (b) LLaVA-1.5 with only SIG, and (c) LLaVA-1.5 with neither component.

2. **Attention Pattern Analysis**: Visualize and quantify attention weight distributions across layers with and without MDA to empirically verify that visual inputs receive "considerable attention weights" in deeper layers as claimed.

3. **Training Scale Impact Experiment**: Design an experiment varying the relative amounts of text-only versus multimodal training data to test the hypothesis that training scale disparity causes language bias.
