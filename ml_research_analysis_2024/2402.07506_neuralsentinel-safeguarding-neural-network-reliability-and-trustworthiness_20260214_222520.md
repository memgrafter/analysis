# NeuralSentinel: Safeguarding Neural Network Reliability and Trustworthiness

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.07506
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07506
- Authors: Xabier Echeberria-Barrio; Mikel Gorricho; Selene Valencia; Francesco Zola
- Reference count: 27
- Key outcome: NeuralSentinel combines attack, defense, and explainability techniques in an easy-to-use tool for assessing ANN reliability, validated through a Hackathon event.

## Executive Summary
NeuralSentinel is a comprehensive tool designed to assess the reliability and trustworthiness of Artificial Neural Network models by combining state-of-the-art attack and defense strategies with explainability concepts. The tool provides a user-friendly interface that allows both experts and non-experts to apply various adversarial attacks (FGSM, BIM, PGD) and defense mechanisms (adversarial training, dimensionality reduction, prediction similarity) while visualizing the impact on model behavior. During a Hackathon validation event, users successfully attacked and defended a skin cancer image detector, gaining insights into model misclassification factors and the effectiveness of different techniques. The tool aims to bridge the gap between complex neural network operations and human understanding, enabling more informed decisions about model deployment and trustworthiness.

## Method Summary
NeuralSentinel implements multiple adversarial attack algorithms (FGSM, BIM, PGD) and defense strategies (adversarial training, dimensionality reduction, prediction similarity) that can be combined and applied to pre-trained ANN models. The tool includes an explainability module that monitors neuron activation frequencies across classes to help users understand model decision-making processes. Users interact with the system through a visualization interface that displays original and attacked data, similarity metrics, and neuron behavior patterns. The tool was validated using a skin cancer image detector model and breast histopathology dataset during a Hackathon event, where participants iteratively tested attacks and defenses while learning about model vulnerabilities.

## Key Results
- Successfully validated NeuralSentinel during a Hackathon event where users attacked and defended a skin cancer image detector
- Demonstrated that combining multiple attack and defense strategies reveals model vulnerabilities that single approaches might miss
- Showed that explainability features help users understand model decision-making processes through neuron activation monitoring

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Combining multiple attack and defense strategies increases the detection of model weaknesses and improves reliability assessment.
- Mechanism: By deploying various adversarial attacks (FGSM, BIM, PGD) and defense mechanisms (adversarial training, dimensionality reduction, prediction similarity) in combination, the tool can stress-test the neural network under diverse perturbation scenarios, revealing vulnerabilities that single-strategy approaches might miss.
- Core assumption: Different attack and defense techniques target different aspects of model robustness, and their combination provides a more comprehensive reliability evaluation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "NS provide a simple and easy-to-use interface for helping humans in the loop dealing with all the needed information."
  - [section] "The tool allows the application of different state-of-the-art attack and defence strategies, that can also be combined in order to detect the most suitable one for the considered use case."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; related papers focus on individual attack/defense methods but not comprehensive combinations.
- Break condition: If the combined strategies produce conflicting results or if the tool cannot effectively manage the complexity of multiple simultaneous evaluations.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Explainability features increase user trust by revealing the model's decision-making process.
- Mechanism: The XAI module monitors neuron activation frequencies and compares them across classes, helping users understand which features the model relies on for predictions and how attacks alter these behaviors.
- Core assumption: Users can interpret neuron activation patterns and frequency differences to gain insight into model behavior.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This XAI module aims to approach non-expert staff to understand the model decisions based on the model inputs."
  - [section] "the XAI module uses randomly selected data... to calculate and report the most interesting models' neurons... sorted by class comparisons."
  - [corpus] Limited evidence; related papers discuss explainability but not specifically neuron frequency monitoring for adversarial scenarios.
- Break condition: If the neuron activation data is too complex for non-experts to interpret or if the visualization fails to clearly show the impact of attacks.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Interactive visualization and simulation enable users to learn about model reliability through hands-on experimentation.
- Mechanism: The tool provides real-time feedback on attack success rates, similarity metrics, and neuron behavior, allowing users to iteratively test and understand the effects of different attacks and defenses.
- Core assumption: Direct interaction with the model under attack leads to better understanding than passive observation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "During the event, experts and non-experts attacked and defended the detector, learning which factors were the most important for model misclassification and which techniques were the most efficient."
  - [section] "The visualization interface allows the user to execute the operations and visualize the results... displays the original and the attacked data, as well as the difference between them."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; hackathon-based validation is described but not deeply analyzed in related papers.
- Break condition: If the interface becomes too complex or if the simulation results are not clearly tied to actionable insights.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Adversarial machine learning basics
  - Why needed here: Understanding how small input perturbations can cause model misclassification is essential for using attack tools effectively.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between FGSM and PGD attacks in terms of perturbation application?
- Concept: Neural network architecture and neuron activation
  - Why needed here: The XAI module relies on monitoring neuron activations, so users must grasp how neurons contribute to classification.
  - Quick check question: How does the frequency of neuron activation differ between classes in a well-trained model?
- Concept: Similarity metrics and perturbation evaluation
  - Why needed here: Metrics like SSIM and the "grade" help users judge the quality and impact of adversarial examples.
  - Quick check question: Why is a high similarity score between original and attacked data desirable in adversarial testing?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: NeuralSentinel module (backend with attack, defense, XAI submodules) -> API REST module -> Visualization module (frontend with Command Control, Impact, Explainability views)
- Critical path: Load model/data -> Apply attack -> Evaluate defense -> Visualize results -> Interpret XAI
- Design tradeoffs: Comprehensive attack/defense coverage vs. interface complexity; real-time simulation vs. computational cost; neuron-level explainability vs. user interpretability
- Failure signatures: High similarity but low misclassification (ineffective attack); low similarity but high misclassification (obvious tampering); XAI view fails to update after attack; API timeouts during large model loading
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Load a simple CNN model and MNIST data; run FGSM attack with ε=0.1 and observe accuracy drop.
  2. Apply adversarial training defense to the same model; rerun FGSM and compare results.
  3. Use the XAI module to visualize neuron activations before and after attack; identify top-k neurons for misclassification.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How can the NeuralSentinel tool's attack and defense mechanisms be further improved to better handle emerging adversarial attack techniques?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that NeuralSentinel includes state-of-the-art attack and defense strategies, but it also suggests extending the tool to incorporate more mechanisms, indicating potential for improvement.
- Why unresolved: Adversarial attack techniques are constantly evolving, and the effectiveness of current defense mechanisms may diminish over time.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies showing the effectiveness of NeuralSentinel's current mechanisms against new attack techniques, and user feedback on the tool's performance in real-world scenarios.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the optimal parameters for the attack algorithms in NeuralSentinel to maximize the detection of adversarial examples without causing excessive computational overhead?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the need for fine-tuning attack parameters during the Hackathon, suggesting that optimal parameter settings are not yet fully determined.
- Why unresolved: Different models and datasets may require different parameter settings for optimal performance, and finding the right balance between effectiveness and efficiency is challenging.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experimentation with various parameter settings across different models and datasets, along with performance metrics to assess computational overhead.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the explainability module in NeuralSentinel be enhanced to provide more intuitive and actionable insights for non-expert users?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions the importance of the explainability module in helping users understand model decisions, but also notes that there is room for improvement in visualization and user experience.
- Why unresolved: Current explainability techniques may not be easily interpretable by non-experts, and enhancing the module could lead to better user understanding and trust.
- What evidence would resolve it: User studies evaluating the effectiveness of different explainability techniques in conveying model decisions, and feedback from non-expert users on the clarity and usefulness of the insights provided.

## Limitations

- Validation based on single Hackathon event with limited participants rather than comprehensive quantitative evaluation
- Lack of rigorous metrics for attack success rates, defense effectiveness, and user comprehension assessment
- Unproven scalability to larger models and datasets with complex computational requirements

## Confidence

- **High**: The technical implementation of attack (FGSM, BIM, PGD) and defense strategies is clearly described and follows established adversarial ML literature
- **Medium**: The integration of multiple attack/defense strategies and explainability features into a unified tool is feasible based on the described architecture
- **Low**: Claims about improved reliability assessment and user trust through explainability are not supported by rigorous evaluation data

## Next Checks

1. Conduct controlled experiments measuring attack success rates, defense effectiveness, and model accuracy degradation across multiple model architectures and datasets
2. Perform user studies with both expert and non-expert participants to evaluate comprehension of XAI visualizations and overall tool usability
3. Test the tool's performance with larger-scale models and datasets to assess computational efficiency and scalability limitations
