# Machine Unlearning in Generative AI: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2407.20516
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20516
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Comprehensive survey of machine unlearning techniques for generative AI models, including formulation of three key objectives (accuracy, locality, generalizability) and categorization of approaches.

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a systematic overview of machine unlearning techniques for generative AI models, addressing the growing need to remove specific knowledge from large language models, generative image models, and multimodal models. The authors formulate three key objectives for evaluating unlearning effectiveness: accuracy (preventing generation of unwanted content), locality (preserving performance on unrelated tasks), and generalizability (extending unlearning to unseen related content). They categorize existing approaches into parameter optimization and in-context unlearning strategies, analyzing their advantages, limitations, and practical applications. This work serves as a comprehensive reference for researchers and practitioners in generative AI safety and privacy.

## Method Summary
The survey synthesizes existing machine unlearning approaches by first defining the problem framework with forget and retain datasets, then categorizing methods into parameter optimization (gradient-based adjustments, knowledge distillation, parameter-efficient modules) and in-context unlearning (prompt manipulation, external memory). The authors propose an evaluation framework based on three objectives and review datasets, benchmarks, and applications. The methodology involves systematic literature review, theoretical formulation of unlearning objectives, and analysis of practical implementation challenges across different generative model architectures.

## Key Results

- Systematic categorization of unlearning approaches into parameter optimization and in-context strategies
- Identification of key challenges including cross-modal unlearning, evaluation reliability, and theoretical guarantees
- Comprehensive review of datasets, benchmarks, and applications for GenAI unlearning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Parameter optimization unlearning methods work by selectively adjusting model parameters to remove unwanted knowledge while preserving performance on unrelated tasks.
- **Mechanism:** These methods use techniques like gradient-based optimization (with or without reverse loss), knowledge distillation, and parameter-efficient operations to modify only the parameters associated with target knowledge.
- **Core assumption:** The unwanted knowledge can be isolated to specific parameters or parameter subspaces without affecting unrelated knowledge.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "categorize existing approaches into parameter optimization and in-context unlearning strategies"
  - [section] "Parameter optimization for unlearning can be implemented through various methods, including gradient-based adjustments, knowledge distillation, data sharding, integrating extra learnable layers, task vector, and parameter efficient module operation"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence for this specific mechanism
- **Break condition:** When knowledge is entangled across parameters, making isolation impossible without affecting unrelated performance.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** In-context unlearning works by manipulating the model's context or environment rather than modifying parameters directly.
- **Mechanism:** This approach retains original parameters but alters input prompts or adds external memory modules to achieve selective forgetting during inference.
- **Core assumption:** The model's behavior can be sufficiently controlled through context manipulation without parameter changes.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "categorize existing approaches into parameter optimization and in-context unlearning strategies"
  - [section] "In-context unlearning techniques retain the parameters in their original state and manipulate the model's context or environment to facilitate unlearning"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence for this specific mechanism
- **Break condition:** When the model's internal knowledge is too deeply embedded to be overridden by context changes alone.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Machine unlearning effectiveness can be evaluated using three key objectives: accuracy (preventing generation of unwanted content), locality (preserving performance on unrelated tasks), and generalizability (extending unlearning to unseen related content).
- **Mechanism:** These objectives provide a structured framework for measuring how well unlearning techniques remove specific knowledge while maintaining overall model utility.
- **Core assumption:** These three metrics comprehensively capture the essential requirements for effective machine unlearning in generative AI.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "formulate three key objectives for MU in GenAI: accuracy (preventing generation of unwanted content), locality (preserving performance on unrelated tasks), and generalizability (extending unlearning to unseen related content)"
  - [section] "The three quantitative objectives of optimizing (and evaluating) g∗ are as follows (higher is better): Accuracy, Locality, Generalizability"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence for this specific framework
- **Break condition:** When unlearning objectives conflict or when evaluation metrics don't capture real-world performance adequately.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Gradient-based optimization
  - **Why needed here:** Understanding how gradients can be used to both learn and unlearn information in neural networks
  - **Quick check question:** How does gradient ascent differ from gradient descent in the context of machine unlearning?

- **Concept:** Knowledge distillation
  - **Why needed here:** Many unlearning approaches use teacher-student model configurations to transfer knowledge while removing unwanted information
  - **Quick check question:** What is the relationship between knowledge distillation and machine unlearning?

- **Concept:** Parameter-efficient fine-tuning
  - **Why needed here:** Modern unlearning approaches often use parameter-efficient modules like LoRA to make unlearning more practical
  - **Quick check question:** How do parameter-efficient modules like LoRA enable more efficient unlearning compared to full fine-tuning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data processing pipeline for forget and retain datasets -> Model selection and loading for pre-trained generative models -> Unlearning method implementation (parameter optimization or in-context) -> Evaluation framework for accuracy, locality, and generalizability -> Dataset management for training, validation, and testing

- **Critical path:** 1. Load pre-trained model and datasets 2. Implement chosen unlearning method 3. Apply unlearning to remove target knowledge 4. Evaluate performance across all three objectives 5. Iterate and optimize parameters

- **Design tradeoffs:** Parameter optimization offers better accuracy but may sacrifice locality; In-context unlearning preserves parameters but may be less effective; Computational efficiency vs. unlearning effectiveness; Granularity of forgetting vs. risk of affecting unrelated knowledge

- **Failure signatures:** Catastrophic forgetting of unrelated knowledge; Incomplete removal of target knowledge; Performance degradation on retain datasets; Generalizability failure on unseen related content

- **First 3 experiments:** 1. Test basic gradient ascent unlearning on a small, well-defined dataset 2. Compare parameter optimization vs. in-context unlearning on the same task 3. Evaluate trade-offs between accuracy, locality, and generalizability on benchmark datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can we design machine unlearning approaches that maintain consistency across model updates when new undesirable knowledge is introduced?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 7.2.1 discusses that current GenAI MU approaches may fail to erase newly introduced undesirable knowledge, as models may need to be fine-tuned on similar unlearned knowledge at different time steps.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper highlights this as a promising future direction but doesn't provide concrete solutions for maintaining consistency across updates.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Development and empirical validation of unlearning methods that can effectively remove newly introduced undesirable knowledge while preserving previously unlearned content across multiple model update cycles.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What theoretical guarantees can be established for generative model unlearning effectiveness and the trade-off between unlearning accuracy, locality, and generalizability?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 7.1.2 identifies a significant gap between practical unlearning applications and theoretical analysis, noting that comprehensive theoretical analyses tailored to generative models are yet to be developed.
- **Why unresolved:** While some work like NPO [185] provides theoretical insights for LLMs, there's a lack of broader theoretical frameworks for different generative models.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Development of formal theoretical frameworks that provide guarantees for unlearning effectiveness across different generative models, including bounds on the trade-off between accuracy, locality, and generalizability.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can we develop more reliable evaluation methods for GenAI unlearning that don't depend on potentially biased LLMs as evaluators?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 7.2.3 discusses the limitations of using state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 as evaluators, noting their known biases and dependence on prompt templates.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper identifies this as a critical issue but doesn't propose alternative evaluation frameworks that could provide more reliable and unbiased assessments.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Creation and validation of alternative evaluation frameworks that combine multiple evaluation methods, including human evaluation protocols and automated metrics that are less susceptible to bias and prompt sensitivity.

## Limitations

- The survey relies heavily on theoretical formulations rather than extensive empirical demonstrations, particularly for multimodal and image generation models
- The three-objective framework represents a novel contribution, but empirical validation across diverse model architectures remains largely theoretical
- The relative effectiveness of different methods across varying generative model types is not conclusively established through comparative experiments

## Confidence

- **High confidence** in the taxonomy and categorization of unlearning approaches
- **Medium confidence** in the practical effectiveness claims without extensive empirical validation
- **Medium confidence** in the proposed evaluation framework as a theoretical construct

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical Benchmarking:** Conduct head-to-head comparisons of parameter optimization vs. in-context unlearning methods across multiple generative model architectures (LLMs, image generators, MLLMs) using standardized datasets to validate the theoretical effectiveness claims.

2. **Framework Validation:** Test the three-objective evaluation framework (accuracy, locality, generalizability) on real-world unlearning scenarios to determine if these metrics comprehensively capture practical unlearning performance and identify any missing dimensions.

3. **Cross-Modal Generalization:** Validate whether unlearning techniques developed for text-based models transfer effectively to image and multimodal models, addressing the current gap in cross-modal unlearning effectiveness.
