# YouTube Comments Decoded: Leveraging LLMs for Low Resource Language Classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.05039
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05039
- Reference count: 37
- Tamil macro-F1: 0.61 (rank 9th), Malayalam macro-F1: 0.50 (rank 13th)

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of sarcasm detection in code-mixed Tamil-English and Malayalam-English social media comments using GPT-3.5 Turbo with prompt-based zero-shot classification. The approach leverages the model's pre-trained knowledge to classify comments as sarcastic or non-sarcastic without extensive fine-tuning, achieving a macro-F1 score of 0.61 for Tamil (ranking 9th) and 0.50 for Malayalam (ranking 13th). The study demonstrates that prompt engineering is a viable approach for low-resource code-mixed languages, though performance varies significantly between languages and detection classes, with non-sarcastic detection being notably more accurate than sarcastic detection.

## Method Summary
The methodology employs GPT-3.5 Turbo for zero-shot classification of code-mixed YouTube comments using carefully crafted prompts. For each comment, a language-specific prompt is generated asking the model to classify the text as either "Sarcastic" or "Non-sarcastic." The system processes Tamil-English and Malayalam-English comments separately, with temperature settings (0.7, 0.8, 0.9) applied during inference. No fine-tuning or task-specific training data is required, relying instead on the model's pre-trained knowledge of linguistic patterns and cultural contexts. The approach minimizes dependency on labeled datasets, making it suitable for under-resourced languages.

## Key Results
- Tamil-English comments achieved macro-F1 score of 0.61, ranking 9th place
- Malayalam-English comments achieved macro-F1 score of 0.50, ranking 13th place
- Non-sarcastic class detection performed significantly better than sarcastic detection (Tamil: F1 0.79 vs 0.43; Malayalam: F1 0.77 vs 0.22)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Prompt-based zero-shot classification allows GPT-3.5 Turbo to leverage its pre-trained knowledge to handle sarcasm detection in code-mixed Tamil-English and Malayalam-English texts without extensive fine-tuning.
- Mechanism: The LLM interprets the classification task as a natural language instruction embedded in the prompt. This instruction provides context and guides the model to focus on sarcasm-relevant cues (e.g., tone, context, language switching). The model's pre-trained knowledge base, encompassing diverse linguistic patterns and cultural contexts, is activated to classify the text according to the specified categories ("Sarcastic" or "Non-sarcastic").
- Core assumption: The pre-trained knowledge of GPT-3.5 Turbo includes sufficient exposure to code-mixing patterns, cultural context, and sarcasm cues in Tamil and Malayalam to enable effective zero-shot classification.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This work introduces a prompt-based method using GPT-3.5 Turbo for sarcasm and sentiment detection in code-mixed texts, specifically focusing on Tamil-English and Malayalam-English language pairs."
  - [section 5] "Prompting [9] is an effective approach for solving the problem of sarcasm detection in code-mixed texts, particularly in under-resourced languages like Tamil-English and Malayalam-English..."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The explicit and concise nature of the prompts improves interpretability by making it easier to understand how the model interprets the task.
- Mechanism: The instructions are directly embedded in the input prompt, providing a clear and transparent mapping between the input text and the expected output category. This allows researchers to examine the model's responses to different prompts and gain insights into where and why the model might be making classification errors, leading to more targeted improvements.
- Core assumption: The model's interpretation of the task is sufficiently aligned with the explicit instructions provided in the prompt, and the output is consistent with the expected categories.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5] "Improved Interpretability: The explicit nature of prompts makes it easier to understand how the model is interpreting the task [31], as the instructions are directly embedded in the input."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Prompting reduces the need for extensive task-specific data, making it a feasible and efficient solution for resource-constrained settings like low-resource code-mixed languages.
- Mechanism: By leveraging the model's existing knowledge gained from vast pre-training on diverse text corpora, prompting allows the model to generalize to new tasks with minimal additional training. This minimizes the dependency on large annotated datasets, which are often difficult to obtain for under-resourced languages.
- Core assumption: The model's pre-trained knowledge is sufficiently general and transferable to enable effective performance on the sarcasm detection task with minimal task-specific data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5] "Reduced Need for Task-Specific Data: Building a model from scratch or fine-tuning a model for sarcasm detection in code-mixed texts would typically require a substantial amount of labeled data, which is often difficult to obtain for under-resourced languages [32]."

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input comments -> Prompt Generator -> GPT-3.5 Turbo -> Classification Output -> Evaluation

- Critical path:
  1. Input comment is tokenized and embedded
  2. Prompt is added to the embedded comment
  3. GPT-3.5 Turbo processes the input and generates a classification
  4. Classification is compared to the ground truth label
  5. Macro-F1 score is calculated based on the comparison

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Prompt simplicity vs. model performance: Simpler prompts may be easier to interpret but might not provide enough context for accurate classification.
  - Language-specific prompts vs. universal prompts: Language-specific prompts can be tailored to the nuances of each language but require more development effort.
  - Zero-shot vs. few-shot learning: Zero-shot learning minimizes the need for task-specific data but may have lower performance than few-shot learning.

- Failure signatures:
  - Low precision for sarcastic class: Indicates a high rate of false positives, where non-sarcastic comments are misclassified as sarcastic.
  - Low recall for sarcastic class: Indicates a high rate of false negatives, where actual sarcastic comments are missed by the model.
  - Imbalanced performance between sarcastic and non-sarcastic classes: Suggests that the model is better at detecting one class than the other.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Vary prompt temperature (e.g., 0.7, 0.8, 0.9) to observe its impact on classification consistency and accuracy.
  2. Test different prompt formulations (e.g., "Is this comment sarcastic? Yes/No" vs. "Please classify this comment as Sarcastic or Non-sarcastic") to assess their impact on model performance.
  3. Analyze the impact of including or excluding context (e.g., surrounding comments or user information) in the prompt on sarcasm detection accuracy.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific prompt engineering strategies could improve sarcasm detection performance for low-resource code-mixed languages beyond zero-shot prompting?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses prompt engineering as a viable approach but notes the need for improved training strategies to better capture sarcasm nuances
- Why unresolved: The paper only experimented with basic zero-shot prompting and did not explore more sophisticated prompt engineering techniques like chain-of-thought prompting, few-shot examples, or prompt tuning
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies testing different prompt engineering approaches (e.g., few-shot prompting with diverse examples, iterative refinement, temperature tuning) on the same datasets to measure performance improvements

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of prompt-based approaches compare to fine-tuned transformer models specifically trained on code-mixed Dravidian language data for sarcasm detection?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that traditional approaches struggle with code-mixed data and that prompting minimizes the need for extensive labeled datasets, but doesn't compare against fine-tuned models
- Why unresolved: The study focused solely on prompting approaches without benchmarking against models trained on the specific code-mixed datasets
- What evidence would resolve it: Direct comparison of prompt-based GPT-3.5 Turbo performance against BERT-like models fine-tuned on the same code-mixed Tamil and Malayalam datasets, measuring both macro-F1 scores and class-specific performance

### Open Question 3
- Question: What linguistic features or patterns in code-mixed Tamil and Malayalam specifically contribute to the difficulty in detecting sarcasm, and how can these be systematically addressed?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that code-mixing complicates NLP tasks due to complex interaction between languages and that the model struggles with detecting sarcasm in Malayalam (F1 0.22) and Tamil (F1 0.43)
- Why unresolved: While performance metrics are provided, the paper doesn't analyze which specific linguistic phenomena (code-switching points, idiomatic expressions, script variations) most affect sarcasm detection
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed linguistic analysis of misclassified instances identifying patterns in code-switching locations, non-native script usage, and cultural references that correlate with detection failures, followed by targeted feature engineering or data augmentation strategies

## Limitations
- The study only uses test sets without validation performance or training details, making it unclear if prompts were optimized through iterative refinement
- The performance gap between Tamil (F1 0.61) and Malayalam (F1 0.50) may reflect pre-training bias rather than inherent language difficulty
- No analysis of misclassified instances or failure patterns limits understanding of where the model struggles specifically with sarcasm detection

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The reported macro-F1 scores (0.61 for Tamil, 0.50 for Malayalam) and ranking positions (9th and 13th) are directly verifiable from the evaluation metrics described.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that prompting is "effective" for low-resource code-mixed languages is supported by the results but lacks comparative analysis against alternative approaches.
- **Low Confidence**: The assertion that Tamil-English is inherently "easier" than Malayalam-English for sarcasm detection is not sufficiently supported, as the study doesn't control for dataset characteristics.

## Next Checks
1. Cross-validate with different prompt formulations across both languages to determine if performance differences stem from prompt design rather than language difficulty
2. Analyze dataset characteristics (comment length, code-mixing density, domain specificity) to identify whether imbalances explain the performance gap
3. Conduct detailed error analysis by sampling misclassified instances from both languages to identify systematic failure patterns and differences between Tamil and Malayalam
