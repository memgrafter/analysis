# An Evaluation Framework for Attributed Information Retrieval using Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.08014
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08014
- Reference count: 37
- Primary result: Framework introduces novel metrics (AutoAIS, citation overlap) for evaluating attributed information retrieval with LLMs

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive framework for evaluating attributed information retrieval using Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework addresses the challenge of assessing both answer correctness and attribution quality in open-ended information-seeking scenarios where queries can have multiple answers supported by diverse sources. The authors propose three architectural designs (Generate, Retrieve then Generate, and Generate then Retrieve) and demonstrate their effectiveness using the HAGRID dataset. The framework introduces novel metrics for evaluating attribution quality and shows that the Retrieve then Generate approach with query generation yields the best performance across multiple evaluation metrics.

## Method Summary
The framework implements three architectural designs for attributed information retrieval: Generate (G), Retrieve then Generate (RTG), and Generate then Retrieve (GTR). Each design can use any backbone LLM. The RTG architecture retrieves relevant documents before generating answers, while GTR generates answers first then retrieves supporting documents. The framework uses the HAGRID dataset for evaluation and introduces novel metrics including AutoAIS and citation overlap to assess attribution quality. Experiments compare the three designs across multiple evaluation metrics including BLEU, ROUGE-L, BertScore, and new attribution-specific metrics.

## Key Results
- RTG scenarios achieve the best overall performance with BLEU score of 18.33, ROUGE-L of 33.58, and BertScore of 56.13
- RTG-query-gen variant shows highest citation quality metrics among all architectural designs
- Novel metrics AutoAIS and citation overlap effectively evaluate attribution quality in attributed information retrieval
- Framework demonstrates reproducibility and provides comprehensive evaluation across multiple metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its systematic approach to attributed information retrieval, combining retrieval mechanisms with generation capabilities. The RTG architecture works particularly well because it grounds the generation process in retrieved documents, ensuring factual accuracy and proper attribution. The query generation component in RTG-query-gen further enhances retrieval relevance by creating targeted subqueries that better capture the information need. The novel metrics provide quantitative measures for attribution quality that go beyond traditional text similarity metrics.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Attributed Information Retrieval**: A framework combining information retrieval with answer generation while maintaining source attribution. Why needed: Traditional IR systems return documents but don't generate answers with proper citations. Quick check: Can the system generate answers with verifiable source attribution?

2. **Architectural Design Patterns**: Three main patterns (G, RTG, GTR) for combining retrieval and generation. Why needed: Different scenarios require different trade-offs between retrieval accuracy and generation quality. Quick check: Does the architecture match the specific use case requirements?

3. **Evaluation Metrics for Attribution**: Novel metrics beyond traditional text similarity that assess citation quality. Why needed: Standard metrics don't capture whether answers are properly attributed to sources. Quick check: Do the metrics correlate with human judgment of attribution quality?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: User Query -> Query Processor -> [Retrieval Engine | Generation Engine] -> Answer with Citations

**Critical Path**: For RTG-query-gen: User Query → Query Generator → Retrieval Engine → Document Processor → Generation Engine → Answer with Citations

**Design Tradeoffs**: G architecture prioritizes generation speed but may hallucinate; RTG prioritizes accuracy but requires more computation; GTR may generate first but relies on retrieval for validation.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor retrieval leads to hallucinated answers; weak query generation produces irrelevant retrievals; generation without proper attribution yields unreliable results.

**First Experiments**: 1) Test baseline G architecture on simple queries; 2) Implement RTG with fixed queries; 3) Add query generation component to RTG.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation constrained to single dataset (HAGRID), limiting generalizability
- Experiments don't explore all possible architectural variations systematically
- Novel metrics validated only within this specific context
- Comparison limited to LLaMA-2 backbone LLM

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Framework reproducibility with HAGRID dataset | High |
| Superiority of RTG-query-gen variant | Medium |
| Effectiveness of novel attribution metrics | Medium |
| Generalizability across domains and datasets | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework with multiple diverse datasets beyond HAGRID to validate cross-domain performance
2. Experiment with different backbone LLMs (not just LLaMA-2) to assess architecture robustness
3. Compare the proposed metrics against human evaluation on a broader set of queries to validate metric reliability
