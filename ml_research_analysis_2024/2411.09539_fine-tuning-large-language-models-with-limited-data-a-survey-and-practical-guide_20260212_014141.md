# Fine-tuning Large Language Models with Limited Data: A Survey and Practical Guide

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2411.09539
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09539
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Practical guide to fine-tuning large language models under data scarcity, covering parameter-efficient methods, domain adaptation, and specialization techniques with actionable insights

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive overview of fine-tuning large language models when training data is limited. It systematically covers parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, domain and cross-lingual adaptation strategies, specialization techniques, and preference alignment approaches. The paper emphasizes practical guidance for researchers and practitioners, offering insights into when and how to apply different methods based on task constraints and resource availability.

## Method Summary
The survey synthesizes current knowledge on fine-tuning approaches for data-scarce scenarios through systematic categorization of techniques. It organizes methods into parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), domain adaptation, cross-lingual adaptation, task specialization, and preference alignment. The analysis draws from empirical studies and practical implementations to highlight trade-offs between different approaches, with particular attention to sample efficiency and adaptation quality under constrained conditions.

## Key Results
- Data quality often outweighs quantity in fine-tuning effectiveness
- Larger foundation models demonstrate greater sample efficiency
- Careful method selection is crucial for effective adaptation in low-resource settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Fine-tuning large language models with limited data works by leveraging the pre-existing knowledge embedded in foundation models while adapting specific parameters or representations to new tasks. Parameter-efficient methods reduce the number of trainable parameters, making adaptation feasible with fewer examples. Domain and cross-lingual adaptation techniques focus on transferring relevant knowledge while preserving general capabilities. Specialization methods fine-tune models for specific tasks without catastrophic forgetting. Preference alignment techniques align model outputs with human values using minimal preference data through techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback.

## Foundational Learning
- **Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)**: Reduces computational cost and data requirements by updating only a small subset of parameters - needed to make fine-tuning feasible with limited data, quick check: verify trainable parameter count reduction
- **Domain adaptation**: Transfers knowledge from source to target domains while maintaining domain-specific characteristics - needed to apply general models to specialized contexts, quick check: measure domain shift reduction
- **Cross-lingual adaptation**: Enables models to perform well across language boundaries - needed for global application of models trained on dominant languages, quick check: evaluate performance on target language benchmarks
- **Catastrophic forgetting**: Risk of losing previously learned knowledge during fine-tuning - needed to understand trade-offs in adaptation, quick check: measure performance drop on source tasks
- **Sample efficiency**: Ability to learn effectively from few examples - needed to quantify adaptation effectiveness under data constraints, quick check: plot performance vs. training data size

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Foundation Model <- PEFT Adapter -> Downstream Task -> Evaluation Metrics

**Critical Path**: Foundation Model → PEFT Method Selection → Fine-tuning Configuration → Evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs**: Model size vs. sample efficiency (larger models more sample-efficient but costlier), parameter efficiency vs. adaptation quality (more parameters often yield better results but require more data), computational resources vs. fine-tuning approach (full fine-tuning most flexible but most expensive)

**Failure Signatures**: Catastrophic forgetting of general capabilities, overfitting to limited training data, poor generalization to out-of-distribution examples, unstable training dynamics with small datasets

**First Experiments**:
1. Compare different PEFT methods (LoRA, prefix tuning, adapters) on a small benchmark with controlled data scarcity
2. Evaluate catastrophic forgetting by testing pre-fine-tuning performance on source tasks after adaptation
3. Measure sample efficiency by fine-tuning with incrementally increasing dataset sizes and plotting learning curves

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper notes that many parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods lack extensive ablation studies under extreme data scarcity conditions. It highlights the need for more systematic validation of claims about data quality versus quantity across diverse low-resource scenarios. The survey also identifies the challenge of providing universally applicable guidance given the task-specific nature of many fine-tuning trade-offs.

## Limitations
- Many PEFT methods lack extensive ablation studies under extreme data scarcity
- Claims about data quality vs. quantity need more systematic validation
- Task-specific nature of fine-tuning trade-offs makes universal guidance challenging

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| General landscape and categorization of fine-tuning methods | High |
| Empirical trade-offs between different approaches | Medium |
| Practical recommendations for specific scenarios | Medium |
| Long-term applicability of technique recommendations | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic ablation studies comparing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods under controlled data scarcity conditions (e.g., 10, 100, 1000 samples) across multiple task types
2. Perform cross-modal validation of the claim that larger models are more sample-efficient by testing foundation models of different sizes on the same low-resource tasks
3. Implement a living benchmark that regularly updates performance comparisons of fine-tuning methods as new techniques emerge, tracking the persistence of current recommendations over time
