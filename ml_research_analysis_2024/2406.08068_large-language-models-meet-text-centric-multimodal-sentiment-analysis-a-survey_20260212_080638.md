core_contribution: This survey comprehensively reviews the application of large language
  models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) in text-centric multimodal sentiment
  analysis tasks, which combine text with images, videos, and audio to analyze emotions
  and sentiments. It categorizes 14 multimodal sentiment analysis tasks into coarse-grained
  (e.g., sentiment classification) and fine-grained (e.g., aspect-based sentiment
  analysis) levels, summarizing recent methods and highlighting how LLMs can enhance
  these tasks through knowledge supplementation, improved interpretability, and cross-domain
  applicability.

# Large Language Models Meet Text-Centric Multimodal Sentiment Analysis: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2406.08068
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08068
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Comprehensive review of LLM/LMM applications in text-centric multimodal sentiment analysis across 14 task categories

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a systematic overview of how large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) are being applied to text-centric multimodal sentiment analysis tasks. The authors categorize 14 multimodal sentiment analysis tasks into coarse-grained and fine-grained levels, examining recent methods and identifying how LLMs can enhance these tasks through knowledge supplementation, improved interpretability, and cross-domain applicability. The paper serves as a comprehensive reference for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of LLMs and multimodal sentiment analysis.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a comprehensive literature review methodology, systematically categorizing multimodal sentiment analysis tasks and reviewing recent approaches that leverage LLMs and LMMs. The authors organize 14 tasks into two levels - coarse-grained tasks like sentiment classification and fine-grained tasks like aspect-based sentiment analysis - and analyze how LLMs can enhance each category. The methodology involves examining existing research papers, identifying patterns in LLM applications, and synthesizing findings to highlight both opportunities and challenges in the field.

## Key Results
- Systematic categorization of 14 multimodal sentiment analysis tasks into coarse-grained and fine-grained levels
- Identification of LLM capabilities in enhancing sentiment analysis through knowledge supplementation and improved interpretability
- Documentation of key challenges including LLM hallucinations and high fine-tuning costs
- Exploration of future applications in comment analysis and multimodal human-machine interaction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
LLMs work effectively for multimodal sentiment analysis by leveraging their extensive pre-trained knowledge and reasoning capabilities to process and integrate information from multiple modalities. The models can understand contextual relationships between text, images, audio, and video, enabling more nuanced sentiment detection that accounts for multimodal cues. LLMs enhance traditional approaches through their ability to generalize across domains, provide interpretable reasoning paths, and supplement domain-specific knowledge that may be missing from training data.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Multimodal Fusion Techniques** - Why needed: To combine information from different modalities effectively; Quick check: Verify models can integrate text and visual features without information loss
2. **Sentiment Analysis Fundamentals** - Why needed: Understanding sentiment detection principles across single and multiple modalities; Quick check: Ensure models can distinguish between emotion, sentiment, and opinion
3. **LLM Prompt Engineering** - Why needed: To effectively guide LLMs for specific multimodal sentiment tasks; Quick check: Test different prompt formats for task performance
4. **Cross-Modal Alignment** - Why needed: To ensure consistent representation across different input modalities; Quick check: Verify alignment metrics between text and visual embeddings
5. **Fine-tuning Strategies** - Why needed: To adapt LLMs efficiently for specific multimodal sentiment tasks; Quick check: Compare parameter-efficient methods against full fine-tuning
6. **Evaluation Metrics for Multimodal Sentiment** - Why needed: To properly assess model performance across different task types; Quick check: Validate metric selection against task requirements

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Text Input -> Multimodal Encoder -> Fusion Layer -> LLM Reasoning -> Sentiment Output

**Critical Path**: Input Processing -> Feature Extraction -> Multimodal Fusion -> LLM Reasoning -> Output Generation

**Design Tradeoffs**: Full fine-tuning provides better task-specific performance but at higher computational cost versus parameter-efficient methods that offer faster adaptation with potentially lower accuracy

**Failure Signatures**: Hallucinations in sentiment attribution, inconsistent reasoning across modalities, over-reliance on text modality when visual/audio cues are more informative

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Baseline comparison of traditional multimodal sentiment analysis versus LLM-enhanced approaches on standardized datasets
2. Ablation study examining the contribution of each modality to final sentiment predictions
3. Prompt engineering experiments testing different instruction formats for multimodal sentiment tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The survey identifies several open questions regarding the optimal integration of LLMs into multimodal sentiment analysis pipelines, including how to effectively handle hallucination issues, the best approaches for fine-tuning large models for specific sentiment tasks, and methods for ensuring consistent reasoning across different modalities. The paper also questions the scalability of current approaches to real-world applications and the development of standardized evaluation frameworks for multimodal sentiment analysis.

## Limitations
- Limited quantitative analysis of LLM hallucination rates and their impact on sentiment accuracy
- Speculative nature of future application predictions without empirical validation
- Incomplete cost-benefit analysis of different fine-tuning strategies for various task categories

## Confidence
- **High**: Systematic categorization of 14 multimodal sentiment analysis tasks
- **Medium**: Assessment of LLM capabilities in enhancing sentiment analysis tasks
- **Low**: Specific predictions about future applications and technological developments

## Next Checks
1. Conduct empirical benchmarking studies comparing LLM-enhanced approaches against traditional multimodal sentiment analysis methods across the 14 task categories identified in the survey, with standardized datasets and evaluation metrics.

2. Perform systematic error analysis on LLM outputs in multimodal sentiment tasks to quantify hallucination rates and identify patterns in knowledge supplementation failures.

3. Investigate cost-benefit analyses of different fine-tuning strategies for LLMs in multimodal sentiment analysis, including comparisons of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods versus full fine-tuning approaches.
