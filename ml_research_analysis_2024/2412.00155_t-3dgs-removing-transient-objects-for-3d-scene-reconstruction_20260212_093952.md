## Executive Summary
This paper presents T-3DGS, a novel framework for removing transient objects during 3D scene reconstruction using Gaussian Splatting. The method addresses the challenge of dynamic objects in video sequences that degrade reconstruction quality by employing an unsupervised classification network that distinguishes transient objects from static elements based on their distinct training dynamics, followed by refinement using an off-the-shelf segmentation method with bidirectional tracking to enhance boundary accuracy and temporal coherence. The key innovation is a divergence-based approach that leverages semantic consistency between reference and reconstructed frames for identifying transient objects, combined with mask propagation for improved consistency with semi-transient distractors.

## Method Summary
T-3DGS employs a two-stage approach to remove transient objects from 3D scene reconstruction. The first stage uses an unsupervised classification network that distinguishes transient objects from static elements by analyzing their distinct training dynamics, leveraging a divergence-based approach that identifies semantic inconsistencies between reference and reconstructed frames. The second stage refines the initial classification using an off-the-shelf segmentation method enhanced with bidirectional tracking to improve boundary accuracy and temporal coherence. The framework specifically addresses challenging cases including semi-transient and slow-moving objects that previous methods struggle with, using mask propagation to maintain consistency across frames.

## Key Results
- T-3DGS achieves PSNR improvements of 0.3-3.5 dB compared to state-of-the-art methods across benchmark datasets
- The method successfully handles challenging cases including semi-transient and slow-moving objects
- Evaluations on both sparsely and densely captured video datasets demonstrate significant performance gains
- The framework maintains temporal coherence through bidirectional tracking refinement

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by exploiting the fundamental difference in training dynamics between static and transient objects in Gaussian Splatting. Static objects converge to stable representations during training, while transient objects exhibit divergent behavior due to their changing positions across frames. By monitoring this divergence, the unsupervised classifier can identify transient objects without requiring manual annotations. The divergence-based approach leverages semantic consistency between reference and reconstructed frames, assuming that transient objects will show higher divergence due to their inconsistent presence. The bidirectional tracking refinement then improves boundary accuracy and temporal coherence by propagating segmentation masks across frames, handling semi-transient distractors more effectively than unidirectional approaches.

## Foundational Learning

**Gaussian Splatting** - A 3D scene representation technique that uses millions of small Gaussian ellipsoids to render photorealistic images efficiently. Needed because it provides the underlying 3D representation that T-3DGS modifies by removing transient objects. Quick check: Verify that the splatting representation can handle the removal of objects without introducing artifacts.

**Unsupervised Classification** - Machine learning approach that identifies patterns and categories without labeled training data. Needed because manual annotation of transient objects in video sequences is impractical for large datasets. Quick check: Confirm that the divergence-based features provide sufficient separation between transient and static object classes.

**Bidirectional Tracking** - Motion estimation technique that tracks objects both forward and backward in time. Needed because it provides better temporal coherence than unidirectional tracking, especially for semi-transient objects that appear in multiple frames. Quick check: Validate that backward tracking captures objects missed in forward-only approaches.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input video frames -> Unsupervised divergence classifier -> Initial transient mask -> Off-the-shelf segmentation -> Bidirectional tracking refinement -> Final mask -> Gaussian Splatting reconstruction

**Critical Path**: The divergence-based classification must complete before segmentation refinement can begin, as the initial mask guides the refinement process. The bidirectional tracking is the final step before reconstruction.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades computational complexity for accuracy by using two separate classification stages rather than a single end-to-end approach. This allows for more robust handling of challenging cases but increases processing time. The reliance on off-the-shelf segmentation introduces dependency on external methods but leverages existing optimizations.

**Failure Signatures**: The method may struggle with highly dynamic environments where semantic consistency assumptions break down, complex object motion patterns that obscure divergence signals, and cases where transient and static objects have similar motion characteristics. Poor quality input segmentation will cascade through the refinement stage.

**First Experiments**: 1) Test on synthetic sequences with controlled transient object motion to validate the divergence classification mechanism. 2) Evaluate the impact of removing the bidirectional tracking refinement on boundary accuracy and temporal coherence. 3) Compare performance across different off-the-shelf segmentation methods to assess dependency and potential improvements.
