# StructEval: Deepen and Broaden Large Language Model Assessment via Structured Evaluation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.03281
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03281
- Reference count: 23
- Evaluates LLMs using structured assessment across multiple cognitive levels

## Executive Summary
StructEval is a structured evaluation framework that addresses the limitations of single-item assessments for large language models. It generates test instances across multiple cognitive levels defined by Bloom's Taxonomy and around critical concepts identified through knowledge graphs. The framework significantly improves evaluation robustness against data contamination and increases rank consistency across models from 1.24% to 33.17%. Experiments show StructEval can automatically construct high-quality benchmarks with 95%+ helpfulness and 97%+ correctness rates.

## Method Summary
StructEval employs a two-module framework: Bloom's Taxonomy-based instance generation and Concept Mapping-based instance expansion. The system extracts test objectives from seed questions, retrieves relevant documents, and generates test instances at each of the six cognitive levels. It then uses knowledge graph retrieval to identify critical concepts and generates additional instances around these concepts. The framework uses GPT-3.5 for generation and BM25/BGE for retrieval, with human evaluation confirming high quality of generated instances.

## Key Results
- 95%+ helpfulness and 97%+ correctness rates for generated instances
- Rank consistency across models improves from 1.24% to 33.17%
- Maintains stable performance under data contamination while original benchmarks show significant divergence
- Successfully applies to multiple-choice benchmarks including MMLU, ARC-Easy, ARC-Challenge, and OpenBook QA

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
StructEval generates structured evaluation instances across multiple cognitive levels defined by Bloom's Taxonomy. The framework uses LLMs to automatically generate test instances at each of the six cognitive levels (Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create) for each test objective extracted from seed questions. This approach assumes LLMs can be prompted to generate questions that target specific cognitive levels in Bloom's Taxonomy.

### Mechanism 2
StructEval reduces data contamination bias by requiring comprehensive understanding rather than memorization. By creating multiple test instances across different cognitive levels and concepts, a model that has only memorized specific answers cannot perform well across all dimensions. This mechanism assumes models with data contamination can memorize specific answers but cannot demonstrate comprehensive understanding across multiple cognitive levels.

### Mechanism 3
StructEval improves evaluation consistency by reducing reliance on single-item assessments. Instead of determining model capability based on one instance, StructEval evaluates across multiple instances at different cognitive levels and concepts, making the assessment less sensitive to prompt selection, surface form shortcuts, and data distribution. This approach assumes single-item assessments are highly sensitive to various confounders that can affect model performance.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Bloom's Taxonomy cognitive levels**
  - Why needed here: Forms the theoretical foundation for structuring evaluation across different depths of understanding
  - Quick check question: Can you list the six cognitive levels in Bloom's Taxonomy in order from lowest to highest complexity?

- **Concept: Knowledge graph retrieval and concept mapping**
  - Why needed here: Enables expansion of evaluation to test understanding of critical concepts related to the test objective
  - Quick check question: How does knowledge graph-based concept mapping help identify whether a model truly understands a topic versus just memorizing facts?

- **Concept: Data contamination in LLM evaluation**
  - Why needed here: Understanding this challenge motivates the need for StructEval's multi-faceted approach
  - Quick check question: What is data contamination and why does it pose a particular challenge for LLM evaluation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Seed instance → Test objective extraction → Document retrieval → Multi-level instance generation → Instance refinement → Knowledge graph retrieval → Concept-based instance generation → Combined evaluation

- **Critical path**: The core evaluation pipeline that extracts test objectives, generates instances across cognitive levels, retrieves knowledge graph concepts, and combines all instances for comprehensive assessment

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Quality vs. scale: Using GPT-3.5 for generation balances cost and quality, but may limit instance difficulty
  - Breadth vs. depth: Covering all cognitive levels and concepts provides comprehensive assessment but increases complexity
  - Automation vs. control: Automated generation enables large-scale evaluation but requires careful quality control

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Low helpfulness/accuracy rates in human evaluation
  - Large performance divergence between clean and contaminated data
  - Poor rank consistency across different experimental runs
  - Generated instances that are too easy or don't align with test objectives

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Run StructEval on a small subset of MMLU to verify instance generation quality and alignment with Bloom's Taxonomy
  2. Compare model rankings using StructEval vs. original benchmarks on the same set of models
  3. Test data contamination resistance by comparing performance on StructEval vs. original benchmarks when models are trained on contaminated data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper explicitly states that StructEval can be easily adapted to other formats like open-ended QA and multi-turn conversations, though it only implements it for multiple-choice benchmarks. The authors acknowledge that the current use of GPT-3.5 may limit instance difficulty and quality, suggesting future work with more powerful LLMs. The framework uniformly applies all six cognitive levels and multiple concepts without exploring whether fewer levels/concepts might provide sufficient assessment with better efficiency.

## Limitations

- Relies on the assumption that models cannot generalize memorized knowledge to answer questions at different cognitive levels
- Effectiveness depends on the quality of the underlying LLM used for generation (GPT-3.5), which may limit instance difficulty and diversity
- Only validated on multiple-choice benchmarks, with potential adaptation needed for other formats

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The framework's ability to generate structured evaluation instances across multiple cognitive levels (as evidenced by human evaluation showing 95%+ helpfulness and 97%+ correctness)
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about improved rank consistency (33.17% vs 1.24%) and resistance to data contamination, as these depend on specific experimental conditions and model behaviors that may vary
- **Medium Confidence**: The theoretical foundation of using Bloom's Taxonomy for structured assessment, as the paper provides limited empirical validation of whether generated instances truly test the intended cognitive skills

## Next Checks

1. Test StructEval's performance on a larger set of models including state-of-the-art systems (GPT-4, Claude, etc.) to verify if rank consistency improvements hold across the current LLM landscape
2. Conduct a systematic study on how well models can generalize from contaminated data to answer StructEval questions at different cognitive levels, measuring the actual contamination resistance
3. Perform a detailed analysis of the relationship between generated instance difficulty and the cognitive level they target, validating that higher-level cognitive tasks are indeed more challenging for models
