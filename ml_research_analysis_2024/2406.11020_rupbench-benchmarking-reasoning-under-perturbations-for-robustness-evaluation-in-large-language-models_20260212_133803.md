# RUPBench: Benchmarking Reasoning Under Perturbations for Robustness Evaluation in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.11020
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11020
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduced RUPBench benchmark to evaluate LLM robustness across 15 reasoning datasets with 9 perturbation types

## Executive Summary
RUPBench is a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of large language models (LLMs) across diverse reasoning tasks. The benchmark incorporates 15 reasoning datasets spanning commonsense, arithmetic, logical, and knowledge-intensive reasoning, and introduces nine types of textual perturbations at lexical, syntactic, and semantic levels. The study assesses the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-4o, Llama3, Phi-3, and Gemma on both original and perturbed datasets.

The findings reveal that larger models tend to exhibit greater robustness to perturbations, with GPT-4o demonstrating the highest accuracy (83.9%) and the lowest average performance drop rate (10.0%). Common error types identified through manual inspection provide insights into specific challenges faced by LLMs in different reasoning contexts, highlighting areas for improvement to handle diverse and noisy inputs effectively.

## Method Summary
The RUPBench benchmark systematically evaluates LLM robustness by combining 15 diverse reasoning datasets with nine types of textual perturbations across lexical, syntactic, and semantic levels. The methodology involves testing multiple state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-4o, Llama3, Phi-3, and Gemma on both unperturbed and perturbed versions of the datasets. Performance is measured through accuracy scores and average performance drop rates, with additional manual error analysis conducted on a subset of models and perturbation types to identify common failure patterns and challenges specific to different reasoning domains.

## Key Results
- GPT-4o achieved the highest accuracy (83.9%) and lowest average performance drop rate (10.0%) among evaluated models
- Larger models generally demonstrated greater robustness to perturbations compared to smaller models
- Manual error analysis revealed specific challenges in different reasoning contexts, providing insights for model improvement

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of RUPBench stems from its systematic approach to evaluating LLM robustness by combining diverse reasoning tasks with controlled perturbations. By testing models across multiple perturbation types and reasoning domains, the benchmark captures how models handle variations in input structure while maintaining reasoning capabilities. The multi-level perturbation strategy (lexical, syntactic, semantic) provides a comprehensive assessment of model robustness that reflects real-world input variability.

## Foundational Learning

- **Textual Perturbations**: Modifications to input text at different levels (lexical, syntactic, semantic)
  - Why needed: To simulate real-world input variations and test model robustness
  - Quick check: Apply simple perturbations and verify model response changes

- **Reasoning Task Diversity**: Inclusion of commonsense, arithmetic, logical, and knowledge-intensive tasks
  - Why needed: To evaluate model performance across different cognitive domains
  - Quick check: Test model on each reasoning type independently

- **Benchmark Design Methodology**: Systematic selection of datasets and perturbation generation
  - Why needed: To ensure comprehensive and reproducible evaluation
  - Quick check: Verify dataset selection criteria and perturbation generation process

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Dataset Selection -> Perturbation Generation -> Model Testing -> Error Analysis -> Performance Evaluation

Critical path: Perturbation Generation -> Model Testing -> Performance Evaluation

Design tradeoffs: Comprehensive perturbation coverage vs. computational efficiency

Failure signatures: Accuracy drops >15% indicate significant model sensitivity to specific perturbation types

First experiments:
1. Test baseline model performance on unperturbed datasets
2. Apply single perturbation type and measure accuracy impact
3. Compare performance across different model sizes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation covers only nine perturbation types, potentially missing other real-world input variations
- Manual error analysis conducted on a subset of models, introducing potential selection bias
- Benchmark focuses primarily on English-language reasoning tasks, limiting multilingual generalizability

## Confidence
- Benchmark comprehensiveness and design methodology: High
- Relative performance rankings between models: Medium
- Generalizability of robustness findings: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of individual perturbation types on model performance
2. Test the benchmark across additional languages and reasoning domains to assess cross-domain robustness
3. Implement uncertainty quantification metrics alongside accuracy to better understand model behavior under perturbations
