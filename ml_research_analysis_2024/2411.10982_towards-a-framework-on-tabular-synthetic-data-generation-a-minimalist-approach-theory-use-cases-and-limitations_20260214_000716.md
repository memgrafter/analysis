# Towards a framework on tabular synthetic data generation: a minimalist approach: theory, use cases, and limitations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.10982
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10982
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Minimalist SparsePCA+XGBoost framework generates competitive synthetic tabular data with interpretability and computational efficiency

## Executive Summary
This study proposes a minimalist framework for synthetic tabular data generation using SparsePCA encoding and XGBoost decoding. The approach handles nonlinear data through preprocessing (clustering or log transformation) and provides interpretable latent representations. Evaluated on simulated credit scoring data, the method demonstrates competitive performance against autoencoders and VAEs, particularly excelling in interpretability and computational efficiency. The framework shows promise for model robustness testing as an alternative to raw and quantile perturbation methods.

## Method Summary
The framework consists of SparsePCA for dimensionality reduction followed by XGBoost models for nonlinear reconstruction. Data preprocessing includes log transformation for skewed variables and clustering for nonlinearity handling. The SparsePCA encoder projects data onto linear subspaces that maximize variance while maintaining sparse loadings for interpretability. XGBoost decoders are trained separately for each feature to learn the inverse mapping from latent space to original feature space. For synthetic data generation, uniform noise is sampled in latent space and decoded through the trained XGBoost models, with post-processing to enforce data constraints.

## Key Results
- PSI scores indicate stable synthetic data generation across different perturbation strategies
- Model-based approach provides reasonable trade-offs between data fidelity and perturbation control
- Method excels in interpretability and computational efficiency compared to autoencoders and VAEs
- Demonstrates effectiveness for model robustness testing as alternative to raw and quantile perturbations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: SparsePCA encoding reduces dimensionality while preserving interpretability by projecting data onto linear subspaces that maximize variance.
- Mechanism: SparsePCA computes principal components as sparse linear combinations of original features, creating an interpretable latent representation that can be reconstructed by XGBoost.
- Core assumption: The underlying data manifold can be adequately approximated by a linear subspace, and the sparse loadings provide sufficient feature selection.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The model consists of a minimalistic unsupervised SparsePCA encoder"
  - [section] "Principal components optimizes for the directions that maximizes the variance which are essentially the singular vectors"
  - [corpus] Weak - no corpus papers directly discuss SparsePCA for synthetic data generation
- Break condition: If the data manifold is highly nonlinear or requires capturing complex interactions that cannot be represented through linear projections, the SparsePCA encoding will lose critical information.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: XGBoost decoder effectively handles heterogeneous tabular data by learning nonlinear mappings from latent space to original feature space.
- Mechanism: XGBoost trees recursively partition the latent space and learn local approximations for each feature, handling different data types (continuous, binary, categorical) through its built-in splitting criteria.
- Core assumption: XGBoost's ensemble of decision trees can approximate the inverse mapping from compressed latent representation to original data space without requiring explicit density estimation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "XGboost decoder which is SOTA for structured data regression and classification tasks"
  - [section] "The nonlinear recovery for the latent representation uses SOTA tabular data prediction method XGboost"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus lacks direct comparison of XGBoost decoders vs. other methods
- Break condition: If the reconstruction requires modeling complex dependencies between variables that cannot be captured by tree-based partitioning, or if the data contains highly continuous and smooth variations that trees struggle to approximate.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The model-based perturbation strategy in latent space provides a controlled alternative to raw and quantile perturbations for robustness testing.
- Mechanism: Gaussian noise added to PCA latents propagates through the XGBoost decoder, creating synthetic data that maintains realistic data relationships while allowing perturbation magnitude control through the epsilon parameter.
- Core assumption: Perturbations in the linear latent space translate to meaningful and realistic variations in the original feature space when decoded by XGBoost.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The case study result suggests that the method provides an alternative to raw and quantile perturbation for model robustness testing"
  - [section] "we straightforwardly perturb the latents and obtain synthetic data outputs"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus papers focus on different perturbation methods but don't directly compare with this approach
- Break condition: If the latent space dimensionality is insufficient to capture all data variation, noise in certain latent dimensions may create unrealistic synthetic samples after decoding.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Manifold Hypothesis
  - Why needed here: The framework assumes high-dimensional tabular data lies on or near a lower-dimensional manifold that can be learned through dimensionality reduction
  - Quick check question: What happens if the data doesn't satisfy the manifold hypothesis - can you identify scenarios where this approach would fail?

- Concept: Dimension Reduction Tradeoffs
  - Why needed here: Understanding the balance between information loss and computational efficiency in choosing latent dimension size
  - Quick check question: How would you determine the optimal number of principal components to retain for a given dataset?

- Concept: Tree-based vs. Neural Network Models
  - Why needed here: XGBoost is chosen over neural networks for interpretability and handling heterogeneous data types
  - Quick check question: What are the key advantages and disadvantages of using XGBoost versus autoencoders for tabular data reconstruction?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input -> Preprocessing (log transform/clustering) -> SparsePCA encoding -> XGBoost decoding -> Output (synthetic data)

- Critical path:
  1. Data preprocessing and transformation
  2. SparsePCA encoding to obtain latent representation
  3. XGBoost training for each output dimension
  4. Synthetic data generation via sampling or perturbation
  5. Post-processing to enforce data constraints

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Simplicity vs. expressivity: SparsePCA+XGBoost is simpler than VAEs but may miss complex nonlinear relationships
  - Interpretability vs. performance: Linear projections offer interpretability but may lose information
  - Computational efficiency vs. reconstruction quality: Fewer latent dimensions improve efficiency but reduce fidelity

- Failure signatures:
  - High PSI scores between synthetic and real data distributions
  - Unrealistic synthetic samples (e.g., negative values for count variables)
  - Poor model robustness test results compared to baseline methods
  - Large reconstruction error between original and decoded data

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run the framework on a simple 2D synthetic dataset (e.g., half-circle) to verify basic functionality and visualize latent traversals
  2. Compare PSI scores between synthetic and real data on a small tabular dataset to evaluate distribution matching
  3. Test model-based perturbation by adding noise at different epsilon levels and measuring impact on downstream model performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed SparsePCA+XGBoost method compare to flow-based generative models for tabular data generation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions flow-based methods as an alternative for density estimation in the nonlinear case but does not provide direct comparisons.
- Why unresolved: The authors only discuss theoretical advantages of flow-based methods but do not empirically test them against their proposed approach.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments comparing SparsePCA+XGBoost against flow-based models like RealNVP or Glow on tabular datasets would provide empirical evidence.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal latent dimension size for the SparsePCA encoding when handling high-dimensional tabular data?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that increasing PC dimension can lead to performance improvements in high-dimensional data but does not provide specific guidance on optimal sizing.
- Why unresolved: The authors note this as an empirical observation but do not establish a systematic method for determining optimal latent dimensions.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study varying latent dimensions across different dataset sizes and characteristics would identify optimal sizing strategies.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the model-based perturbation strategy compare to quantile perturbation for variables with highly skewed distributions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that for highly skewed variables like "Amount Past Due," the model-based perturbation produces smaller perturbation sizes in the lower quantile regions.
- Why unresolved: The authors observe this behavior but do not quantify the trade-offs or provide guidelines for when each method is preferable.
- What evidence would resolve it: A quantitative comparison of perturbation effectiveness across different distribution types and skewness levels would clarify when each method is optimal.

## Limitations
- Evaluation based on simulated credit scoring data may not capture real-world complexity
- Performance on high-dimensional data with thousands of features remains untested
- Scalability to very large datasets (millions of rows) was not explicitly evaluated

## Confidence
- SparsePCA + XGBoost mechanism: Medium - The approach is well-grounded but lacks direct comparative evidence against alternatives
- Robustness testing application: Medium - Promising results but limited to specific scenarios
- Interpretability claims: High - The linear nature of SparsePCA inherently provides interpretability

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on real-world datasets with varying sizes (from 10K to 1M rows) to evaluate scalability and computational efficiency claims
2. Compare synthetic data quality using multiple metrics beyond PSI (e.g., Wasserstein distance, feature correlation preservation) across diverse tabular datasets
3. Validate the robustness testing capability by conducting controlled experiments measuring downstream model performance degradation when trained on perturbed synthetic data versus raw data
