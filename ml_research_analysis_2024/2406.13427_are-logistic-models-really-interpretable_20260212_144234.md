core_contribution: This work addresses the interpretability of logistic regression
  (LR) models by showing through a user study that skilled participants are unable
  to reliably reproduce the action of small LR models given the trained parameters.
  To remedy this, the authors propose Linearised Additive Models (LAMs), an optimal
  piecewise linear approximation that augments any trained additive model equipped
  with a sigmoid link function, requiring no retraining.

# Are Logistic Models Really Interpretable?
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.13427
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13427
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: LAMs improve interpretability of logistic regression without retraining, with minimal performance loss

## Executive Summary
This paper challenges the conventional wisdom that logistic regression models are inherently interpretable. Through user studies, the authors demonstrate that even skilled participants struggle to understand and reproduce the behavior of small logistic regression models from their parameters alone. To address this, they propose Linearised Additive Models (LAMs), which provide a piecewise linear approximation of trained logistic models, improving interpretability without requiring retraining. The study shows that LAMs significantly outperform standard logistic regression in user comprehension tasks while maintaining competitive performance metrics on financial datasets.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce Linearised Additive Models (LAMs) as a method to improve logistic regression interpretability. LAMs create an optimal piecewise linear approximation of any trained additive model with a sigmoid link function, requiring no retraining of the original model. The approach involves decomposing the logistic function into interpretable linear segments that users can more easily reason about. The method is evaluated through user studies where participants attempt to solve model reasoning tasks using either standard logistic regression parameters or LAMs representations. Performance is also benchmarked on financial modeling datasets using ROC-AUC and calibration metrics.

## Key Results
- User study shows skilled participants solve model reasoning tasks with LAMs much more accurately than with standard logistic regression
- LAMs achieve minimal performance degradation (ROC-AUC and calibration) compared to original logistic models on financial datasets
- LAMs require no retraining of the original model while providing improved interpretability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
LAMs work by decomposing the nonlinear logistic function into a series of linear segments that approximate the model's behavior in different regions of the input space. This piecewise linear representation aligns better with human intuition about how features contribute to predictions, as users can more easily trace through linear relationships than interpret the combined effects of nonlinear transformations. The decomposition preserves the original model's predictions while making the decision boundaries more transparent and traceable.

## Foundational Learning
- Logistic regression fundamentals: Understanding how linear combinations of features are transformed through sigmoid functions is essential for grasping why LAMs improve interpretability
- Why needed: Provides baseline understanding of what LAMs aim to simplify
- Quick check: Can you explain how changing a feature's coefficient affects the final prediction in logistic regression?

- User study methodology in ML interpretability: Knowledge of how to design and evaluate interpretability studies with human participants
- Why needed: Critical for understanding the empirical validation approach
- Quick check: What metrics would you use to measure interpretability in a user study?

- Piecewise linear approximations: Understanding how complex functions can be decomposed into simpler linear segments
- Why needed: Core technical concept behind LAMs
- Quick check: Can you describe how piecewise linear approximation differs from other approximation methods?

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Trained logistic model -> LAM decomposition algorithm -> Piecewise linear segments -> Interpretable model representation
- Critical path: Original model training → LAM generation → User study evaluation → Performance benchmarking
- Design tradeoffs: LAMs sacrifice some mathematical elegance and slight performance for significant gains in human interpretability; no retraining requirement vs. approximation accuracy
- Failure signatures: LAMs may fail when the original logistic model has highly complex, non-smooth decision boundaries that cannot be well-approximated by piecewise linear functions; interpretation may break down in regions with sparse data
- 3 first experiments: 1) Generate LAMs from a simple 2-feature logistic model and visualize the piecewise linear approximation 2) Compare user performance on a toy dataset between LR and LAMs representations 3) Measure approximation error of LAMs against the original logistic model across different complexity levels

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Interpretability findings depend heavily on user study design and participant selection criteria, which are not fully detailed
- Comparison focuses on specific reasoning tasks that may not represent all real-world interpretability needs
- Claims about "no retraining" and "optimal" approximation need more practical validation across diverse datasets and model architectures

## Confidence
- User study interpretability results: Medium - Well-designed study but limited participant details and task scope
- LAMs performance claims: High - Extensive empirical validation across multiple datasets
- No retraining requirement: Medium - Theoretical claim needs more practical validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a replication study with a larger, more diverse participant pool including varying levels of ML expertise to verify the interpretability findings are robust across different user backgrounds
2. Test LAMs performance and interpretability across multiple domains (healthcare, legal, scientific) to assess generalizability beyond financial applications
3. Measure the computational overhead and approximation accuracy of LAMs generation across different model sizes and feature dimensions to quantify practical limitations
