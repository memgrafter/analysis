# Langevin Unlearning: A New Perspective of Noisy Gradient Descent for Machine Unlearning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.10371
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10371
- Reference count: 40
- Langevin unlearning achieves (α,ε)-Renyi unlearning through projected noisy gradient descent with exponentially decaying ε

## Executive Summary
Langevin unlearning introduces a unified framework that combines differential privacy learning with privacy-certified unlearning using projected noisy gradient descent (PNGD). The method enables approximate certified unlearning for non-convex problems while providing complexity savings compared to full retraining. By leveraging the connection between DP learning and unlearning processes, it achieves privacy guarantees through an exponentially decaying ε parameter over unlearning iterations.

## Method Summary
The framework implements Langevin unlearning through a projected noisy gradient descent optimization that iteratively updates model parameters to remove specific data points while maintaining privacy guarantees. The process unifies the differential privacy learning phase with the unlearning phase, allowing the same noise injection mechanism to serve both purposes. The method achieves (α,ε)-Renyi unlearning by fine-tuning parameters on updated datasets, with theoretical guarantees extending to non-convex optimization problems under certain smoothness and gradient bound assumptions.

## Key Results
- Achieves (α,ε)-Renyi unlearning with ε decaying exponentially in unlearning iterations
- Provides complexity savings compared to full retraining while maintaining competitive privacy-utility trade-offs
- Successfully handles sequential and batch unlearning requests for multiple data points
- Demonstrates superior performance on MNIST and CIFAR10 compared to baseline gradient-based approximate unlearning approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the fundamental connection between differential privacy in the learning phase and unlearning in the removal phase. The projected noisy gradient descent injects calibrated noise during parameter updates, which simultaneously provides DP guarantees during training and enables privacy-certified unlearning during removal. The exponential decay of ε ensures that each unlearning iteration provides stronger privacy guarantees while converging toward the updated model parameters that exclude the specified data points.

## Foundational Learning

**Differential Privacy (DP)**: A framework ensuring that individual data points cannot be inferred from model outputs. Why needed: Provides the theoretical foundation for privacy guarantees in both learning and unlearning phases. Quick check: Verify that privacy budget ε decreases appropriately over iterations.

**Renyi Differential Privacy**: A relaxation of DP using Rényi divergence to provide tighter privacy accounting. Why needed: Enables more precise privacy quantification for the unlearning process. Quick check: Confirm that (α,ε)-RDP bounds are correctly computed.

**Non-convex Optimization**: Optimization landscapes with multiple local minima and saddle points. Why needed: Most deep learning problems are non-convex, requiring specialized theoretical treatment. Quick check: Validate that smoothness and gradient bound assumptions hold for target architectures.

**Projected Gradient Descent**: Optimization method that constrains updates to a feasible region. Why needed: Ensures parameter updates remain within valid bounds during unlearning. Quick check: Verify projection operations maintain feasibility after each update.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Dataset -> Model Parameters -> Projected Noisy Gradient Updates -> Updated Parameters -> Privacy Certification

Critical path: Data removal request → Parameter fine-tuning via PNGD → Privacy accounting → Certified model output

Design tradeoffs: The noise parameter σ controls the privacy-utility trade-off, with higher noise providing stronger privacy but potentially degrading model performance. Sequential versus batch processing affects computational efficiency and privacy guarantees.

Failure signatures: Privacy budget exhaustion, model performance degradation beyond acceptable thresholds, convergence failure in non-convex optimization, violation of Lipschitz smoothness assumptions.

First experiments:
1. Verify exponential decay of ε over unlearning iterations on a simple convex problem
2. Test privacy-utility trade-off sensitivity to noise parameter σ on MNIST
3. Compare complexity costs against full retraining for varying batch sizes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

The theoretical guarantees for non-convex problems depend on assumptions about Lipschitz smoothness and gradient bounds that may not universally hold. The exponential decay of ε requires careful hyperparameter tuning of the noise parameter σ, for which the paper lacks systematic guidance. Empirical validation is limited to small-scale image classification tasks, leaving scalability questions for larger models and datasets.

## Confidence

- High confidence: Mathematical framework and optimization procedure are sound for described settings
- Medium confidence: Privacy guarantees hold under stated assumptions but practical applicability may vary
- Medium confidence: Complexity savings versus retraining pending larger-scale validation
- Low confidence: Generalizability to complex architectures beyond simple image classifiers

## Next Checks

1. Test framework scalability on language models or recommendation systems to assess limits
2. Conduct ablation studies on hyperparameter sensitivity, particularly noise parameter σ and ε decay relationship
3. Evaluate behavior when unlearning requests arrive in time-dependent orders that cannot be arbitrarily rearranged
