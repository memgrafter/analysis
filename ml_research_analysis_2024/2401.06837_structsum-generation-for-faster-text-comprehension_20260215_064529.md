- We study generating structured representations like tables and mind maps from text. Current LLMs struggle with producing factually accurate and well-structured outputs. We propose a divide-and-generate approach for tables, where text is first chunked into topical subpassages before generating focused tables. For mind maps, we use an iterative expansion strategy starting from a root concept and expanding branches. To improve quality, we introduce a pipeline with structure-specific prompts followed by critics that assess factuality, local structure, and global structure. This critic-based filtering leads to absolute improvements of +37pp (79%) for mind maps and +15pp (78%) for tables. We also propose Auto-QA to measure semantic coverage by automatically generating QA pairs from input text and checking if structured outputs can answer them. Finally, a user study shows that STRUCT SUMs reduce comprehension time by 42.9% for tables and 31.9% for mind maps without loss in accuracy.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of generating structured representations (tables and mind maps) from text using LLMs, with a focus on improving factuality and structural quality. The authors propose a divide-and-generate approach for tables, where text is first chunked into topically coherent subpassages before generating focused tables, and an iterative expansion strategy for mind maps starting from a root concept. To enhance output quality, they introduce a pipeline of structure-specific prompts followed by critics that assess factuality, local structure, and global structure, leading to significant improvements in accuracy. They also propose Auto-QA to measure semantic coverage by automatically generating QA pairs from input text and checking if structured outputs can answer them. A user study demonstrates that STRUCT SUMs reduce comprehension time by 42.9% for tables and 31.9% for mind maps without loss in accuracy.

## Method Summary
The method involves generating structured representations (tables and mind maps) from text using LLMs, addressing factuality and structural quality issues. For tables, the approach uses text segmentation followed by table generation for each sub-passage. For mind maps, it employs iterative expansion starting from a root concept. A critic pipeline (factuality, local/global structure) is applied to filter outputs, and Auto-QA is used to measure semantic coverage. The method is evaluated on filtered Wikipedia passages using PaLM-2-Unicorn, with prompts and critics defined in Appendix C.

## Key Results
- Absolute improvements of +37pp (79%) for mind maps and +15pp (78%) for tables using critic-based filtering
- STRUCT SUMs reduce comprehension time by 42.9% for tables and 31.9% for mind maps without loss in accuracy
- Auto-QA coverage evaluation shows improved semantic coverage of structured outputs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Divide-and-generate prompting improves table quality by reducing the complexity of each generation task.
- Mechanism: Splitting long text into topically coherent sub-passages allows the model to generate smaller, focused tables with fewer missing cells and better formatting.
- Core assumption: Table generation from short, focused passages is easier for the model than from long, multi-topic passages.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We therefore propose a divide-and-generate prompting approach that first divides the input text into multiple text passages, each representing a sub-topic, followed by an LLM prompt to generate a table-caption pair for each smaller passage."
  - [section] "We use a one-shot prompt for this step, as shown in Appendix C (Figure 14). After the chunking, we prompt the model to generate a table along with its caption for each sub-passage obtained in the previous step."
- Break condition: If sub-passage boundaries are poorly chosen, important information may be split across tables, reducing overall coverage.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Iterative expansion for mind maps ensures better structural correctness by allowing the model to reason radially at each step.
- Mechanism: The model first generates a central root concept, then decides at each iteration whether to expand further, adding branches to current leaf nodes.
- Core assumption: Mind maps require non-linear, branching reasoning that is difficult to capture in a single prompt.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We propose an iterative prompting for mind maps generation. We initialize the mind map by generating the root concept. At each iteration, we decide either to expand the current mind map further or stop the process."
  - [section] "Algorithm 1 shows the overall procedure. Details of each prompt is in Appendix C."
- Break condition: If the model fails to choose a good root concept, the entire mind map structure may be misaligned.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Critic-based filtering significantly improves output quality by targeting factuality and structural issues common to both modalities.
- Mechanism: A pipeline of structure-specific prompts followed by critics that assess factuality, local structure, and global structure is applied to filter low-quality outputs.
- Core assumption: LLMs can be prompted to act as critics and reliably detect errors in structured outputs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We introduce a taxonomy of problems around factuality, global and local structure, common to both modalities and propose a set of critiques to tackle these issues resulting in an absolute improvement in accuracy of +37pp (79%) for mind maps and +15pp (78%) for tables."
  - [section] "To improve the quality of the generated data and to avoid costly human annotations, we propose to use a combination of critics as a measure of data quality."
- Break condition: If critics are too lenient or too strict, they may either fail to filter bad outputs or discard too many good ones.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Prompt engineering for structured outputs
  - Why needed here: Structured outputs like tables and mind maps require precise formatting and reasoning, which standard free-form prompts often fail to capture.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between a single-table and multi-table generation approach, and why does the latter help?

- Concept: Factuality verification in generated text
  - Why needed here: Ensuring that generated tables and mind maps are factually grounded in the input text is critical for user trust and comprehension.
  - Quick check question: How does the post-attribution method verify factuality without causing the model to copy verbatim?

- Concept: Semantic coverage measurement
  - Why needed here: Evaluating how much of the input text is captured in the structured output requires a systematic way to generate and answer questions automatically.
  - Quick check question: How does the Auto-QA method ensure that the generated QA pairs are grounded in the input text?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input text -> Text segmentation (for tables) or root concept generation (for mind maps)
  -> Structured output generation (table or mind map)
  -> Critic pipeline (factuality, local structure, global structure)
  -> Filtered output
  -> Coverage evaluation (Auto-QA)

- Critical path:
  Input text -> Segmentation/Root generation -> Structured output -> Critics -> Filtered output -> Coverage evaluation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Single vs. multiple tables: Multiple tables reduce complexity but may increase redundancy.
  - Factuality vs. abstractiveness: Stricter factuality checks may reduce coverage.
  - Critic cost: Row-level attribution is more accurate but increases LLM calls.

- Failure signatures:
  - Factuality critic fails: Outputs contain hallucinated or unattributed information.
  - Local structure critic fails: Column headers do not match values (e.g., dates in name columns).
  - Global structure critic fails: Mind map ToC is too generic or too specific.
  - Auto-QA coverage low: Structured output misses key information from the input.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Generate tables from a simple passage using single-table vs. multi-table approach; compare cell completeness and formatting.
  2. Generate a mind map from a passage with clear central theme; verify root concept and branch expansion.
  3. Apply critics to a batch of generated outputs; measure improvement in human-rated quality.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

Here are 3 concrete research questions based on the paper:

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would STRUCT SUMs perform on other modalities like images or videos, given recent advances in VLMs?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions exploring other modalities as a limitation
- Why unresolved: The current study is limited to text-to-table and text-to-mind map transformations
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating STRUCT SUM generation and comprehension effectiveness for multimodal inputs using VLMs

### Open Question 2
- Question: Would STRUCT SUMs maintain their effectiveness across different languages or would multilingual adaptations be needed?
- Basis in paper: The paper acknowledges its limitation to English sources
- Why unresolved: The current study only uses English Wikipedia passages
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting STRUCT SUM generation and comprehension studies on multilingual text corpora

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we automatically determine the optimal STRUCT SUM modality (table vs mind map) for a given input text?
- Basis in paper: The paper notes the need for a systematic way to decide which modality is adequate for a given text
- Why unresolved: The current study relies on regex-based filtering for table generation
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and evaluating an automatic modality selection algorithm based on text characteristics

## Limitations

- The divide-and-generate approach for tables relies on effective text segmentation, but the paper does not provide details on the segmentation algorithm's robustness to noisy or ambiguous input text.
- The critic-based filtering assumes LLMs can reliably detect errors in structured outputs, but the quality of these critics is not independently verified beyond the reported improvements.
- The Auto-QA method for coverage evaluation depends on the LLM's ability to generate grounded QA pairs, but the paper does not report error rates for hallucinated or irrelevant questions.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The overall framework (divide-and-generate for tables, iterative expansion for mind maps) is clearly specified and the reported improvements (+15pp for tables, +37pp for mind maps) are substantial and internally consistent.
- **Medium Confidence**: The critic pipeline and Auto-QA coverage evaluation are well-motivated, but the exact prompt templates and critic evaluation metrics are only partially specified in the appendix, requiring careful implementation.
- **Low Confidence**: The user study results are promising but lack detail on methodology and sample characteristics, making it difficult to assess external validity.

## Next Checks

1. **Prompt Template Fidelity**: Reconstruct and test the exact prompt templates (especially the critic prompts) using the provided appendix snippets to ensure faithful reproduction of the reported results.
2. **Segmentation Robustness**: Evaluate the text segmentation algorithm on a diverse set of passages (including noisy or ambiguous text) to assess its impact on table completeness and redundancy.
3. **Critic Accuracy**: Independently verify the accuracy of the factuality and structure critics by manually annotating a sample of generated outputs and comparing against critic scores.
