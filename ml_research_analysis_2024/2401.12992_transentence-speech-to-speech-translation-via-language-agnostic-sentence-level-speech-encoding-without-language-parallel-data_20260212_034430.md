# TranSentence: Speech-to-speech Translation via Language-agnostic Sentence-level Speech Encoding without Language-parallel Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.12992
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12992
- Authors: Seung-Bin Kim; Sang-Hoon Lee; Seong-Whan Lee
- Reference count: 0
- One-line primary result: TranSentence achieves BLEU scores of 18.72 and 18.24 on English-Spanish and Spanish-English translation tasks without language-parallel speech data.

## Executive Summary
TranSentence introduces a speech-to-speech translation system that operates without requiring language-parallel speech data. It leverages a pre-trained language-agnostic sentence-level speech encoder to convert speech into language-independent semantic embeddings, enabling training solely on target language data. During inference, source language speech is encoded into the same embedding space, allowing translation without parallel corpora. The model incorporates a semantic encoder to expand and refine embeddings for better alignment with discrete speech units, which are decoded and converted back to speech using a unit vocoder.

## Method Summary
The model uses a pre-trained language-agnostic sentence-level speech encoder (XLS-R) to generate embeddings that capture semantic information across languages. A semantic encoder refines these embeddings through feature expansion, improving alignment with discrete speech units. A Transformer-based decoder then generates these units autoregressively, which are converted back to speech using a unit vocoder. The system is trained on monolingual target language data and performs inference by encoding source language speech into the shared semantic space and decoding into target language speech units.

## Key Results
- Achieves BLEU scores of 18.72 (En→Es) and 18.24 (Es→En) on CVSS-C dataset without language-parallel speech data
- Outperforms prior textless approaches while matching or exceeding text-based methods in certain language pairs
- Scales to multilingual settings with consistent performance across language pairs
- Enables semantic evaluation of translated speech through embedding similarity metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Language-agnostic sentence-level embeddings enable S2ST without parallel speech data by mapping speech from any language into a shared semantic space. The model encodes source and target language speech into embeddings in the same semantic space using a pre-trained language-agnostic encoder. During training, the decoder learns to generate target speech units from these embeddings. At inference, source speech embeddings are passed to the same decoder, allowing translation without needing parallel speech pairs. Core assumption: Embeddings of semantically equivalent sentences across languages are sufficiently similar in the shared embedding space to allow cross-lingual transfer.

### Mechanism 2
Feature expansion improves decoder attention by transforming fixed-size embeddings into a frame-like sequence with semantic refinement. The single-vector embedding is split into sub-embeddings and passed through a semantic encoder (convolutional layers). This expanded representation aligns better with the decoder's need to generate a sequence of speech units, easing attention computation. Core assumption: Breaking down and refining the embedding provides richer temporal alignment cues for unit prediction.

### Mechanism 3
The semantic encoder's cosine similarity between source and target embeddings provides a semantic quality metric for translated speech. After translation, the cosine similarity between the source and translated speech embeddings indicates how well semantic meaning is preserved. This allows evaluation without relying solely on BLEU scores. Core assumption: Higher cosine similarity correlates with better semantic preservation in the translated output.

## Foundational Learning

- **Language-agnostic sentence embeddings (e.g., LASER, XLS-R)**
  - Why needed: They provide a way to represent speech semantics independent of language, enabling cross-lingual transfer without parallel speech data
  - Quick check: What property must embeddings have to allow translation without parallel data?

- **Discrete speech units (e.g., HuBERT clustering, unit vocoder)**
  - Why needed: They allow the decoder to output speech without requiring continuous spectrogram prediction, making training feasible without text labels
  - Quick check: How do discrete units simplify speech generation compared to spectrogram prediction?

- **Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence models with attention**
  - Why needed: They model the alignment between semantic embeddings and output units, enabling autoregressive generation of speech units from embeddings
  - Quick check: Why is attention critical when generating a sequence from a fixed-size embedding?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Language-agnostic sentence-level speech encoder (XLS-R based) → Semantic encoder (conv layers) → Discrete unit decoder (Transformer) → Unit vocoder (HiFi-GAN based)
- **Critical path**: Encoder → Feature expansion → Decoder → Vocoder
- **Design tradeoffs**: Using pre-trained encoder avoids training from scratch but ties performance to its quality; feature expansion aids attention but adds complexity and potential information loss; discrete units avoid spectrogram prediction but may limit naturalness compared to continuous outputs
- **Failure signatures**: Low BLEU + high embedding similarity → semantic alignment good, but unit prediction poor; Low BLEU + low embedding similarity → encoder failing to produce language-agnostic embeddings; High BLEU + low embedding similarity → BLEU not reflecting true semantic quality
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Train without feature expansion (single vector embedding) to measure its impact; 2) Train with parallel speech data to establish upper bound on BLEU; 3) Compare BLEU vs embedding similarity across different source-target language pairs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: How does the quality of the language-agnostic speech encoder affect the overall performance of TranSentence, and can optimizing the encoder specifically for generative tasks improve results? The paper states that "the dependency of the translation's performance on the pre-trained speech encoder" is a limitation, and suggests that future work should investigate encoders "optimized for generative tasks, rather than for the current mining tasks." This remains unresolved as the paper does not explore or compare the performance of TranSentence with different pre-trained encoders or investigate the impact of encoder optimization on translation quality.

- **Open Question 2**: Can the semantic similarity evaluation method proposed in the paper be further refined to better correlate with human judgments of translation quality? The paper introduces a method for evaluating the semantic similarity of translated and reference speech using the language-agnostic sentence-level speech encoder, but notes that the embeddings "do not yet exactly align with each other." This remains unresolved as the paper does not validate the proposed evaluation method against human judgments or explore ways to improve the correlation between embedding similarity and perceived translation quality.

- **Open Question 3**: How does the performance of TranSentence scale with larger amounts of training data, and what are the practical limits of its data efficiency? The paper demonstrates TranSentence's effectiveness without language-parallel speech data, but does not explore its performance with varying amounts of target language monolingual data. This remains unresolved as the experiments use a fixed amount of training data, and the paper does not investigate how the system's performance changes with more or less data.

## Limitations

- Performance is heavily dependent on the quality of the pre-trained language-agnostic speech encoder
- Requires speech-text pairs for pre-training the language-agnostic encoder, limiting true textless operation
- Feature expansion mechanism adds complexity without clear ablation studies showing its isolated impact
- Evaluation relies on ASR transcription quality for BLEU scoring, introducing potential noise

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core mechanism of using language-agnostic embeddings for cross-lingual transfer is well-supported by the XLS-R pre-training and demonstrated BLEU scores that exceed prior textless approaches
- **Medium confidence**: The feature expansion mechanism improves decoder attention, but the exact contribution is unclear without ablation studies isolating its effect
- **Low confidence**: The semantic similarity metric reliably indicates translation quality, as this evaluation method has not been validated against human judgments in the S2ST literature

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies comparing TranSentence performance with and without feature expansion to isolate its contribution to the overall BLEU score improvements

2. Evaluate translation quality using human judgments of semantic preservation in addition to BLEU scores and embedding similarity to validate the proposed semantic evaluation metric

3. Test the model's robustness to ASR transcription errors by introducing controlled noise in the ASR transcription process and measuring the impact on BLEU scores for translated speech
