# SpeechPrompt: Prompting Speech Language Models for Speech Processing Tasks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2408.13040
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13040
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Proposes prompting speech LMs for speech processing tasks using learnable verbalizers and achieves competitive results vs fine-tuning

## Executive Summary
SpeechPrompt explores prompting speech language models for diverse speech processing tasks including classification, sequence generation, and speech generation. The paper reformulates these tasks as unified speech-to-unit generation problems using textless speech LMs. A key innovation is the learnable verbalizer that maps discrete speech units to task-specific labels, improving explainability and performance. Experiments show competitive results compared to fine-tuning paradigms across multiple speech tasks while maintaining parameter efficiency through prompt tuning.

## Method Summary
The method converts raw speech to discrete units using SSL encoders and quantizers, then prompts speech LMs to generate unit sequences conditioned on task-specific prompts. A learnable verbalizer bridges the gap between discrete units and downstream task labels through a linear transformation matrix. The framework supports both decoder-only (GSLM) and encoder-decoder (Unit mBART) speech LMs. Prompt tuning modifies only input prompt vectors rather than full model parameters, enabling efficient adaptation. The unified speech-to-unit generation formulation allows handling diverse speech tasks within a single framework.

## Key Results
- Achieves competitive performance vs fine-tuning on speech command recognition, intent classification, and speech translation
- Demonstrates strong few-shot learning capabilities with learnable verbalizers
- Shows encoder-decoder models (Unit mBART) outperform decoder-only models (GSLM) for multimodal speech tasks
- Maintains parameter efficiency through prompt tuning while achieving comparable accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The learnable verbalizer enables effective mapping from discrete speech units to task-specific labels by learning weighted embeddings.
- Mechanism: A linear transformation matrix W transforms logits from the speech LM into logits over the task's label space, creating label-specific embeddings by weighting original vocabulary embeddings.
- Core assumption: Discrete speech units contain information correlating with downstream task labels that can be learned through the verbalizer.
- Break condition: If discrete units lack relevant information or correlations are too complex for simple linear transformation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Reformulating speech processing tasks as speech-to-unit generation tasks enables unified prompting across diverse speech tasks.
- Mechanism: All tasks (classification, sequence generation, speech generation) are cast as generating discrete unit sequences conditioned on input speech and task-specific prompts.
- Core assumption: Generative capabilities of speech LMs can be directed by prompts to handle different output types.
- Break condition: If speech LM cannot generate appropriate unit sequences or prompt design fails to guide generation.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Prompt tuning with continuous vectors achieves competitive performance while maintaining parameter efficiency.
- Mechanism: Only prompt vectors (prepended to inputs or attention modules) are trained while LM parameters remain frozen.
- Core assumption: Speech LMs have learned general representations adaptable to specific tasks through input conditioning rather than parameter updates.
- Break condition: If frozen LM lacks task-relevant knowledge or prompt vectors cannot sufficiently adapt the model.

## Foundational Learning

- **Discrete speech unit representation**: Why needed: Framework relies on converting continuous speech to discrete units for language model processing. Quick check: What is the typical size range for discrete speech unit vocabularies used in textless speech LMs?

- **Autoregressive language modeling**: Why needed: Speech LMs generate output sequences token-by-token, essential for speech-to-unit generation formulation. Quick check: How does autoregressive nature affect order of unit generation for different task types?

- **Prompt engineering principles**: Why needed: Task-specific prompts guide speech LM to perform different speech processing tasks without modifying model parameters. Quick check: What are the two main types of prompt tuning mentioned, and where are prompts inserted?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input speech → SSL encoder → Quantizer → Discrete units → Speech LM (with prompts) → Unit sequence → Verbalizer/Speech decoder → Task output
- **Critical path**: Path from discrete units through speech LM to verbalizer/speech decoder determines task performance
- **Design tradeoffs**: Learnable verbalizer adds parameters but improves performance; fixed verbalizers are parameter-efficient but may underperform
- **Failure signatures**: Poor performance across tasks suggests unit representation quality or prompt design issues; task-specific failures may indicate verbalizer learning problems
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Implement speech-to-unit generation pipeline with fixed verbalizer on simple speech classification task
  2. Add learnable verbalizer and compare performance on same task
  3. Test prompt tuning effectiveness by comparing frozen LM with prompt tuning vs full fine-tuning on small dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different speech LM architectures (decoder-only vs. encoder-decoder) impact prompting effectiveness for speech processing tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper compares GSLM and Unit mBART, observing encoder-decoder models perform better for speech processing tasks
- Why unresolved: Paper suggests encoder-decoder models may be better suited but doesn't explain why or explore other architectures
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive study comparing various speech LM architectures on wide range of speech processing tasks

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are limitations of current speech LMs in capturing speaker and emotion information, and how can these be addressed?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper acknowledges speech LMs don't fully capture speaker and emotion information, posing challenges beyond content-related aspects
- Why unresolved: Paper doesn't explore specific reasons for struggles or propose concrete solutions
- What evidence would resolve it: Research identifying specific speech features conveying speaker/emotion information and methods to incorporate these into speech LMs

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can prompting framework be extended to achieve true 0-shot inference in speech processing?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper mentions achieving true 0-shot inference remains challenging but compelling goal, suggesting instruction-tuned speech LMs as promising avenue
- Why unresolved: Paper doesn't provide concrete solution or explore challenges and limitations of existing approaches
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful implementation and evaluation of framework performing speech processing tasks without any training examples

## Limitations

- Verbalizer effectiveness uncertain in few-shot settings where training data is limited
- Unified framework may not work equally well for all speech tasks (GSLM struggles with sequence generation)
- Evaluation lacks ablation studies on prompt design choices to determine which components contribute most to performance gains

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims:**
- Prompting speech LMs is computationally more efficient than fine-tuning
- Speech-to-unit generation reformulation is technically feasible
- Discrete speech units can be generated by existing speech LMs

**Medium Confidence Claims:**
- Learnable verbalizers improve performance over fixed verbalizers
- Prompt tuning achieves competitive performance with fine-tuning on speech tasks
- Framework generalizes across different speech processing tasks

**Low Confidence Claims:**
- Unified framework works equally well for all speech tasks
- Method's explainability advantages are substantial and consistent
- Few-shot learning performance will scale to more complex tasks

## Next Checks

1. **Verbalizer Ablation Study**: Test learnable verbalizer across different discrete unit vocabulary sizes (50, 100, 200 units) and compare with fixed verbalizers to quantify verbalizer contribution.

2. **Prompt Design Analysis**: Systematically vary prompt length, insertion positions, and initialization strategies across multiple tasks to determine which prompt design choices have largest impact on performance.

3. **Generalization Stress Test**: Evaluate framework on held-out speech task (e.g., emotion recognition or speaker identification) not used in original experiments to test whether unified speech-to-unit generation approach truly generalizes beyond studied tasks.
