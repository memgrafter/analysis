# Exploring Multi-Modal Data with Tool-Augmented LLM Agents for Precise Causal Discovery

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2412.13667
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13667
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: MATMCD reduces causal discovery errors (NHD) by up to 66.7% and improves root cause locating (MAP@10) by up to 83.3% over baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MATMCD, a tool-augmented LLM agent system for causal discovery using multi-modal data. The approach integrates observational data with semantics-rich external data (web documents and logs) through a two-agent framework. The Data Augmentation Agent retrieves and summarizes relevant information, while the Causal Constraint Agent combines this data with prior causal graphs to infer causal relationships. Experimental results on seven datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in causal discovery accuracy compared to baseline methods.

## Method Summary
MATMCD employs a two-agent framework to enhance causal discovery. The Data Augmentation Agent queries external sources like web documents and logs to retrieve relevant information, then summarizes this data to create a comprehensive context. The Causal Constraint Agent then uses this augmented information alongside prior causal graphs to identify and refine causal relationships. This tool-augmented approach allows the system to leverage both structured observational data and unstructured external knowledge sources for more precise causal inference.

## Key Results
- Reduces causal discovery errors (NHD) by up to 66.7% compared to best baselines
- Improves root cause locating (MAP@10) by up to 83.3% over baselines
- Demonstrates significant potential of multi-modal data integration for causal discovery

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system works by combining the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with external knowledge retrieval. By augmenting observational data with relevant external information, MATMCD can identify causal relationships that might be missed when relying solely on the available observational data. The two-agent architecture allows for specialized handling of data retrieval and causal inference tasks, with the agents working in tandem to progressively refine causal understanding.

## Foundational Learning
- **Causal Discovery**: Finding causal relationships from data; needed to identify cause-effect relationships in complex systems; quick check: understanding DAG structures
- **Multi-modal Data Integration**: Combining different data types (observational, textual, log data); needed to enrich causal discovery with external context; quick check: ability to process heterogeneous data sources
- **LLM Tool Augmentation**: Enhancing LLM capabilities with external tools; needed to access and process information beyond model training data; quick check: understanding tool-calling mechanisms
- **Causal Constraints**: Using prior knowledge to guide causal discovery; needed to incorporate domain expertise; quick check: familiarity with constraint-based causal discovery methods
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Identifying underlying causes of observed effects; needed for practical applications in troubleshooting; quick check: understanding of precision metrics like MAP@10

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: External Data Sources -> Data Augmentation Agent -> Summarized Context -> Causal Constraint Agent -> Causal Discovery Output

**Critical Path**: The core workflow follows a sequential path: retrieve external data → summarize context → apply causal constraints → output refined causal graph

**Design Tradeoffs**: The system trades computational overhead (querying external sources, agent orchestration) for improved accuracy through multi-modal data integration. This approach assumes availability of relevant external data sources.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation when external data sources are irrelevant, when prior causal knowledge is inaccurate, or when causal relationships are highly complex/non-linear beyond the tested scenarios.

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Test MATMCD with varying levels of initial causal knowledge (fully specified to unknown structures)
2. Introduce controlled noise in retrieved external information to measure robustness
3. Compare against traditional causal discovery algorithms (PC, FCI) on identical datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Relies on predefined causal graphs as starting points, limiting generalizability
- Performance on highly complex causal structures remains uncertain
- Potential biases from external data sources not thoroughly addressed

## Confidence

**High confidence**: System architecture and methodology are well-defined with substantial improvements over baselines

**Medium confidence**: Effectiveness of multi-modal data integration for causal discovery, based on limited dataset diversity

**Low confidence**: Robustness in real-world scenarios with incomplete or noisy prior causal knowledge

## Next Checks
1. Test MATMCD on synthetic datasets with varying levels of initial causal knowledge (from fully specified to completely unknown structures) to assess performance boundaries.

2. Evaluate the system's sensitivity to the quality of external data sources by introducing controlled noise or bias in the retrieved information and measuring the impact on causal discovery accuracy.

3. Compare MATMCD against traditional causal discovery methods (e.g., PC, FCI algorithms) on the same datasets to establish relative performance and identify specific scenarios where it excels or underperforms.
