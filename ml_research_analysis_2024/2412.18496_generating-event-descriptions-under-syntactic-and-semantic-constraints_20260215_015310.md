# Generating event descriptions under syntactic and semantic constraints

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.18496
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18496
- Reference count: 15
- All methods reliably produce natural, typical, and distinctive event descriptions, but manual generation continues to outperform automated methods.

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates methods for generating event descriptions under syntactic and semantic constraints to support scalable lexical semantic annotation. The authors compare manual generation by experts, sampling from a corpus annotated with syntactic and semantic information, and sampling from a language model (LM) conditioned on these constraints. The generated event descriptions are assessed along three dimensions: naturalness, typicality, and distinctiveness. While all methods produce acceptable results, manual generation continues to outperform automated methods, though the automated methods are deemed sufficient for downstream annotation and analysis tasks.

## Method Summary
The study compares three methods for generating event descriptions: manual generation by experts, sampling from a corpus annotated with syntactic and semantic information, and sampling from a language model (LM) conditioned on syntactic and semantic constraints. The LM approach uses prompting with sense glosses and constrained sampling with a probabilistic context-free grammar to enforce syntactic constraints. The evaluation uses 96 verbs from PropBank and VerbNet, with sentences generated for each verb under specific syntactic constraints (e.g., NP V NP). The quality of generated sentences is assessed through crowdworker judgments on naturalness, typicality, and distinctiveness.

## Key Results
- All three methods (manual, corpus-based, and LM-based) reliably produce natural, typical, and distinctive event descriptions
- Manual generation outperforms automated methods in all three quality dimensions
- LM-based generation with prompting and constrained sampling outperforms corpus-based sampling
- Conditioning on manually-created sense glosses produces more distinctive sentences than using LM-generated sense glosses

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Prompting an LM with sense glosses and syntactic constraints produces more natural, typical, and distinctive sentences than sampling from a corpus.
- Mechanism: The LM compresses distributional patterns from the training corpus, enabling it to interpolate and generalize beyond exact matches. Prompting provides semantic guidance while constrained sampling enforces syntax, yielding sentences that satisfy both constraints without requiring exact matches in the corpus.
- Core assumption: The LM's training data contains sufficient examples of the target verb senses and syntactic patterns to enable meaningful generalization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "sampling from a language model (LM) conditioned on syntactic and semantic information" produces "natural, typical, and distinctive event descriptions"
  - [section 2.3.1] "prompting a language model with a gloss of a verb's sense actually produce good examples of that verb in that sense?"
  - [corpus] Weak - the corpus evidence only shows related work on controllable generation, not direct evidence for this specific claim
- Break condition: The LM's training data lacks sufficient coverage of the target verb senses or syntactic patterns, or the prompting approach fails to properly encode the semantic constraints.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Conditioning LM generation on manually-created sense glosses produces more distinctive sentences than conditioning on LM-generated sense glosses.
- Mechanism: Manually-created sense glosses are more precise and aligned with established lexical resources (PropBank), providing clearer semantic constraints that lead to more targeted sentence generation.
- Core assumption: Manually-created sense glosses are more semantically precise than LM-generated ones, even when the LM attempts to align with PropBank.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.3.3] "conditioning on manually generated sense glosses when generating from an LM yields a more distinctive set of sentences than conditioning on LM-generated sense glosses"
  - [section 3.4.2] The paper describes a two-stage process to generate LM glosses, attempting to align with PropBank but finding the LM tends to offer multiple senses for all verbs
  - [corpus] Weak - the corpus evidence only shows related work on sense disambiguation, not direct evidence for this specific claim
- Break condition: The LM's sense generation capabilities improve to match or exceed the precision of manually-created glosses, or the manually-created glosses contain errors or inconsistencies.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The combination of prompting and constrained sampling enables generation of sentences that satisfy both semantic and syntactic constraints without requiring exact matches in the corpus.
- Mechanism: Prompting provides semantic guidance by specifying the desired verb sense, while constrained sampling enforces syntactic constraints through a probabilistic context-free grammar, allowing the LM to generate novel sentences that satisfy both types of constraints.
- Core assumption: The LM's probability distribution can be effectively combined with the constrained distribution to generate valid sentences under both semantic and syntactic constraints.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.3.3] "enforcing such constraints is where the constrained sampling approach shines" and describes combining prompting with constrained sampling
  - [section 3.4] The paper implements this combination to generate sentences under the constraints in (15)
  - [corpus] Weak - the corpus evidence only shows related work on constrained generation, not direct evidence for this specific claim
- Break condition: The combination of prompting and constrained sampling fails to produce valid sentences under the specified constraints, or the resulting sentences are of poor quality.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) and their use in constrained sampling
  - Why needed here: The paper uses a PCFG to enforce syntactic constraints on LM-generated sentences
  - Quick check question: How does a PCFG differ from a regular context-free grammar, and why is this distinction important for constrained sampling?

- Concept: Language model prompting and conditioning
  - Why needed here: The paper uses prompting to provide semantic guidance to the LM and conditioning to enforce syntactic constraints
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between prompting and conditioning in the context of language model generation, and how do they complement each other?

- Concept: Lexical semantic annotation and its challenges
  - Why needed here: The paper aims to support scalable lexical semantic annotation through automated sentence generation
  - Quick check question: What are the main challenges in lexical semantic annotation, and how does automated sentence generation aim to address these challenges?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Manual generation (experts) -> Corpus sampling with post-editing -> LM generation (prompting + constrained sampling)
- Critical path: (1) obtain verb and sense information, (2) generate or obtain sense glosses, (3) construct prompt with sense glosses, (4) sample from LM conditioned on prompt and PCFG constraints, (5) rank and select highest quality sentences
- Design tradeoffs: The system trades off between quality (manual generation) and efficiency (automated methods). Within automated methods, there's a tradeoff between the precision of manually-created sense glosses and the efficiency of LM-generated glosses.
- Failure signatures: Common failure modes include: (1) LM generates sentences that violate syntactic constraints, (2) LM-generated sense glosses are imprecise or misaligned with established resources, (3) corpus-based sampling fails to find sufficient examples of rare verb senses, (4) post-editing of corpus sentences introduces unnaturalness.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a basic version of LM-based sentence generation with manual sense glosses and simple syntactic constraints, and evaluate its naturalness, typicality, and distinctiveness compared to manual generation.
  2. Extend the LM-based generation to handle more complex syntactic constraints and compare its performance to the basic version.
  3. Implement LM-generated sense glosses and compare their performance to manual sense glosses in terms of sentence quality and distinctiveness.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How well do the automated methods generalize to more complex syntactic constraints beyond simple transitive clauses?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note they used relatively strict constraints resulting in simple syntactic contexts and raise this as a question for future research.
  - Why unresolved: The paper only tested methods on simple transitive clauses (NP V NP), not on more complex syntactic structures.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying the same automated methods to generate sentences with more complex syntactic constraints (e.g., ditransitives, embedded clauses, various argument structures).

- Question: How well do the automated methods generalize to more complex semantic or pragmatic constraints, such as generating multisentence contexts?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly raise this as a question for future research, wondering how far prompting and constrained decoding can take us for more complex semantic/pragmatic constraints.
  - Why unresolved: The paper only tested methods on single-sentence generation with semantic constraints about verb senses and noun selection.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experiments using the automated methods to generate longer texts or discourse contexts with semantic/pragmatic constraints.

- Question: Can efficient post-editing techniques improve the quality of automatically generated linguistic expressions to match manually generated ones while reducing overall human effort?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest this as a potential future research direction, asking if post-editing could bring automated outputs to manual quality with less effort than full manual generation.
  - Why unresolved: The paper only evaluated fully automated generation without any human post-editing or refinement.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the quality and effort of post-editing automated outputs versus fully manual generation.

## Limitations

- The study focuses on a limited set of 96 verbs from specific lexical resources, which may limit generalizability to other domains or languages
- The evaluation relies on crowdworker judgments which may not fully capture expert annotation needs
- The constrained sampling approach depends on the quality of underlying syntactic and semantic annotations
- The methods were only tested on simple syntactic structures (transitive clauses)

## Confidence

- High: Relative performance comparisons between manual, corpus-based, and LM-based methods
- High: The finding that LM-based generation outperforms corpus-based sampling
- High: The finding that manual sense glosses yield more distinctive sentences than LM-generated glosses
- Medium: Absolute quality assessments of generated sentences, given the judgment-based evaluation approach

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate generated sentences with domain experts rather than crowdworkers to assess their suitability for professional annotation tasks
2. Test the approach on verbs outside the initial selection criteria (those not sharing Levin classes or with different polysemy levels)
3. Compare against additional automated generation baselines including newer model architectures like GPT-4 or Claude
