# An Early-Stage Workflow Proposal for the Generation of Safe and Dependable AI Classifiers

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.01850
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01850
- Reference count: 8
- Authors propose a workflow for generating safe and dependable AI classifiers using single protected channel pattern

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an early-stage workflow proposal for generating safe and dependable AI classifiers, specifically addressing the challenge of qualifying deep neural networks for functional safety applications. The authors identify a critical gap in current functional safety methodologies, which require well-understood and justifiable parameters that are difficult to achieve with traditional neural network architectures. Their approach leverages the single protected channel pattern (SPCP) to validate CNN outputs, focusing dependability on a validator rather than the CNN itself, thereby avoiding the need to qualify the complex CNN components.

## Method Summary
The proposed workflow centers on using ONNX format as a neutral, extendable model representation that can be trained with tools like PyTorch or TensorFlow without requiring their qualification. The approach includes tools for architecture validation and model partitioning to separate reliable and non-reliable components. The authors plan to implement prototypes of these tools in Scheme for code inspection and provability, with the ultimate goal of suggesting reliability and traceability enhancements to the ONNX standard.

## Key Results
- Proposes SPCP-based validation approach to avoid qualifying complex CNN components
- Leverages ONNX format as neutral model representation for safety-critical applications
- Plans to implement Scheme-based tools for architecture validation and model partitioning
- Identifies gap in functional safety methodologies for AI systems
- Represents novel contribution to emerging field of safe-AI

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by shifting the dependability focus from the neural network itself to a validator component using the single protected channel pattern. This pattern allows the complex CNN to operate while a separate validation mechanism ensures output safety. By using ONNX as an intermediate representation, the workflow can leverage existing training tools without requiring their qualification, while maintaining the ability to inspect and validate the model architecture and parameters.

## Foundational Learning
- **Functional Safety Requirements**: Safety-critical systems require well-understood, justifiable parameters; needed because neural networks lack traditional verifiability; quick check: verify system meets ISO 26262 or similar standards
- **Single Protected Channel Pattern (SPCP)**: Validation mechanism that focuses dependability on validator rather than the main component; needed to avoid qualifying complex neural networks; quick check: validate SPCP implementation against known safety benchmarks
- **ONNX Format**: Open neural network exchange format serving as neutral representation; needed to avoid tool qualification requirements; quick check: verify ONNX model compatibility across different frameworks
- **Model Partitioning**: Separation of reliable and non-reliable components; needed to isolate safety-critical functionality; quick check: measure partitioning accuracy and overhead
- **Scheme-based Code Inspection**: Use of functional programming language for validation tools; needed for provability and traceability; quick check: implement basic prototype and measure verification capabilities

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Training Tools (PyTorch/TensorFlow) -> ONNX Model -> Architecture Validator -> Model Partitioner -> SPCP Validator -> Safety-Critical System

**Critical Path**: Model training → ONNX conversion → Architecture validation → Model partitioning → SPCP validation → System deployment

**Design Tradeoffs**: Uses ONNX for tool independence but adds conversion overhead; implements Scheme for provability but may limit tool availability; focuses on validator rather than CNN qualification but adds computational overhead

**Failure Signatures**: Incorrect model partitioning leading to unreliable components in safety-critical path; SPCP validator failure resulting in undetected unsafe outputs; ONNX conversion errors causing model integrity issues

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Implement basic ONNX model conversion and validation pipeline
2. Test SPCP validator with simple CNN on benchmark dataset
3. Measure overhead and accuracy impact of model partitioning approach

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- No empirical validation or prototype implementations provided
- Theoretical assumptions about SPCP effectiveness remain untested
- Claims about Scheme-based tools and ONNX reliability enhancements unverified
- Practical viability demonstrated through case studies or benchmarks

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Identification of functional safety gap for AI systems | High |
| Relevance of single protected channel pattern | High |
| Theoretical framework for architecture validation | Medium |
| Scheme-based code inspection tool effectiveness | Low |
| ONNX reliability enhancement proposals | Low |

## Next Checks

1. Implement a proof-of-concept validator using the single protected channel pattern on a real-world CNN application (e.g., automotive image recognition) and measure validation accuracy and computational overhead

2. Conduct a case study comparing traditional functional safety certification processes with the proposed workflow using a concrete example system

3. Develop and test the architecture validation tools on multiple neural network architectures to verify the partitioning methodology and identify potential failure modes
