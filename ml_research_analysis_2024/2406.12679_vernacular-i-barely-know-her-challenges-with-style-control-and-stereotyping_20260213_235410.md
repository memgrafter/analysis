# Vernacular? I Barely Know Her: Challenges with Style Control and Stereotyping

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.12679
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12679
- Reference count: 13
- Five state-of-the-art LLMs struggled with consistent grade-level text generation and produced stereotypical AAVE despite in-context learning improvements

## Executive Summary
This study evaluated five leading LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, Llama-3, Mistral-instruct-7B) for style control in educational and cultural contexts. Models were tested on grade-specific reading level generation and African American Vernacular English (AAVE) generation using both prompt-only and in-context learning setups. Results showed significant challenges: models failed to consistently generate first-grade-level text, with high variability across models, and despite improved lexical dialect control through in-context learning, they still produced stereotypical language. The findings demonstrate that instruction tuning alone cannot overcome inherent biases in LLM outputs, highlighting the need for better training data, bias mitigation strategies, and safeguards for culturally sensitive applications.

## Method Summary
The study tested five LLMs using prompt-only and in-context learning (ICL) approaches on two style control tasks: reading level generation and AAVE dialect generation. Reading level was measured using Flesch-Kincaid scores, while dialect usage was quantified using a lexicon-based approach with demographic word associations. ICL examples included K5 Learning first-grade texts for reading level and YouTube transcripts for AAVE. The methodology systematically varied prompt conditions to assess model performance and bias persistence across different instruction paradigms.

## Key Results
- LLMs showed inconsistent performance in generating first-grade reading level text, with Llama-3 exhibiting high variability (mean: 19.57, std: 27.6)
- GPT-4/4o achieved better consistency in reading level generation (mean: 4.14–4.22) compared to other models
- In-context learning significantly improved AAVE dialect usage (p=0.007) but did not eliminate stereotypical language generation
- Mistral-instruct-7B demonstrated competitive performance despite smaller size, showing instruction tuning can compensate for parameter limitations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: In-context learning improves lexical dialect control but not conceptual cultural sensitivity
- Mechanism: ICL examples provide surface-level lexical cues (words, phrases) that models incorporate into output, shifting measurable dialect scores upward while leaving deeper semantic biases intact
- Core assumption: Models separate lexical pattern matching from semantic understanding of cultural concepts
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "in-context learning improved dialect usage (p=0.007), but models still produced stereotypical language"
  - [section] "ICL can significantly improve the amount of usage of AAE/AA VE(p < 0.05)" but "internal stereotypes and biases persist regardless of ICL"
  - [corpus] Weak - related work on dialect discrimination exists but no direct mechanism evidence
- Break condition: When reference texts contain no stereotypical content yet outputs still contain stereotypes, proving lexical improvement doesn't equal conceptual understanding

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Instruction-tuned models perform better than parameter-size increases for style control tasks
- Mechanism: Fine-tuning on instruction-following data creates better alignment between user prompts and model behavior than scaling parameters alone
- Core assumption: Instruction tuning encodes task-specific behavioral patterns that parameter scaling cannot replicate
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Mistral-7B... shows competitive performance with only one test case failing" despite fewer parameters than Llama-3
  - [section] "Mistral Instruct 7B... outperforms both GPT-3.5 and Llama-3, demonstrating that proper instruction tuning can compensate for a smaller parameter size"
  - [corpus] Weak - general knowledge about instruction tuning benefits but no specific style control mechanism
- Break condition: When larger untuned models outperform smaller tuned ones on style control, contradicting the compensation hypothesis

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: LLM opinions are malleable based on ICL references while biases remain fixed
- Mechanism: Models adapt surface-level stance and tone to match reference examples but underlying prejudiced associations persist from pretraining
- Core assumption: Opinion representation is separate from bias representation in model weights
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "LLMs often generated culturally insensitive content during their tasks" even with unbiased ICL
  - [section] "Opinions sway, biases don't" and "Some internal stereotypes and biases persist regardless of ICL"
  - [corpus] Weak - related work on LLM opinion malleability exists but no mechanism for bias persistence
- Break condition: When opinion changes in ICL don't correlate with stereotype presence, proving separate mechanisms

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Flesch-Kincaid reading level calculation
  - Why needed here: Primary metric for measuring text simplification success across grade levels
  - Quick check question: How does the FK formula weight syllables vs sentence length in grade level prediction?

- Concept: Lexicon-based dialect scoring using demographic word associations
  - Why needed here: Core metric for measuring African American Vernacular English generation quality
  - Quick check question: What demographic data sources are used to create the word-level AAE probability scores?

- Concept: In-context learning mechanics and few-shot prompting
  - Why needed here: Experimental method for testing whether examples can guide style control
  - Quick check question: How does the number of ICL examples affect the magnitude of style control improvements?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Prompt processor → Language model core → Scoring engine → Result aggregator
- Critical path: Generate text → Calculate reading level → Calculate dialect score → Statistical analysis
  - Primary bottleneck: Scoring consistency across different text generation outputs
  - Secondary bottleneck: Managing model-specific quirks (refusals, high variance)
- Design tradeoffs: Few-shot learning vs fine-tuning for style control
  - Few-shot: Faster to implement, lower data requirements, less model customization
  - Fine-tuning: Better performance potential, requires more resources, permanent changes
- Failure signatures:
  - High variance in outputs (Llama-3 behavior)
  - Model refusals (Mistral on specific prompts)
  - Persistent stereotypes despite unbiased references
  - Inconsistent instruction following across models
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run prompt-only generation for all five models on "Sun" question, measure FK scores
  2. Apply one-shot ICL with positive dialect reference, measure AAE score changes
  3. Apply two-shot ICL with mixed references, measure opinion sway vs stereotype persistence

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can fine-tuning or meta-training improve LLM performance in style control tasks compared to in-context learning alone?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that their study relies on few-shot learning techniques and suggest that future research could incorporate fine-tuning or meta-training to explore ways to mitigate stereotypes.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on evaluating in-context learning (ICL) performance and does not experiment with fine-tuning or meta-training approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing fine-tuned or meta-trained models against ICL baselines on the same style control tasks (reading level and dialect generation) would demonstrate if these approaches yield better performance and reduced stereotyping.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do different dialect varieties beyond African American Vernacular English (AAVE) affect LLM style control capabilities?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors limit their dialect analysis to AAVE and acknowledge that there are various dialects of English, but do not explore other dialect varieties.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses specifically on AAVE, leaving open the question of how LLMs handle other English dialects or non-English languages.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating the same LLMs on style control tasks for other English dialects (e.g., Southern American English, Chicano English) or other languages would reveal whether performance patterns generalize across different linguistic varieties.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What specific training data modifications could effectively reduce stereotypical language generation in LLMs while maintaining style control capabilities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors conclude that instruction tuning alone is insufficient for culturally sensitive outputs and suggest that additional de-biasing methods are essential.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies the problem of persistent stereotypes, it does not propose specific training data interventions or test their effectiveness.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing different de-biasing techniques (e.g., balanced dialect representation, stereotype mitigation in training corpora, adversarial debiasing) while evaluating style control performance would identify effective approaches.

## Limitations

- Evaluation focused on only five commercial and open models, potentially missing performance variations in other architectures
- Lexicon-based dialect scoring may not capture full complexity of AAVE linguistic features and could introduce measurement artifacts
- ICL methodology used static reference examples without exploring full space of prompt engineering techniques
- Stereotype detection relied on qualitative assessment rather than systematic bias measurement frameworks

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Instruction tuning compensating for parameter size in style control tasks; statistical significance of ICL improvements for dialect usage (p=0.007)

**Medium Confidence**: LLMs retaining biases despite improved lexical control; variability findings for Llama-3 (std: 27.6)

**Low Confidence**: Separation of lexical pattern matching from semantic understanding of cultural concepts as distinct mechanisms

## Next Checks

1. Apply established bias measurement frameworks (e.g., StereoSet, CrowS-Pairs) to quantify stereotype persistence beyond qualitative assessment, testing whether lexical improvements truly don't correlate with conceptual understanding

2. Systematically vary ICL example quantity, diversity, and formatting to determine optimal conditions for style control, including testing chain-of-thought prompting and iterative refinement approaches

3. Test whether observed style control limitations extend to other languages and dialects, examining if instruction-tuned smaller models maintain their advantage across different linguistic contexts
