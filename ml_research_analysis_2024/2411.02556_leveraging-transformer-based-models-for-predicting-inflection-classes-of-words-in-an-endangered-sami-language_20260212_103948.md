# Leveraging Transformer-Based Models for Predicting Inflection Classes of Words in an Endangered Sami Language

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.02556
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02556
- Reference count: 3
- One-line primary result: Transformer model achieves 1.00 F1 for POS classification and 0.81 F1 for Contlex classification on Skolt Sami

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of predicting inflection classes for Skolt Sami, an endangered Uralic language with complex morphology and limited data. The authors propose a transformer-based model that leverages data augmentation via miniparadigms and multi-task learning to classify parts of speech (POS) and continuation lexica (Contlex). By extracting 28,984 lexemes from the Ve′rdd dictionary and augmenting them with morphological forms generated using the Skolt Sami FST, the model learns to generalize across sparse data. Results show an average weighted F1 score of 1.00 for POS classification and 0.81 for Contlex classification, with accuracy improving significantly as more word forms are provided.

## Method Summary
The method extracts 28,984 lexemes from the Ve′rdd dictionary and augments them with morphological forms generated using the Skolt Sami FST. The model uses a transformer architecture with shared embedding layers and task-specific output heads, trained with data augmentation via miniparadigms and multi-task learning. Byte-Pair Encoding tokenization handles morphological complexity, while AdamW optimizer with Cosine Annealing LR scheduler trains the model for 100 epochs.

## Key Results
- Average weighted F1 score of 1.00 for POS classification
- Average weighted F1 score of 0.81 for Contlex classification
- Performance improves significantly as more word forms are provided
- Multi-task learning architecture successfully predicts both POS and Contlex labels

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multi-task learning with shared transformer layers improves both POS and Contlex classification by leveraging shared morphological features.
- Mechanism: The model uses a shared embedding layer and transformer encoder to learn generalized linguistic representations, then splits into task-specific output heads. This allows joint training to capture dependencies between POS and inflection class labels while optimizing separately for each task.
- Core assumption: Skolt Sami's morphology contains shared patterns between POS and inflection classes that can be jointly learned without task interference.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The input tokens, which were first processed using Byte-Pair Encoding, were then passed through a shared embedding layer. This embedding layer learned a consistent representation for all input data, regardless of the specific task."
  - [section] "The transformer encoder consisted of two encoder layers with four attention heads each. This configuration was chosen to balance the need for model depth and computational efficiency."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus contains related work on multi-task learning for morphological tasks but no direct evidence for this specific shared architecture approach.
- Break condition: Tasks have conflicting optimization objectives that cause negative transfer, or shared representations become too task-specific to benefit both outputs.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Data augmentation using miniparadigms effectively addresses data scarcity in endangered language settings by generating diverse morphological forms.
- Mechanism: For each verb and noun, the model generates multiple morphological forms (present tense, singular, imperative, etc.) using the Skolt Sami FST transducer. This increases dataset size and helps the model learn morphological variations across sparse data.
- Core assumption: Generating additional forms from existing lexemes captures the essential morphological patterns needed for classification without introducing noise.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "To mitigate data scarcity, we employed data augmentation using 'miniparadigms.' For each verb and noun, specific morphological forms (e.g., present tense, singular form, imperative) were generated."
  - [section] "This approach added multiple derived forms for each lexeme, thereby significantly increasing the size of the dataset."
  - [section] "The use of miniparadigms allowed the model to learn morphological variations more effectively, compensating for the limited data available."
- Break condition: Generated forms introduce noise or don't reflect actual language usage patterns, leading to overfitting on synthetic data.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization effectively handles Skolt Sami's morphological complexity by breaking words into meaningful subword units.
- Mechanism: BPE learns to split words into frequent morphemes and subword units, allowing the model to handle both common morphological patterns and rare words without vocabulary explosion.
- Core assumption: Skolt Sami's morphological structure can be adequately captured by subword units learned from the concatenated lexeme and generated form data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "To handle the morphological complexity of Skolt Sami, we employed Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) as a tokenization method."
  - [section] "We trained a BPE model on the concatenated lexeme and all the form data generated, using a vocabulary size of 2000 to capture the most relevant subword units for the language."
  - [section] "This tokenization approach helped the model deal with highly inflected forms of lexemes by breaking them into smaller, more manageable units."
- Break condition: BPE fails to capture long-range morphological dependencies or creates suboptimal subword boundaries for this specific language.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Finite-State Transducers (FSTs) for morphological analysis
  - Why needed here: The model relies on FSTs to generate morphological forms for data augmentation, providing the foundational linguistic rules that guide the neural network learning
  - Quick check question: How would the data augmentation process change if we didn't have access to a reliable FST for Skolt Sami?

- Concept: Multi-task learning architecture
  - Why needed here: The model needs to predict both POS and Contlex labels simultaneously, requiring shared representations that capture dependencies between these tasks
  - Quick check question: What would be the trade-offs of training separate models for POS and Contlex classification instead of using the multi-task approach?

- Concept: Data augmentation techniques for low-resource languages
  - Why needed here: Endangered languages like Skolt Sami have limited annotated data, making traditional deep learning approaches infeasible without synthetic data generation
  - Quick check question: How does the miniparadigm approach differ from other data augmentation strategies like back-translation or word replacement?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: BPE-tokenized words → Shared embedding layer → Transformer encoder (2 layers, 4 attention heads) → Dual classification heads → Loss computation → Backpropagation
- Critical path: Tokenization → Shared embedding → Transformer encoding → Dual classification → Loss computation → Backpropagation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Shared vs. separate embeddings: Shared reduces parameters but may limit task-specific learning
  - Transformer depth: 2 layers chosen for efficiency vs. deeper models that might overfit on limited data
  - Miniparadigm selection: Balancing comprehensive coverage vs. computational cost of generating too many forms
- Failure signatures:
  - High POS accuracy but low Contlex accuracy: Tasks may not benefit from shared learning or Contlex classification is inherently harder
  - Both tasks perform poorly: Data augmentation may not be sufficient, or model capacity is inadequate
  - Perfect training but poor validation: Overfitting due to limited data or aggressive data augmentation
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline single-task POS classification to establish lower bound performance
  2. Multi-task learning with different numbers of transformer layers (1, 2, 3) to find optimal depth
  3. Data augmentation ablation study: full augmentation vs. no augmentation vs. partial augmentation to measure impact on both tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How does the model perform on predicting inflection classes for unseen lexemes that are morphologically similar to the training data but semantically distinct?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the model's ability to generalize across sparse data and mentions that data augmentation using miniparadigms helps in learning morphological variations.
  - Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific results or analysis on the model's performance with unseen lexemes that are morphologically similar but semantically distinct.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with a test set containing lexemes that are morphologically similar but semantically distinct from the training data and reporting the model's accuracy and F1 scores.

- Question: What is the impact of incorporating syntactic or contextual information on the model's performance for rare Contlex categories?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that rare Contlex categories show lower performance due to limited training data and suggests that incorporating additional features could enhance the model's understanding.
  - Why unresolved: The paper does not experiment with or report on the impact of incorporating syntactic or contextual information.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Running experiments where syntactic or contextual features are added to the model and comparing the performance on rare Contlex categories with and without these features.

- Question: How does the model's performance change when trained on a multilingual dataset including other Uralic languages?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that expanding the dataset to include other related Uralic languages could enhance model performance through cross-linguistic transfer learning.
  - Why unresolved: The paper does not provide results from training the model on a multilingual dataset.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Training the model on a dataset that includes lexemes from multiple Uralic languages and comparing the performance metrics with those obtained from the monolingual Skolt Sami dataset.

## Limitations
- The approach's dependence on a comprehensive FST raises questions about generalizability to languages without such linguistic resources
- The model's performance on Contlex classification (0.81 F1) shows clear room for improvement, particularly given the 73-class complexity
- Highly specialized nature of the Skolt Sami data limits broader applicability

## Confidence
- High confidence in POS classification results (1.00 F1) given the binary nature of the task and clear performance metrics
- Medium confidence in the overall multi-task learning approach, as related work shows mixed results for morphological tasks
- Medium confidence in data augmentation effectiveness, limited by the synthetic nature of generated forms
- Low confidence in long-term model stability and performance on truly unseen data due to the small original dataset size

## Next Checks
1. Ablation study on FST-generated forms: Compare model performance using only authentic dictionary forms versus augmented data to quantify the true benefit of miniparadigm generation.
2. Cross-linguistic validation: Test the multi-task learning architecture on a related Uralic language with similar morphological complexity but different data availability.
3. Generalization testing: Evaluate model performance on completely unseen word forms and rare inflection patterns not present in the training data augmentation.
