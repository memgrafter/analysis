# Gradient Correlation Subspace Learning against Catastrophic Forgetting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.02334
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02334
- Authors: Tammuz Dubnov; Vishal Thengane
- Reference count: 6
- Key outcome: GCSL achieves 80% and 55% average accuracy on MNIST and Fashion MNIST respectively, outperforming catastrophic forgetting baseline

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Gradient Correlation Subspace Learning (GCSL), a method designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in incremental class learning scenarios. The approach works by identifying a subspace of weights that are least affected by previous tasks and projecting new task weights into this subspace during training. Through experiments on MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets using fully connected networks, GCSL demonstrates significant improvements over naive baselines and competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods like Gradient Projection Memory (GPM).

## Method Summary
GCSL addresses catastrophic forgetting by computing correlation matrices between gradient updates across tasks, then using PCA to extract eigenvectors that define a subspace least affected by previous tasks. During training of new tasks, weights are projected into this subspace while maintaining performance on earlier tasks. The method employs layer-specific subspaces and task-specific binary cross-entropy loss, with the subspace size adjustable per layer and task. The correlation matrix is computed over training samples, and PCA is applied to identify the most stable directions for weight updates.

## Key Results
- GCSL achieves 80% average accuracy on MNIST compared to catastrophic forgetting baseline
- GCSL reaches 55% average accuracy on Fashion MNIST, significantly outperforming naive approaches
- Performance comparable to or better than Gradient Projection Memory across different network sizes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging gradient correlation to identify stable subspaces in the weight space that are minimally affected by previous tasks. By projecting new task gradients into these subspaces while maintaining a fixed set of weights from previous tasks, GCSL preserves learned knowledge while accommodating new information. The correlation-based approach ensures that only the most task-invariant directions are used for updates, reducing interference between tasks.

## Foundational Learning
**Gradient correlation computation**
- Why needed: Identifies directions in weight space that are stable across tasks
- Quick check: Verify correlation matrix is positive semi-definite and properly normalized

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- Why needed: Extracts orthogonal basis vectors that define the stable subspace
- Quick check: Confirm eigenvectors are ordered by descending eigenvalues

**Catastrophic forgetting**
- Why needed: Core problem GCSL addresses in incremental learning
- Quick check: Compare performance to baseline that suffers from forgetting

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**
Fully connected network -> Correlation matrix computation -> PCA eigenvector extraction -> Subspace projection -> Task-specific BCE loss

**Critical path**
Correlation matrix calculation → PCA → Subspace projection → Training loop with frozen weights

**Design tradeoffs**
- Subspace size vs. capacity to learn new tasks
- Computational cost of correlation matrix vs. forgetting prevention
- Layer-specific vs. global subspace application

**Failure signatures**
- Singular correlation matrix indicates insufficient gradient variance
- Degraded performance suggests incorrect eigenvector ordering
- Training instability may result from improper weight freezing

**3 first experiments**
1. Verify correlation matrix computation on small synthetic dataset
2. Test PCA eigenvector extraction with known gradient patterns
3. Implement basic subspace projection on single-layer network

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
**Open Question 1**
How does the choice of subspace size per layer affect the performance of GCSL in different network architectures? The paper shows that different subspace sizes yield different results, but does not provide a clear heuristic or rule for determining the optimal size.

**Open Question 2**
How does GCSL compare to other state-of-the-art methods on more complex datasets and architectures? The comparison is limited to two specific datasets and network types, leaving questions about performance on more complex tasks and architectures.

**Open Question 3**
Can GCSL be effectively combined with other continual learning techniques to improve performance? The paper suggests that GCSL could be combined with replay-based approaches or used in self-supervised networks, but does not provide empirical evidence of such combinations.

## Limitations
- Correlation matrix computation method not fully specified (full samples vs. subset)
- Limited ablation studies on subspace size and correlation threshold parameters
- Restricted to fully connected networks and relatively simple datasets

## Confidence
- High confidence: The core GCSL methodology and its basic implementation
- Medium confidence: The comparative performance claims against GPM and naive baselines
- Low confidence: The specific implementation details that could affect reproducibility

## Next Checks
1. Verify correlation matrix computation by implementing both full-sample and batch-wise approaches to compare subspace quality
2. Test different PCA implementations (SVD vs eigenvalue decomposition) to confirm numerical stability
3. Conduct ablation studies varying subspace sizes and correlation thresholds to understand their impact on performance trade-offs
