core_contribution: This paper introduces Pomo3D, a 3D-aware portrait manipulation
  framework that enables free accessorizing by decomposing and recomposing portraits
  and accessories. The approach tackles the challenge of generating out-of-distribution
  appearances where multiple accessories can be worn simultaneously, addressing limitations
  in existing methods that either fail to generate additional objects or cause unwanted
  alterations to the portrait.

# Pomo3D: 3D-Aware Portrait Accessorizing and More

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Introduces Pomo3D framework enabling 3D-aware portrait accessorizing with view-consistent editing

## Executive Summary
Pomo3D is a 3D-aware portrait manipulation framework that addresses the challenge of accessorizing portraits with multiple accessories while maintaining view consistency and identity preservation. The framework introduces dual geometry tri-planes for both portraits and accessories, enabling free accessorizing through decomposition and recomposition of portrait elements. By incorporating a bias-conscious mapper and Scribble2Accessories module, Pomo3D can handle dataset biases and generate accessories from user input, achieving competitive performance with FID 9.1, KID 1.51, and FV-ID 0.748 while offering extensive editing options at interactive frame rates.

## Method Summary
Pomo3D introduces a novel approach to 3D-aware portrait manipulation by separating the generation and editing of portraits and accessories into distinct yet interconnected components. The framework employs dual geometry tri-planes - one for portraits and one for accessories - allowing for independent manipulation of geometric structures. A bias-conscious mapper addresses dataset biases by learning to generate accessories regardless of demographic correlations present in training data. The Scribble2Accessories module enables users to create accessories from simple scribble maps, expanding the framework's flexibility. Through a combination of tri-plane decomposition, mapper bias correction, and interactive editing capabilities, Pomo3D achieves view-consistent accessorizing while maintaining competitive quality metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods.

## Key Results
- Achieves view-consistent editing with FID 9.1, KID 1.51, and FV-ID 0.748
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in flexibility while maintaining competitive view consistency
- Offers extensive editing options including geometry modification, texture editing, and avatar stylization at interactive frame rates

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Pomo3D works by decoupling portrait and accessory generation through dual geometry tri-planes, allowing independent manipulation while maintaining coherence. The bias-conscious mapper addresses dataset biases by learning to generate accessories regardless of demographic correlations, enabling more diverse and realistic combinations. The Scribble2Accessories module bridges the gap between user intent and generated accessories by translating simple scribble maps into detailed accessory geometry and texture, providing an intuitive interface for customization.

## Foundational Learning
- **Tri-plane representation**: A method for representing 3D geometry and appearance using three 2D feature planes (geometry, texture, and alpha) - needed for efficient 3D-aware image synthesis and enables view-consistent editing across different perspectives.
- **Bias-conscious mapping**: Techniques that identify and mitigate dataset biases during training - needed because existing portrait datasets often contain demographic correlations that limit generalization, and quick check involves testing model performance across underrepresented demographic groups.
- **Scribble-based generation**: Using user-drawn scribbles as input for generating complex structures - needed to provide intuitive user control over accessory creation, and quick check involves measuring the semantic correspondence between input scribbles and generated accessories.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:**
Tri-plane Encoder -> Dual Geometry Tri-planes -> Bias-Conscious Mapper -> Scribble2Accessories -> Composition Network

**Critical path:**
Tri-plane Encoder -> Dual Geometry Tri-planes -> Bias-Conscious Mapper -> Composition Network

**Design tradeoffs:**
- Separate vs. joint modeling of portraits and accessories (separate enables more flexible editing but requires careful composition)
- Dataset bias handling through mapper vs. data augmentation (mapper is more targeted but may not capture all biases)
- Scribble-based vs. template-based accessory creation (scribble offers more flexibility but requires more complex generation network)

**Failure signatures:**
- Artifacts at accessory-portrait boundaries when geometry misalignment occurs
- Demographic bias artifacts when generating accessories for underrepresented groups
- Inconsistent accessory appearance across different viewing angles due to incomplete tri-plane representation

**Three first experiments:**
1. Test accessory composition on portraits with extreme head poses to evaluate geometry tri-plane robustness
2. Evaluate bias-conscious mapper by generating accessories for demographic groups underrepresented in training data
3. Assess Scribble2Accessories module by comparing generated accessories against ground truth for various scribble inputs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Heavy reliance on PPSS dataset which exhibits clear gender and age biases for accessories
- Dataset typically contains only one type of accessory at a time, limiting multi-accessory generation
- Performance metrics (FID 9.1, KID 1.51) indicate room for improvement in distributional matching

## Confidence
- **High** confidence in core architectural innovations (dual geometry tri-planes, bias-conscious mapper, Scribble2Accessories module)
- **Medium** confidence in out-of-distribution generation claims due to validation primarily on biased PPSS dataset
- **Low** confidence in "free accessorizing" assertion due to constraints from dataset biases and potential artifacts

## Next Checks
1. Test Pomo3D on a more diverse, unbiased portrait dataset with varied accessory combinations across different demographics to assess generalization beyond PPSS dataset biases
2. Evaluate the framework's performance on extreme head poses and occlusions to determine the robustness of the geometry tri-planes under challenging viewing conditions
3. Conduct a perceptual study comparing Pomo3D-generated accessories against ground truth accessories across different demographic groups to quantify bias-related artifacts and realism issues
