# Self-Supervised Radiograph Anatomical Region Classification -- How Clean Is Your Real-World Data?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.15967
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15967
- Reference count: 30
- Key outcome: Self-supervised models achieve 96.6-97.1% accuracy on 14-class anatomical region classification with only 1% labeled data maintaining 92.2% accuracy

## Executive Summary
This work tackles the challenge of accurately predicting anatomical regions in skeletal radiographs using self-supervised learning, addressing a critical need for effective downstream model selection and data curation in clinical imaging. The authors develop a robust approach that leverages large-scale unlabeled radiographs to train feature extractors using contrastive methods like SimCLR and BYOL, complemented by supervised contrastive learning. Custom augmentations, including rotation correction and novel gauge insertion, are introduced to improve model robustness and focus on anatomical features rather than operation planning artifacts.

The results demonstrate strong performance with top-1 accuracy reaching 96.6% (SimCLR) and 97.1% (supervised contrastive) on the test set, while maintaining high accuracy (92.2%) even with only 1% of labeled data. The approach also proves effective for identifying and correcting mislabeled data in the PACS system, improving overall data quality. This work highlights the potential of self-supervised learning for addressing real-world challenges in medical imaging and improving the reliability of clinical workflows.

## Method Summary
The approach employs self-supervised contrastive learning (SimCLR, BYOL, and supervised contrastive) to train a ResNet18 backbone on unlabeled skeletal radiographs for anatomical region classification. Custom augmentations including rotation correction, border removal, and novel gauge insertion are used to improve robustness. The models are evaluated using a linear evaluation protocol where the pretrained backbone is frozen and a single fully connected layer is trained on labeled data. The method demonstrates strong performance with minimal labeled data requirements and effective identification of mislabeled data in real-world clinical datasets.

## Key Results
- Top-1 accuracy of 96.6% (SimCLR) and 97.1% (supervised contrastive) on 14-class anatomical region classification
- High accuracy maintained (92.2%) with only 1% of labeled data (310 images)
- Custom gauge insertion augmentation successfully reduces model reliance on spurious features
- Model effectively identifies and corrects mislabeled data in PACS system

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Self-supervised contrastive learning enables effective anatomical region classification with minimal labeled data
- Mechanism: The model learns rich visual features by contrasting augmented views of the same image against different images, creating robust embeddings without requiring anatomical region labels during pretraining
- Core assumption: Anatomical regions have consistent visual features that can be captured through contrastive learning across augmentations
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "even with only 1% of labeled data (310 images), the model maintains high accuracy (92.2%), demonstrating its effectiveness in low-resource settings"
  - [section]: "We achieve a strong linear evaluation accuracy of 96.6% with a single model and 97.7% using an ensemble approach"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus papers mention self-supervised learning but don't specifically address anatomical region classification with minimal labels
- Break condition: If anatomical regions don't have consistent visual patterns distinguishable through augmentations, contrastive learning would fail to capture meaningful features

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Custom data augmentations improve model robustness and reduce reliance on spurious features like surgical gauges
- Mechanism: By randomly inserting surgical gauges during training and applying custom preprocessing (border removal, rotation normalization), the model learns to focus on anatomical features rather than operation planning artifacts
- Core assumption: Surgical gauges are not consistent indicators of anatomical region and their presence would bias predictions
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Custom augmentations, including rotation correction and a novel gauge insertion augmentation, are introduced to improve model robustness"
  - [section]: "images in the region pelvis/hip and rarely knee can contain a circular gauge for surgery planning. To combat the model relying on this for its prediction... we add a novel augmentation where we use 6 example gauges extracted from the dataset, and randomly insert zero to two of them"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus papers don't discuss surgical gauge augmentation specifically
- Break condition: If surgical gauges were consistently present only in specific anatomical regions, this augmentation strategy would reduce accuracy

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Supervised contrastive learning extends self-supervised pretraining to achieve higher accuracy by leveraging available labels
- Mechanism: The model treats all images of the same anatomical region as positive pairs during pretraining, strengthening the feature space separation between regions
- Core assumption: Labeled data can be effectively used to create meaningful positive pairs that improve contrastive learning
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Specifically, they employ contrastive methods like SimCLR and BYOL, complemented by supervised contrastive learning"
  - [section]: "Due to VRAM constraints, we had to reduce our batch size to 896 for BYOL; accordingly, we setτbase = 0.9995 as recommended in [8]."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus papers mention contrastive learning but not supervised contrastive learning for anatomical region classification
- Break condition: If the labeled data contains significant noise or the number of labels per class is highly imbalanced, supervised contrastive learning could degrade performance

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contrastive learning principles
  - Why needed here: The entire approach relies on learning meaningful image representations by comparing similar and dissimilar examples
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how SimCLR creates positive and negative pairs from a single image?

- Concept: Data augmentation strategies for medical imaging
  - Why needed here: Custom augmentations like surgical gauge insertion are critical to handling domain-specific artifacts
  - Quick check question: What considerations must be made when applying standard augmentations to radiographs versus natural images?

- Concept: Ensemble methods for classification
  - Why needed here: The ensemble approach provides additional accuracy gains over individual models
  - Quick check question: How does combining softmax outputs from multiple models improve classification performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing -> Custom augmentations (rotation, border removal, gauge insertion) -> Self-supervised pretraining (SimCLR/BYOL/SupCon) -> Linear evaluation head training -> Ensemble inference

- Critical path: Data preprocessing → Self-supervised pretraining → Linear evaluation head training → Ensemble inference

- Design tradeoffs:
  - ResNet18 vs ResNet50: Smaller model sufficient for task, lower computational cost
  - Freezing backbone during linear evaluation: Prevents overfitting to noisy labels, enables future error analysis
  - Custom gauge augmentation: Improves robustness but adds complexity to data pipeline

- Failure signatures:
  - High validation loss during linear evaluation: Possible overfitting to noisy labels
  - Low accuracy on spine classes: Indicates label noise or class overlap issues
  - Confusion between clavicle and shoulder: Suggests need for better data cleaning or augmentation

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train linear evaluation head with 1% labeled data using pretrained SimCLR backbone
  2. Compare performance with and without custom gauge augmentation on pelvis/hip class
  3. Test ensemble performance by combining SimCLR, BYOL, and supervised contrastive models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How do the performance and robustness of the self-supervised models compare when trained on datasets from different hospitals with varying image acquisition protocols?
- Can the model's ability to detect mislabeled data be further improved by incorporating uncertainty estimation techniques?
- How does the model perform on radiographs from underrepresented anatomical regions or rare conditions within the 14-class classification task?

## Limitations
- Reliance on in-house dataset that is not publicly available, making direct reproduction difficult
- Gauge insertion augmentation lacks precise implementation details that could affect reproducibility
- Label quality issues in original dataset suggest potential noise that may not be fully addressed

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The self-supervised learning framework's effectiveness in leveraging unlabeled data for anatomical region classification
- Medium Confidence: The custom gauge augmentation's impact on model robustness
- Low Confidence: The generalizability of the approach to other medical imaging tasks or datasets

## Next Checks
1. Ablation study on gauge augmentation: Train models with and without the gauge insertion augmentation on the pelvis/hip class to quantify its specific impact on reducing spurious feature reliance

2. Label noise analysis: Examine the corrected labels to determine the extent and distribution of initial label errors, and assess whether the model can identify similar errors in other datasets

3. Cross-institutional validation: Test the trained models on radiographs from a different institution to evaluate robustness to variations in image acquisition protocols, equipment, and patient demographics
