# Zero-Shot Load Forecasting with Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.11350
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11350
- Reference count: 31
- Primary result: Zero-shot load forecasting with Chronos LLM achieves 7.34%-84.30% lower RMSE than baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a zero-shot load forecasting approach using Chronos, a large language model pre-trained on extensive time series data. The method leverages Chronos's pre-trained knowledge to perform accurate load forecasting in data-scarce scenarios without requiring dataset-specific training or fine-tuning. Experiments across five real-world datasets demonstrate that Chronos significantly outperforms nine popular baseline models for both deterministic and probabilistic load forecasting with various forecast horizons (1-48 hours).

## Method Summary
The approach uses Chronos, a large language model pre-trained on 28 diverse time series datasets, to perform zero-shot load forecasting. The method transforms continuous load data into discrete tokens through mean scaling and quantization, enabling the LLM to process the data. The T5 architecture with positional encoding, self-attention, layer normalization, residual connections, and feed-forward neural networks is used. The model is evaluated on five real-world load datasets and compared against nine baseline models using RMSE, MAE, MAPE, QS, and CRPS metrics.

## Key Results
- Chronos reduces RMSE by 7.34%-84.30% compared to baseline models
- CRPS is reduced by 19.63%-60.06% compared to baseline models
- QS is reduced by 22.83%-54.49% compared to baseline models
- Superior performance is maintained across forecast horizons of 1-48 hours

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Zero-shot performance is possible because Chronos is pre-trained on massive, diverse time series data and maps continuous values to discrete tokens via scaling and quantization.
- Mechanism: By transforming time series into a fixed vocabulary of tokens, the model leverages learned temporal patterns without retraining on the target dataset.
- Core assumption: The learned temporal relationships generalize across domains, and the tokenization preserves the critical structure of the data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] Chronos "enables accurate load forecasting in data-scarce scenarios without the need for extensive data-specific training."
  - [section] Scaling and quantization transform continuous real values into discrete tokens that can be fed into LLMs.
  - [corpus] "Chronos tokenizes time series values using scaling and quantization into a fixed vocabulary and trains existing transformer-based language model architectures on these tokenized time series."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Chronos outperforms other LLMs like TimeLLM because it is directly pre-trained on time series rather than text.
- Mechanism: Direct time series training allows Chronos to learn temporal dynamics without the lossy step of text conversion, preserving the native time series structure.
- Core assumption: Learning on time series is more effective than learning on text representations of time series.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Chronos model uses the LLM framework but is directly pre-trained on massive time series data rather than text data."
  - [section] "TimeLLM is trained on textual data, and it handles time-series data by first converting it into text..."
  - [corpus] "Large pre-trained models such as Chronos and Time-MoE show strong zero-shot (ZS) performance..."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Chronos maintains performance in data-scarce scenarios because its pre-training provides a robust prior over time series patterns.
- Mechanism: The extensive pre-training acts as a learned inductive bias, allowing the model to infer load dynamics even with minimal local data.
- Core assumption: The diversity of the pre-training corpus covers the statistical structure of load time series.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Chronos model enables accurate load forecasting in data-scarce scenarios without the need for extensive data-specific training."
  - [section] "Despite the scarcity of data, their forecast accuracy does not vary significantly" for statistical models; Chronos avoids this limitation.
  - [corpus] "Pretrained time series models have enabled inference-only forecasting systems that produce accurate predictions without task-specific training."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Time series tokenization via scaling and quantization
  - Why needed here: LLMs require discrete tokens, but time series are continuous; this process enables the transfer.
  - Quick check question: What are the two steps that transform continuous load data into tokens for the LLM?

- Concept: Zero-shot learning
  - Why needed here: The model must forecast without fine-tuning; understanding the distinction from few-shot is critical.
  - Quick check question: How does zero-shot forecasting differ from fine-tuning or few-shot adaptation in terms of data requirements?

- Concept: Probabilistic forecasting via quantile regression
  - Why needed here: Load forecasting benefits from uncertainty quantification; Chronos outputs full distributions.
  - Quick check question: What does the α-quantile represent in the context of load forecasting?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Tokenization layer (scaling → quantization) → LLM backbone (T5 encoder-decoder with positional encoding, self-attention, layer norm, residual connections, feed-forward) → Dequantization layer (softmax → inverse scaling) → Output quantile distribution
- Critical path: Input load data → Tokenization → LLM forward pass → Softmax sampling → Dequantization → Forecast
- Design tradeoffs: High training time and GPU cost versus fast inference and zero-shot generalization; trade-off between vocabulary size (resolution) and model complexity
- Failure signatures: Persistent token distribution mismatch → poor dequantization; poor scaling choices → loss of temporal shape; overfitting to pre-training data → poor domain transfer
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify tokenization preserves temporal shape on a small synthetic load dataset
  2. Run inference on held-out load data and compare RMSE to a baseline statistical model
  3. Test probabilistic forecast calibration by computing PICP vs. PIAW across different PINC levels

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the Chronos model's performance compare to traditional machine learning models when trained on limited historical data (few-shot learning) versus zero-shot scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses zero-shot learning but mentions future work exploring few-shot learning scenarios.
- Why unresolved: The current study focuses solely on zero-shot learning, and there is no comparative analysis with few-shot learning.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments comparing Chronos model performance in few-shot versus zero-shot scenarios would provide insights into its adaptability and effectiveness with limited data.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of incorporating numerical weather prediction data on the Chronos model's forecasting accuracy for multivariate time series?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that future work will extend the Chronos model to multivariate forecasting, incorporating numerical weather prediction data.
- Why unresolved: The current model is limited to univariate forecasting and does not utilize external data sources like weather predictions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extending the Chronos model to include weather data and comparing its performance against the current univariate model would highlight the benefits of incorporating external factors.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the Chronos model's computational efficiency scale with increasing dataset size and complexity in real-world applications?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the model's computational time, highlighting longer training times but efficient inference, suggesting scalability challenges.
- Why unresolved: The study does not address scalability with larger datasets or more complex forecasting scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the Chronos model on progressively larger datasets and measuring training and inference times would reveal its scalability and practical applicability.

## Limitations

- Model access and reproducibility are limited due to undisclosed pre-trained weights and implementation details
- Evaluation is restricted to five specific load datasets, limiting generalization assessment

- The scaling and quantization mechanism enables LLMs to process continuous time series data effectively
- Zero-shot forecasting with Chronos is feasible and effective in data-scarce scenarios

**Medium Confidence**:
- Chronos significantly outperforms deep learning models (TFT, DeepAR, PatchTST) in zero-shot settings
- The probabilistic forecasting outputs are well-calibrated and reliable across all datasets
- The performance gap between Chronos and TimeLLM is consistent across all forecast horizons

**Low Confidence**:
- Chronos will generalize to highly noisy or non-stationary load datasets without performance degradation
- The model's zero-shot performance will remain superior if applied to domains outside electricity load forecasting (e.g., weather or financial time series)
- Chronos's performance is robust to different quantization granularities or scaling methods

## Next Checks

1. **Tokenization Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically test Chronos's performance with different scaling and quantization parameters (e.g., varying bin sizes or normalization methods) on the University of Texas at Austin dataset. Measure RMSE and CRPS to identify the optimal configuration and assess robustness.

2. **Cross-Domain Generalization Test**: Apply Chronos to a non-electricity dataset (e.g., temperature or financial time series) in a zero-shot manner. Compare results with domain-specific baselines to evaluate generalization beyond load forecasting.

3. **Probabilistic Forecast Calibration**: Perform detailed calibration analysis by computing PICP vs. PIAW across multiple PINC levels (e.g., 50%, 70%, 90%) on the Midea Group dataset. Assess whether uncertainty estimates are reliable and well-calibrated in extreme load scenarios.
