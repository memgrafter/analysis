# A Systems Theoretic Approach to Online Machine Learning

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03775

- This paper introduces a systems theoretic framework for understanding and designing online learning systems, addressing the gap between machine learning approaches and formal systems theory.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a systems theoretic framework for understanding and designing online learning (OL) systems, addressing the gap between machine learning approaches and formal systems theory. The authors propose a novel definition of OL systems and identify key design parameters by decomposing OL systems into system structure (input-output spaces) and system behavior (probability distributions). They formalize OL as systems that update knowledge bases over time to maintain prediction performance despite concept drift—changes in data distributions. The framework is illustrated using healthcare fraud detection, where fraudsters' evolving behavior creates non-stationary data streams. The paper distinguishes between virtual drift (changes in input distributions) and real drift (changes in output distributions), and introduces homomorphism concepts to relate system structures across time steps.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a systems theoretic approach to online machine learning by decomposing OL systems into system structure (input-output spaces X(t), Y(t)) and system behavior (probability distributions P(X), P(Y|X)). The framework formalizes OL as systems that update knowledge bases K(t) over time to maintain prediction performance despite concept drift. The method involves tracking structural changes between time steps using homomorphism mappings ρ and θ, distinguishing between virtual drift (input distribution changes) and real drift (output distribution changes), and updating the knowledge base accordingly. The approach is illustrated through healthcare fraud detection where fraudsters' evolving behavior creates non-stationary data streams.

## Key Results
- The framework provides a formal systems-theoretic definition of online learning systems that bridges statistical learning theory and system design
- Homomorphism concepts enable structural relationships between successive time steps even when input-output spaces change
- The framework formally separates virtual drift (input distribution changes) from real drift (output distribution changes), enabling targeted adaptation strategies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The paper provides a formal systems-theoretic definition of online learning systems that bridges the gap between statistical learning theory and system design. By decomposing OL systems into system structure (input-output spaces) and system behavior (probability distributions), the framework allows for top-down design rather than bottom-up algorithm tuning. Core assumption: OL systems can be meaningfully modeled as input-output systems with observable structures and behaviors that evolve over time.

### Mechanism 2
Homomorphism concepts enable structural relationships between successive time steps even when input-output spaces change. By mapping structures from one time step to the next using appropriate mappings, homogeneous structures can be recovered even when domains differ. Core assumption: There exist meaningful mappings between successive system structures that preserve essential information for learning.

### Mechanism 3
The framework formally separates virtual drift (input distribution changes) from real drift (output distribution changes), enabling targeted adaptation strategies. By distinguishing between changes in P(X) versus P(Y|X), the system can apply appropriate learning strategies for each drift type. Core assumption: Virtual and real drift have distinct impacts on learning performance and require different adaptation mechanisms.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Abstract Learning Systems Theory (ALST)
  - Why needed here: Provides the mathematical foundation for treating learning systems as formal systems with input-output relationships
  - Quick check question: Can you describe how ALST extends Abstract Systems Theory (AST) to learning contexts?

- Concept: Homomorphism in system theory
  - Why needed here: Enables structural continuity across time steps when input-output spaces change
  - Quick check question: How would you define a homomorphism between two system structures in this context?

- Concept: Concept drift patterns and types
  - Why needed here: Understanding drift is central to the behavioral analysis of OL systems
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes virtual drift from real drift in terms of their impact on learning systems?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input space X(t): Feature representation at time t
  - Output space Y(t): Label/target space at time t
  - Data D(t): Joint samples from X(t) and Y(t)
  - Knowledge base K(t): Parameters or representations learned from D(t)
  - Predictive function f: Maps inputs to outputs using knowledge base
  - Homomorphism mappings ρ and θ: Structural transformations between time steps

- Critical path: Data → Structure Analysis → Behavior Analysis → Knowledge Update → Prediction
  - Each time step: Observe data → Determine structural changes → Analyze drift type → Update knowledge → Make predictions

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Homogeneous vs heterogeneous structures: Simplicity vs flexibility
  - Explicit vs implicit drift detection: Computational cost vs responsiveness
  - Parameter-based vs data-based knowledge transfer: Efficiency vs robustness

- Failure signatures:
  - Performance degradation without structural change → Behavior drift
  - Inability to map structures between time steps → Missing homomorphism
  - Rapid performance oscillation → Incorrect drift type identification

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple OL system with fixed structure and synthetic virtual drift to verify knowledge updating works
  2. Add structural changes with homomorphism mappings to test structural continuity mechanisms
  3. Introduce real drift and measure how the system distinguishes and adapts to different drift types

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can the complexity and variability of online learning systems be formally quantified and controlled using systems theory principles? Basis in paper: The paper discusses complexity and variability as subjective characteristics of OL systems but doesn't provide formal quantification methods. Why unresolved: The paper identifies these as important but subjective characteristics without concrete metrics or control mechanisms.

### Open Question 2
What are the optimal structural relationships between consecutive time steps in online learning systems for minimizing concept drift impact? Basis in paper: The paper discusses homogeneous vs heterogeneous system structures and homomorphisms but doesn't determine optimal structural relationships. Why unresolved: The paper presents structural relationships as possibilities but doesn't evaluate their effectiveness against concept drift.

### Open Question 3
How can latent features be discovered and utilized to relate heterogeneous system structures in online learning? Basis in paper: The paper mentions latent features as a potential solution but notes the challenge of discovering them without external knowledge. Why unresolved: The paper identifies this as a challenge but doesn't propose concrete methods for latent feature discovery.

## Limitations
- The framework's practical utility hinges on the existence of meaningful homomorphism mappings between time steps, which may not exist in domains with dramatic structural changes
- The separation of virtual and real drift assumes clean categorization, but real-world drift often exhibits hybrid characteristics that may not fit neatly into these categories
- The paper does not provide concrete algorithms for constructing homomorphism mappings, leaving a significant implementation gap

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core premise that OL systems can be decomposed into structure (input-output spaces) and behavior (probability distributions) is well-founded and theoretically sound. The formalism of defining OL systems as evolving knowledge bases is robust.

**Medium Confidence**: The practical utility of homomorphism concepts for maintaining structural continuity across time steps is theoretically compelling but lacks concrete implementation guidance. The effectiveness depends heavily on domain characteristics and the availability of appropriate mappings.

**Low Confidence**: The diagnostic power of distinguishing virtual from real drift in complex, real-world scenarios where drift patterns are often ambiguous or hybrid in nature. The framework may oversimplify drift detection challenges.

## Next Checks
1. **Homomorphism Mapping Test**: Implement and evaluate the framework on a domain with known structural changes (e.g., evolving feature sets in fraud detection) to assess whether meaningful homomorphism mappings can be constructed and whether they improve prediction performance compared to baseline approaches.

2. **Drift Classification Validation**: Design experiments with synthetic data streams that exhibit mixed drift patterns to test the framework's ability to correctly identify and respond to hybrid virtual/real drift scenarios. Measure classification accuracy and adaptation speed.

3. **Structural Change Robustness**: Evaluate the framework's performance when homomorphism mappings are imperfect or unavailable by introducing scenarios with partial structural changes. Assess whether the system can gracefully degrade or employ alternative adaptation strategies.
