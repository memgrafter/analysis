# Investigating the Impact of Text Summarization on Topic Modeling

## Quick Facts

- LLM-generated summaries improve topic modeling by reducing noise and highlighting key themes

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes enhancing topic modeling by summarizing documents with an LLM before applying BERTopic. The approach uses GPT-3.5-Turbo-Instruct with few-shot prompts to generate summaries of different lengths, which are then input into BERTopic. Results show that shorter summaries work better for longer documents while longer summaries work better for shorter documents, indicating an optimal summary length per dataset. Diversity improved significantly with summaries while coherence was comparable or slightly lower, demonstrating that LLM summarization can effectively reduce noise and improve topic modeling outcomes.

## Method Summary
The method involves two main stages: document summarization and topic modeling. Documents are first truncated to fit within GPT-3.5-Turbo-Instruct's 4096 token limit, then summarized using few-shot prompts to generate either short (20-30 words) or long (60-80 words) summaries. These summaries are then processed by BERTopic, which applies UMAP for dimensionality reduction, HDBSCAN for clustering, and class-based TF-IDF for topic representation. The approach is evaluated on the BBC News and 20 Newsgroups datasets using coherence (C_V) and diversity metrics.

## Key Results
- Shorter summaries improve topic modeling for longer documents by reducing noise
- Longer summaries work better for shorter documents by preserving context
- Topic diversity improved significantly with summaries, while coherence was comparable or slightly lower

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLM-generated summaries reduce noise in topic modeling by filtering out irrelevant details while preserving core thematic content
- Mechanism: Truncating documents and generating concise summaries provides fewer irrelevant terms to BERTopic, leading to more focused clustering around main themes
- Core assumption: LLM summarization preserves the most semantically important parts of documents
- Evidence anchors:
  - "helps capture the most essential information while reducing noise and irrelevant details that could obscure the overall theme"
  - "Document summarization is employed to reduce noise in the data"
- Break condition: If summaries omit key context or include hallucinated content, topic modeling may produce misleading topics

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: There is an optimal summary length per dataset, balancing context preservation and noise reduction
- Mechanism: Shorter documents benefit from longer summaries (more context), while longer documents benefit from shorter summaries (less redundancy)
- Core assumption: Document length and content density determine the tradeoff point between preserving context and eliminating noise
- Evidence anchors:
  - "datasets exhibit an optimal summary length that leads to improved topic modeling performance"
  - "Longer documents tend to contain more diverse information, so shorter summaries can effectively distill the main points... In contrast, shorter documents may lack sufficient context, which is why longer summaries will help preserve subtleties"
- Break condition: If document characteristics differ significantly, a single optimal length may not generalize

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using LLM-generated summaries improves topic diversity compared to raw text
- Mechanism: Summaries condense varied content into more focused representations, reducing redundancy and enabling clustering algorithm to discover more distinct topics
- Core assumption: Summary generation process enhances topic separability in embedding space
- Evidence anchors:
  - "The diversity values produced using either of the summaries consistently outperform those obtained using the entire text"
  - "The BBC dataset... shows better results when shorter summaries are used. In contrast, the 20 Newsgroups dataset... performs better with longer summaries"
- Break condition: If summaries become too short or overly generic, diversity may drop due to loss of distinguishing detail

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Topic Modeling Basics (LDA, NMF, BERTopic)
  - Why needed here: Understanding how topic models work helps reason about how input preprocessing affects clustering and topic quality
  - Quick check question: What is the main difference between bag-of-words models like LDA and embedding-based models like BERTopic?

- Concept: Document Summarization with LLMs
  - Why needed here: Knowing how few-shot prompting and context window limits affect summary quality is crucial for applying this method correctly
  - Quick check question: Why did the authors truncate documents before summarization, and what problem does this solve?

- Concept: Evaluation Metrics (Coherence, Diversity)
  - Why needed here: These metrics are used to judge whether summarization improves or harms topic modeling outcomes
  - Quick check question: What does a higher topic diversity score indicate about the topics generated?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Document preprocessing → Truncation to fit LLM context window → LLM summarization (GPT-3.5-Turbo-Instruct) → Short (20-30 words) or Long (60-80 words) summaries → BERTopic embeddings → UMAP dimensionality reduction → HDBSCAN clustering → Class-based TF-IDF topic representation → Evaluation (Coherence C_V, Diversity metrics)

- Critical path:
  1. Input document → truncation → summary generation
  2. Summary → BERTopic embeddings → clustering → topic extraction
  3. Topic keywords → coherence and diversity calculation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Summary length vs. context preservation: Longer summaries retain more context but may introduce noise; shorter summaries reduce noise but may lose subtle themes
  - LLM choice vs. control: Closed-source models like GPT-3.5 offer strong performance but less transparency and potential context limits
  - Evaluation metrics: Coherence measures interpretability; diversity measures distinctness—improvements in one may not guarantee improvements in the other

- Failure signatures:
  - Low coherence despite high diversity → summaries may be too generic or omit important terms
  - No improvement over raw text → summaries may not effectively filter noise or preserve core themes
  - Crashes or poor results on short documents → summarization is ineffective or harmful when documents are already concise

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare topic diversity and coherence using raw text vs. short summaries on a small sample of BBC News documents
  2. Test different summary lengths (e.g., 15, 30, 60 words) on the 20 Newsgroups dataset to find the optimal length
  3. Evaluate the effect of truncation threshold on summary quality and topic modeling performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal summary length for different types of documents beyond news articles, such as scientific papers or social media posts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the optimal summary length may vary depending on the dataset and suggests testing a range of summary lengths on a sample of the dataset
- Why unresolved: The paper only tested on BBC News and 20 Newsgroups datasets, which are news-related
- What evidence would resolve it: Conduct experiments on diverse datasets from different domains (e.g., scientific papers, social media, legal documents)

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the quality of LLM-generated summaries affect the performance of topic modeling, and can this relationship be quantified?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges that the effectiveness of the proposed method heavily relies on the quality of the summaries generated by the LLM
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of how summary quality impacts topic modeling performance
- What evidence would resolve it: Develop metrics to evaluate summary quality and measure correlation with topic modeling performance

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the proposed summarization and topic modeling approach be adapted to handle datasets with very short documents, such as tweets, without losing effectiveness?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that the proposed approach is not suitable for datasets with very short documents, such as tweets
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore alternative methods for short documents
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiment with different summarization techniques or topic modeling algorithms that don't rely on summarization for short documents

## Limitations
- Optimal summary length findings are based on limited datasets and may not generalize to other domains
- Coherence improvements were mixed, with some configurations performing worse than raw text
- The approach is not suitable for very short documents like tweets where summarization is ineffective

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: LLM summarization can improve topic diversity in topic modeling
- **Medium confidence**: Optimal summary length varies by document length, with shorter summaries better for longer documents
- **Low confidence**: Summary length optimization generalizes across domains; coherence improvements are consistent

## Next Checks
1. Test the optimal summary length hypothesis on additional datasets with varied document characteristics to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing different summarization models (open vs. closed source) to isolate the contribution of model choice
3. Perform manual evaluation of summary quality and topic interpretability to validate whether quantitative improvements translate to meaningful topics
