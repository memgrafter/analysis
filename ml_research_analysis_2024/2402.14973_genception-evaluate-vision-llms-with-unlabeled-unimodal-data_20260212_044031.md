# GenCeption: Evaluate Vision LLMs with Unlabeled Unimodal Data

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2402.14973
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14973
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Annotation-free evaluation method for multimodal LLMs using only unimodal data, showing strong correlation with established benchmarks while avoiding training data contamination.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces GenCeption, a novel annotation-free method for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) using only unimodal data. Inspired by the DrawCeption game, GenCeption iteratively describes and regenerates non-textual samples to measure semantic drift across modalities via the GC@T metric. The authors implement this as MMECeption, a VLLM benchmark using MME images without QA annotations. Results show strong correlations with established benchmarks, with VLLMs lagging significantly behind human performance, especially on text-intensive tasks. The method avoids costly annotation, reduces training data contamination risk, and slows benchmark saturation while providing continuous, nuanced evaluation.

## Method Summary
GenCeption is an iterative evaluation procedure where multimodal LLMs describe images using limited tokens, image generation models create new images from these descriptions, and semantic similarity between original and generated images is measured across multiple iterations. The GC@T metric calculates semantic drift by computing cosine similarity (or FID) between image embeddings at each iteration, weighted by the iteration number. The authors apply this to create MMECeption, evaluating seven vision LLMs on MME images without their QA annotations, comparing performance against human baselines.

## Key Results
- VLLMs show significantly lower performance than humans on MMECeption, particularly on text-intensive tasks
- GC@T scores strongly correlate with established MME benchmark metrics across all iterations
- Weighted GC@T scores show progressive correlation improvement with more iterations, unlike unweighted scores
- Contemporary VLLMs excel at describing scenes and artworks but perform poorly on text-heavy tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: GenCeption reduces benchmark saturation by using unimodal data, preventing training data contamination.
- **Mechanism**: By evaluating MLLMs using only unimodal data, the risk of model exposure to benchmark samples during training is minimized. This ensures the model's performance reflects genuine understanding rather than memorization.
- **Core assumption**: The unimodal datasets used are not part of the MLLMs' training corpora.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "This approach eliminates the need for costly data annotation, minimizes the risk of training data contamination..."
  - [section]: "GenCeption addresses challenge (1) by relying on easily accessible unimodal datasets... addressing challenge (3) and (4), as it allows to easily use previously unseen datasets for MLLM evaluation..."
  - [corpus]: Weak. The corpus does not explicitly discuss data contamination or saturation, but the related paper "Both Text and Images Leaked!" suggests contamination is a recognized issue in MLLM evaluation.
- **Break condition**: If unimodal datasets are inadvertently included in the MLLMs' training data, the contamination risk remains, and saturation continues.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: GenCeption's continuous GC@T metric avoids the illusion of emergent abilities by providing nuanced performance evaluation.
- **Mechanism**: The GC@T metric uses a weighted average of cosine similarity (or FID) scores across iterations, allowing for a continuous and nuanced assessment of semantic drift. This avoids the binary pass/fail nature of discrete metrics, which can falsely suggest sudden improvements.
- **Core assumption**: Semantic drift captured by continuous metrics is a better indicator of true model performance than discrete accuracy scores.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "To tackle challenge (2), GenCeption uses the continuous GC@T metric, providing a more nuanced evaluation compared to discrete metrics, allowing for better projections of performance improvements and avoiding the mirage of emergent abilities."
  - [section]: "To quantify the overall speed and magnitude of semantic drift, we calculate the GenCeption score over T iterations, denoted as GC@T ∈ [−1.0, 1.0], as follows: GC@T := (PT t=1(t · s(t)))/(PT t=1 t)."
  - [corpus]: Weak. The corpus does not directly discuss continuous vs. discrete metrics, but the paper "Are Vision LLMs Road-Ready?" suggests the need for nuanced evaluation in specialized domains.
- **Break condition**: If the continuous metric does not correlate well with established benchmarks, its ability to avoid illusory emergent abilities is compromised.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: GenCeption evaluates a diverse range of MLLM abilities by requiring comprehensive image descriptions within token limits.
- **Mechanism**: The fixed textual prompt PDesc instructs the MLLM to provide detailed descriptions of images, forcing the model to reason about emotions, intentions, weather, object counting, and artistic styles. This diversity is measured through the iterative description and regeneration process.
- **Core assumption**: A limited token count forces the MLLM to prioritize and demonstrate a wide range of skills in its descriptions.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "Further, an MLLM's ability to provide complete yet concise descriptions of non-textual samples measures a diverse range of specialized abilities. For instance, to perform well at describing an image using a limited number of tokens, it is advantageous to be able to reason over people's emotions and intentions behind their actions, infer the current and preceding weather, count objects, and recognize artistic styles."
  - [section]: "While it may not be possible to preserve the initial information perfectly due to varying levels of richness, accuracy, and ambiguity in different modalities, a more capable MLLM will minimize the semantic drift from the original input."
  - [corpus]: Weak. The corpus does not explicitly discuss the diversity of abilities evaluated, but the paper "Code-Vision: Evaluating Multimodal LLMs Logic Understanding and Code Generation Capabilities" suggests the need for diverse benchmarks.
- **Break condition**: If the MLLM can provide adequate descriptions without genuinely understanding the image content (e.g., through memorization), the diversity of evaluated abilities is not truly assessed.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
  - **Why needed here**: Understanding the architecture and capabilities of MLLMs is crucial for grasping how GenCeption evaluates them. MLLMs integrate multiple modalities (e.g., text, images) and are the primary subject of the GenCeption evaluation method.
  - **Quick check question**: What are the key differences between unimodal and multimodal models, and how do MLLMs integrate different modalities?

- **Concept**: Image Generation and Embeddings
  - **Why needed here**: GenCeption relies on image generation models (e.g., DALL·E, Imagen) to regenerate images based on MLLM descriptions and embedding models (e.g., ViT) to quantify semantic similarity. Understanding these components is essential for implementing the GenCeption pipeline.
  - **Quick check question**: How do image generation models and embedding models work, and what are their roles in the GenCeption evaluation process?

- **Concept**: Evaluation Metrics (Cosine Similarity, FID)
  - **Why needed here**: GenCeption uses cosine similarity and FID to measure the semantic drift between the original and generated images. Understanding these metrics is crucial for interpreting the GC@T scores and assessing MLLM performance.
  - **Quick check question**: What is the difference between cosine similarity and FID, and how do they quantify semantic similarity between images?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input images -> MLLM description generator -> Image generator -> Embedding model -> Similarity calculator -> GC@T scores
- **Critical path**: The critical path involves the iterative loop of (1) MLLM description generation, (2) image regeneration, (3) embedding computation, and (4) similarity calculation. Any bottleneck in these steps will directly impact the evaluation process.
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - **Unimodal vs. Multimodal Data**: Using unimodal data reduces contamination risk but may not fully capture MLLM capabilities in integrated multimodal tasks.
  - **Cosine Similarity vs. FID**: Cosine similarity is faster but may not capture perceptual differences as well as FID, which is more computationally expensive.
  - **Token Limit**: A lower token limit forces concise descriptions but may restrict the MLLM's ability to express complex information.
- **Failure signatures**:
  - **High GC@T Scores with Low Qualitative Performance**: Indicates that the continuous metric may not correlate well with actual understanding.
  - **Instability Across Iterations**: Suggests that the MLLM's performance is inconsistent, potentially due to randomness in image generation or description.
  - **High Correlation with Hallucination Benchmarks**: May indicate that the metric is primarily capturing hallucination rather than semantic coherence.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Baseline Comparison**: Evaluate a simple baseline MLLM (e.g., LLaVA-7B) on a small subset of images and compare GC@T scores with established benchmarks (e.g., MME).
  2. **Human Performance Benchmark**: Have human annotators describe a subset of images and compute GC@T scores to establish an upper bound for MLLM performance.
  3. **Ablation Study on Image Generators**: Compare GC@1 scores using different image generators (e.g., DALL·E 3 vs. Imagen 2) to assess the impact of the generation model on the evaluation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: Can GenCeption be effectively adapted to evaluate MLLMs on non-visual modalities such as audio and video, and what challenges arise in developing modality-specific generation and embedding models?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors state "GenCeption is designed to be modality-agnostic" and "Future research is invited to adapt GenCeption to other non-text modalities, such as audio, video, and graphs."
- **Why unresolved**: The paper focuses on visual modalities due to their maturity and availability of tools. Adapting GenCeption to other modalities requires careful exploration of generation and embedding models, which hasn't been tested.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Successful application of GenCeption to audio/video datasets with comparable correlation to established benchmarks as seen in the visual domain, along with analysis of modality-specific challenges and solutions.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: How does the temporal weighting in the GC@T metric affect the evaluation of MLLM performance, and is there an optimal weighting scheme that better captures semantic drift across iterations?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors conduct an ablation study removing temporal weighting, finding "unweighted scores correlate with MME in a uniform manner across different iterations, whereas the weighted scores show a progressive increase in correlation with MME as more iterations are applied."
- **Why unresolved**: While the study shows weighted scores better align with MME, the optimal weighting scheme remains unexplored. The choice of weighting by iteration number (t) may not be optimal for all types of MLLMs or datasets.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Systematic comparison of different weighting schemes (e.g., exponential, logarithmic, or learned weights) against benchmark performance, identifying configurations that maximize correlation with established evaluation metrics.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: What specific skills contribute most to high GC@T scores, and can datasets be designed to isolate and evaluate these skills more granularly than the current MMECeption benchmark allows?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The authors note that "contemporary VLLMs perform poorly on text-intensive tasks while excelling in describing scenes and artworks" and suggest future research could "investigate this in a more fine-grained manner by creating datasets requiring specialized skills."
- **Why unresolved**: The current benchmark provides a broad assessment but lacks granularity in identifying which specific abilities drive performance differences. The paper acknowledges this limitation but doesn't propose concrete solutions.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Creation and evaluation of specialized datasets targeting specific skills (e.g., emotion recognition, complex reasoning, technical understanding) with analysis showing which skills most strongly correlate with overall GC@T performance across different MLLM architectures.

## Limitations

- The paper cannot empirically verify that unimodal datasets remain uncontaminated by MLLM training data without access to model training corpora
- The claim that continuous metrics better capture emergent abilities than discrete metrics lacks direct comparison studies within the paper
- The diversity of abilities assessment relies on assumptions about token limits forcing comprehensive descriptions that aren't empirically validated

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core mechanism of iterative description-generation cycles for evaluation is technically sound and well-implemented
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim about avoiding training data contamination through unimodal data usage is reasonable but unverified
- **Medium Confidence**: The correlation with established benchmarks suggests validity, but causation versus correlation requires further investigation

## Next Checks

1. **Contamination Audit**: Cross-reference the unimodal datasets used against known MLLM training corpora to verify the contamination risk reduction claim
2. **Human Baseline Replication**: Replicate the human performance benchmark on a subset of images to validate the claimed performance gap between humans and VLLMs
3. **Continuous vs Discrete Metric Comparison**: Conduct a controlled experiment comparing GC@T scores against established discrete metrics on the same tasks to verify claims about avoiding illusory emergent abilities
