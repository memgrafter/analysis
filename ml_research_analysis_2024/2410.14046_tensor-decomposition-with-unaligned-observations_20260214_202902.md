core_contribution: This paper introduces a framework for tensor decomposition that
  handles tensors with a mode containing unaligned observations (a functional mode)
  by decomposing them into a sum of rank-one tensors. The unaligned mode is represented

# Tensor Decomposition with Unaligned Observations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.14046
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14046
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Framework for tensor decomposition with unaligned observations using RKHS functions

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel framework for tensor decomposition that handles tensors containing unaligned observations in one mode, referred to as the functional mode. The key innovation is representing this functional mode using functions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), allowing for flexible and robust data representation. The approach decomposes tensors into sums of rank-one tensors while accommodating various data types through a versatile loss function. The authors propose three main algorithms: RKHS-TD, GRKHS-TD, and S-GRKHS-TD, along with a sketching algorithm S-RKHS-TD for specific loss functions. The framework demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods in both simulations and real-world applications, particularly for clustering tasks.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework extends traditional tensor decomposition by incorporating unaligned observations through functional representation in RKHS. The core approach decomposes a tensor into a sum of rank-one tensors where one mode (the functional mode) is represented by RKHS functions rather than discrete indices. This allows handling data where observations in one dimension are not aligned across samples. The authors develop multiple algorithms to compute these decompositions: RKHS-TD for standard cases, GRKHS-TD for generalized scenarios, and S-GRKHS-TD using stochastic gradient methods for improved computational efficiency. For specific cases using ℓ2 loss, they introduce S-RKHS-TD, a sketching algorithm that further enhances efficiency. The framework accommodates various data types including binary, integer-valued, and positive-valued data through a flexible loss function design.

## Key Results
- S-RKHS-TD achieves the same level of fit as RKHS-TD with significantly reduced computational time
- Proposed algorithms demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods in clustering tasks
- The framework effectively handles various data types including binary, integer-valued, and positive-valued data
- Real-world data applications show improved performance over traditional tensor decomposition approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging the mathematical properties of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces to represent unaligned observations in a continuous functional space rather than discrete indices. This allows the tensor decomposition to naturally handle data where observations in one mode are not aligned across samples. The RKHS representation provides a flexible basis for capturing complex patterns in the functional mode while maintaining the interpretability and computational advantages of tensor decomposition. By decomposing into rank-one tensors with RKHS functions in one mode, the framework can effectively model interactions between aligned and unaligned dimensions.

## Foundational Learning

**Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS)**: A Hilbert space of functions where point evaluation is a continuous linear functional, enabling function representation through kernel evaluations. Needed to provide a flexible mathematical framework for representing the unaligned mode as continuous functions. Quick check: Verify that the chosen kernel satisfies the reproducing property and positive definiteness.

**Tensor Decomposition**: Factorizing a tensor into a sum of rank-one tensors (outer products of vectors). Needed as the fundamental structure for capturing multi-way interactions in the data. Quick check: Ensure the rank-1 tensor representation correctly captures the intended interactions between modes.

**Functional Mode**: The mode in the tensor that contains unaligned observations, represented through functions rather than discrete indices. Needed to handle real-world data where observations are not perfectly aligned across samples. Quick check: Confirm that the functional representation correctly handles the misalignment in the data.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Tensor -> (RKHS-TD/GRKHS-TD/S-GRKHS-TD) -> Rank-One Tensor Decomposition with RKHS Functions

**Critical Path**: Input tensor → Loss function evaluation → Gradient computation → Parameter update (for iterative algorithms) → Convergence check → Output decomposition

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational complexity for flexibility in handling unaligned data. While traditional tensor decomposition methods are computationally efficient, they cannot handle unaligned observations. The RKHS approach adds computational overhead but provides the flexibility needed for real-world data. The choice between deterministic algorithms (RKHS-TD) and stochastic variants (S-GRKHS-TD) involves a tradeoff between accuracy and computational efficiency.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance may occur when: the kernel choice is inappropriate for the data structure, the rank is misspecified, or the functional mode does not actually contain meaningful unaligned information. Convergence issues may arise if the loss landscape is highly non-convex or if regularization parameters are poorly chosen.

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify the framework on synthetic data with known unaligned structure to confirm correctness
2. Compare computational time between RKHS-TD and S-RKHS-TD on medium-sized datasets
3. Test sensitivity to kernel choice and regularization parameters on a simple benchmark dataset
