# Nuance Matters: Probing Epistemic Consistency in Causal Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.00103
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00103
- Authors: Shaobo Cui; Junyou Li; Luca Mouchel; Yiyang Feng; Boi Faltings

- Primary result: Current LLMs struggle to maintain epistemic consistency in identifying the polarity and intensity of causal intermediates

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the concept of causal epistemic consistency, which measures LLMs' ability to self-consistently differentiate and rank fine-grained causal intermediates. The authors propose three novel metrics to evaluate 21 high-profile LLMs on their consistency in distinguishing supporters and defeaters in causal reasoning. Extensive experiments reveal that even advanced models like GPT-4 perform unsatisfactorily in maintaining this consistency, with larger models showing modest improvements. The paper also explores using internal token probabilities as an alternative ranking method, finding that coordinating conjunctions yield better results than subordinating conjunctions for maintaining causal epistemic consistency.

## Method Summary
The authors construct the δ-CAUSAL dataset from multiple sources containing cause-effect pairs with annotated supporting and defeating intermediates. They evaluate 21 LLMs using a three-phase pipeline: generating fine-grained intermediates (supporters and defeaters with varying intensities), ranking these intermediates by causal influence, and comparing generation and ranking orders using three consistency metrics. The study also explores using internal token probabilities as an auxiliary tool, calculating conditional probabilities to estimate causal strength and re-rank intermediates. Models are tested across different scales (2B, 7B, 13B, 70B) to examine the relationship between model size and causal epistemic consistency.

## Key Results
- Current LLMs struggle to maintain causal epistemic consistency, with even GPT-4 performing unsatisfactorily
- Larger model scales generally improve causal epistemic consistency, but the effect is modest
- Internal token probabilities show promise as an auxiliary tool, with coordinating conjunctions ("so") performing better than subordinating conjunctions ("because") for ranking consistency
- All three proposed metrics (intensity ranking concordance, cross-group position agreement, and intra-group clustering) reveal consistent patterns of LLM limitations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Causal epistemic consistency measures whether LLMs self-consistently rank the fine-grained intermediates they generate.
- Mechanism: The paper introduces three metrics—intensity ranking concordance, cross-group position agreement, and intra-group clustering—to evaluate consistency between generation and ranking phases.
- Core assumption: Consistency between generation and ranking phases reflects the model's true understanding of causal intensity and polarity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "propose a suite of novel metrics -- intensity ranking concordance, cross-group position agreement, and intra-group clustering"
  - [section] "we propose the concept of 'causal epistemic consistency': Causal epistemic consistency refers to an LLM's ability to maintain self-consistency in differentiating its generated intermediates"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence: No directly relevant papers in corpus neighbors discuss self-consistency between generation and ranking phases
- Break condition: If the model generates and ranks intermediates independently without sharing internal state, consistency metrics may not reflect true causal understanding.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Internal token probability can serve as an alternative to prompting for maintaining causal epistemic consistency.
- Mechanism: The paper explores using conditional token probabilities (e.g., p(Ei|C ⊕ Ij, w, E<i)) to estimate causal strength and rank intermediates instead of relying on model generation/ranking prompts.
- Core assumption: Token probabilities capture the model's implicit causal judgments better than explicit prompting.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we explore the potential of using internal token probabilities as an auxiliary tool to maintain causal epistemic consistency"
  - [section] "Internal token probability has proven to be a reliable indicator for sequence correlation estimation"
  - [corpus] Moderate evidence: "Bridging Internal Probability and Self-Consistency for Effective and Efficient LLM Reasoning" discusses similar concepts
- Break condition: If token probabilities are not available for closed-source models or if they don't capture causal relationships well, this approach fails.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Larger model scales generally improve causal epistemic consistency.
- Mechanism: The paper tests multiple model sizes (2B, 7B, 13B, 70B) and finds that larger models show better consistency scores.
- Core assumption: Model scale correlates with better causal understanding and self-consistency.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "we investigate whether increasing the model scale improves the causal epistemic consistency of LLMs" and "we clearly observe that an increase in model size generally enhances causal epistemic consistency"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence: No directly relevant papers in corpus neighbors discuss causal epistemic consistency scaling
- Break condition: If certain architectural features matter more than scale, or if scaling hits diminishing returns for causal reasoning, this mechanism breaks.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Causal reasoning and defeasibility
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates how well LLMs handle nuanced causal intermediates that can support or defeat causal relationships
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between a "supporter" and a "defeater" in causal reasoning?

- Concept: Self-consistency in language models
  - Why needed here: The paper's core contribution is measuring how consistently LLMs rank the intermediates they generate
  - Quick check question: What does it mean for a model to be "self-consistent" in its outputs?

- Concept: Token probability and causal strength estimation
  - Why needed here: The paper explores using internal token probabilities as an alternative ranking method
  - Quick check question: How can conditional token probabilities be used to estimate causal strength between events?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: δ-CAUSAL dataset -> 21 LLMs (open and closed-source) -> Three metrics (τ-A, τ-D, τ-all, CGP, IGC) -> Probability module (conditional token likelihoods)

- Critical path:
  1. Generate fine-grained intermediates (supporters and defeaters with varying intensities)
  2. Rank generated intermediates based on causal influence
  3. Compare ranking order with generation order using consistency metrics
  4. (Optional) Calculate causal strength using token probabilities and re-rank

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Prompt complexity vs. output quality: Pairwise generation prompts produce cleaner outputs than direct 10-argument generation
  - Model access vs. evaluation completeness: Closed-source models limit probability-based analysis
  - Metric comprehensiveness vs. computational cost: Multiple metrics provide nuanced evaluation but increase computation time

- Failure signatures:
  - Low τ-all scores indicate poor intensity ranking concordance across all intermediates
  - Low CGP scores suggest confusion between supporters and defeaters
  - Low IGC scores reveal poor clustering of intermediates by polarity
  - Inconsistent results across conjunction words indicate token probability method instability

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run a single cause-effect pair through the pipeline with one LLM to verify all components work
  2. Compare consistency metrics across two different model sizes to validate scaling effects
  3. Test all conjunction words (so, because, since, as, therefore, thus, hence) on one model to verify probability-based ranking differences

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can LLMs be trained or fine-tuned to improve their causal epistemic consistency, particularly in maintaining intensity rankings of fine-grained intermediates?
- Basis in paper: The paper demonstrates that current LLMs struggle to maintain causal epistemic consistency, especially in intensity ranking concordance, despite their varying architectures and scales.
- Why unresolved: The paper evaluates existing LLMs without exploring training or fine-tuning methods to enhance their causal epistemic consistency. It remains unclear whether targeted training could improve their ability to differentiate and rank intermediates based on intensity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the causal epistemic consistency of LLMs before and after targeted training or fine-tuning on causal reasoning tasks, particularly focusing on intensity ranking.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do different architectural choices (e.g., attention mechanisms, activation functions) in LLMs affect their ability to maintain causal epistemic consistency?
- Basis in paper: The paper evaluates a wide range of LLMs, including closed-source and open-source models, but does not delve into the impact of specific architectural choices on causal epistemic consistency.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on model performance rather than architectural analysis, leaving open the question of which architectural elements contribute to better or worse causal epistemic consistency.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of LLMs with different architectural designs, isolating the effects of specific components on causal epistemic consistency metrics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can internal token probabilities be effectively integrated into the prompting process to enhance LLMs' causal epistemic consistency?
- Basis in paper: The paper explores the potential of using internal token probabilities as an auxiliary tool for maintaining causal epistemic consistency, finding that certain conjunction words yield better results than others.
- Why unresolved: While the paper investigates the use of internal token probabilities, it does not fully explore their integration into the prompting process or their potential to systematically improve causal epistemic consistency.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments that systematically combine internal token probabilities with prompting strategies, measuring the impact on causal epistemic consistency across various LLMs and tasks.

## Limitations

- Evaluation scope: The paper focuses on 21 high-profile LLMs, but the selection may not be representative of the broader LLM landscape
- Dataset specificity: The δ-CAUSAL dataset may contain inherent biases in its cause-effect pairs and intermediate annotations
- Probability-based approach constraints: Internal token probability method is only applicable to open-source models, creating an evaluation gap for closed-source models like GPT-4

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The core finding that LLMs struggle with causal epistemic consistency is well-supported by multiple metrics across different model scales and architectures.

**Medium confidence**: The scaling effect showing larger models perform better has moderate support but requires more systematic analysis across model families.

**Low confidence**: The specific claim that token probability-based ranking is a reliable auxiliary tool needs more validation, particularly given the limited applicability to closed-source models.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-linguistic validation**: Test the causal epistemic consistency framework on non-English causal reasoning datasets to evaluate whether the observed LLM limitations are language-specific or universal.

2. **Ablation study on prompt design**: Systematically vary prompt complexity (pairwise vs. multi-argument generation) and observe the impact on both intermediate quality and consistency metrics to determine optimal prompting strategies.

3. **Correlation analysis with external metrics**: Compare causal epistemic consistency scores with established causal reasoning benchmarks and human evaluation to establish whether consistency correlates with actual causal understanding quality.
