# Bayesian identification of nonseparable Hamiltonians with multiplicative noise using deep learning and reduced-order modeling

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2401.12476
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12476
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Bayesian framework for learning nonseparable Hamiltonian systems with multiplicative noise using deep learning and reduced-order modeling, showing up to 724× improvement in Hamiltonian MSE with noisy training data

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a Bayesian framework for learning nonseparable Hamiltonian systems subject to multiplicative noise using deep learning and reduced-order modeling techniques. The approach addresses two key challenges: developing a Gaussian filter for statistically-dependent vector-valued additive and multiplicative noise models, and creating an efficient algorithm for high-dimensional systems. The method is validated on canonical nonseparable Hamiltonian models and a chaotic double pendulum, demonstrating significant improvements in parameter estimation accuracy when training data contains noise. Additionally, the framework is applied to a 64-dimensional spatially-discretized nonlinear Schrödinger equation, successfully estimating parameters within an 8-dimensional reduced space despite 20% multiplicative noise corruption.

## Method Summary
The framework combines deep learning with Bayesian inference to learn nonseparable Hamiltonian systems with both additive and multiplicative noise. It develops a Gaussian filter specifically designed for vector-valued noise processes that are statistically dependent, enabling proper uncertainty quantification. The approach leverages reduced-order modeling to project high-dimensional systems onto lower-dimensional spaces, improving computational efficiency. A novel training objective based on Hamiltonian mean squared error is employed, which shows superior performance compared to standard objectives when dealing with noisy training data. The method is demonstrated through numerical experiments on canonical models and a spatially-discretized nonlinear Schrödinger equation.

## Key Results
- Demonstrated up to 724× improvement in Hamiltonian mean squared error compared to standard training objectives when using noisy training data
- Successfully applied to a 64-dimensional spatially-discretized nonlinear Schrödinger equation, estimating parameters within an 8-dimensional reduced space
- Showed robust performance with data corrupted by up to 20% multiplicative noise

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its comprehensive treatment of both additive and multiplicative noise within a Bayesian framework. By developing a Gaussian filter specifically for statistically-dependent vector-valued noise processes, the method properly accounts for the correlation structure in the noise, leading to more accurate uncertainty quantification. The integration of reduced-order modeling allows the approach to scale to high-dimensional systems by projecting them onto lower-dimensional spaces where learning becomes computationally tractable. The use of Hamiltonian mean squared error as a training objective directly targets the preservation of the underlying geometric structure, which is crucial for physical systems.

## Foundational Learning

**Hamiltonian Mechanics**: Why needed - Provides the geometric structure that must be preserved in the learned model. Quick check - Verify the learned model conserves the Hamiltonian along trajectories.

**Bayesian Inference**: Why needed - Enables uncertainty quantification in parameter estimates. Quick check - Examine posterior distributions for parameters to ensure reasonable uncertainty estimates.

**Gaussian Filtering**: Why needed - Handles the propagation of uncertainty through the dynamical system. Quick check - Validate filter performance on benchmark problems with known noise characteristics.

**Reduced-Order Modeling**: Why needed - Enables computational tractability for high-dimensional systems. Quick check - Compare learned dynamics in reduced space against full-dimensional ground truth.

**Deep Learning for Dynamical Systems**: Why needed - Provides flexible function approximation for complex Hamiltonian structures. Quick check - Test network architecture on synthetic Hamiltonian data with varying complexity.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data → Gaussian Filter → Reduced-Order Projection → Deep Learning Network → Parameter Estimation → Hamiltonian Validation

**Critical Path**: The Gaussian filter processes noisy observations, which are then projected to a reduced space. The deep learning network learns the reduced Hamiltonian dynamics, and parameters are estimated through Bayesian inference. The learned model is validated by checking Hamiltonian conservation.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The reduced-order modeling approach trades off some representational accuracy for computational efficiency, which may limit applicability to systems that cannot be effectively projected to lower dimensions. The Gaussian filter assumes specific noise structures that may not generalize to all Hamiltonian systems.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor Hamiltonian conservation indicates inadequate learning of the geometric structure. Failure to converge in high-dimensional spaces suggests the reduced-order projection is insufficient. Overly wide posterior distributions may indicate the noise model is not capturing the true uncertainty structure.

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Test the Gaussian filter on a simple linear system with known additive and multiplicative noise to verify uncertainty propagation.
2. Validate the reduced-order modeling approach on a 2D Hamiltonian system by comparing learned dynamics in reduced space against full-dimensional ground truth.
3. Apply the framework to a synthetic nonseparable Hamiltonian with controlled noise injection to assess parameter estimation accuracy across varying noise levels.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Computational efficiency gains rely on specific assumptions about noise structure and may not generalize to all Hamiltonian systems
- Performance improvements demonstrated on simple canonical models may not scale linearly to more complex physical systems
- Reduced-order modeling assumes underlying dynamics can be well-represented in lower dimensions, which may not hold for all Hamiltonian systems

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The theoretical framework for Gaussian filtering with mixed additive and multiplicative noise is sound and mathematically rigorous.

**Medium confidence**: The computational efficiency gains and numerical performance improvements are well-demonstrated but may depend on specific problem characteristics.

**Medium confidence**: The reduced-order modeling approach shows promise but may have limited applicability for systems that cannot be effectively projected to lower dimensions.

## Next Checks

1. Test the framework on a larger class of Hamiltonian systems with varying degrees of nonseparability and compare computational scaling with system dimension.

2. Conduct sensitivity analysis to quantify how the relative contributions of additive versus multiplicative noise affect parameter estimation accuracy and uncertainty quantification.

3. Validate the approach on experimental data from a physical system (e.g., laboratory double pendulum or fluid dynamics setup) with controlled noise injection to assess real-world applicability.
