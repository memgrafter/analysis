- One-line primary result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with only 0.1K parameters by combining time and frequency domain feature extraction

## Executive Summary
MixLinear is an ultra-lightweight model for long-term multivariate time series forecasting designed for resource-constrained devices. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with only 0.1K parameters by capturing temporal and frequency domain features from both domains. The model segments trend components in the time domain to model intra-segment and inter-segment variations, while extracting frequency features from a low-dimensional latent space. Evaluation on four benchmark datasets shows MixLinear delivers top-tier performance, achieving up to 5.3% MSE reduction compared to baseline models while requiring significantly fewer parameters (195 vs. 6M+ for transformer models). The model is particularly effective in high-channel scenarios and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities across different datasets.

## Method Summary
MixLinear combines time domain segmentation and frequency domain transformation using two linear layers for time domain and two complex-valued linear layers for frequency domain. The model extracts trend components through aggregation and downsampling with period w, segments trends into √n × √n matrices, and applies FFT-based frequency domain transformation with low-pass filtering. Training uses Adam optimizer with learning rate 0.02 for 30 epochs with early stopping (patience 10), using batch sizes 256 for <100 channels and 128 for <300 channels.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with only 195 parameters compared to 6M+ for transformer models
- Delivers up to 5.3% MSE reduction compared to baseline models on benchmark datasets
- Particularly effective in high-channel scenarios (e.g., 370 channels) where traditional models struggle

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: MixLinear achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with only 0.1K parameters by combining time and frequency domain feature extraction while reducing parameter complexity.
- Mechanism: The model captures intra-segment and inter-segment variations in the time domain by splitting trend components into smaller segments, and extracts frequency features from a low-dimensional latent space in the frequency domain.
- Core assumption: Decomposing time series into trend components and processing them in both time and frequency domains allows for efficient feature extraction without sacrificing accuracy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "MixLinear effectively captures both temporal and frequency domain features by modeling intra-segment and inter-segment variations in the time domain and extracting frequency variations from a low-dimensional latent space in the frequency domain."
  - [section] "Unlike the existing linear models that apply pointwise transformations, our Time Domain Transformation captures inter-segment and intra-segment dependencies by splitting the decoupled time series (trend) into segments."
  - [corpus] Weak - No direct corpus evidence of similar dual-domain approaches with this specific parameter reduction.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The trend segmentation in the time domain significantly reduces model complexity from O(n²) to O(n).
- Mechanism: By dividing trend components into √n segments and applying linear transformations to capture both intra-segment and inter-segment dependencies, the parameter requirement is reduced from n × m to 2 × √n × √m.
- Core assumption: Segmenting trend components into smaller pieces allows for more efficient modeling of dependencies compared to pointwise transformations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "By reducing the parameter scale of a downsampled n-length input/output one-layer linear model from O(n2) to O(n), MixLinear achieves efficient computation without sacrificing accuracy."
  - [section] "Leveraging Segment Transformation, MixLinear reduces the model complexity from n × m to 2 × √n × √m. When m = n, this method offers a significant reduction in complexity (from O(n2) to O(n))."
  - [corpus] Weak - No direct corpus evidence of this specific segment-based approach for parameter reduction.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Frequency domain transformation in MixLinear focuses on trend components in a lower-dimensional latent space, reducing model complexity while learning frequency variations effectively.
- Mechanism: The model applies FFT to trend components, uses a low-pass filter to remove high-frequency noise, and compresses the filtered spectral representation into a lower-dimensional latent space before reconstruction.
- Core assumption: Trend components contain the most important information for forecasting, and processing them in a lower-dimensional frequency space is sufficient for accurate predictions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "In the frequency domain, it captures frequency domain variations by mapping the decoupled time series subsequences (trend) into a latent frequency space and reconstructing the trend spectrum."
  - [section] "Unlike FITS, MixLinear applies frequency domain transformation to downsampled time series subsequences (trend) and learns the frequency feature from latent space which focuses on the important bits of the data and trains in a lower dimensional, computationally much more efficient space."
  - [corpus] Weak - No direct corpus evidence of this specific approach to frequency domain transformation.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Time series decomposition into trend and periodic components
  - Why needed here: MixLinear relies on separating trend and periodic components to apply different transformations in each domain
  - Quick check question: How would you decompose a time series with both trend and seasonality into its components?

- Concept: Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and frequency domain analysis
  - Why needed here: MixLinear uses FFT to convert trend components into the frequency domain for feature extraction
  - Quick check question: What information does the FFT provide about a time series signal?

- Concept: Low-pass filtering and spectral compression
  - Why needed here: MixLinear applies a low-pass filter to remove noise and compresses the filtered spectral representation into a lower-dimensional latent space
  - Quick check question: How does a low-pass filter help in noise reduction and why would you compress spectral data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Trend Segmentation -> Segment Transformation -> Frequency Domain Transformation -> Combination -> Output
- Critical path: Trend Segmentation → Segment Transformation → Frequency Domain Transformation → Combination → Output
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Segment length √n vs. parameter count: Shorter segments reduce parameters but may miss long-range dependencies
  - Low-pass filter cutoff frequency vs. model complexity: Lower cutoff reduces parameters but may lose important information
  - Latent space dimension vs. reconstruction accuracy: Smaller dimensions reduce parameters but may not capture all frequency features
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor forecasting accuracy: Check if trend segmentation is appropriate for the data periodicity
  - High parameter count: Verify that segment length and latent space dimension are optimized
  - Overfitting: Check if the model is too complex for the dataset size
  - Underfitting: Verify that the trend components capture sufficient information
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Vary the trend segmentation segment length (e.g., √n, 2√n, √n/2) and measure parameter count and accuracy
  2. Test different low-pass filter cutoff frequencies to find the optimal balance between complexity and accuracy
  3. Compare the performance of MixLinear with and without frequency domain transformation on datasets with varying numbers of channels

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does MixLinear's performance scale with increasing forecast horizons beyond 720?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper tests horizons up to 720 but does not explore longer horizons.
- Why unresolved: The paper only reports results up to 720 horizons, leaving longer-term performance unexamined.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing MSE trends for horizons significantly longer than 720, particularly in resource-constrained settings.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal LPF cutoff frequency for different types of time series data beyond the tested datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that LPF cutoff frequency affects performance and suggests adaptive filtering may be needed.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests a limited range of cutoff frequencies (1-19) on specific datasets without exploring cross-dataset optimization.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study mapping optimal LPF frequencies across diverse time series types and characteristics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does MixLinear perform in multivariate time series with highly correlated channels?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper tests datasets with varying channel counts but doesn't specifically examine channel correlation effects.
- Why unresolved: The experiments use datasets with fixed channel counts but don't analyze how channel correlation impacts performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled channel correlation levels, showing performance degradation or improvement patterns.
