- One-line primary result: First comprehensive survey systematically categorizing 37 commonsense causality benchmarks and reviewing acquisition methods and reasoning approaches

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of commonsense causality, addressing a critical gap in organizing the rapidly growing body of research in this field. The survey systematically categorizes 37 existing benchmarks based on commonsense types (physical, social, biological, temporal) and uncertainty levels (first-principle vs. empirical causality). It reviews three main approaches to acquiring benchmarks—extractive, generative, and manual annotation—comparing their relative strengths and weaknesses. For reasoning, the paper distinguishes between qualitative approaches that simplify causal reasoning as classification tasks and quantitative approaches that measure causal strength probabilistically, providing a complete roadmap for advancing commonsense causality research in the era of large language models.

## Method Summary
The paper employs a systematic review methodology, analyzing over 200 representative articles to construct comprehensive taxonomies and frameworks. The authors developed a multi-dimensional classification system for benchmarks based on commonsense types and uncertainty levels, conducted detailed comparisons of acquisition methods through literature analysis, and categorized reasoning approaches based on their treatment of uncertainty. The survey synthesizes findings across multiple domains including physical, social, biological, and temporal causality, providing structured tables and taxonomies to organize the research landscape.

## Key Results
- Systematic categorization of 37 existing commonsense causality benchmarks based on commonsense types and uncertainty levels
- Comprehensive comparison of three benchmark acquisition methods (extractive, generative, manual annotation) with detailed pros and cons
- Clear distinction between qualitative reasoning approaches (classification-based) and quantitative approaches (probabilistic causal strength measurement)
- Identification of five key future research directions including contextual nuances, complex structures, temporal dynamics, probabilistic perspectives, and multimodal approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Comprehensive taxonomy of commonsense causality improves research organization and progress tracking
- Mechanism: The paper systematically categorizes 37 existing benchmarks based on commonsense types (physical, social, biological, temporal) and uncertainty levels (first-principle vs empirical causality). This structured classification enables researchers to identify gaps, compare methodologies, and build upon existing work systematically.
- Core assumption: A well-defined taxonomy with clear criteria provides meaningful organization that enhances research efficiency
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our comprehensive survey bridges this gap by focusing on taxonomies, benchmarks, acquisition methods, qualitative reasoning, and quantitative measurements in commonsense causality"
  - [section] "Leveraging this taxonomy, we methodically categorize 37 existing benchmarks to provide a structured overview"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence, but the paper's systematic approach to organizing over 200 representative articles supports this claim
- Break condition: If the taxonomy categories overlap significantly or fail to capture important distinctions in causality research, the organizational benefit diminishes

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multiple acquisition methods (extractive, generative, manual annotation) provide complementary strengths for benchmark collection
- Mechanism: Each acquisition method addresses different aspects of benchmark quality - extractive methods offer scalability, generative methods provide flexibility, and manual annotation ensures high quality. Together they create a comprehensive ecosystem for gathering diverse causality data.
- Core assumption: Different acquisition methods have complementary strengths and weaknesses that can be strategically combined
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we discuss three main approaches to acquiring benchmarks conducive to commonsense causality research: extractive (§ 3.1), generative (§ 3.2), and manual annotation methods (§ 3.3)"
  - [section] "We systematically compare the merits and demerits of these three approaches, providing insights for future work on commonsense causality acquisition"
  - [corpus] Moderate - the paper provides detailed comparison in Table 3 showing relative strengths of each method
- Break condition: If one method becomes overwhelmingly superior (e.g., generative methods reach perfect quality and scalability), the need for complementary approaches reduces

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Distinguishing qualitative and quantitative reasoning approaches addresses different aspects of uncertainty in causality
- Mechanism: Qualitative approaches simplify causal reasoning as classification tasks to bypass uncertainty, while quantitative approaches measure causal strength probabilistically to quantify uncertainty. This dual approach allows researchers to choose methods appropriate for their specific uncertainty tolerance and research goals.
- Core assumption: Different research contexts require different strategies for handling uncertainty - some need precise measurements while others need simpler binary classifications
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The first type is qualitative approaches (§ 4.1), which simplify causal reasoning as a classification task and bypass the uncertainty. The second type is quantitative approaches (§ 4.2), which employ metrics to measure causal strength, thereby quantifying the uncertainty"
  - [section] "This classification not only aids in understanding the diverse methodologies but also highlights the varied strategies employed to tackle uncertainty in commonsense causality reasoning"
  - [corpus] Moderate - the paper provides detailed comparison in Table 5 showing relative merits of each approach
- Break condition: If uncertainty quantification becomes trivial (e.g., through perfect probabilistic models), the distinction between qualitative and quantitative approaches may become less relevant

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Taxonomy-based organization of research domains
  - Why needed here: The paper's systematic classification of benchmarks and methods relies on understanding how taxonomies create research frameworks
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how categorizing causality by commonsense type (physical, social, biological, temporal) helps identify research gaps?

- Concept: Multiple methods for knowledge acquisition and their tradeoffs
  - Why needed here: Understanding the strengths and limitations of extractive, generative, and manual annotation methods is crucial for benchmark collection
  - Quick check question: What are the key advantages of manual annotation over extractive methods for commonsense causality benchmarks?

- Concept: Uncertainty quantification in causal reasoning
  - Why needed here: The paper's distinction between qualitative and quantitative approaches to uncertainty requires understanding how uncertainty manifests in causal relationships
  - Quick check question: How does the probabilistic approach to causal strength measurement differ from the classification-based approach?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: The paper's architecture follows a logical progression from taxonomy → benchmarks → acquisition methods → reasoning approaches → future directions. Each section builds upon the previous one, creating a comprehensive framework for commonsense causality research.

- Critical path: The most critical path for understanding the paper is: Taxonomy (Section 2) → Benchmarks (Table 1) → Acquisition Methods (Section 3) → Reasoning Approaches (Section 4). This sequence provides the foundational knowledge needed to understand the research landscape.

- Design tradeoffs: The paper balances breadth (covering over 200 articles) with depth (detailed analysis of specific methods). This tradeoff means some topics receive less detailed treatment than others, but provides comprehensive coverage of the field.

- Failure signatures: If a researcher struggles with this paper, common failure points include: misunderstanding the taxonomy categories, confusing the different acquisition methods, or not grasping the qualitative vs quantitative distinction in reasoning approaches.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Create a simple taxonomy of commonsense causality using the paper's criteria (commonsense types and uncertainty levels) and classify 5-10 existing benchmarks
  2. Compare two acquisition methods (e.g., extractive vs manual annotation) on a small dataset to understand their relative strengths and weaknesses
  3. Implement both a qualitative (classification-based) and quantitative (probabilistic strength measurement) approach to a simple causal reasoning task to experience the tradeoff between simplicity and precision

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we effectively model contextual nuances in commonsense causality when the set of all potential contexts B is unknown and potentially infinite?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses contextual nuances in commonsense causality and presents Dupré's contextual-unanimity causality formula P(E|C, B) > P(E|¬C, B) × P(B), noting that this formula contains several quantities that are difficult to obtain in practice.
- Why unresolved: The formula requires knowing the complete set of contexts B and their probabilities P(B), which is practically impossible given the infinite and unknown nature of real-world contexts. The paper acknowledges this difficulty but doesn't provide a concrete solution.
- What evidence would resolve it: A practical algorithm or framework that can identify a minimal yet comprehensive set of relevant contexts B' and accurately estimate P(B') for commonsense causality reasoning, validated on multiple benchmark datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between model complexity and explanatory power when using partial contextual models for commonsense causality?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper proposes partial contextual models as an alternative to accounting for all possible contexts, formulating it as an optimization problem to find an optimal B' that balances accuracy and simplicity.
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides the optimization framework, it doesn't specify how to determine the regularization parameter λ or how to evaluate the trade-off between model complexity and explanatory power in practice.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing different values of λ and their impact on causality prediction accuracy across multiple commonsense causality datasets, along with guidelines for setting λ based on dataset characteristics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we effectively measure and compare causal strength across different cause-effect pairs when dealing with linguistic variability and vast solution spaces for ¬C?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the challenges of quantitative causal reasoning, specifically noting that accurately estimating conditional probabilities P(E|C) and P(E|¬C) is difficult due to linguistic variability, and the solution space for ¬C is vast and cannot be exhaustively explored.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges these fundamental challenges in probabilistic causal measurement but doesn't propose concrete solutions for handling the infinite possibilities of ¬C or the linguistic variations in expressing causal relationships.
- What evidence would resolve it: A robust method for efficiently sampling or approximating the solution space of ¬C and handling linguistic variability in causal expressions, validated through cross-dataset comparisons of causal strength measurements.

## Limitations
- Taxonomy classification based on published descriptions may not capture emerging nuances in causality research
- Acquisition method comparisons are literature-based without empirical validation
- Distinction between qualitative and quantitative approaches may not fully capture hybrid real-world applications

## Confidence
- Taxonomy framework and benchmark classification: Medium - Well-structured but based on published descriptions
- Acquisition method comparisons: Low-Medium - Literature-based without empirical validation
- Reasoning approach distinctions: High - Clear theoretical framework, though practical applications may blur distinctions
- Future directions proposals: Medium - Grounded in current trends but speculative about future developments

## Next Checks
1. **Empirical benchmark validation**: Select 5-10 benchmarks from the survey and conduct hands-on evaluation to verify the accuracy of their classification within the taxonomy framework, particularly testing the commonsense type and uncertainty level assignments.

2. **Acquisition method comparison study**: Design a controlled experiment using identical causality tasks to empirically compare the performance, scalability, and quality trade-offs of extractive, generative, and manual annotation methods as described in the survey.

3. **Hybrid reasoning approach validation**: Implement a hybrid system that combines qualitative and quantitative reasoning methods on complex causality tasks to test whether the survey's distinction adequately captures practical needs and whether hybrid approaches outperform pure implementations.
