# Towards Negotiative Dialogue for the Talkamatic Dialogue Manager
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.02917
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02917
- Reference count: 3
- Primary result: Initial implementation of negotiative dialogue features in TDM based on human-human dialogue analysis

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an initial implementation of negotiative dialogue capabilities in the Talkamatic Dialogue Manager (TDM), enabling users to ask questions about alternatives, inquire about knowledge preconditions, and modify search criteria during task-oriented conversations. The implementation draws from analysis of human-human dialogue data collected in a phone directory domain, demonstrating how developers can encode these negotiative behaviors through specific attributes and parameters in domain descriptions. The work advances toward creating more flexible dialogue systems that support the exploratory and comparative behaviors typical of natural human conversations.

The proposed approach addresses a key limitation in many dialogue systems that assume users have complete information and fixed goals before interaction begins. By supporting negotiation-like behaviors such as asking about available options and modifying search constraints, the system better aligns with how humans naturally explore and refine their objectives during task-oriented dialogue. The paper provides concrete examples of how these features are encoded in TDM's dialogue plans, offering a practical framework for developers to implement similar negotiative capabilities.

## Method Summary
The implementation leverages the Talkamatic Dialogue Manager's existing framework, extending it to handle three key negotiative dialogue phenomena: user questions about alternatives, knowledge precondition questions, and search criteria modification. The approach is based on analysis of human-human dialogue data collected for a phone directory domain, which informed the design of specific dialogue plan attributes and parameters. Developers can enable these features by adding particular attributes to domain descriptions that specify how the system should handle negotiation-like behaviors during task completion.

## Key Results
- Implemented three core negotiative dialogue features: questions about alternatives, knowledge precondition questions, and search criteria modification
- Demonstrated how developers can encode negotiative behaviors through specific attributes in TDM domain descriptions
- Provided proof-of-concept implementation based on human-human dialogue analysis from phone directory domain

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by extending the TDM framework's dialogue plans to explicitly handle negotiation-like behaviors that naturally occur in human task-oriented dialogue. By analyzing how humans explore options and modify constraints during conversations, the system can anticipate and appropriately respond to user questions about alternatives and search parameters. The implementation provides developers with concrete mechanisms to encode these behaviors, making the dialogue system more flexible and aligned with natural conversational patterns.

## Foundational Learning
- **Negotiative dialogue phenomena** - Understanding how users naturally explore and modify goals during task-oriented conversations; needed to design systems that support realistic dialogue patterns
- **Dialogue plan attributes** - Specific parameters in TDM that control how the system handles different types of user interactions; needed to enable negotiative features through domain descriptions
- **Knowledge precondition questions** - User queries about what information the system has before making recommendations; needed to support informed decision-making during dialogue
- **Search criteria modification** - User ability to adjust constraints and preferences during task completion; needed to enable flexible exploration of alternatives
- **Alternative exploration** - User behavior of asking about available options before committing to choices; needed to support realistic decision-making processes
- **Domain description encoding** - How negotiative behaviors are specified in TDM through attributes and parameters; needed for practical implementation by developers

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: User utterances -> NLU module -> Dialogue plan interpreter -> TDM reasoning engine -> Response generation
- **Critical path**: User question about alternatives -> Plan attribute matching -> Alternative generation -> User presentation -> User selection
- **Design tradeoffs**: Flexibility vs. complexity in handling unexpected user questions; explicit encoding vs. learned negotiation patterns
- **Failure signatures**: System unable to generate relevant alternatives; misinterpretation of modification requests; failure to recognize knowledge precondition questions
- **First experiments**:
  1. Test system response to basic questions about available alternatives in phone directory domain
  2. Evaluate handling of knowledge precondition questions about search criteria
  3. Assess system's ability to process and implement search criteria modifications

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation based solely on simulated dialogue data rather than real user interactions
- Implementation tested only in constrained phone directory domain, limiting generalizability
- No quantitative performance metrics or user studies to validate effectiveness of negotiative features

## Confidence
- Technical implementation details: **High** - clear description of how features are encoded in TDM framework
- Behavioral claims about human dialogue patterns: **Medium** - limited supporting evidence from analyzed corpus
- Practical utility and user experience: **Low** - no user evaluation data provided

## Next Checks
1. Conduct user study comparing dialogue success rates between negotiative-enabled TDM and baseline system in phone directory domain
2. Test implementation across multiple domains (restaurant recommendation, technical troubleshooting) to evaluate generalizability
3. Perform error analysis on system responses to unexpected user questions or modification requests to identify robustness limitations
