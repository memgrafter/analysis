- This paper proposes a taxonomy of key factors influencing offense-defense dynamics in AI, focusing on how AI systems can be used for both societal harm and protection.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a comprehensive taxonomy examining how artificial intelligence can be used for both societal harm and protection. The framework identifies six interconnected elements that influence offense-defense dynamics: Raw Capability Potential, Accessibility and Control, Adaptability, Proliferation/Diffusion/Release Methods, Safeguards and Mitigations, and Sociotechnical Context. By establishing a shared terminology and conceptual foundation, the authors aim to facilitate further research and discourse on AI governance and policy decisions. The framework addresses the dual-use nature of AI technologies and their potential for large-scale societal impacts.

## Method Summary
This is a conceptual framework paper proposing a taxonomy of factors influencing offense-defense dynamics in AI. The authors develop a six-element framework based on existing literature from international relations, technology assessment, and AI safety research. Rather than providing quantitative methods or empirical validation, the paper focuses on establishing theoretical foundations and identifying key leverage points within the offense-defense dynamics system. The framework is designed to be applicable across different AI domains and contexts, from cybersecurity to CBRN threats.

## Key Results
- The taxonomy identifies Accessibility and Control as a critical bottleneck that can limit both offensive misuse and defensive deployment of AI systems
- Raw Capability Potential and Sociotechnical Context are identified as the most influential elements in determining offense-defense dynamics
- The framework reveals that certain elements serve as leverage points, exerting disproportionate influence on the overall offense-defense balance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The taxonomy works by identifying key leverage points in AI's offense-defense dynamics, particularly through Accessibility and Control as a bottleneck.
- Mechanism: The framework maps how access restrictions can prevent both offensive misuse and defensive deployment, creating a critical control point that influences all other elements.
- Core assumption: That access control can effectively bottleneck both offensive and defensive applications regardless of underlying capability.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Accessibility and Control...signifies that regardless of an AI system's raw capabilities or adaptability, tightly controlled access can significantly limit its potential for both offensive and defensive applications."
  - [abstract] "By establishing a shared terminology and conceptual foundation for analyzing these interactions, this work seeks to facilitate further research and discourse in this critical area."
- Break condition: If AI systems become distributed through decentralized networks that bypass traditional access controls, or if capability gaps become so large that defensive applications become fundamentally inaccessible.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The framework captures dual-use nature by examining how the same capabilities can be used for both harm and protection.
- Mechanism: By separating Raw Capability Potential (what the system can do) from sociotechnical factors (how it's used), the taxonomy reveals how identical technical features enable both offensive and defensive applications.
- Core assumption: That AI capabilities are inherently neutral and that their orientation depends entirely on sociotechnical context.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "While AI technologies may be fundamentally neutral, significant asymmetries can emerge naturally in their offensive and defensive applications."
  - [section] "An AI system's potential for societal harm or benefit is determined by a complex interplay of factors, including its technical characteristics, the contexts in which it is deployed, and the ways in which its capabilities propagate through society."
- Break condition: If certain capabilities prove to be inherently offensive or defensive in nature, making the dual-use assumption invalid.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The framework's interconnected structure allows for holistic analysis of second-order effects in AI governance.
- Mechanism: By modeling the six elements as an interconnected system rather than isolated factors, the taxonomy captures how changes in one area (like regulatory strength) cascade through other elements to affect overall offense-defense balance.
- Core assumption: That the six taxonomy elements form a coherent system with meaningful interdependencies rather than being independent factors.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The six elements of the Offense-Defense Dynamics Framework form a complex, interconnected system rather than existing in isolation."
  - [section] "These interdependencies manifest in various ways throughout the taxonomy. For example, an AI system's level of access control significantly impacts proliferation patterns..."
- Break condition: If empirical validation reveals that the elements operate largely independently or that certain connections in the framework are spurious.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Offense-Defense Theory in International Relations
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly builds on this theoretical foundation to apply military strategy concepts to AI governance.
  - Quick check question: What is the primary insight from offense-defense theory that the paper applies to AI systems?

- Concept: Dual-Use Technology Analysis
  - Why needed here: The framework assumes AI is inherently dual-use and examines factors that determine whether capabilities are used for harm or protection.
  - Quick check question: How does the framework distinguish between raw capability and its sociotechnical orientation?

- Concept: Systems Thinking and Interdependency Mapping
  - Why needed here: The framework explicitly models six elements as an interconnected system where changes in one element affect others.
  - Quick check question: What makes certain elements "leverage points" in the offense-defense dynamics framework?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw Capability Potential -> Accessibility and Control -> Adaptability -> Proliferation/Diffusion/Release Methods -> Safeguards and Mitigations -> Sociotechnical Context (with bidirectional interconnections between all elements)
- Critical path: For analyzing any AI system's offense-defense dynamics, start with Raw Capability Potential to establish baseline capabilities, then assess Accessibility and Control as the primary bottleneck, followed by Adaptability to understand repurposing risks, then examine Proliferation methods, Safeguards in place, and finally Sociotechnical Context for external factors.
- Design tradeoffs: The framework prioritizes breadth over depth by focusing on general patterns rather than specific applications, trading detailed application cataloging for broader applicability across different AI domains and contexts.
- Failure signatures: The framework may fail if it overemphasizes technical factors at the expense of social ones, if it assumes linear relationships between elements when the reality is more complex, or if it cannot adequately capture rapidly evolving AI capabilities.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Map a specific AI system (like GPT-4) onto each taxonomy element to test the framework's applicability and identify measurement challenges.
  2. Conduct a scenario analysis where one element (e.g., regulatory strength) is varied to observe cascading effects through other elements.
  3. Compare offense-defense dynamics across different AI domains (cybersecurity vs. CBRN threats) to validate the framework's domain generality.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific quantitative metrics could be developed to operationalize the six elements of the Offense-Defense Dynamics Framework?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "future research should aim to empirically operationalize it, for example by developing granular quantitative elements for each element" and "A promising method to operationalize the taxonomy is through the application of graph theory and hypergraphs to fully map the complex interdependencies between its elements."
- Why unresolved: The paper only suggests methods for operationalization but does not propose specific metrics or indicators for each framework element.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies proposing and validating specific quantitative measures for Raw Capability Potential, Accessibility and Control, Adaptability, Proliferation/Diffusion/Release Methods, Safeguards and Mitigations, and Sociotechnical Context.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do specific sociotechnical factors (e.g., regulatory frameworks, geopolitical tensions) quantitatively influence the balance between offensive and defensive AI applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses how "the sociotechnical context can either amplify or mitigate the risks associated with AI technologies" and mentions "geopolitical stability" and "regulatory strength" as key dimensions.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies these factors, it does not provide empirical data or models showing their quantitative impact on offense-defense dynamics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Statistical analysis or simulation studies demonstrating the relationship between specific sociotechnical factors and the prevalence or effectiveness of offensive vs. defensive AI applications.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the critical leverage points within the Offense-Defense Dynamics Framework that, when modified, most significantly shift the balance toward defensive advantages?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "certain elements emerge as clear leverage points, exerting disproportionate influence on the overall offense-defense dynamics" and mentions "Accessibility and Control" and "Safeguards and Mitigations" as potential leverage points.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies potential leverage points but does not empirically determine which elements or sub-elements have the most significant impact on shifting offense-defense balances.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies or simulations identifying and quantifying the impact of specific framework elements on offense-defense dynamics, potentially using methods like sensitivity analysis or causal inference.

## Limitations
- The framework lacks empirical validation and specific quantitative metrics for operationalizing each taxonomy element
- The interconnections between elements are theorized but not empirically proven, potentially oversimplifying complex relationships
- The framework's generalizability across different AI domains and contexts remains untested

## Confidence
- **Medium Confidence:** The taxonomy's basic structure and the identification of key factors influencing offense-defense dynamics are well-grounded in existing literature on dual-use technology and offense-defense theory.
- **Low Confidence:** The specific interconnections between taxonomy elements and their relative importance in determining overall offense-defense balance require empirical validation before strong claims can be made.
- **Medium Confidence:** The framework's general applicability across different AI domains is plausible but untested, requiring domain-specific validation to confirm its utility.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct empirical case studies mapping specific AI systems (e.g., large language models, autonomous weapons) onto each taxonomy element to test measurement validity and identify gaps.
2. Develop quantitative metrics for each taxonomy element and validate their predictive power in real-world offense-defense scenarios.
3. Test the framework's sensitivity to changes in individual elements through controlled scenario analysis to identify true leverage points versus spurious connections.
