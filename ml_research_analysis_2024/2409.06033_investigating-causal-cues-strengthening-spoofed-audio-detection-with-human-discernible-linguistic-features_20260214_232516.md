- Primary result: Ensemble causal discovery identifies AudioQualityAnomaly and PitchAnomaly as having the strongest causal effects on spoofed audio detection

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a novel approach to spoofed audio detection by applying causal discovery and inference to expert-defined linguistic features. The authors combine multiple causal discovery algorithms (PC and GES) with three inference methods (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost) to identify which human-discernible linguistic features most strongly indicate audio authenticity. The hybrid dataset includes real and spoofed audio samples with sociolinguistic annotations, validated through expert knowledge. Results show that AudioQualityAnomaly and PitchAnomaly have the strongest causal effects on detecting spoofed audio, with PauseAnomaly and IntakeOrOuttakeofBreath showing secondary effects.

## Method Summary
The study employs an ensemble causal discovery approach using PC and GES algorithms to identify causal relationships between five Expert Defined Linguistic Features (EDLFs) and audio authenticity. The backdoor criterion is applied to estimate causal effects, with results validated through sociolinguistics expert knowledge. The method involves combining observational data from spoofed and real audio samples, running independent causal discovery algorithms, creating an ensemble consensus graph, and performing causal inference using multiple machine learning models to rank feature importance.

## Key Results
- AudioQualityAnomaly and PitchAnomaly demonstrate the strongest causal effects on spoof detection
- PauseAnomaly and IntakeOrOuttakeofBreath show secondary causal effects on spoof detection
- Ensemble causal discovery provides more robust results than single-model approaches
- Expert validation confirms the identified causal relationships between linguistic features and audio authenticity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Ensemble causal discovery improves robustness over single-model approaches
- Mechanism: The paper combines PC and GES algorithms, keeping only edges/directed edges both agree upon. This majority-vote ensemble filters out spurious or algorithm-specific artifacts, yielding more reliable causal graphs.
- Core assumption: When two different causal discovery methods agree, the inferred relationships are more likely to reflect true causal structure rather than statistical noise.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We propose an ensemble method across multiple causal models."
  - [section] "Our ensemble model combined the agreed upon node connections from both the PC and GES models."
  - [corpus] Weak - no corpus neighbor discusses ensemble causal discovery methods.
- Break condition: If the two algorithms systematically disagree due to inherent bias or incompatibility in their assumptions (e.g., different handling of latent confounders), the ensemble may discard valid causal edges.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Backdoor criterion enables proper causal effect estimation
- Mechanism: The backdoor criterion identifies a set of variables (Z) that, when conditioned upon, block all non-causal paths between X (EDLF) and Y (spoof label). This adjustment isolates the true causal effect of X on Y.
- Core assumption: The set of variables satisfying the backdoor criterion can be correctly identified and included in the model, ensuring all confounding paths are blocked.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we used the backdoor criterion test, an approach that enables the identification of the optimal set of variables Z...to condition on."
  - [section] "The backdoor criterion test operates by strategically blocking all spurious paths that may exist between X and Y."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors focus on detection methods, not causal inference methodology.
- Break condition: If important confounders are omitted from Z, or if conditioning on colliders occurs, the estimated causal effect will be biased.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Human knowledge validation creates feedback loop for model refinement
- Mechanism: Sociolinguistics experts provide ground truth validation of causal relationships, which is used to iteratively refine the causal graphs. This tight coupling ensures the AI models incorporate domain expertise.
- Core assumption: Expert knowledge accurately reflects the true causal relationships in the data, and their feedback can meaningfully improve the causal models.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We also perform a tightly coupled sociolinguistics based ground truth validation of the causal graphs."
  - [section] "To validate the generated causal graph, we compared it to our ground truth knowledge provided by the sociolinguistics experts."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors don't discuss human knowledge validation in causal frameworks.
- Break condition: If expert validation is inconsistent, subjective, or fails to capture the true causal structure, the feedback loop may introduce bias rather than improve accuracy.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Causal discovery algorithms (PC and GES)
  - Why needed here: These algorithms identify potential causal relationships between EDLFs and spoof labels from observational data, which is the foundation for understanding which features actually cause spoof detection.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between constraint-based (PC) and score-based (GES) causal discovery methods?

- Concept: Backdoor criterion and causal inference
  - Why needed here: Once potential causal relationships are identified, the backdoor criterion enables proper estimation of the magnitude of these effects by adjusting for confounders.
  - Quick check question: What are the two conditions that must be satisfied for a set of variables Z to be a valid backdoor adjustment set?

- Concept: Ensemble methods in causal discovery
  - Why needed here: Combining multiple causal discovery approaches reduces the risk of false positives and increases confidence in the identified causal relationships.
  - Quick check question: How does the ensemble method in this paper determine which edges to keep in the final causal graph?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data pipeline: Hybrid dataset of spoofed audio with EDLF annotations
  - Causal discovery module: PC and GES algorithms
  - Ensemble module: Consensus mechanism for combining PC and GES results
  - Validation module: Expert knowledge integration and ground truth comparison
  - Causal inference module: Backdoor criterion implementation with multiple ML models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost)

- Critical path:
  1. Load hybrid dataset with EDLF annotations
  2. Run PC and GES algorithms independently
  3. Combine results using ensemble majority vote
  4. Validate with expert knowledge and iterate if necessary
  5. Apply backdoor criterion for causal effect estimation
  6. Rank EDLFs by causal influence scores

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Ensemble vs. single model: Ensemble reduces false positives but may discard valid edges if algorithms disagree
  - Expert validation vs. purely data-driven: Expert input improves interpretability but may introduce subjective bias
  - Multiple inference methods: Using different ML models for causal inference provides robustness but increases computational cost

- Failure signatures:
  - Ensemble produces very sparse graphs: PC and GES algorithms may have incompatible assumptions
  - Causal effects show inconsistent signs across inference methods: Model specification or backdoor criterion application may be flawed
  - Expert validation significantly contradicts data-driven results: Potential mismatch between domain expertise and actual data patterns

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run PC and GES algorithms separately on the hybrid dataset and compare their outputs to identify areas of agreement/disagreement
  2. Apply the ensemble method to the PC and GES results and analyze the resulting graph structure
  3. Implement the backdoor criterion for causal effect estimation using one inference method (e.g., Random Forest) and verify the adjustment process is correctly blocking confounding paths

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do specific Voice Conversion (VC) algorithms (like ASSEM-VC) compare to Text-to-Speech (TTS) algorithms in terms of producing EDLFs that are causally linked to spoofed audio detection?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that VC samples often contain authentic linguistic features due to their production method, making them harder to detect using EDLFs compared to TTS.
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions VC and TTS but doesn't provide a direct comparative analysis of how different generative algorithms produce EDLFs and their causal links to spoof detection.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of causal discovery results across different VC and TTS algorithms, showing which algorithms produce more detectable EDLFs and their relative causal strengths.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal feature selection process for auto-annotation of EDLFs that balances causal significance with annotation efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the need for auto-annotation of EDLFs but doesn't provide specific guidance on how to prioritize features for this process based on their causal importance.
- Why unresolved: While the paper ranks EDLFs by causal effect, it doesn't translate this into a practical framework for auto-annotation that considers both causal significance and annotation complexity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of an auto-annotation pipeline that prioritizes features based on causal strength while maintaining high accuracy, including efficiency metrics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do different audio quality levels affect the causal relationships between EDLFs and spoof detection?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies AudioQualityAnomaly as a front-line feature that affects perception of other EDLFs, but doesn't explore how varying quality levels impact these relationships.
- Why unresolved: The paper treats AudioQualityAnomaly as binary but doesn't investigate how different quality levels (poor, moderate, good) influence the strength of relationships between EDLFs and spoof detection.
- What evidence would resolve it: Causal discovery analysis across multiple audio quality levels, showing how the strength of relationships between EDLFs and spoof detection varies with quality.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What is the minimum sample duration required for reliable detection of EDLFs and their causal relationships to spoof detection?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses audio clips with average durations ranging from 2-4.2 seconds but doesn't explore how clip length affects EDLF detection and causal analysis.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't investigate whether shorter or longer clips would affect the reliability of EDLF detection or the strength of causal relationships.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic analysis of causal discovery results across different clip lengths, identifying the minimum duration needed for reliable EDLF detection and causal analysis.

## Limitations

- The study relies on expert-defined linguistic features which introduces potential subjectivity in annotation, with exact criteria for determining "anomalous" production not fully specified
- The ensemble approach may discard valid causal edges when PC and GES algorithms disagree, potentially leading to overly conservative estimates of causal relationships
- The dataset's relatively small size (344 samples) and specific composition may limit generalizability to other spoofed audio scenarios

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The identification of AudioQualityAnomaly and PitchAnomaly as having the strongest causal effects on spoof detection is well-supported by the ensemble approach and multiple inference methods
- **Medium Confidence:** The secondary effects of PauseAnomaly and IntakeOrOuttakeofBreath are less robust, with IntakeOrOuttakeofBreath showing zero causal effect due to imbalanced presence in the dataset
- **Medium Confidence:** The overall framework of combining causal discovery with expert validation is methodologically sound, though implementation details could affect results

## Next Checks

1. Perform sensitivity analysis by varying the agreement threshold in the ensemble method to assess how conservative edge selection affects causal effect estimates
2. Conduct ablation studies by removing one expert-defined feature at a time to quantify its individual contribution to spoof detection performance
3. Test the generalizability of findings by applying the causal framework to an independent spoofed audio dataset with different attack types and recording conditions
