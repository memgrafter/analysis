# A Framework for Synthetic Audio Conversations Generation using Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.00946
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00946
- Authors: Kaung Myat Kyaw; Jonathan Hoyin Chan
- Reference count: 18
- One-line primary result: Proposed framework ConversaSynth generates high-quality synthetic audio conversations with 94.5% format adherence and 93.49 dB SNR using LLM and hybrid TTS approach.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents ConversaSynth, a framework for generating synthetic audio datasets of multi-speaker conversations using large language models (LLMs) and text-to-speech (TTS) systems. The system combines Llama3-8B for dialogue generation with a hybrid approach using Parler-TTS and XTTS for voice synthesis, producing 189 high-quality conversations spanning over 4 hours of audio. The framework demonstrates efficiency, scalability, and flexibility in creating diverse synthetic datasets for training speech-related models, addressing the challenge of limited high-quality conversational audio data.

## Method Summary
The framework generates synthetic audio conversations through a modular pipeline: Llama3-8B creates text dialogues using persona-based few-shot prompting, Parler-TTS generates initial voice samples, XTTS clones these voices for consistency across utterances, and audio segments are concatenated with metadata to produce the final dataset. The system processes conversations with 2-5 speakers each, using 9 predefined personas with unique speaking styles. Text-to-speech conversion and voice cloning ensure speaker consistency while maintaining high audio quality (93.49 dB SNR). The pipeline achieves 94.5% success rate in format adherence across 200 generated conversations.

## Key Results
- Generated 189 multi-speaker conversations (94.5% success rate) with consistent speaker voices and minimal format errors
- Produced over 4 hours of audio with average signal-to-noise ratio of 93.49 dB
- Demonstrated efficient processing (~18.65s per conversation) with modular design enabling error recovery

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLM-generated text ensures diverse, coherent multi-speaker dialogues when personas and format constraints are enforced via few-shot prompting.
- Mechanism: Llama3-8B is prompted with randomly selected personas and example dialogue structures. Persona definitions include explicit speaking styles to guide TTS output quality. Few-shot prompting constrains generation to expected JSON format with bracketed speaker names.
- Core assumption: LLM can maintain persona consistency and conversational coherence when given explicit persona traits and format constraints.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The framework first creates diverse and coherent text-based dialogues across various topics"
  - [section] "We utilized few-shot prompting... to ensure that the generated response adheres to the desired format"
  - [corpus] Weak; corpus contains related synthetic dialogue work but no direct validation of LLM coherence mechanisms
- Break condition: If LLM fails to follow persona traits or produces malformed output, pipeline must retry or fall back to stricter prompt.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Combining Parler-TTS and XTTS achieves voice consistency across multi-turn dialogues while maintaining audio quality.
- Mechanism: Parler-TTS generates unique voice samples per persona, but these can vary between utterances. XTTS then clones each persona's voice from first Parler-TTS output and uses cloned voice for all subsequent utterances, ensuring consistency within conversation.
- Core assumption: XTTS voice cloning can preserve speaker identity across multiple utterances once trained on single Parler-TTS sample.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "To address this issue, we incorporate a second model, XTTS, which is a zero-shot text-to-speech model with voice cloning capabilities"
  - [section] "First, we use Parler-TTS to generate a unique voice for each persona. Next, we employ XTTS to clone these unique voices"
  - [corpus] Weak; corpus has related TTS work but no direct evidence of this specific hybrid approach for consistency
- Break condition: If XTTS fails to clone or cloned voice degrades, framework reverts to Parler-TTS only, accepting voice variability.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Framework scales to large synthetic datasets with high success rates due to modular design and efficient error handling.
- Mechanism: Pipeline processes 200 conversations in ~3730 seconds total (~18.65s per conversation) with 94.5% format adherence. Failures isolated to text generation; audio synthesis and concatenation not reported to fail. Modular approach allows rerunning only failed generation step.
- Core assumption: Isolated failure modes mean rerunning text generation step can recover from errors without rebuilding entire dataset.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "189 adhered to the correct format, resulting in a success rate of 94.5%"
  - [section] "The process of converting the generated text conversations into audio using Parler-TTS and XTTS took 4,457.94 seconds in total"
  - [corpus] Weak; corpus has synthetic data benchmarks but no direct evidence of error recovery patterns
- Break condition: If text generation consistently fails above 5-10% rate, persona definitions or prompt templates need revision before scaling.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Persona-based dialogue generation
  - Why needed here: Ensures each speaker has distinct traits, improving realism and diversity in synthetic conversations.
  - Quick check question: How does the framework enforce that each persona's speaking style is preserved across all utterances?

- Concept: Few-shot prompting for format control
  - Why needed here: Guides LLM to produce structured JSON dialogues with bracketed speaker names, enabling downstream TTS processing.
  - Quick check question: What happens if LLM ignores few-shot examples and generates free-form text?

- Concept: Voice cloning for consistency
  - Why needed here: Maintains same speaker voice across multiple turns in conversation, avoiding jarring changes that reduce realism.
  - Quick check question: How does system ensure XTTS cloning doesn't drift in quality between different utterances?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Llama3-8B -> Few-shot prompt builder -> Text validation -> Parler-TTS -> XTTS -> Audio concatenation -> Dataset output
- Critical path: Text generation → Format validation → TTS (Parler → XTTS) → Concatenation → Dataset output
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Llama3-8B chosen for speed vs. Gemma2-9B's zero format errors; accepts slightly higher error rate for faster throughput
  - Hybrid TTS (Parler + XTTS) chosen for consistency vs. single-model simplicity; increases complexity but improves realism
- Failure signatures:
  - Text: Wrong JSON format, missing speaker brackets
  - TTS: Voice inconsistency, audio corruption, mismatched timing
  - Concatenation: Out-of-order segments, missing speaker tags
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run text generation with 2 personas and verify format compliance (target 100% success on small set)
  2. Test Parler-TTS alone on 10 dialogues; measure voice variation across turns
  3. Validate XTTS cloning by generating 5 cloned voices and checking cross-turn consistency

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the framework perform when generating synthetic audio conversations in languages other than English?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions assessing the framework's generalization to other languages as a future work direction, indicating this has not been tested.
- Why unresolved: The current study focuses solely on English, and multilingual datasets and model training would be required to evaluate performance in other languages.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the framework with LLMs and TTS systems trained on multilingual datasets and comparing the quality and coherence of generated conversations across different languages.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of adding background noise or reverb on the quality and realism of the generated audio conversations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that audio post-processing, such as adding background noise or reverb, is possible but does not evaluate its impact.
- Why unresolved: The study does not provide data on how these modifications affect audio quality, listener perception, or model performance in downstream tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with and without background noise/reverb, measuring SNR, conducting user studies for perceived realism, and testing model performance on tasks like speech recognition.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the framework handle complex conversational scenarios, such as overlapping speech or emotional tone variations?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The framework generates structured dialogues but does not address overlapping speech or emotional nuances, which are critical for realistic conversations.
- Why unresolved: The current methodology focuses on sequential dialogue generation and standard TTS conversion without modeling overlapping speech or emotional variations.

## Limitations

- The framework's success rate of 94.5% indicates that 5.5% of generated conversations fail to adhere to the expected JSON format, which could impact downstream processing.
- The evaluation focuses on format correctness and audio quality metrics (SNR) but lacks human perceptual validation of dialogue naturalness and speaker voice realism.
- The persona-based approach may limit conversational diversity if the predefined personas do not cover sufficient linguistic and stylistic variation.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The framework's modular design and reported success metrics (94.5% format adherence, 93.49 dB SNR) are well-supported by the experimental data and methodology description.
- **Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of the few-shot prompting approach for maintaining dialogue coherence and format compliance, as the paper demonstrates success but does not explore alternative prompting strategies or failure analysis in depth.
- **Medium Confidence**: The hybrid TTS approach (Parler-TTS + XTTS) for voice consistency, as the paper describes the mechanism but provides limited quantitative evidence comparing it to single-model approaches or measuring voice drift across extended conversations.

## Next Checks

1. **Human Evaluation Study**: Conduct a perceptual study with human raters to assess dialogue naturalness, speaker voice consistency, and overall conversation quality beyond automated SNR measurements.
2. **Ablation Study on TTS Components**: Compare the hybrid Parler-TTS + XTTS approach against using either model alone to quantify the specific contribution of voice cloning to consistency and quality.
3. **Failure Mode Analysis**: Analyze the 5.5% of conversations that failed format compliance to identify common failure patterns and test whether prompt template adjustments can reduce this rate below 2%.
