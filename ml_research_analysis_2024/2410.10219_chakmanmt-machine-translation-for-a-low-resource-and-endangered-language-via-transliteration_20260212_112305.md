- Introduces first machine translation system for Chakma language using transliteration framework

## Executive Summary
This work establishes the first machine translation system for Chakma, an endangered Indo-Aryan language, by creating new parallel and monolingual datasets and proposing a transliteration framework to bridge script differences with Bangla. Using character-level transliteration to map Chakma script to Bangla Unicode, the authors enable effective transfer learning from Bangla-pretrained models. The approach combines fine-tuning, in-context learning, and data augmentation strategies to achieve strong performance despite extreme data scarcity, with BLEU scores reaching up to 17.8 (CCP→BN) and 4.41 (BN→CCP).

## Method Summary
The authors create a new Chakma-Bangla parallel corpus of 15,021 sentence pairs and monolingual corpus of 42,783 sentences, plus a 600-sentence trilingual benchmark. They propose character-level transliteration to map Chakma script to Bangla Unicode, enabling transfer from Bangla-pretrained models. The methodology includes from-scratch Transformer baselines, fine-tuning of BanglaT5 and mT5 models with transliteration, iterative back-translation for data augmentation, and GPT-based in-context learning with 100-400 demonstration examples. All models are evaluated on the same benchmark using BLEU and chrF metrics.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuning BanglaT5 with transliteration achieves 11.36-17.81 BLEU for CCP→BN translation
- GPT-4.1 in-context learning reaches 17.80 BLEU for CCP→BN with 400 demonstrations
- Strong translation asymmetry shows better performance CCP→BN than BN→CCP
- Without transliteration, all models show near-zero performance, confirming its necessity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Transliteration bridges script mismatch and enables effective transfer from Bangla-pretrained models.
- Mechanism: Chakma and Bangla share high orthographic and phonetic similarity. Character-level transliteration maps Chakma script to Bangla Unicode, allowing models trained on Bangla to process Chakma text directly.
- Core assumption: Preserving semantic content through near one-to-one transliteration is sufficient for model transfer.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We propose a character-level transliteration framework that exploits the close orthographic and phonological relationship between Chakma and Bangla"
  - [section 4.2] "This transliteration step serves as a core foundation for both fine-tuning pretrained models and in-context learning experiments."
  - [corpus] Weak: no explicit corpus evidence provided for transliteration effectiveness, but implied by reported BLEU improvements.
- Break condition: If script similarity is lower than assumed or transliteration introduces semantic drift, transfer performance collapses (see Table 6 showing near-zero BLEU without transliteration).

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Large language models via in-context learning achieve strong translation quality with minimal parallel data.
- Mechanism: GPT models leverage demonstration examples to infer translation patterns without parameter updates, adapting to Chakma's orthographic variation.
- Core assumption: Demonstration examples provide sufficient context for accurate translation even with limited data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "fine-tuning and in-context learning substantially outperform from-scratch baselines, with strong asymmetry across translation directions"
  - [section 4.4] "This setting assesses their ability to perform Chakma translation using only in-context examples."
  - [corpus] Weak: no explicit corpus evidence, but performance gains in Table 8 support this mechanism.
- Break condition: If demonstrations are insufficient or irrelevant, translation quality degrades (see Table 11 showing zero-shot failure).

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Back-translation augments parallel data and improves model robustness under extreme scarcity.
- Mechanism: Iterative back-translation generates synthetic parallel data from monolingual corpora, providing additional training examples for low-resource directions.
- Core assumption: Synthetic data preserves translation quality and helps models generalize.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we apply iterative back-translation (IBT) to generate synthetic parallel data from monolingual corpora"
  - [section 4.3] "We further evaluate two data-centric extensions to improve robustness under scarcity."
  - [corpus] Weak: no explicit corpus evidence, but BLEU improvements in Table 2 support effectiveness.
- Break condition: If synthetic data introduces noise or doesn't match target distribution, performance gains disappear.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cross-script transfer learning
  - Why needed here: Chakma uses a distinct script from Bangla, requiring mechanism to bridge orthographic differences for model transfer
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how transliteration enables Bangla-pretrained models to process Chakma text?

- Concept: In-context learning mechanics
  - Why needed here: Few-shot learning enables strong translation quality without extensive fine-tuning data
  - Quick check question: What factors determine the effectiveness of in-context learning demonstrations?

- Concept: Data augmentation strategies
  - Why needed here: Extreme data scarcity requires synthetic data generation to improve model robustness
  - Quick check question: How does iterative back-translation work to augment low-resource parallel data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data collection pipeline -> Transliteration module -> Model training (from-scratch/pretrained/ICL) -> Evaluation
- Critical path: 
  1. Collect and preprocess parallel data
  2. Apply transliteration for cross-script compatibility
  3. Train/fine-tune models or prepare ICL prompts
  4. Evaluate using benchmark dataset
  5. Analyze results and iterate
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Transliteration vs character-level modeling: transliteration enables transfer but may introduce surface variation
  - Fine-tuning vs ICL: fine-tuning more stable for BN→CCP, ICL stronger for CCP→BN but requires commercial models
  - Synthetic data vs real data: back-translation helps but may introduce noise
- Failure signatures:
  - Near-zero BLEU/chrF scores indicate transliteration failure or extreme data scarcity
  - Large BLEU-chrF gaps suggest orthographic variation affecting evaluation
  - Direction asymmetry indicates script/pretrain imbalance
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train from-scratch Transformer baseline to establish data scarcity limits
  2. Fine-tune BanglaT5 with transliteration enabled to test transfer effectiveness
  3. Evaluate GPT-4.1 ICL with 400 demonstrations to compare few-shot vs fine-tuning performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the exact character-level drift introduced by the Chakma-Bangla transliteration system, and how does it affect downstream translation quality over multiple round-trip iterations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows that round-trip transliteration achieves high BLEU and chrF scores (41.55 BLEU / 79.32 chrF for BN→CCP→BN and 38.37 BLEU / 79.69 chrF for CCP→BN→CCP after one cycle, converging to near-ceiling levels after two cycles), but does not detail the specific character-level substitutions causing drift.
- Why unresolved: While the paper notes minor surface-level variation, it does not provide a detailed analysis of which characters are being substituted and how these substitutions impact translation quality over multiple cycles.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed character-level error analysis showing the specific substitutions and their impact on translation quality over multiple round-trip iterations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of large language models (LLMs) for Chakma translation vary with different prompt engineering strategies, such as prompt structure, demonstration ordering, and temperature settings?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates LLMs using a fixed prompting template with 100-400 demonstration examples and fixed temperature settings, but does not explore the impact of different prompt engineering strategies.
- Why unresolved: The paper uses a fixed prompting template and does not explore how variations in prompt structure, demonstration ordering, or temperature settings affect translation quality.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic evaluation of different prompt engineering strategies and their impact on translation quality for Chakma.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the practical deployment considerations for machine translation systems for endangered languages like Chakma, including model selection, data privacy, and community engagement?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper establishes strong baselines for Chakma translation and discusses the importance of data scarcity and orthographic variation, but does not address practical deployment considerations.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on establishing baselines and evaluating different modeling approaches, but does not discuss practical considerations for deploying machine translation systems for endangered languages in real-world settings.
- What evidence would resolve it: A case study or analysis of the practical challenges and considerations for deploying machine translation systems for endangered languages, including community feedback and data privacy concerns.

## Limitations

- Limited evaluation of transliteration quality: No explicit validation of semantic preservation during transliteration process
- Commercial model dependency: Strongest results rely on GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o with limited accessibility
- BLEU underestimation: Acknowledged but not quantified, affecting reliability of quality estimates

## Confidence

- High Confidence: Baseline results showing near-zero performance without transliteration are well-supported and consistent across experiments
- Medium Confidence: Effectiveness of fine-tuning BanglaT5 with transliteration is supported by multiple experiments
- Low Confidence: Claims about in-context learning superiority are based on commercial model performance with limited open-source comparison

## Next Checks

1. **Transliteration Semantic Validation**: Conduct human evaluation comparing original Chakma text with transliterated versions to quantify semantic drift and establish transliteration quality bounds

2. **Open-Source ICL Benchmark**: Replicate ICL experiments using open-source models (Llama, Mistral) with same demonstrations to assess commercial model superiority

3. **Orthographic Variation Analysis**: Systematically introduce controlled orthographic variations in Chakma text to measure their impact on BLEU/chrF scores and establish correction factors
