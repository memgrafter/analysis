# DeepUQ: Assessing the Aleatoric Uncertainties from two Deep Learning Methods

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.08587
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08587
- Authors: Rebecca Nevin; Aleksandra Ćiprijanović; Brian D. Nord
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Predicted aleatoric uncertainty scales with injected noise, but only 7/12 DE and 2/12 DER experiments are well-calibrated (within one std of true uncertainty)

## Executive Summary
This work systematically benchmarks two deep learning uncertainty quantification methods—Deep Ensembles (DE) and Deep Evidential Regression (DER)—by comparing their predictions of aleatoric uncertainty against ground truth values across synthetic datasets. Using both 0D linear regression and 2D imaging data with three noise levels, the study injects uncertainty on input or output variables and propagates uncertainty where applicable. While both methods successfully scale predicted uncertainty with injected noise magnitude, significant calibration issues persist, particularly for high-dimensional data and high-noise input uncertainty scenarios.

## Method Summary
The study uses synthetic 0D linear regression and 2D galaxy image datasets with injected Gaussian noise at low, medium, and high levels on either input or output variables. Two UQ methods are trained: Deep Ensembles with β-Negative Log Likelihood loss and Deep Evidential Regression with Normal Inverse Gaussian loss. Both methods use fully connected networks for 0D data and convolutional networks for 2D data. Predicted aleatoric uncertainty is evaluated against true uncertainty values, with calibration assessed by checking if predictions fall within one standard deviation of ground truth.

## Key Results
- Aleatoric uncertainty predictions from both methods scale with injected noise magnitude across all experiments
- Only 7/12 Deep Ensemble experiments and 2/12 Deep Evidential Regression experiments are well-calibrated (within one std of true uncertainty)
- Calibration is poorest for high-noise 2D input uncertainty experiments, with DER underestimating high-noise uncertainty while overestimating low-noise uncertainty

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Aleatoric uncertainty estimates scale with injected noise magnitude
- Mechanism: Both methods minimize likelihood-based losses incorporating variance terms, causing networks to adjust variance predictions to match true noise levels
- Core assumption: Loss functions (β-NLL for DE and NIG for DER) are properly minimized, leading networks to accurately reflect input noise in output variance predictions
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states uncertainty scales with injected noise; both methods use variance terms in loss functions
- Break condition: If training loss fails to converge or variance predictions saturate regardless of input noise

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Miscalibration increases with data dimensionality and input uncertainty injection
- Mechanism: High-dimensional data and input uncertainty introduce complex functional relationships that both methods struggle to propagate accurately through networks
- Core assumption: Propagation of input uncertainty through networks is non-trivial and depends on network's ability to capture complex input-output relationships
- Evidence anchors: Abstract notes poorest accuracy for 2D input uncertainty experiments; section describes noise injection on each pixel
- Break condition: If network architecture is modified to explicitly account for input uncertainty or dimensionality reduction techniques are applied

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: DER underestimates high-noise uncertainty while overestimating low-noise uncertainty, while DE shows opposite trend for 2D input uncertainty
- Mechanism: DER's evidential framework with t-distribution parameterization may be overly conservative for low noise but insufficiently flexible for high noise; DE's ensemble averaging may smooth variance predictions in complex input uncertainty scenarios
- Core assumption: Evidential prior and ensemble averaging mechanisms have inherent biases in handling different noise regimes
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states majority of DER experiments produce miscalibrated uncertainty; section notes DER over-estimates low-noise and under-estimates high-noise
- Break condition: If hyperparameters of evidential prior or ensemble size are adjusted to better fit data distribution

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Aleatoric uncertainty vs. epistemic uncertainty
  - Why needed here: Paper focuses specifically on aleatoric uncertainty, which is inherent to data, not model uncertainty
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in deep learning?

- Concept: Uncertainty propagation through neural networks
  - Why needed here: Paper injects uncertainty on input variables and propagates it to output variables, requiring understanding of how uncertainty flows through networks
  - Quick check question: How does injecting noise on input variable affect predicted uncertainty on output variable?

- Concept: Bayesian neural networks and variational inference
  - Why needed here: Both DE and DER relate to Bayesian approaches to uncertainty quantification; understanding theoretical foundations is crucial for interpreting results
  - Quick check question: How do Deep Ensembles and Deep Evidential Regression relate to Bayesian neural networks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data generation -> Model architecture -> Training module -> Analysis module
- Critical path: Data generation -> Model training -> Uncertainty prediction -> Calibration analysis
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Ensemble size vs. computational cost for DE
  - Choice of prior distribution and regularization for DER
  - Network architecture complexity vs. ability to capture input uncertainty propagation
- Failure signatures:
  - Predicted uncertainty values that do not scale with injected noise
  - Systematic under- or over-estimation of aleatoric uncertainty across different noise levels
  - Poor performance on high-dimensional data with input uncertainty injection
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce 0D linear regression with output uncertainty injection at low noise level
  2. Implement 2D galaxy image data with output uncertainty injection at medium noise level
  3. Test 0D linear regression with input uncertainty injection at high noise level

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific calibration techniques would most effectively improve aleatoric uncertainty estimates for high-dimensional and high-noise cases?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper explicitly states "further research on post-facto calibration for these methods would be beneficial, particularly for high-noise and high-dimensional settings"
- Why unresolved: Paper identifies need for calibration but does not explore or test specific calibration methods
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing various calibration techniques (e.g., isotonic regression, conformal prediction) on high-dimensional and high-noise datasets, comparing effectiveness in aligning predicted uncertainties with true uncertainties

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do Deep Ensembles and Deep Evidential Regression methods perform when applied to real-world datasets with complex, non-Gaussian noise distributions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Paper acknowledges "our conclusions apply only to our toy datasets" and do not extend to "real world datasets with higher complexity"
- Why unresolved: Study limited to synthetic datasets with homoskedastic Gaussian noise; performance on real-world data with more complex noise characteristics remains untested
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying DE and DER methods to real-world datasets (e.g., astrophysical imaging, medical imaging) with known noise characteristics and evaluating their uncertainty predictions

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of varying β parameter in β-NLL loss function on calibration of Deep Ensembles' aleatoric uncertainty estimates?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper mentions experimenting with several β values (0.0, 0.5, 1.0) and schedules but ultimately selects β = 0.5 without exploring impact on uncertainty calibration
- Why unresolved: While paper uses β = 0.5, it does not analyze how different β values affect calibration of uncertainty estimates
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematically varying β parameter and assessing effect on calibration of aleatoric uncertainty predictions across different noise levels and data dimensionalities

## Limitations
- Experiments limited to synthetic 0D and 2D datasets; results may not generalize to real-world high-dimensional or non-Gaussian noise scenarios
- Only assesses whether uncertainty predictions fall within one standard deviation of true values; does not evaluate full calibration curves or reliability diagrams
- Methodology for propagating input uncertainty through networks is simplified and may not capture complex dependencies in real applications

## Confidence
- High confidence: Scaling of predicted uncertainty with injected noise magnitude - directly observed across all experiments
- Medium confidence: Dimensionality-dependent miscalibration - supported by results but mechanism not fully explored
- Medium confidence: Method-specific bias patterns - observed trends but underlying causes not definitively established

## Next Checks
1. Test calibration assessment using reliability diagrams and expected calibration error metrics rather than simple ±1σ criterion
2. Validate findings on real-world datasets (e.g., medical imaging, autonomous driving) with heteroscedastic noise characteristics
3. Investigate impact of ensemble size (DE) and evidential prior hyperparameters (DER) on calibration performance across noise regimes
