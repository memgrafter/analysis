# Uncertainty Quantification with Bayesian Higher Order ReLU KANs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.01687
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01687
- Authors: James Giroux; Cristiano Fanelli
- Reference count: 32
- Key outcome: First method for uncertainty quantification in KANs using Bayesian approach with epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimates

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the first method for uncertainty quantification in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), specifically focusing on Higher Order ReLUKANs to enhance computational efficiency. The method provides both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimates through a Bayesian approach that defines posteriors over the basis functions and convolution weights. The approach is validated on simple one-dimensional functions and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), demonstrating accurate uncertainty quantification and functional dependency identification.

## Method Summary
The method employs Bayesian inference to define posteriors over the basis functions (Ri,m(x)) and convolution weights in Higher Order ReLU KANs. Epistemic uncertainty is captured through variational inference over these parameters, while aleatoric uncertainty is modeled using a separate Bayesian KAN (surrogate model) that predicts output uncertainty directly from the data. The training procedure involves minimizing a combined loss function that includes functional loss, aleatoric loss, and KL divergence for regularization, with models trained for 60k iterations using Adam optimizer.

## Key Results
- Achieves MSE of 0.004-0.007 for Poisson equation and 0.003-0.052 for Helmholtz equation, similar to deterministic KANs
- Correctly recovers scale parameters and functional dependencies in one-dimensional fits with stochastic terms
- Learned aleatoric uncertainty accurately captures true noise structure in SPDE applications
- Epistemic uncertainty remains low due to high quality of fits

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: The method provides both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty by defining posteriors over the basis functions and convolution weights.
- **Mechanism**: Epistemic uncertainty is captured through variational inference over the parameters of the basis functions (ei, si) and weights of the convolution layer. Aleatoric uncertainty is modeled by training a separate Bayesian KAN (surrogate model) to predict the output uncertainty directly from the data.
- **Core assumption**: The true uncertainty structure can be decomposed into epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) components, and both can be approximated through Bayesian inference over the network parameters.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "The method we propose is general in nature, providing access to both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties."
  - [section 3] "We define posteriors over the basis functions Ri,m(x), at both second (default ReLU-KAN) and higher order (m > 2) such that we can efficiently account for the uncertainty in our network."
  - [corpus] Related works like "Scalable Bayesian Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks" and "Uncertainty Quantification for Scientific Machine Learning using Sparse Variational Gaussian Process Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (SVGP KAN)" suggest active research in this area, but specific evidence of this exact decomposition is not provided in the corpus.
- **Break condition**: If the true uncertainty structure cannot be decomposed into epistemic and aleatoric components, or if the variational approximation fails to capture the true posterior distributions.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: The use of Higher Order ReLU basis functions enhances computational efficiency while maintaining expressiveness for complex functions.
- **Mechanism**: Higher Order ReLU basis functions (Ri,m(x) with m > 2) provide smoother derivatives compared to the standard square of ReLUs, which is crucial for solving partial differential equations with higher order derivatives. This smoothness allows for more efficient learning and better approximation of complex functions.
- **Core assumption**: The smoothness of higher order derivatives of the basis functions is a critical factor for the performance of the network on PDEs and other complex functions.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section 2] "the smoothness of higher order derivatives of the previously defined basis functions is a highly limiting factor, specifically for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) that posses higher order derivatives. As a result, they provide a more general framework, in which higher order basis functions (opposed to the square of ReLUs) are represented in Eq. 6."
  - [section 4.2] "The higher-order models are able to capture the complexity of the landscape to a higher degree."
  - [corpus] The paper "Higher-order-ReLU-KANs (HRKANs) for solving physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) more accurately, robustly and faster" directly addresses this mechanism, providing strong support.
- **Break condition**: If the higher order derivatives of the basis functions do not provide sufficient smoothness for the target application, or if the computational overhead of higher order functions outweighs the benefits.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: The combination of a functional KAN and a surrogate KAN for aleatoric uncertainty allows for efficient and accurate uncertainty quantification.
- **Mechanism**: The functional KAN learns the underlying function, while the surrogate KAN, which can inherit the structure of the functional KAN, learns the aleatoric uncertainty. This separation allows for more efficient training and better capture of the noise structure in the data.
- **Core assumption**: The aleatoric uncertainty can be effectively modeled by a separate network that learns the noise structure, and this network can benefit from inheriting the structure of the functional KAN.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section 3] "We instead represent the aleatoric uncertainty through a surrogate model, taking the form of another Bayesian KAN, depicted in Fig. 1."
  - [section 4.1] "The aleatoric term is captured with high fidelity under both likelihood assumptions."
  - [corpus] Limited direct evidence in the corpus for this specific mechanism of using a surrogate KAN for aleatoric uncertainty. Related works like "Scalable Bayesian Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks" suggest Bayesian approaches, but not this specific architecture.
- **Break condition**: If the aleatoric uncertainty cannot be effectively separated from the functional uncertainty, or if the surrogate KAN fails to learn the noise structure accurately.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Bayesian Inference
  - Why needed here: The entire method relies on Bayesian inference to define posteriors over the network parameters, allowing for uncertainty quantification.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in the context of Bayesian inference?
- **Concept**: Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem
  - Why needed here: KANs are based on this theorem, which states that any continuous multivariate function can be represented as a finite sum of continuous univariate functions.
  - Quick check question: How does the Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem relate to the structure of KANs?
- **Concept**: Variational Inference
  - Why needed here: Exact Bayesian inference is intractable for neural networks, so variational inference is used to approximate the posterior distributions over the parameters.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the evidence lower bound (ELBO) in variational inference?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Functional KAN -> Surrogate KAN -> Variational Inference -> Loss Function -> Training Loop
- **Critical path**: Functional KAN learns underlying function -> Surrogate KAN learns aleatoric uncertainty -> Variational inference approximates posteriors -> Combined loss function drives training
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Computational efficiency vs. expressiveness: Higher order basis functions provide smoother derivatives but increase computational cost
  - Model complexity vs. uncertainty quantification: More complex models can better capture uncertainty but are harder to train and interpret
  - Functional KAN structure vs. surrogate KAN performance: Inheriting the structure can improve performance but may limit flexibility
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Poor fit to the data: Indicates issues with the basis functions or training process
  - Overestimated or underestimated uncertainty: Suggests problems with the variational inference or the surrogate KAN
  - High computational cost: May indicate the need for optimization or simplification of the model
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Fit a simple 1D function (e.g., sin(πx)) with and without noise to validate the basic functionality and uncertainty quantification
  2. Solve a simple PDE (e.g., Poisson equation) without noise to test the higher order basis functions and functional KAN
  3. Solve a PDE with noise to validate the aleatoric uncertainty quantification and the surrogate KAN
