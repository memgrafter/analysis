# Comparative Analysis of Listwise Reranking with Large Language Models in Limited-Resource Language Contexts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.20061
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20061
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: LLMs significantly outperform BM25-DT in cross-lingual reranking for low-resource African languages

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates large language models (LLMs) for listwise reranking in cross-lingual retrieval scenarios involving low-resource African languages. The research compares proprietary models RankGPT3.5, RankGPT4o-mini, RankGPTo1-mini, and RankClaude-sonnet against traditional BM25-DT baselines using CIRAL test collections with English queries and passages translated from Hausa, Somali, Swahili, and Yoruba. Results show LLMs significantly outperform BM25-DT across all languages, with RankGPTo1-mini achieving the highest scores in nDCG@10 and MRR@100 metrics. The study demonstrates that LLMs effectively handle cross-lingual reranking tasks for limited-resource languages, offering substantial performance improvements over traditional methods while highlighting the potential for cost-effective solutions in multilingual information retrieval.

## Method Summary
The study employs a listwise reranking approach using four proprietary LLMs (RankGPT3.5, RankGPT4o-mini, RankGPTo1-mini, RankClaude-sonnet) to rerank documents retrieved by BM25-DT from the CIRAL test collection. English queries are used with passages translated from four African languages (Hausa, Somali, Swahili, Yoruba). The LLM rerankers process the top 100 BM25-DT results using zero-shot translations to English, generating ranked lists that are evaluated using nDCG@10 and MRR@100 metrics.

## Key Results
- LLMs significantly outperform BM25-DT across all four African languages
- RankGPTo1-mini achieves the highest nDCG@10 and MRR@100 scores
- Performance improvements vary by language, with Yoruba showing the most benefit from reranking
- Listwise reranking with LLMs provides substantial performance gains over traditional methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs achieve superior reranking performance for low-resource languages through semantic understanding beyond term-frequency matching.
- Mechanism: Traditional methods like BM25-DT rely on exact term matching and frequency statistics. LLMs leverage contextual embeddings and pre-trained knowledge to capture semantic relationships, enabling them to identify relevant documents even when exact terms don't match.
- Core assumption: The LLM's pre-training data includes sufficient multilingual coverage to understand cross-lingual semantic relationships, even for low-resource languages.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "LLMs, on the other hand, leverage pre-trained knowledge and are capable of capturing semantic relationships, even in cross-lingual scenarios."
  - [section] "These models consider multiple documents to generate a ranked list."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related papers focus on efficiency improvements rather than multilingual semantic capabilities

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Cross-lingual translation quality directly impacts LLM reranking performance for low-resource languages.
- Mechanism: The study uses zero-shot translations from African languages to English before reranking. The quality of these translations determines how well the LLM can process and rank the content.
- Core assumption: Even imperfect translations preserve enough semantic information for the LLM to make meaningful relevance judgments.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Our prompt: Documents: {doc } Translate this doc from {African language} to {certain language}. Only return the translation, don't say any other word."
  - [section] "Additionally, it's possible that the reranking performance of LLMs in African language scenarios benefits from high-quality translations, which we will demonstrate further."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus about translation quality impact on reranking

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Listwise reranking with LLMs outperforms pointwise approaches for limited-resource languages due to better context utilization.
- Mechanism: LLMs can process multiple documents simultaneously within their context window, allowing them to make ranking decisions based on relative document relationships rather than individual document scoring.
- Core assumption: The context window (4096-65536 tokens across models) can accommodate enough documents to make meaningful pairwise/comparative judgments.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Listwise approaches are particularly advantageous due to the large context size that LLMs can handle."
  - [section] "Due to the limitations of the context window, BM25 retrieves only the top 100 most relevant documents for each query."
  - [corpus] Strong evidence - multiple related papers (Self-Calibrated Listwise Reranking, Rank-K) focus on listwise approaches

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) fundamentals
  - Why needed here: The study operates in a cross-lingual context where queries are in English but documents are in African languages, requiring understanding of translation and retrieval challenges.
  - Quick check question: What are the three main approaches to CLIR (document translation, query translation, and interlingual indexing), and which does this study use?

- Concept: Listwise vs. pointwise reranking methods
  - Why needed here: The study specifically uses listwise reranking with LLMs, which is fundamentally different from traditional pointwise methods that score documents independently.
  - Quick check question: How does listwise reranking differ from pointwise reranking in terms of input to the ranking model and output format?

- Concept: Evaluation metrics for ranking systems (nDCG, MRR)
  - Why needed here: The study reports nDCG@10 and MRR@100, which measure different aspects of ranking quality at different cutoff points.
  - Quick check question: What's the key difference between nDCG and MRR as ranking evaluation metrics, and when would each be more appropriate?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - CIRAL test collection (English queries + African language passages)
  - BM25-DT retriever (initial candidate selection, top 100)
  - LLM reranker (RankGPT3.5, RankGPT4o-mini, RankGPTo1-mini, RankClaude-sonnet)
  - Translation module (zero-shot document translation to English)
  - Evaluation pipeline (nDCG@10 and MRR@100 calculation)

- Critical path:
  1. Query and document collection from CIRAL
  2. Document translation to English
  3. BM25-DT retrieval (top 100)
  4. LLM listwise reranking
  5. Evaluation metric calculation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Context window vs. document count: Larger context windows allow more documents but increase latency and cost
  - Translation quality vs. computational cost: Zero-shot translation is cheaper but potentially less accurate than supervised approaches
  - Reranking depth (top 100) vs. comprehensive evaluation: Deeper reranking is more expensive but potentially more accurate

- Failure signatures:
  - Low nDCG@10 but high MRR@100: LLM is finding some highly relevant documents but failing to properly order the top results
  - Similar performance across all languages: Suggests the LLM isn't adapting to language-specific characteristics
  - Translation errors causing incorrect rankings: Check for systematic errors in translated documents

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Vary the number of documents retrieved by BM25-DT (e.g., top 50, 100, 200) to find the optimal balance for each LLM's context window
  2. Compare zero-shot translation with a small set of supervised translations for a subset of documents to quantify translation quality impact
  3. Test different prompt formulations for the LLM reranker to optimize for cross-lingual scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do the performance characteristics of listwise reranking with LLMs vary across different low-resource African languages, and what linguistic factors contribute to these variations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that while all LLMs outperform BM25 DT, the degree of improvement varies depending on the language, with Yoruba consistently benefiting the most from reranking, while Hausa shows more modest gains.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies performance variations but does not provide a detailed linguistic analysis of why certain languages perform better than others.
- What evidence would resolve it: A linguistic analysis comparing syntactic and semantic characteristics of Hausa, Somali, Swahili, and Yoruba, along with their impact on LLM reranking performance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the relationship between the quality of machine-translated passages and the reranking performance of LLMs in cross-lingual scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "it's possible that the reranking performance of LLMs in African language scenarios benefits from high-quality translations, which we will demonstrate further."
- Why unresolved: The paper suggests this relationship but does not provide empirical evidence or detailed analysis of how translation quality affects reranking performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments varying translation quality and measuring corresponding changes in LLM reranking performance across different languages.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do open-source LLMs compare to proprietary models like RankGPT and RankClaude in listwise reranking tasks for low-resource languages?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that "Due to the increasing effectiveness of open-source LLMs in this area, they hold great potential for enhancing tasks involving low-resource languages," but does not provide direct comparisons.
- Why unresolved: The paper discusses open-source LLMs as a future direction but does not evaluate their current performance against proprietary models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Direct performance comparisons between open-source LLMs (e.g., LLaMA, Mistral) and proprietary models using the same CIRAL test collection and evaluation metrics.

## Limitations
- Reliance on proprietary LLMs prevents full reproducibility and independent verification
- CIRAL test collection not publicly available, making direct replication impossible
- Zero-shot translation approach introduces uncertainty about translation quality across different African languages
- Does not explore supervised translation methods or optimal reranking depths beyond top 100 documents

## Confidence
**High Confidence**: The core finding that LLMs significantly outperform BM25-DT for cross-lingual reranking in low-resource languages is well-supported by reported metrics and logical mechanism of semantic understanding.

**Medium Confidence**: The assertion that RankGPTo1-mini achieves the highest scores is supported by data but requires verification since exact metric values are not provided.

**Low Confidence**: Claims about specific mechanisms by which LLMs handle low-resource languages (e.g., extent of multilingual coverage in pre-training data) cannot be verified without access to models' training data and architecture details.

## Next Checks
1. **Translation Quality Impact**: Conduct controlled experiment comparing zero-shot translation with professionally translated documents to quantify impact on reranking performance.

2. **Context Window Optimization**: Systematically vary BM25-DT retrieval depth (top 50, 100, 200) for each LLM to identify optimal reranking depth balancing performance and computational costs.

3. **Cross-Lingual Generalization**: Test LLMs on a held-out African language not included in the original study to assess generalizability of cross-lingual reranking approach.
