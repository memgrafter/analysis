# GaNDLF-Synth: A Framework to Democratize Generative AI for (Bio)Medical Imaging

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.00173
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00173
- Reference count: 16
- GaNDLF-Synth enables zero/low-code generative AI for biomedical imaging through unified support for autoencoders, GANs, and diffusion models

## Executive Summary
GaNDLF-Synth is a framework designed to democratize generative AI for biomedical imaging by providing a zero/low-code interface for training and evaluating synthesis models. Built on the GaNDLF-Core and MONAI-Gen libraries, it supports diverse data modalities and distributed computing, ensuring scalability and reproducibility. The framework lowers the entry barrier for clinical and computational researchers by automating complex tasks like model design, training, and hyperparameter tuning.

Validation on publicly available datasets showed that diffusion models produced the most realistic synthetic images but required significant inference time (~312 hours per sample), while autoencoders were faster (~1 second per sample) and still performed well. GaNDLF-Synth aims to make generative AI more accessible and extensible for healthcare applications while maintaining the flexibility needed for advanced research.

## Method Summary
GaNDLF-Synth builds on MONAI-Gen and GaNDLF-Core to provide a unified framework for training autoencoders, GANs, and diffusion models. Users configure experiments via YAML files, which are automatically parsed and validated. The framework supports distributed computing through DeepSpeed integration and integrates with MLOps tools for experiment tracking. Validation was performed on publicly available datasets using first-order radiomic features to compare synthetic and real images, with diffusion models showing superior realism but requiring substantially more inference time.

## Key Results
- Diffusion models produced the most realistic synthetic images among the three synthesis algorithms tested
- Autoencoders achieved reasonable performance with inference times of ~1 second per sample, compared to ~312 hours for diffusion models
- The framework successfully validated on publicly available datasets with de-identified medical imaging data
- GaNDLF-Synth provides unified support for multiple synthesis algorithms while maintaining flexibility through YAML-based configuration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GaNDLF-Synth reduces the expertise barrier for clinical researchers by automating complex tasks like model design, training, and hyperparameter tuning.
- Mechanism: The framework provides a zero/low-code interface where users configure experiments via YAML files, which are automatically parsed and validated. This removes the need for extensive programming knowledge while maintaining flexibility for advanced users.
- Core assumption: Users can effectively configure synthesis tasks through structured text files without needing deep computational expertise.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "lower the entry barrier for clinical and computational researchers by automating complex tasks like model design, training, and hyperparameter tuning"
  - [section] "GaNDLF-Synth adopts a zero/low code approach... allowing users to configure experiments via YAML files (i.e., structured text files) that are automatically parsed and validated"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence about zero/low-code approaches in neighboring papers; this appears to be a unique contribution of GaNDLF-Synth

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: GaNDLF-Synth democratizes generative AI by providing unified support for multiple synthesis algorithms (AE, GAN, Diff) on the same data.
- Mechanism: The framework creates a unified abstraction layer that can communicate with various synthesis approaches, each with heterogeneous training mechanisms, allowing researchers to compare different methods without rebuilding pipelines.
- Core assumption: Different synthesis algorithms can be effectively abstracted under a unified interface while maintaining their unique characteristics and requirements.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "GaNDLF-Synth describes a unified abstraction for various synthesis algorithms, including autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models"
  - [section] "By ensuring a unified abstraction layer that can communicate with multiple types of synthesis approaches, GaNDLF-Synth alleviates many of these concerns regarding the design of the training pipeline"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - neighboring papers discuss various generative AI approaches but don't specifically address unified framework abstractions

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: GaNDLF-Synth enables scalable and reproducible research through distributed computing support and extensive unit testing.
- Mechanism: The framework natively supports distributed training strategies like DeepSpeed and data distributed parallel, while maintaining reproducibility through comprehensive unit testing and version-controlled configurations.
- Core assumption: Distributed computing can be effectively integrated into a user-friendly framework without compromising reproducibility.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "supports diverse data modalities and distributed computing, ensuring scalability and reproducibility through extensive unit testing"
  - [section] "GaNDLF-Synth also enables users to easily perform distributed computing i.e., the ability to utilize a wide array of heterogeneous compute capabilities... This enables GaNDLF-Synth to maximize throughput without requiring additional code"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence about distributed computing in generative AI frameworks in neighboring papers

## Foundational Learning

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Core framework (GaNDLF-Core) -> Synthesis extension (GaNDLF-Synth) -> Dependency libraries (PyTorch, Lightning, MONAI-Gen, SimpleITK) -> Configuration system (YAML) -> Distributed computing layer (DeepSpeed)
- Critical path: Data → YAML configuration → Framework parsing → Model training → Evaluation → Checkpointing
- Design tradeoffs: Zero/low-code interface vs. flexibility for advanced users; unified abstraction vs. algorithm-specific optimizations; ease of use vs. computational efficiency
- Failure signatures: Misconfigured YAML files causing training failures; incompatible algorithm-dataset combinations; distributed computing errors due to resource constraints
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train a simple autoencoder on a small publicly available medical imaging dataset using default configurations
  2. Compare the same dataset across all three synthesis algorithms (AE, GAN, Diff) using identical preprocessing
  3. Implement distributed training on a multi-GPU setup with the same model to measure scalability benefits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies measuring privacy leakage and security in federated learning scenarios using synthetic data generated by GANDLF-Synth, compared to real patient data.

## Limitations

- Validation was performed on publicly available datasets without specifying which datasets were used, limiting reproducibility
- Diffusion models showed significantly longer inference times (~312 hours per sample) compared to autoencoders (~1 second), potentially limiting practical utility
- The zero/low-code approach's effectiveness depends on users' ability to properly configure YAML files, which is not empirically validated in the paper

## Confidence

- Framework architecture and integration with existing libraries (High): The technical implementation details and library dependencies are well-specified and verifiable.
- Zero/low-code accessibility claims (Medium): While the approach is described, actual user testing data is not provided.
- Performance comparisons between synthesis algorithms (Medium): Results are presented but the specific evaluation methodology and datasets are not fully detailed.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct user studies with clinical researchers of varying computational expertise to empirically validate the zero/low-code interface effectiveness and identify usability barriers.

2. Test the framework on additional publicly available medical imaging datasets with standardized preprocessing and evaluation protocols to verify generalizability of results.

3. Implement benchmark comparisons with existing generative AI frameworks for medical imaging to assess whether GaNDLF-Synth's unified abstraction provides performance advantages or introduces computational overhead.
