# Human Speech Perception in Noise: Can Large Language Models Paraphrase to Improve It?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.04029
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04029
- Reference count: 20
- Key outcome: Standard prompting struggles to control acoustic intelligibility, but a prompt-and-select approach achieves 40% relative improvement in human speech perception for noisy utterances.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether large language models can generate paraphrases that improve human speech perception in noisy conditions. The authors introduce a novel task called Paraphrase to Improve Speech Perception in Noise (PI-SPiN), where the goal is to generate text that is both semantically equivalent to the input and more acoustically intelligible in adverse listening conditions. They find that standard prompting approaches struggle to control the non-textual attribute of acoustic intelligibility, even though they capture textual attributes like semantic equivalence well. To address this, they propose a simple two-step approach called "prompt-and-select": first generating multiple paraphrase candidates using a prompt focused on textual attributes, then selecting the best candidate based on acoustic intelligibility measured by the short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) metric. Human evaluation shows this approach leads to a 40% relative improvement in speech perception for highly distorted utterances in babble noise at -5 dB SNR.

## Method Summary
The authors evaluate LLMs for generating paraphrases that are acoustically intelligible in noisy conditions. They use 300 short English sentences from the Switchboard corpus, each 10-12 words, mixed with babble noise from NOISEX-92 at -5 dB SNR. They implement zero-shot prompting with ChatGPT, comparing standard prompting (three prompt variations) against a "prompt-and-select" approach that generates multiple candidates and selects the best based on STOI. Evaluation metrics include semantic equivalence (STS), lexical deviation (LD), utterance length (PhLen), linguistic predictability (PPL), and acoustic intelligibility (STOI). The prompt-and-select approach generates 6 paraphrases per sentence using a medium-prompt, then selects the one with highest PWR-STOI. Human evaluation with native English listeners verifies improvements in speech perception.

## Key Results
- Standard prompting approaches struggle to optimize acoustic intelligibility while capturing textual attributes like semantic equivalence
- The prompt-and-select approach achieves a 40% relative improvement in human speech perception for highly distorted utterances in babble noise at -5 dB SNR
- Increasing the number of candidates improves acoustic intelligibility but may reduce semantic equivalence due to increased lexical deviation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs struggle to directly generate text with both textual and non-textual attributes due to the non-textual attribute being outside the model's learned representation space.
- Mechanism: When prompted with instructions to generate acoustically intelligible text, the model interprets all attributes textually, leading to hallucination or failure to optimize the non-textual attribute.
- Core assumption: Acoustic intelligibility is not directly representable in the LLM's learned text space and cannot be optimized through textual prompts alone.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "with standard prompting, LLMs struggle to control the non-textual attribute, i.e., acoustic intelligibility, while efficiently capturing the desired textual attributes like semantic equivalence."
  - [section] "we found that the model was able to capture textual attributes, while consistently struggling to improve acoustic intelligibility."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence, inferred from paper findings.
- Break condition: If a metric that directly maps non-textual attributes to text space is introduced, the mechanism may break.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Decoupling textual and non-textual attribute optimization through a two-step prompt-and-select approach allows effective control over both attributes.
- Mechanism: First generate multiple paraphrases optimized for textual attributes, then select the best candidate based on the non-textual attribute metric, effectively optimizing both attributes in sequence.
- Core assumption: The non-textual attribute can be accurately measured and used for selection without needing to be represented in the generation space.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our approach resulted in a 40% relative improvement in human speech perception... by paraphrasing utterances that are highly distorted in a listening condition with babble noise at signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) −5 dB."
  - [section] "We found that by increasing the candidate set, there is an improvement in acoustic intelligibility."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence, inferred from paper methodology.
- Break condition: If the non-textual attribute metric is not accurate or the candidate set is too small, the mechanism may break.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The effectiveness of the prompt-and-select approach depends on the number of candidates generated, with a trade-off between improvement in non-textual attributes and maintenance of textual attributes.
- Mechanism: Increasing the number of candidates improves the likelihood of finding paraphrases with better non-textual attributes, but may reduce semantic equivalence due to increased lexical deviation.
- Core assumption: There is a balance between optimizing for non-textual attributes and maintaining textual attributes that can be controlled by adjusting the number of candidates.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "we found that by increasing the candidate set, there is an improvement in acoustic intelligibility... However, when n is increased from 6 to 12, there was only a limited improvement of 1.6% in PWR-STOI."
  - [section] "Increasing n from 6 to 12 slightly reduced the overall semantic equivalence between the model input and output paraphrase."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence, inferred from paper analysis.
- Break condition: If the number of candidates is too large or too small, the mechanism may break.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Acoustic Intelligibility
  - Why needed here: Understanding how acoustic features contribute to speech perception in noise is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of paraphrases in improving speech intelligibility.
  - Quick check question: How does the Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI) metric measure acoustic intelligibility in noisy environments?

- Concept: Prompt Engineering
  - Why needed here: Designing effective prompts is essential for guiding LLMs to generate text with desired attributes, including both textual and non-textual attributes.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between zero-shot learning and few-shot learning in prompt engineering?

- Concept: Evaluation Metrics
  - Why needed here: Understanding and selecting appropriate evaluation metrics is crucial for assessing the quality of generated paraphrases in terms of both textual and non-textual attributes.
  - Quick check question: What are the advantages and disadvantages of using BERTScore for measuring semantic equivalence in paraphrase generation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: LLM -> TTS system -> Noise mixer -> Evaluation metrics -> Selection module
- Critical path: Generate paraphrases → Synthesize speech → Mix with noise → Calculate evaluation metrics → Select best paraphrase
- Design tradeoffs: Balancing the number of candidates generated (affecting non-textual attribute optimization) with the need to maintain textual attributes (semantic equivalence and lexical deviation)
- Failure signatures: If the non-textual attribute metric is not accurate, the selection step may fail to choose the best paraphrase. If the number of candidates is too small, the improvement in non-textual attributes may be limited.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the effectiveness of the prompt-and-select approach with different numbers of candidates (e.g., 1, 6, 12) on a small subset of the evaluation dataset.
  2. Compare the performance of the prompt-and-select approach with standard prompting methods on the full evaluation dataset.
  3. Conduct a human evaluation to verify whether the model-generated paraphrases via the prompt-and-select approach are indeed more intelligible than original sentences in a noisy listening environment.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper suggests fine-tuning LLMs on a dataset of acoustically intelligible paraphrases as a potential future direction, noting that their approach doesn't involve model training. They also highlight the need to explore whether their findings generalize to other types of noise beyond babble noise and to investigate which specific acoustic features beyond STOI contribute most to perceived intelligibility gains.

## Limitations

- The evaluation relies heavily on automated metrics (STS, LD, STOI) that may not fully capture human perceptual experiences
- The acoustic intelligibility metric (STOI) was originally designed for evaluating noisy speech, not paraphrased speech
- The study uses a single noise type (babble noise) at one SNR level (-5 dB), limiting generalizability to other acoustic conditions
- The approach's computational cost increases linearly with the number of candidates generated, which may not be practical for real-world deployment

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The claim that standard prompting approaches struggle to optimize non-textual attributes like acoustic intelligibility is well-supported by both quantitative metrics and human evaluation results.

**Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of the prompt-and-select approach is supported by both automated metrics and human evaluation, but with some caveats regarding generalizability and computational efficiency.

**Low Confidence**: The generalizability of these findings to other acoustic conditions, noise types, and languages remains uncertain due to the study's specific focus on babble noise at -5 dB SNR.

## Next Checks

1. **Multi-condition acoustic validation**: Test the prompt-and-select approach across a broader range of SNR levels (-10 dB to 0 dB) and different noise types (speech-shaped noise, street noise, competing speakers) to verify whether the 40% improvement generalizes beyond the specific conditions tested.

2. **Cross-linguistic generalizability**: Evaluate the approach with non-English sentences to determine whether the prompt-and-select method works across different languages, particularly those with different phonological structures and writing systems.

3. **Long-term perceptual effects**: Conduct longitudinal studies to assess whether the improved acoustic intelligibility from paraphrased speech leads to better learning outcomes or reduced listening effort over extended periods, rather than just immediate speech recognition improvements.
