# Unleashing The Power of Pre-Trained Language Models for Irregularly Sampled Time Series

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.08328
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08328
- Authors: Weijia Zhang; Chenlong Yin; Hao Liu; Hui Xiong
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: ISTS-PLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on ISTS across 6 datasets, outperforming 17 baselines with fewer parameters and maintaining zero-shot adaptation capability.

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of irregularly sampled time series (ISTS) analysis by adapting pre-trained language models (PLMs). Existing approaches focus on regularly sampled data, but ISTS exhibits non-uniform intervals, missing data, and asynchrony. The authors propose a series-based representation for ISTS and introduce ISTS-PLM, a unified framework using time-aware and variable-aware PLMs. These specialized PLMs replace positional embeddings with continuous-time and variable embeddings respectively, enabling effective modeling of intra- and inter-series dependencies. Experiments on six datasets across classification, interpolation, extrapolation, few-shot, and zero-shot tasks demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance.

## Method Summary
ISTS-PLM uses a two-stage approach: first, a time-aware PLM (based on GPT-2) with continuous-time embeddings models each variable's series independently, capturing irregular temporal dynamics. Second, a variable-aware PLM (based on BERT) with variable embeddings models correlations between variables. The framework employs a series-based representation where each variable's observations are organized into separate sequences. PLM parameters are frozen except layer normalization, with only the input embedding layer and task-specific output layer being trainable. The approach is evaluated on classification, interpolation, and extrapolation tasks across six datasets.

## Key Results
- ISTS-PLM consistently outperforms 17 competitive baselines across six datasets
- Maintains robust zero-shot adaptation capability while requiring fewer training parameters
- Series-based representation significantly improves performance over set/vector representations
- Time-aware and variable-aware PLMs effectively address intra- and inter-series modeling challenges

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Series-based representation enables PLMs to model intra- and inter-series dependencies more effectively than set- or vector-based representations.
- Mechanism: Series-based representation organizes each variable's observations into separate, ordered sequences, preserving temporal semantics and reducing noise from variable mixing. This structured input allows PLMs to leverage their strong sequence modeling capabilities.
- Core assumption: Temporal semantics and variable correlations are better preserved when each variable is modeled as a separate series rather than mixed in sets or vectors.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "series-based representation for ISTS" and "simple yet effective series-based representation"; [section 4.2.3] "Series-based representation method represents the time series of each variable separately"; [section 5.5] "the strategy of first modeling each variable's series independently, followed by modeling their correlations, significantly enhances the performance"
- Break condition: If ISTS contains very few observations per variable or inter-variable correlations are weak, benefits of separate series modeling may diminish.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Time-aware PLM with continuous-time embeddings enables PLMs to handle irregular time intervals effectively.
- Mechanism: Replaces standard positional embeddings with learnable continuous-time embeddings that encode actual time intervals between observations. This allows PLM to discern irregular dynamics within ISTS.
- Core assumption: Irregular sampling patterns contain meaningful temporal information capturable by continuous-time embeddings rather than fixed positional offsets.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "time-aware and variable-aware PLMs tailored to tackle the intractable intra- and inter-time series modeling"; [section 4.2] "we present time-aware PLM that replaces the positional embeddings of PLM with continuous-time embedding"; [section 5.3] "removing TA-PLM and continuous-time embeddings overall leads to a more substantial performance drop in interpolation and forecasting tasks"
- Break condition: If time intervals are randomly distributed without meaningful patterns, continuous-time embeddings may not capture useful information.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Variable-aware PLM with variable embeddings enables effective modeling of inter-series correlations despite asynchrony.
- Mechanism: After modeling each variable's series independently with time-aware PLM, a second PLM uses variable embeddings (replacing positional embeddings) to model correlations between variables. This handles asynchrony challenge by first summarizing each series, then comparing summaries.
- Core assumption: Variable correlations can be effectively modeled even when original time series are misaligned, by first summarizing each series and then comparing these summaries.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "variable-aware PLMs tailored to tackle the intractable intra- and inter-time series modeling"; [section 4.2.3] "we employ another variable-aware PLM...to tackle the challenging inter-time series correlations modeling"; [section 5.3] "removing VA-PLM generally results in a larger performance decrease in classification task"
- Break condition: If inter-variable correlations are extremely weak or number of variables is very large, variable-aware PLM may not effectively capture meaningful relationships.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Understanding of irregularly sampled time series characteristics (non-uniform intervals, missing data, asynchrony)
  - Why needed here: Entire approach is built around addressing these specific challenges that distinguish ISTS from regularly sampled time series
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between ISTS and RSTS that make standard PLM approaches ineffective?

- Concept: Familiarity with transformer architecture and positional embeddings
  - Why needed here: Work fundamentally modifies transformer architecture by replacing positional embeddings with time and variable embeddings
  - Quick check question: How do standard positional embeddings in transformers differ from continuous-time and variable embeddings used in this approach?

- Concept: Understanding of pre-trained language models and their adaptation methods
  - Why needed here: Approach freezes PLM parameters and only fine-tunes layer normalization, requiring understanding of when and why this strategy works
  - Quick check question: What are the advantages and limitations of freezing PLM parameters versus full fine-tuning for time series applications?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input embedding layer (time embedder, variable embedder, value embedder, mask embedder) -> Time-aware PLM -> Variable-aware PLM -> Task-specific output layer

- Critical path: ISTS → input embedding → time-aware PLM → variable-aware PLM → task output
  - For series-based representation: each variable processed independently through time-aware PLM, then variable-aware PLM models inter-variable correlations

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Series-based vs set/vector representations: series-based preserves temporal semantics better but requires separate processing per variable
  - Freezing PLMs vs fine-tuning: freezing reduces computational cost and prevents catastrophic forgetting but may limit task-specific adaptation
  - Two-stage PLM approach: handles asynchrony but adds complexity and computational overhead

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on interpolation/extrapolation: likely indicates time-aware PLM not capturing temporal dynamics effectively
  - Poor performance on classification: likely indicates variable-aware PLM not capturing inter-variable correlations
  - No improvement over baselines: likely indicates representation method not preserving necessary information

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test series-based representation with simple MLP classifier (no PLMs) to verify representation quality
  2. Test time-aware PLM with fixed positional embeddings (no continuous-time) to isolate time modeling effect
  3. Test variable-aware PLM with fixed positional embeddings (no variable embeddings) to isolate variable modeling effect

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different continuous-time embedding functions (beyond the sinusoidal approach used) affect the performance of time-aware PLMs for ISTS?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors propose a time embedder using sinusoidal functions to encode continuous-time information, but do not explore alternative continuous-time encoding methods.
- Why unresolved: The paper only uses one specific continuous-time embedding approach without comparing it to other possible functions (e.g., polynomial, exponential, learned embeddings) that could potentially capture temporal dynamics differently.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments using different continuous-time embedding functions (polynomial, exponential, learned) across the same ISTS tasks and datasets would reveal whether the sinusoidal approach is optimal or if alternatives perform better.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of ISTS-PLM scale with increasing numbers of variables and missing data ratios in real-world applications?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates on datasets with up to 96 variables and mentions "prevalent missing data" but does not systematically vary the number of variables or missing data ratios to test scalability limits.
- Why unresolved: The experiments use fixed dataset configurations without exploring how performance degrades as variable count increases or missing data becomes more severe, which is critical for real-world deployment.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments that systematically increase variable counts and missing data ratios across datasets, measuring performance degradation, would establish the practical limits and scalability of ISTS-PLM.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of variable-aware PLM on capturing cross-variable dependencies compared to simpler correlation modeling approaches?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors claim the variable-aware PLM "facilitates the understanding of variable-specific characteristics" but do not compare it against simpler approaches like direct correlation matrices or attention mechanisms without variable embeddings.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not benchmark the variable-aware PLM against simpler correlation modeling techniques to demonstrate whether its complexity is justified by performance gains.
- What evidence would resolve it: Head-to-head comparisons between ISTS-PLM with variable-aware PLM and equivalent models using simpler correlation modeling (e.g., correlation matrices, basic attention) on the same tasks would reveal whether the additional complexity provides measurable benefits.

## Limitations
- Representation bottleneck: Series-based representation assumes variable-wise independence initially, which may lose cross-variable dependencies present in raw ISTS
- Pre-training dependency: Performance heavily relies on PLMs pre-trained on large text corpora
- Scalability concerns: Quadratic scaling with variable count may limit applicability to datasets with many variables

## Confidence
- High confidence in series-based representation effectiveness - Multiple ablation studies and cross-dataset experiments consistently show superior performance
- Medium confidence in zero-shot capability - Promising results but limited to classification tasks on two datasets only
- Medium confidence in parameter efficiency claim - Fewer trainable parameters reported, but computational complexity comparisons not thoroughly analyzed

## Next Checks
1. Cross-PLM validation: Test ISTS-PLM with different pre-trained PLMs (e.g., RoBERTa, T5) to assess whether performance gains generalize across architectures
2. Temporal pattern analysis: Systematically evaluate performance on ISTS with different temporal characteristics (e.g., periodic vs. random sampling) to identify when time-aware embeddings provide most benefit
3. Variable correlation stress test: Create synthetic ISTS with varying degrees of inter-variable correlation to quantify when variable-aware modeling becomes critical versus when simpler approaches suffice
