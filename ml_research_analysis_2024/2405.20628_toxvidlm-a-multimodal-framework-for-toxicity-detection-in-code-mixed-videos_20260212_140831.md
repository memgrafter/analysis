# ToxVidLM: A Multimodal Framework for Toxicity Detection in Code-Mixed Videos

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.20628
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20628
- Reference count: 16
- Achieves 94.29% accuracy and 94.35% weighted F1 score for toxicity detection in code-mixed Hindi-English videos

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of detecting toxic content in code-mixed Hindi-English video data, introducing the ToxCMM benchmark dataset and proposing ToxVidLM, a multimodal multitask framework. The framework leverages language models alongside video and audio encoders, incorporating a cross-modal synchronization module and gated fusion mechanism. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating multiple modalities significantly improves toxic content detection performance, achieving state-of-the-art results across toxicity, severity, and sentiment classification tasks.

## Method Summary
ToxVidLM is a multimodal multitask framework that processes text, audio, and video inputs from code-mixed Hindi-English videos. The framework uses pre-trained encoders (HingRoberta/GPT2 for text, Whisper/MMS for audio, VideoMAE/TimeSformer for video) and employs cross-modal synchronization through Multi-Head Cross Attention where text serves as reference for aligning audio and video representations. A gated fusion mechanism dynamically weights modality contributions, and the shared encoder generates representations for three task-specific heads (toxicity, severity, sentiment). The model is trained using Adam optimizer with cosine annealing learning rate scheduler on the ToxCMM dataset.

## Key Results
- Achieves 94.29% accuracy and 94.35% weighted F1 score for toxicity detection
- Outperforms all baseline models by substantial margins across all three tasks
- Ablation studies show gated fusion improves performance by 1.72-3.13% across tasks
- Multitask learning with shared encoder consistently outperforms single-task approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Gated fusion of video and audio soft tokens significantly improves toxicity detection performance
- The gated fusion module computes learned weights α for each modality using sigmoid activation, dynamically adjusting contributions based on relevance
- Core assumption: Different video samples benefit from different relative contributions of audio and visual modalities
- Evidence: Ablation study shows removing gated fusion decreases F1-score by 1.72% for toxicity, 2.73% for severity, and 3.13% for sentiment
- Break condition: If gated fusion learns degenerate solution (α always close to 0 or 1), model loses multimodal integration benefit

### Mechanism 2
- Cross-modal synchronization using text-guided attention improves feature alignment across modalities
- Uses Multi-Head Cross Attention where text embeddings serve as both keys and values to align audio and video representations
- Core assumption: Text modality provides most reliable semantic signal for toxic content detection
- Evidence: The procedure involves abstract feature extraction, MHCA for modality alignment, and gated fusion for combining representations
- Break condition: If text modality is noisy or ambiguous in code-mixed scenarios, errors could propagate to other modalities

### Mechanism 3
- Multitask learning with shared encoder improves performance by leveraging correlations between tasks
- Single encoder processes multimodal input and generates shared representations for task-specific heads
- Core assumption: Features useful for toxicity detection overlap significantly with those needed for severity and sentiment analysis
- Evidence: Multitask model achieves weighted F1-Scores of 94.35%, 86.84%, and 83.42% for toxicity, severity, and sentiment respectively
- Break condition: If tasks have conflicting gradients or shared encoder becomes too specialized for one task

## Foundational Learning

- **Multimodal representation learning**: Needed to combine information from text, audio, and video modalities for comprehensive toxic content detection
  - Quick check: Why can't we simply concatenate embeddings from different modalities instead of using cross-modal attention?

- **Cross-attention mechanisms**: Needed to align representations from different modalities in common semantic space using text as reference
  - Quick check: How does using text as both query and value in MHCA differ from using it only as query?

- **Multitask learning optimization**: Needed to simultaneously optimize for toxicity, severity, and sentiment detection while leveraging shared features
  - Quick check: What happens to loss function when tasks have imbalanced performance or different learning rates?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Text encoder → Cross-modal synchronization (MHCA + Gated Fusion) → Multitask module with task-specific heads → Output layer
- **Critical path**: Input → Encoders (text, audio, video) → Cross-modal synchronization → Multitask module → Classification heads
- **Design tradeoffs**: Trades parameter efficiency (single encoder for all tasks) against potential task interference; uses gated fusion instead of concatenation for dynamic modality weighting
- **Failure signatures**: Performance degradation when removing cross-modal synchronization suggests heavy reliance on modality alignment; gated fusion should learn to minimize contribution of consistently underperforming modalities
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Compare unimodal baselines (text-only, audio-only, video-only) to establish baseline performance
  2. Test bimodal combinations (text+audio, text+video) to identify most complementary modality pairing
  3. Evaluate ablation study by removing gated fusion and MHCA components to quantify individual contributions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Context incorporation**: How does performance change when incorporating context from entire video clip instead of treating each utterance as standalone input? The authors acknowledge not considering video clip context and suggest future work will incorporate entire video as input.

- **Implicit toxicity detection**: Can the framework be extended to detect implicit or indirect toxic expressions in code-mixed videos? The study focused on explicit markers of toxicity and excluded implicit/indirect expressions.

- **Larger language models**: How does performance change when using larger pre-trained language models like OpenHathi-7B or Llama 2-7B in text encoder? Due to computational limitations, authors couldn't experiment with larger models but note the framework can accommodate them.

## Limitations

- **Data scale limitations**: ToxCMM dataset contains only 931 videos with 4,021 utterances, relatively small for training complex multimodal models
- **Evaluation scope constraints**: Primarily evaluates on single dataset without extensive cross-dataset validation or out-of-domain testing
- **Implementation specificity**: Critical architectural details for gated fusion and cross-modal synchronization modules not fully specified, making exact reproduction challenging

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Multimodal integration improves toxicity detection performance (well-supported by ablation studies showing consistent performance drops)
- **Medium confidence**: Specific architectural mechanisms (gated fusion, cross-modal synchronization) are important but lack comparison with alternative strategies
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability of results due to evaluation limited to single dataset with specific characteristics (Hindi-English code-mixed videos)

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study replication**: Systematically remove gated fusion and cross-modal synchronization modules to verify individual contributions; compare with alternative fusion strategies (concatenation, attention-based fusion)

2. **Cross-dataset evaluation**: Test trained model on external toxicity detection datasets (Jigsaw datasets, other multimodal corpora) to assess generalization beyond ToxCMM

3. **Component sensitivity analysis**: Perform sensitivity analysis on gated fusion mechanism by visualizing learned weights (α values) across different video samples; analyze appropriate weight assignment and investigate failure cases
