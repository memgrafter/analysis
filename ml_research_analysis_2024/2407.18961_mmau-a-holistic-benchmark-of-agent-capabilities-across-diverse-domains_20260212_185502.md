# MMAU: A Holistic Benchmark of Agent Capabilities Across Diverse Domains

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2407.18961
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18961
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: MMAU evaluates LLM agent capabilities across five domains using 20 tasks with over 3K prompts, revealing that GPT-4 variants excel in understanding and planning while self-correction remains challenging.

## Executive Summary
MMAU introduces a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the fundamental capabilities of LLM agents across five diverse domains: Tool-use, DAG QA, Data Science & Machine Learning coding, Contest-level programming, and Mathematics. Unlike traditional benchmarks focused on task completion, MMAU disentangles five core capabilities—Understanding, Reasoning, Planning, Problem-solving, and Self-correction—using offline tasks with static datasets to ensure reliability and reproducibility. The benchmark evaluates 18 models across 3,220 prompts, revealing significant performance gaps between commercial and open-source models, particularly in tool-use and coding tasks. MMAU provides a holistic framework for assessing agent strengths and limitations, highlighting that balanced capabilities are indicative of stronger, more generalist agents.

## Method Summary
MMAU evaluates LLM agents using 20 tasks across five domains with over 3K prompts, focusing on five core capabilities: Understanding, Reasoning, Planning, Problem-solving, and Self-correction. The benchmark uses static datasets to ensure reproducibility and eliminate environment setup complexity, employing deterministic settings (temperature 0, greedy search) for consistent results. Evaluation includes both capability-centric analysis (isolating individual skills) and domain-centric analysis (assessing performance across domains), with results aggregated to provide insights into model strengths and limitations.

## Key Results
- GPT-4 variants excel in understanding and planning capabilities across all domains
- Self-correction remains challenging for most models, with significant performance gaps between commercial and open-source models
- Commercial models significantly outperform open-source models in tool-use and coding tasks, while performance gaps are less pronounced in mathematical reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: MMAU evaluates LLM agent capabilities in a disentangled manner by isolating core skills from task completion.
- Mechanism: The benchmark decomposes evaluation into five core capabilities (Understanding, Reasoning, Planning, Problem-solving, Self-correction) and uses tasks like planner-shift and solver-shift to test each independently.
- Core assumption: Isolating capabilities through controlled task design yields clearer insights than end-to-end task completion.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "It disentangles five core capabilities: Understanding, Reasoning, Planning, Problem-solving, and Self-correction."
  - [section] "Unlike standard end-to-end evaluations, planner-shift divides the solution generation into two stages."
- Break condition: If tasks cannot truly isolate capabilities without cross-skill interference, disentanglement fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: MMAU achieves reliability and reproducibility by using offline tasks with static datasets instead of interactive environments.
- Mechanism: All tasks are performed on a curated 3K static dataset, eliminating environmental stochasticity and setup complexity.
- Core assumption: Static datasets can adequately represent the diversity and complexity of interactive scenarios.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "unlike existing benchmarks focused on task completion, MMAU evaluates capabilities independently using offline tasks, eliminating the need for complex environment setups."
  - [section] "all tasks in MMAU are performed on our 3K static dataset to eliminate potential issues related to environment instability."
- Break condition: If static datasets fail to capture the dynamics needed for capability assessment, results become less generalizable.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: MMAU's comprehensive coverage across five domains with over 3K prompts enables holistic capability assessment.
- Mechanism: The benchmark integrates Tool-use, DAG QA, Data Science & ML coding, Contest-level programming, and Mathematics, each with domain-specific tasks.
- Core assumption: Covering diverse domains captures a broad spectrum of real-world agent challenges.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "evaluates models across five domains, including Tool-use, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) QA, Data Science and Machine Learning coding, Contest-level programming and Mathematics"
  - [section] "MMAU comprises a total of 3,220 distinct prompts gathered from diverse data sources."
- Break condition: If domain coverage is too narrow, capability gaps in underrepresented areas remain undetected.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Capability disentanglement
  - Why needed here: MMAU's value depends on accurately isolating and measuring distinct agent skills.
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes planner-shift from solver-shift in terms of capability isolation?

- **Concept**: Offline evaluation methodology
  - Why needed here: Ensures reproducibility and eliminates environmental noise in benchmarking.
  - Quick check question: How does MMAU's static dataset approach compare to interactive evaluation setups?

- **Concept**: Multi-domain benchmark design
  - Why needed here: Provides comprehensive assessment across varied real-world agent tasks.
  - Quick check question: Why does MMAU include both coding and mathematical domains?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Five capability modules (Understanding, Reasoning, Planning, Problem-solving, Self-correction) → domain-specific tasks → static datasets → capability and domain-centric analysis → aggregated results

- **Critical path**: 1) Curate diverse datasets from multiple sources 2) Design tasks that isolate capabilities 3) Evaluate 18 models across all tasks 4) Aggregate results for capability and domain analysis

- **Design tradeoffs**: Disentanglement requires more tasks but yields clearer insights; offline evaluation sacrifices some realism for reliability; broad domain coverage increases complexity but provides holistic assessment

- **Failure signatures**: Inconsistent performance across capability types indicates architecture limitations; poor self-correction scores suggest fundamental architecture issues; domain-specific failures highlight specialization gaps

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Evaluate a simple model on planner-shift vs solver-shift to observe capability separation
  2. Test model performance on static vs interactive tool-use tasks to compare evaluation approaches
  3. Compare capability balance across models to identify generalist vs specialist architectures

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can MMAU improve its capability decomposition to better disentangle compound capabilities and provide more granular insights?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges that "Our current approach to capability decomposition, though insightful, still faces challenges in disentangling compound capabilities" and suggests that "Future research should focus on developing more effective methods for decomposing and evaluating these capabilities."
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific methodologies or approaches for improving the disentanglement of compound capabilities within MMAU's evaluation framework.
- What evidence would resolve it: A novel approach or methodology for capability decomposition that demonstrates improved disentanglement of compound capabilities, resulting in more granular and interpretable evaluation results within MMAU.

## Limitations
- Static dataset approach may not fully capture dynamic real-world agent interactions and emergent behaviors
- Capability disentanglement effectiveness depends on tasks truly isolating individual skills without cross-skill interference
- Commercial model evaluation relies on API calls which may have usage limits, rate limits, and potential biases

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The benchmark's methodology for disentangling capabilities is well-founded and evaluation results are robust
- **Medium Confidence**: Performance gaps between commercial and open-source models are supported but may vary with different conditions
- **Low Confidence**: Self-correction challenges are based on current evaluations but may improve rapidly with newer model versions

## Next Checks
1. Replicate a subset of tool-use and coding tasks in an interactive environment to validate static dataset results
2. Systematically analyze specific tasks to quantify cross-skill interference and validate capability disentanglement
3. Evaluate model performance across multiple time points and API versions to determine stability of observed capability gaps
