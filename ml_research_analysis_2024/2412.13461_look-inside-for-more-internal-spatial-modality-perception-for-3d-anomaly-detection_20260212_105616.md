# Look Inside for More: Internal Spatial Modality Perception for 3D Anomaly Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.13461
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13461
- Authors: Hanzhe Liang; Guoyang Xie; Chengbin Hou; Bingshu Wang; Can Gao; Jinbao Wang
- Reference count: 8
- Primary result: 3.2% object-level and 13.1% pixel-level AUROC improvement on Real3D-AD benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Internal Spatial Modality Perception (ISMP), a novel method for 3D anomaly detection that addresses the limitation of traditional approaches focusing only on external structures. ISMP leverages internal spatial views through a Spatial Insight Engine (SIE) that generates multiple projection slices from both internal and external perspectives of point clouds. The method combines enhanced local feature extraction with a feature filtering module to reduce noise and align spatial structures, achieving significant performance improvements on benchmark datasets.

## Method Summary
ISMP introduces a novel approach to 3D anomaly detection by exploring feature representation from internal views. The method employs a Spatial Insight Engine to generate four projection slices (P1-P4) from both internal and external perspectives of point clouds. These slices are then processed through an enhanced feature extraction module that combines PointMAE and FPFH techniques for local feature amplification. A feature filtering module using Laplacian smoothing reduces noise and aligns precise spatial structures. The system computes anomaly scores by comparing features against memory banks of normal samples, achieving improved detection performance over traditional external-only methods.

## Key Results
- Achieves 3.2% object-level AUROC improvement on Real3D-AD benchmarks
- Achieves 13.1% pixel-level AUROC improvement on Real3D-AD benchmarks
- Demonstrates strong generalization ability across classification and segmentation tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Internal spatial views capture more information than external-only views, improving anomaly detection. By projecting the point cloud from both external and internal slices (P1-P4), the method gathers depth and shape data that external views alone cannot provide. The internal slices partition the point cloud into top, middle, and bottom regions, allowing cross-view discrepancy detection. Core assumption: Anomalies often manifest as deviations in internal spatial relationships not visible in single external projection. Break condition: If internal slices fail to align with point cloud's intrinsic coordinate system, or if anomalies are surface-only, additional information becomes redundant or misleading.

### Mechanism 2
Enhanced local feature extraction using FPFH and PointMAE amplifies spatial structure representation. The method samples center points with FPS, extracts patch features via PointMAE, then refines them with FPFH histograms. This creates richer local descriptors capturing both global shape and fine-grained geometric detail. Core assumption: Local neighborhood features, when combined with robust global views, yield better alignment for anomaly scoring. Break condition: If FPS radius r is too small or too large, extracted features will either miss context or include irrelevant points, hurting detection.

### Mechanism 3
Feature filtering with Laplacian smoothing reduces noise and aligns internal-external feature representations. A Laplacian matrix transforms the feature matrix, suppressing redundant variations while preserving intrinsic geometry. The filter is parameterized (α, β, γ) to control smoothing strength and anomaly weighting. Core assumption: Raw point cloud features are noisy and misaligned; smoothing them yields more discriminative representations. Break condition: Over-smoothing may erase subtle but critical anomaly signals, causing false negatives.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph-based filtering (Laplacian smoothing)
  - Why needed here: Point clouds are naturally graph-like; smoothing helps reduce high-frequency noise while preserving global shape.
  - Quick check question: What does the Laplacian matrix L = D - A represent in a point cloud context?

- Concept: Multi-view projection (4-slice method)
  - Why needed here: Multiple orthogonal projections capture different geometric perspectives, enabling cross-view anomaly verification.
  - Quick check question: Why are two middle slices (P2, P3) used instead of just one?

- Concept: Patch-based local feature extraction
  - Why needed here: Local patches around key points preserve fine-grained geometric details that global descriptors may miss.
  - Quick check question: How does the choice of FPS radius r affect the extracted patch features?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Point cloud registration (RANSAC) -> Spatial Insight Engine (SIE) generates 4 projection slices -> FPS sampling -> PointMAE patch features -> FPFH refinement -> Laplacian smoothing -> Memory banks comparison -> Anomaly score calculation

- Critical path: 1. Point cloud registration (RANSAC). 2. Generate 4 projection slices via SIE. 3. Extract local patch features (FPS → PointMAE → FPFH). 4. Apply feature filtering (Laplacian smoothing). 5. Compute anomaly scores using memory banks. 6. Output anomaly map.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. speed: SIE adds internal projections for better detection but increases computation.
  - Noise suppression vs. detail loss: Laplacian filtering reduces noise but risks erasing subtle anomalies.
  - Memory usage vs. recall: Larger memory banks improve nearest-neighbor recall but increase storage.

- Failure signatures:
  - Over-smoothing: Anomalies appear in normal regions (false positives).
  - Misaligned projections: Feature misalignment causes poor scoring.
  - Incorrect FPS radius: Patches too small → weak features; too large → noisy features.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate SIE by comparing P-AUROC with/without internal slices on a single category (e.g., airplane).
  2. Test Laplacian smoothing impact by varying α, β, γ and measuring variance reduction.
  3. Measure FPS radius sensitivity by sweeping r and recording local feature quality.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The method's computational complexity increases significantly due to the 4-slice projection strategy and multiple feature extraction steps, which could limit real-time deployment.
- The Laplacian-based feature filtering approach is justified primarily through general literature rather than specific validation for 3D anomaly detection.
- The specific parameterization of the Laplacian filtering module (α, β, γ values) and its optimal settings for different anomaly types lack empirical validation.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The overall performance improvements (3.2% object-level and 13.1% pixel-level AUROC gains) are well-documented through benchmark comparisons.
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of combining FPFH with PointMAE for local feature extraction, as this combination is novel and lacks direct corpus support.
- **Low confidence**: The specific parameterization of the Laplacian filtering module (α, β, γ values) and its optimal settings for different anomaly types.

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation study on projection slices**: Systematically evaluate the contribution of each of the four projection slices (P1-P4) by testing all possible combinations to quantify the marginal benefit of internal views versus external-only approaches.

2. **Laplacian parameter sensitivity analysis**: Conduct a comprehensive grid search over the α, β, γ parameters in the feature filtering module, measuring their impact on both anomaly detection accuracy and false positive rates across different point cloud categories.

3. **FPS radius impact evaluation**: Perform a detailed analysis of how the FPS sampling radius r affects local feature quality by systematically varying r and measuring the resulting change in anomaly detection performance, particularly for subtle versus obvious anomalies.
