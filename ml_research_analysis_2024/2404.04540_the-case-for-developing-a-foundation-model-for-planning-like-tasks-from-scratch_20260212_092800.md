core_contribution: The paper argues for the need to develop a specialized Foundation
  Model (FM) from scratch for Planning-like (PL) tasks, which include business processes,
  programs, workflows, and guidelines. Current approaches rely on pre-trained, off-the-shelf
  FMs that are fine-tuned, but these models lack the specificity to effectively handle
  the complex requirements of PL tasks, such as state, control flow, data flow, and
  execution semantics.

# The Case for Developing a Foundation Model for Planning-like Tasks from Scratch

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.04540
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04540

- The paper argues for developing a specialized Foundation Model from scratch for Planning-like tasks, which include business processes, programs, workflows, and guidelines.

## Executive Summary
The paper presents a compelling case for developing a specialized Foundation Model (FM) from scratch to address Planning-like (PL) tasks. Current approaches rely on fine-tuning pre-trained, off-the-shelf FMs, which lack the specificity to effectively handle the complex requirements of PL tasks, such as state management, control flow, data flow, and execution semantics. The authors propose a comprehensive FM that is compact, generalizable, and aware of temporal and execution considerations, aiming to revolutionize efficient PL problem-solving.

## Method Summary
The proposed method involves developing a specialized Foundation Model for Planning-like tasks from scratch, rather than relying on fine-tuning pre-trained models. This approach includes novel pre-training tasks such as Next Action Prediction, Conditional Branching Prediction, and Action-Effect Modeling to equip the model with the necessary skills. The FM will be evaluated using metrics like Plan Validity, Plan Optimality, and Compression Ratio. The development process will focus on creating a compact, generalizable model that is aware of temporal and execution considerations specific to PL tasks.

## Key Results
- Current fine-tuning approaches for PL tasks using off-the-shelf FMs are insufficient due to lack of specificity
- Proposed novel pre-training tasks aim to address the unique requirements of PL tasks
- The specialized FM could open new avenues for efficient PL problem-solving, similar to LLMs in Automated Planning and Scheduling

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The proposed approach works by creating a model specifically designed for PL tasks, addressing the limitations of current fine-tuning methods. By incorporating novel pre-training tasks that focus on action prediction, conditional branching, and action-effect modeling, the FM will develop a deep understanding of PL task characteristics. This specialized knowledge will enable the model to handle complex requirements such as state management, control flow, and execution semantics more effectively than general-purpose models.

## Foundational Learning
- Next Action Prediction: Why needed - To anticipate subsequent steps in PL tasks; Quick check - Evaluate accuracy of predicted actions in sample workflows
- Conditional Branching Prediction: Why needed - To handle decision points in PL tasks; Quick check - Assess model's ability to correctly identify branching conditions
- Action-Effect Modeling: Why needed - To understand cause-and-effect relationships in PL tasks; Quick check - Test model's predictions of outcomes based on given actions

## Architecture Onboarding
Component Map:
Specialized PL Task Encoder -> Novel Pre-training Modules -> Execution-Aware Decoder -> Evaluation Metrics

Critical Path:
Specialized PL Task Encoder -> Novel Pre-training Modules -> Execution-Aware Decoder

Design Tradeoffs:
- Model size vs. performance: Smaller, more compact models may be more efficient but could sacrifice some capabilities
- Pre-training task complexity vs. training time: More complex tasks may yield better results but require longer training periods
- Generalization vs. task-specific optimization: Balancing broad applicability with specialized PL task performance

Failure Signatures:
- Inability to handle complex branching structures in PL tasks
- Poor performance on tasks requiring long-term planning or state management
- Failure to generalize across different types of PL tasks (e.g., business processes vs. program workflows)

First Experiments:
1. Test Next Action Prediction accuracy on a small set of PL task examples
2. Evaluate Conditional Branching Prediction performance using a benchmark dataset
3. Assess Action-Effect Modeling capabilities on a simplified PL task scenario

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The proposed novel pre-training tasks have not been empirically validated for PL tasks
- The assumption that off-the-shelf FMs cannot effectively handle PL tasks without significant modifications remains theoretical
- Specific training dataset composition and size requirements for optimal performance are not yet defined
- Proposed evaluation metrics may not comprehensively capture all aspects of PL task performance

## Confidence
- High confidence in identified limitations of current fine-tuning approaches for PL tasks
- Medium confidence in proposed solution architecture, pending empirical validation
- Medium confidence in identified research gaps, based on existing literature review
- Low confidence in practical implementation details and resource requirements

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a systematic comparison study between fine-tuned off-the-shelf models and the proposed specialized FM on a standardized PL task benchmark
2. Develop and test the proposed pre-training tasks on a small-scale dataset to evaluate their effectiveness in capturing PL task characteristics
3. Create a prototype implementation to assess the feasibility of the proposed model architecture and training approach, measuring computational requirements and performance metrics
