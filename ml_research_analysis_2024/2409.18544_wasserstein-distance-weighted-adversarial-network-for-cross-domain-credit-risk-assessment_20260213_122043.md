# Wasserstein Distance-Weighted Adversarial Network for Cross-Domain Credit Risk Assessment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.18544
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18544
- Reference count: 17
- Primary result: WD-WADA achieves up to 28% improvement in precision and 19.4% increase in AUC for cross-domain credit risk assessment

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses cold start and data imbalance challenges in cross-domain credit risk assessment by proposing the Wasserstein Distance-Weighted Adversarial Domain Adaptation Network (WD-WADA). The method combines adversarial domain adaptation with Wasserstein distance for feature alignment and employs a weighted loss function to handle class imbalance. Experiments on real credit datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements over traditional methods, with WD-WADA achieving up to 28% better precision and 19.4% higher AUC scores.

## Method Summary
WD-WADA tackles cross-domain credit risk assessment by using a CNN feature extractor to process tabular credit data, then aligning source and target domain feature distributions through adversarial training using Wasserstein distance. The model addresses class imbalance through a weighted loss function that emphasizes minority class samples and hard-to-classify instances. The method was validated on Lending Club credit card loan data from 2007-2020, comparing performance against baseline models including CNN, DANN, and WD-ADA.

## Key Results
- Up to 28% improvement in precision compared to baseline models
- 19.4% increase in AUC for credit risk classification
- Superior robustness demonstrated by narrower confidence intervals in ROC analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Wasserstein distance provides a smoother and more stable measure of domain shift than Jensen-Shannon divergence used in traditional GAN-based domain adaptation.
- Mechanism: The model uses Wasserstein distance to estimate discrepancy between source and target domain feature distributions, minimized through adversarial training with gradient penalty for Lipschitz continuity.
- Core assumption: Wasserstein distance is a more reliable indicator of domain differences leading to better feature alignment.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states it "leverages the Wasserstein distance to align source and target domains effectively," section III.B describes learning invariant feature representations through adversarial training.
- Break condition: Feature distributions too dissimilar or gradient penalty not properly tuned can cause instability or failure to converge.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Weighted loss function addresses class imbalance by dynamically adjusting importance of minority class samples and hard-to-classify instances.
- Mechanism: Employs sample weighting strategy modifying cross-entropy loss with class proportion weighting and Focal Loss to emphasize minority and difficult samples.
- Core assumption: Emphasizing minority and hard-to-classify samples enables learning more discriminative features for underrepresented classes.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions "innovative weighted strategy to tackle data imbalance," section III.C describes adjusting sample importance based on class distribution and prediction difficulty.
- Break condition: Improper weighting parameter tuning can cause overfitting to minority samples or training instability.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: CNN feature extraction combined with adversarial domain adaptation enables effective knowledge transfer from source to target domains.
- Mechanism: CNN extracts features from tabular credit data, then adversarial training with Wasserstein distance aligns feature distributions, allowing source domain knowledge to improve target domain predictions.
- Core assumption: CNN-learned feature representations are transferable between domains and adversarial training effectively aligns them.
- Evidence anchors: Section III.A describes 38-dimensional structured data processed through CNN layers to 32-dimensional vector, section III.B mentions learning invariant feature representations through adversarial training.
- Break condition: Too dissimilar source/target domains or CNN failing to extract meaningful features can render knowledge transfer ineffective.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Adversarial Domain Adaptation
  - Why needed here: To address cold start problem where historical lending data is scarce in target domain
  - Quick check question: How does adversarial training help align feature distributions between source and target domains?

- Concept: Wasserstein Distance
  - Why needed here: To provide more stable and reliable measure of domain shift compared to traditional divergence measures
  - Quick check question: What is the advantage of using Wasserstein distance over Jensen-Shannon divergence in domain adaptation?

- Concept: Class Imbalance and Weighted Loss Functions
  - Why needed here: Credit risk data typically imbalanced with high-risk transactions being underrepresented
  - Quick check question: How does Focal Loss help address class imbalance problem in credit risk assessment?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: CNN Feature Extractor -> Domain Discriminator (Wasserstein distance) -> Label Classifier (weighted loss)

- Critical path:
  1. Extract features from source and target domain data using CNN
  2. Compute Wasserstein distance between feature distributions
  3. Update domain discriminator to minimize Wasserstein distance
  4. Update feature extractor to maximize Wasserstein distance (adversarial training)
  5. Classify source domain samples using label classifier with weighted loss
  6. Transfer learned features to target domain for prediction

- Design tradeoffs:
  - CNN vs. other feature extractors: CNN handles tabular data but may not be optimal for all credit datasets
  - Wasserstein distance vs. other divergence measures: Provides more stable training but requires careful gradient penalty tuning
  - Weighted loss vs. other imbalance handling techniques: Dynamically adjusts importance but requires weighting parameter tuning

- Failure signatures:
  - High Wasserstein distance between source and target domains: Indicates poor feature alignment
  - Low precision on minority class: Suggests weighted loss not effectively addressing class imbalance
  - Unstable training with oscillating losses: May indicate gradient penalty or learning rate issues

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train CNN feature extractor on source domain only, evaluate feature quality and domain shift
  2. Train adversarial domain adaptation with Wasserstein distance, monitor domain alignment and stability
  3. Implement weighted loss function, evaluate class imbalance handling and overall performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but several implications arise from the work.

## Limitations
- Evidence for Wasserstein distance superiority over traditional measures is weak with no direct citations supporting this specific application
- Class imbalance handling mechanism lacks detailed implementation specifications for precise replication
- Experimental results show strong quantitative improvements but confidence intervals for some metrics are not fully reported

## Confidence
- Wasserstein distance mechanism: Medium - Theoretical foundation established but specific evidence for credit risk applications is limited
- Weighted loss effectiveness: Medium - Approach is standard but exact implementation details are unclear
- Overall performance improvements: High - Multiple baselines compared with clear quantitative results

## Next Checks
1. Implement the exact weighted loss function by reverse-engineering from focal loss equation and class distribution weighting described
2. Compare Wasserstein distance-based domain alignment against Jensen-Shansen divergence on same credit risk dataset to validate claimed stability benefits
3. Perform ablation studies removing weighted loss component to isolate its contribution to reported precision improvements
