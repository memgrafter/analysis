# Towards Propositional KLM-Style Defeasible Standpoint Logics

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2410.04245
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04245
- **Reference count**: 28
- **Primary result**: Propositional KLM-style defeasible standpoint logic with rational closure characterized both algorithmically and semantically

## Executive Summary
This paper integrates standpoint logic and KLM defeasible reasoning to create a framework where multiple agents with possibly contradicting beliefs can reason defeasibly within a single system. The syntax is restricted so that standpoint modal operators can only be applied to KLM formulas, not to each other. Semantics are given via ranked standpoint structures combining ranked interpretations and standpoint structures. Rational closure is extended to this setting both algorithmically and semantically, with an algorithm (RCStandpoint) that splits the knowledge base into standpoint-specific KLM bases and checks entailment point-wise, while a single ranked standpoint structure (M_K^RC) characterizes the same closure. The algorithm runs in P^NP time, matching propositional KLM, and the semantic and algorithmic characterizations are proven equivalent.

## Method Summary
The method extends rational closure from propositional KLM to standpoint logic by first restricting standpoint modal operators to only apply to KLM formulas (not to each other). The RCStandpoint algorithm splits the DRSL knowledge base into standpoint-specific KLM bases using StandpointSplit, then applies propositional rational closure (RCProp) point-wise to check entailment. A single ranked standpoint structure M_K^RC is constructed that characterizes the same closure through its precisiﬁcations. The algorithm and semantic model are proven equivalent, both maintaining P^NP complexity.

## Key Results
- Integrated ranked interpretations and standpoint structures into a single semantic framework (ranked standpoint structures)
- Extended rational closure to standpoint logic both algorithmically (RCStandpoint) and semantically (M_K^RC)
- Proved equivalence between algorithmic and semantic characterizations of rational closure
- Maintained P^NP complexity matching propositional KLM

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The system combines ranked interpretations (for KLM) and standpoint structures (for multiple viewpoints) into a single semantic framework without increasing complexity.
- Mechanism: By constructing a ranked standpoint structure M_K^RC that assigns a ranked interpretation (from KLM rational closure) to each precisiﬁcation (from standpoint logic), the system can evaluate defeasible implications pointwise across all viewpoints.
- Core assumption: The set of standpoints S ∪ {∗} is closed under the knowledge base (no external standpoints).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We integrate ranked interpretations and standpoint structures... in order to introduce ranked standpoint structures for DRSL."
  - [section]: "The semantics we introduce to this standpoint logic follows the intuition given by Gómez Álvarez et al. [16] such that we define a set of 'precisiﬁcations' of formulas, which correspond to 'worlds' in a possible-worlds style semantics."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct evidence in corpus papers, though similar integration appears in "Extending Defeasibility for Propositional Standpoint Logics" which mentions combining defeasible conditionals with standpoint logic.
- Break condition: If external standpoints are queried without being named in the knowledge base, the system loses entailment guarantees as noted in Note 3.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The algorithmic and semantic characterizations of rational closure are equivalent, both in P^NP complexity.
- Mechanism: The RCStandpoint algorithm splits the DRSL knowledge base into standpoint-specific KLM bases and checks entailment pointwise, while the single model M_K^RC characterizes the same closure through its precisiﬁcations.
- Core assumption: Rational closure in propositional KLM is in P^NP and can be called as a subroutine.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we extend the non-monotonic entailment relation of rational closure... The main contribution of this paper is to characterize rational closure for DRSL both algorithmically and semantically."
  - [section]: "We then apply propositional rational closure point-wise on these sets for entailment-checking over a DRSL knowledge base."
  - [corpus]: Moderate - "A Primer for Preferential Non-Monotonic Propositional Team Logics" shows KLM-style reasoning in team semantics, suggesting complexity preservation is achievable.
- Break condition: If defeasible implications in the knowledge base cannot be materialized as Horn clauses, the algorithm may not remain in polynomial time.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The restriction that standpoint modal operators only apply to KLM formulas (not to each other) preserves tractable reasoning.
- Mechanism: This restriction prevents nested modal operators, which would require more complex semantics and potentially increase reasoning complexity beyond P^NP.
- Core assumption: Standpoint operators can be normalized to appear only at the top level of formulas.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "In the language of DRSL, we consider the case where standpoint modal operators are applied to propositional KLM formulas, with some restrictions of how standpoint bound KLM formulas can be combined."
  - [section]: "We also note that for any formula φ ∈ L|∼ and any ranked standpoint structure M, we have M ⊩ φ if and only if M ⊩ □∗φ."
  - [corpus]: Strong - "On the Complexity and Properties of Preferential Propositional Dependence Logic" shows that restricting operator nesting preserves complexity bounds.
- Break condition: If nested standpoint operators are needed for expressiveness, the current semantic and algorithmic approaches would require significant revision.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Ranked interpretations and ranking functions
  - Why needed here: The KLM semantics uses ranking functions to assign typicality levels to possible worlds, which is essential for defeasible reasoning.
  - Quick check question: How does a ranking function R: U → N ∪ {∞} differ from a classical interpretation, and what does R(u) < R(v) signify?

- Concept: Standpoint structures and precisiﬁcations
  - Why needed here: Standpoint structures allow multiple agents with potentially contradictory beliefs to coexist in a single framework by assigning sets of precisiﬁcations to each standpoint.
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between σ(s) (the set of precisiﬁcations for standpoint s) and the satisfaction relation M, π ⊩ □sφ?

- Concept: Rational closure and minimal ranked models
  - Why needed here: Rational closure provides the non-monotonic entailment relation that allows conclusions to be withdrawn when new contradictory information arises.
  - Quick check question: How does the minimal ranked model RK^RC with respect to ⪯K capture the idea of "reasoning as typically as possible"?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Syntax component -> Semantic component (ranked standpoint structures) -> Algorithmic component (RCStandpoint) -> Complexity analysis component
- Critical path:
  1. Parse DRSL knowledge base into normal form
  2. Apply StandpointSplit to generate KLM knowledge bases per standpoint
  3. For each query, determine which standpoint operator applies
  4. Call RCProp on relevant KLM bases
  5. Return entailment result based on pointwise checking
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Restriction vs. Expressiveness: Limiting standpoint operators to KLM formulas preserves tractability but may exclude some desired inferences
  - Pointwise vs. Global: Checking entailment across multiple KLM bases ensures completeness but requires multiple calls to RCProp
  - Normal form requirement: Forces conjunction splitting but simplifies algorithm implementation
- Failure signatures:
  - Missing entailments: May occur if external standpoints are queried without being named in the knowledge base
  - Performance degradation: If defeasible implications cannot be materialized as Horn clauses, complexity may increase beyond polynomial
  - Semantic inconsistency: If standpoint sharpening statements (s1 ⪯ s2) create cycles in the ⪯+ relation
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test basic entailment: Verify K = {p → b, b |∼ f, s ⪯ ∗} entails □s(p |∼ f) using RCStandpoint
  2. Test non-entailment: Verify K' = K ∪ {□s(p |∼ ¬f), t ⪯ ∗} does not entail □s(p |∼ f) or p |∼ f
  3. Test complexity bounds: Measure runtime on knowledge bases with increasing numbers of defeasible implications to confirm P^NP scaling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Can a more expressive version of DRSL be defined that includes negation and disjunction of standpoint-bound formulas without increasing the complexity of rational closure?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors note that "it seems initially that this case would be significantly more difficult to consider, since we lose the Single Model property when we introduce negation and disjunction into KLM in the propositional case"
  - Why unresolved: The paper explicitly states that extending DRSL with negation and disjunction would likely break the single-model property that enables efficient computation, but doesn't explore what minimal extensions might be possible
  - What evidence would resolve it: A formal proof showing whether adding negation/disjunction to standpoint-bound formulas preserves P^NP complexity, or identifying which restricted forms of such extensions would be tractable

- **Open Question 2**: Can other non-monotonic consequence relations like lexicographic closure be extended to standpoint logic while maintaining tractable complexity?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] "It would also be desirable to investigate the proof-theoretic properties of |≈RC in the standpoint logic case and compare those to the original KLM postulates" and "Another notion to explore...is the possibility of extending other non-monotonic consequence relations defined in the propositional case to the standpoint case, such as lexicographic closure"
  - Why unresolved: The paper only develops rational closure for standpoint logic and mentions lexicographic closure as a potential extension without implementation
  - What evidence would resolve it: A complete algorithmic and semantic characterization of lexicographic closure for standpoint logic, along with complexity analysis

- **Open Question 3**: Can standpoint logic be integrated with more expressive KLM-style defeasible logics such as defeasible description logics (DDLs)?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] "Another interesting problem to investigate would be the integration of standpoints into more expressive KLM-style defeasible logics, such as defeasible description logics (DDLs)"
  - Why unresolved: The paper only considers propositional KLM, and while it mentions that standpoint logic has been integrated with other description logics, it doesn't explore how this would work with defeasible description logics
  - What evidence would resolve it: A formal definition of a standpoint-enhanced DDL system with both algorithmic and semantic characterizations of a non-monotonic entailment relation, plus complexity analysis

## Limitations

- The restriction to standpoint operators applied only to KLM formulas may limit expressiveness for certain reasoning scenarios
- Complexity analysis assumes defeasible implications can be materialized as Horn clauses, which may not hold for all knowledge bases
- Handling of external standpoints (those not named in the knowledge base) is not fully specified and may lead to missing entailments

## Confidence

- High confidence: The integration of ranked interpretations and standpoint structures into a single semantic framework (Mechanism 1)
- Medium confidence: The equivalence proof between algorithmic and semantic characterizations of rational closure (Mechanism 2)
- Low confidence: The tractability preservation claim given the restriction on standpoint operator nesting (Mechanism 3)

## Next Checks

1. Test knowledge bases with nested standpoint operators to verify the restriction is necessary for complexity bounds
2. Implement a complete example with multiple standpoints and verify both algorithmic and semantic characterizations produce identical results
3. Analyze the behavior of the system when external standpoints are queried to confirm the limitations stated in Note 3
