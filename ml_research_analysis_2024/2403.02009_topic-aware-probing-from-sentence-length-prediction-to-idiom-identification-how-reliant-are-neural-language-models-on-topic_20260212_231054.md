# Topic Aware Probing: From Sentence Length Prediction to Idiom Identification how reliant are Neural Language Models on Topic?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.02009
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02009
- Reference count: 29
- One-line primary result: BERT and RoBERTa primarily rely on topic information when processing language, with tasks less sensitive to topic being more difficult for these models

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how Transformer-based neural language models like BERT and RoBERTa process natural language by examining their reliance on topic versus other linguistic signals. The authors propose a novel "topic-aware probing" methodology that trains probing models on data from one topic and tests them on both seen and unseen topics to analyze performance differences. Their key finding is that these models primarily rely on topic information, with middle layers capturing the most topic and non-topic information. The study also reveals that tasks less sensitive to topic information are more difficult for these models, suggesting potential improvements through incorporating more word order and syntactic information.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a topic-aware probing methodology that uses Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) topic modeling to partition datasets into topics. They train MLP probing models on embeddings from different layers of BERT and RoBERTa, then evaluate performance on seen versus unseen topics using 5-fold cross-validation. The methodology compares performance against GloVe (as a topic baseline) and random embeddings (as a control). The probing tasks range from simple lexical tasks like sentence length prediction to complex semantic tasks like idiom token identification, with performance measured using AUC ROC scores.

## Key Results
- Tasks less sensitive to topic information (like bigram shift) are also more difficult for BERT and RoBERTa
- General idiom token identification is highly sensitive to topic information
- BERT and RoBERTa encode both topic and non-topic information, with middle layers capturing the most
- RoBERTa is more reliant on topic information than BERT
- Tasks that are relatively insensitive to topic are also tasks that these models find relatively difficult

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Topic-aware probing identifies whether probing tasks rely on topic information by comparing performance on seen vs unseen topics
- Mechanism: Train probing model on data from one topic, test on same topic (seen) and different topics (unseen), analyze performance difference
- Core assumption: Topic information is a meaningful signal that affects probing task performance
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "train probing models on data from one topic and test them on data from both seen and unseen topics"
  - [section 3] "If the topic signal is important...then the performance of the probe model should be significantly better on samples from seen topics compared to unseen topics"
  - [corpus] Weak - neighbor papers mention topic-aware probing but don't provide direct evidence for this mechanism
- Break condition: If performance difference between seen and unseen topics is negligible, indicating topic is not a useful signal for the task

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Initial layers of BERT primarily encode topic information while later layers encode more non-topic information
- Mechanism: Compare performance of different BERT layers on topic-sensitive vs non-topic-sensitive tasks
- Core assumption: Different layers of BERT capture different types of linguistic information
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5] "GloVe and BERT0 have similar performance (same as that of random embedding)" on bigram shift task
  - [section 5] "the initial layer of BERT also primarily encodes the topic signal"
  - [corpus] Weak - neighbor papers discuss probing but don't specifically address layer-wise topic encoding
- Break condition: If all layers perform similarly across topic-sensitive and non-topic-sensitive tasks, suggesting uniform encoding

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Tasks less sensitive to topic information are also more difficult for BERT and RoBERTa
- Mechanism: Analyze correlation between topic sensitivity (GloVe vs random performance) and model performance
- Core assumption: Topic information is a major signal used by BERT and RoBERTa for task performance
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 6] "as sensitivity to topic increases...there is a tendency for the performance of GloVe and Transformer based neural language models to increase"
  - [section 6] "the less sensitive a probing task is to topic information the more difficult the task is for Transformer-based neural language models"
  - [corpus] Weak - neighbor papers mention topic but don't provide direct evidence for this correlation
- Break condition: If no correlation exists between topic sensitivity and model performance, suggesting topic is not the primary factor

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Topic modeling (Latent Semantic Indexing)
  - Why needed here: Used to partition dataset into topics for topic-aware probing
  - Quick check question: What is the main principle behind LSI topic modeling?

- Concept: Probing methodology
  - Why needed here: Foundation for understanding what information is encoded in embeddings
  - Quick check question: How does a probing task determine what information is present in embeddings?

- Concept: AUC ROC metric
  - Why needed here: Used to evaluate performance of probing models on imbalanced datasets
  - Quick check question: Why is AUC ROC preferred over accuracy for imbalanced datasets?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Topic modeling → dataset partitioning → cross-validation → probing model training → performance analysis
- Critical path: Topic modeling → cross-validation fold creation → probing model evaluation → seen/unseen score comparison
- Design tradeoffs: Number of topics vs. sample size in each topic, balancing topic coherence with statistical power
- Failure signatures: Negligible performance difference between seen and unseen topics, indicating topic is not a useful signal
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Apply topic-aware probing to bigram shift task (expected to show negligible topic effect)
  2. Apply topic-aware probing to general idiom token identification task (expected to show strong topic effect)
  3. Compare GloVe baseline performance with random embeddings on various tasks to assess topic sensitivity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the relative importance of topic versus non-topic information vary across different language families and linguistic structures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that their experiments are based only on English datasets and acknowledge the need to examine whether their observations apply to languages with more flexible word order and richer morphology.
- Why unresolved: The paper's experiments are limited to English, which has relatively fixed word order. Different languages may exhibit different patterns in how neural language models process topic versus syntactic information.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting topic-aware probing experiments on languages with different morphological and syntactic properties (e.g., highly inflected languages, languages with free word order) and comparing the results to those obtained for English.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent does the reliance on topic information in neural language models impact their performance on tasks requiring deep semantic understanding versus shallow pattern matching?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors suggest that tasks less sensitive to topic information are also more difficult for Transformer-based models, implying a potential limitation in their semantic understanding capabilities.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the relationship between topic sensitivity and model performance but does not deeply explore the implications for semantic understanding versus pattern matching.
- What evidence would resolve it: Designing experiments that systematically compare model performance on tasks requiring compositional semantics versus those relying on surface-level patterns, and analyzing the role of topic information in each case.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can incorporating explicit syntactic information into the architecture of neural language models improve their performance on tasks that are less sensitive to topic information?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest that the performance of Transformer-based models on tasks insensitive to topic could be improved by incorporating more word order or syntactic information.
- Why unresolved: While the authors propose this as a potential direction, they do not provide empirical evidence for the effectiveness of such architectural modifications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing and evaluating neural language models that explicitly integrate syntactic information (e.g., through recursive neural networks or syntactic attention mechanisms) and comparing their performance on topic-insensitive tasks to standard Transformer models.

## Limitations

- The study is limited to English datasets, making it unclear whether findings generalize to languages with different morphological and syntactic properties
- The reliance on LSI topic modeling may not capture all aspects of topical information, potentially affecting the validity of topic sensitivity measures
- The analysis doesn't investigate how topic information evolves through individual layers, providing only layer-wise aggregate performance

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The finding that BERT and RoBERTa encode both topic and non-topic information, with middle layers capturing the most, is well-supported by the systematic layer-wise analysis and consistent patterns across multiple tasks.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that tasks less sensitive to topic information are also more difficult for BERT and RoBERTa is reasonably supported but relies on correlation analysis across a limited set of tasks, and alternative explanations (like task complexity) weren't fully ruled out.

**Low Confidence**: The conclusion that RoBERTa is more reliant on topic information than BERT is based on aggregate performance differences but doesn't account for potential confounding factors like training data differences or architectural variations.

## Next Checks

1. **Topic Model Robustness Test**: Run the topic-aware probing methodology using different topic modeling approaches (LDA, NMF) and evaluate whether the same patterns of topic sensitivity emerge across methods. This would validate whether the observed patterns are specific to LSI or reflect genuine topic-related phenomena.

2. **Cross-Domain Generalization**: Apply the same topic-aware probing framework to non-English datasets (e.g., multilingual benchmarks) and diverse domains (medical, legal, technical) to assess whether the relationship between topic sensitivity and model performance generalizes beyond the current English-centric experiments.

3. **Fine-grained Layer Evolution Analysis**: Conduct a more granular analysis of how topic and non-topic information evolve through individual layers, using techniques like probing classifier training on every layer pair (0-1, 1-2, etc.) to identify specific transition points where topic encoding emerges or diminishes.
