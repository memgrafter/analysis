# Evaluating the Capabilities of Large Language Models for Multi-label Emotion Understanding

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2412.17837
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17837
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Introduces EthioEmo, a multi-label emotion classification dataset for four Ethiopian languages, showing significant performance gaps between high-resource and low-resource languages in emotion understanding

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces EthioEmo, a multi-label emotion classification dataset for four Ethiopian languages (Amharic, Afan Oromo, Somali, and Tigrinya), addressing the under-explored area of multilingual and multi-label emotion understanding in large language models. The dataset is constructed from diverse sources (news headlines, Twitter posts, YouTube comments, and Facebook comments) and annotated with one or more emotion classes (anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, plus neutral). Extensive experiments are conducted using encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only models, comparing zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning approaches. Results show that accurate multi-label emotion classification remains challenging even for high-resource languages like English, with a significant performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages. Fine-tuning smaller, pre-trained encoder-only models generally outperforms few-shot approaches of LLMs, though open-source decoder-only models like Cohere-aya-101 show promising results. The study highlights the complexities of emotion classification and the need for further research in this area.

## Method Summary
The EthioEmo dataset is constructed from multiple sources including news headlines, Twitter posts, YouTube comments, and Facebook comments across four Ethiopian languages. Each text sample is annotated with one or more emotion labels from seven categories (anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and neutral). The dataset is cleaned by removing special characters, URLs, and mentions, with text tokenized and padded to a fixed length. The study employs encoder-only models (e.g., XLM-R), encoder-decoder models (e.g., mBART), and decoder-only models (e.g., Cohere-aya-101) for emotion classification. Three experimental approaches are compared: zero-shot learning, few-shot learning, and fine-tuning. Zero-shot and few-shot experiments use prompts with example pairs of text and corresponding emotions, while fine-tuning experiments involve training models on the full dataset with evaluation on test sets. Performance is measured using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy metrics, with particular attention to the challenges of multi-label classification.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuning smaller, pre-trained encoder-only models generally outperforms few-shot approaches with LLMs for multi-label emotion classification
- Significant performance gaps exist between high-resource languages (English) and low-resource languages (Ethiopian languages) in emotion understanding tasks
- Open-source decoder-only models like Cohere-aya-101 show promising results in multi-label emotion classification
- Accurate multi-label emotion classification remains challenging even for high-resource languages, highlighting the complexity of emotion understanding

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of fine-tuning smaller encoder-only models over few-shot approaches with LLMs can be attributed to the ability of fine-tuned models to learn task-specific representations and patterns from the training data. Encoder-only models like XLM-R are designed for classification tasks and can effectively capture semantic and emotional nuances in text. The multi-label nature of the emotion classification task requires models to identify and differentiate between multiple emotional states simultaneously, which benefits from the contextualized representations learned during fine-tuning. Additionally, the diverse sources of the EthioEmo dataset provide rich linguistic and cultural contexts that help models better understand the emotional expressions specific to Ethiopian languages and cultures.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-label classification**: Why needed - Emotion texts often express multiple emotions simultaneously; Quick check - Verify dataset contains samples with multiple emotion labels
- **Cross-lingual transfer learning**: Why needed - Limited labeled data for low-resource languages requires knowledge transfer from high-resource languages; Quick check - Compare performance of models trained on English vs. models trained on target language
- **Fine-tuning vs. few-shot learning**: Why needed - Different training paradigms have varying effectiveness for emotion classification tasks; Quick check - Compare performance metrics between fine-tuned and few-shot models on the same test set
- **Emotion taxonomy design**: Why needed - The choice of emotion categories affects model performance and generalizability; Quick check - Analyze distribution of emotion labels in the dataset
- **Cultural context in emotion understanding**: Why needed - Emotional expressions vary across cultures and languages; Quick check - Compare model performance across different language pairs
- **Evaluation metrics for multi-label classification**: Why needed - Standard metrics may not fully capture multi-label prediction quality; Quick check - Review precision, recall, and F1-score calculations for multi-label scenarios

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Collection -> Preprocessing -> Model Training (Fine-tuning/Few-shot/Zero-shot) -> Evaluation -> Analysis

**Critical Path**: The most critical path is from Data Collection through Preprocessing to Model Training, as the quality and diversity of the dataset directly impacts model performance. The evaluation phase is equally critical for understanding model capabilities and limitations.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The study balances between using high-resource languages (English) as a performance baseline and exploring low-resource languages (Ethiopian languages) where limited labeled data exists. Fine-tuning smaller models trades off against using larger LLMs with few-shot approaches, considering computational resources and performance. The choice of emotion taxonomy (seven basic emotions plus neutral) simplifies the classification task but may not capture all emotional nuances.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance in low-resource languages indicates limitations in cross-lingual transfer learning. Inconsistent emotion predictions across different model architectures suggest challenges in capturing complex emotional expressions. Low precision or recall for certain emotion categories may indicate dataset imbalance or model bias toward more frequent emotions.

**First Experiments**:
1. Train XLM-R on English emotion data, then fine-tune on each Ethiopian language separately to measure cross-lingual transfer effectiveness
2. Compare few-shot performance of Cohere-aya-101 against fine-tuned XLM-R on the same test set to validate the primary finding
3. Conduct ablation studies by removing specific data sources (e.g., Twitter posts) to assess their impact on model performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided information.

## Limitations
- Limited generalizability across different emotion taxonomies and cultural contexts, particularly regarding non-Western emotional concepts
- Focus on only four Ethiopian languages restricts broader cross-linguistic conclusions
- Evaluation metrics may not fully capture the nuances of multi-label emotion prediction, especially for emotionally ambiguous or mixed expressions
- The underlying causes of performance gaps between high-resource and low-resource languages remain partially unexplored

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Empirical findings regarding performance differences between high-resource and low-resource languages
- **Medium confidence**: Comparative effectiveness of fine-tuning versus few-shot approaches
- **Medium confidence**: Overall dataset quality and annotation reliability
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability of results to other emotion taxonomies or cultural contexts

## Next Checks
1. Conduct cross-cultural validation studies using different emotion taxonomies that include non-Western emotional concepts to test the robustness of current findings
2. Implement ablation studies on the dataset construction process (data sources, preprocessing steps) to isolate their impact on model performance
3. Perform human evaluation studies comparing model predictions against human agreement rates, particularly for low-resource language samples, to establish baseline human performance levels
