core_contribution: The paper proposes CauseJudger, a new framework for abductive logical
  reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Abductive reasoning, which deduces causes
  from effects, is challenging for LLMs due to the need for reverse thinking and dealing

# CauseJudger: Identifying the Cause with LLMs for Abductive Logical Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.05559
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05559
- Reference count: 13
- Outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 41% improvement over Zero-Shot-CoT with GPT-3.5

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CauseJudger, a novel framework for abductive logical reasoning in large language models. Abductive reasoning, which involves deducing causes from observed effects, presents unique challenges for LLMs due to the need for reverse thinking and handling irrelevant information. CauseJudger addresses these challenges through a three-module approach: transforming reverse reasoning into forward reasoning via hypothesis-and-verification, pruning irrelevant information, and validating the hypothesized cause through forward deduction. The framework demonstrates significant performance improvements across multiple datasets, achieving over 90% accuracy with GPT-4 and reducing the number of LLM calls from 5 to 2 compared to existing methods.

## Method Summary
CauseJudger is a three-module framework designed to tackle abductive reasoning by converting it into a more tractable forward reasoning problem. The Logic Reverse Module (LRM) transforms the task by assuming the possible cause is true and adding it to the premises, converting the abductive task into a forward inference problem. The Information Pruning Module (IPM) uses LLM evaluation to remove premises and rules that are obviously unrelated to the target phenomenon, reducing reasoning noise. Finally, the Forward Reasoning Module (FRM) validates the hypothesized cause by checking if the phenomenon can be inferred from the augmented premises. The framework is evaluated on a newly constructed CauseLogics dataset containing 200,000 tasks with varying reasoning lengths, as well as on a modified ProofWriter dataset.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 41% correctness improvement over Zero-Shot-CoT with GPT-3.5
- Reaches over 90% accuracy with GPT-4 across all datasets
- Reduces LLM calls from 5 (SC-CoT) to 2 (CJ), improving efficiency
- Reduces irrelevant premises from 12.00 to 0.07 on average through IPM

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Hypothesis-and-verification transforms reverse abductive reasoning into forward deductive reasoning.
- Mechanism: By assuming the possible cause is true and adding it to the premises, the system converts the abductive task into a forward inference problem.
- Core assumption: The hypothesized cause, if true, should allow the LLM to derive the phenomenon using the given rules.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "identifies the authenticity of possible cause by transforming thinking from reverse to forward"
  - [section 4.2] "In LRM, we assume that the cause is correct and add it to the set of premises to form a new set: P* = H(P, hyp) = P ∪ {hyp}"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct mentions of hypothesis-and-verification in neighbor papers
- Break condition: If the hypothesized cause is unrelated to the phenomenon, forward reasoning will fail even with added premises.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Information pruning removes irrelevant premises and rules to reduce reasoning noise.
- Mechanism: LLM evaluates each premise and rule for relevance to the target phenomenon, filtering out those that don't contribute to the inference path.
- Core assumption: Irrelevant information significantly interferes with LLM reasoning accuracy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "removing irrelevant information"
  - [section 4.3] "In IPM, before LLMs performs actual reasoning, it removes premises and rules that is obviously unrelated to the target phenomenon"
  - [section 5.1] Table 5 shows IPM reduces irrelevant premises from 12.00 to 0.07 on average
- Break condition: If IPM incorrectly filters relevant information, the reasoning path becomes incomplete.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Forward reasoning module validates the hypothesized cause by checking if the phenomenon can be inferred.
- Mechanism: After reverse transformation and pruning, LLM performs forward deduction to see if the phenomenon follows from the augmented premises.
- Core assumption: If the phenomenon can be derived, the hypothesized cause is a valid explanation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "identifies the authenticity of possible cause... by... removing irrelevant information"
  - [section 4.4] "If phenomenon can be inferred, it indicates that the possible cause is a reasonable explanation for the target phenomenon"
  - [section 5.1] Table 3 shows high accuracy improvement with full CJ framework
- Break condition: If LLM fails to properly execute forward reasoning, validation becomes unreliable.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Abductive vs Deductive reasoning
  - Why needed here: Understanding the difference between reverse and forward thinking patterns is crucial for grasping why traditional reasoning methods fail on abductive tasks.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between abductive reasoning (finding causes from effects) and deductive reasoning (deriving effects from causes)?

- Concept: Hypothesis testing methodology
  - Why needed here: The framework's core approach relies on assuming a hypothesis and testing its validity through forward reasoning.
  - Quick check question: How does assuming a hypothesis and testing it through forward reasoning help solve the reverse thinking challenge in abductive reasoning?

- Concept: Information filtering and relevance assessment
  - Why needed here: The IPM module depends on accurately identifying and removing information that doesn't contribute to the reasoning path.
  - Quick check question: What criteria might an LLM use to determine if a premise or rule is relevant to a specific reasoning task?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Logic Reverse Module (LRM): Transforms reverse reasoning into forward by adding hypothesized cause to premises
  - Information Pruning Module (IPM): Filters out irrelevant premises and rules using LLM evaluation
  - Forward Reasoning Module (FRM): Performs final validation through forward deduction

- Critical path: LRM → IPM → FRM (hypothesis creation → information filtering → validation)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. efficiency: CJ requires only 2 LLM calls vs. SC-CoT's 5 calls
  - Complexity vs. robustness: Adding hypothesis simplifies reasoning but requires accurate validation
  - Filtering aggressiveness: More aggressive pruning reduces noise but risks removing relevant information

- Failure signatures:
  - High IPM pruning but low accuracy: Likely over-filtering relevant information
  - Low accuracy on longer chains: May indicate hypothesis generation or forward reasoning limitations
  - Inconsistent results across runs: Check LLM temperature settings and pruning thresholds

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run CJ with only LRM+FRM (no IPM) on Level 1 dataset to measure pruning impact
  2. Test IPM only (using IO for reasoning) to isolate filtering effectiveness
  3. Compare CJ accuracy vs. Zero-Shot-CoT across all four dataset levels with both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of CauseJudger vary when applied to different domains beyond the CauseLogics dataset, such as healthcare or education?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions potential applications of CauseJudger in healthcare, such as preliminary diagnosis of respiratory diseases, but does not provide experimental results in these domains.
- Why unresolved: The paper only demonstrates the effectiveness of CauseJudger on the CauseLogics dataset and a modified version of the ProofWriter dataset. There is no exploration of its performance in other domains.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments applying CauseJudger to datasets from different domains, such as medical diagnosis or educational reasoning tasks, and comparing its performance to existing methods in those domains.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of increasing the reasoning chain length on the accuracy of CauseJudger, and how does it compare to other methods?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that CauseJudger experiences a certain degree of accuracy decline under conditions of longer logical chains, but does not provide detailed analysis or comparisons.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive analysis of how CauseJudger's performance is affected by increasing reasoning chain length, nor does it compare this impact to other methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments on datasets with varying reasoning chain lengths and comparing the performance of CauseJudger to other methods as the chain length increases.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the Information Pruning Module (IPM) perform in more complex tasks where irrelevant information is harder to distinguish?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that IPM can effectively reduce the number of useless premises in the CauseLogics dataset, but notes that in more complex tasks, it may be necessary to use IPM multiple times and remove different types of useless information in batches.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide experimental results or analysis of IPM's performance in more complex tasks with harder-to-distinguish irrelevant information.
- What evidence would resolve it: Designing and conducting experiments on datasets with varying levels of complexity and irrelevant information, and analyzing the performance of IPM in these scenarios.

## Limitations
- Evaluation focused on synthetic datasets rather than real-world abductive reasoning tasks with ambiguity and incomplete information
- Performance gains may be primarily driven by underlying model capabilities rather than framework effectiveness
- Pruning mechanism effectiveness depends on LLM's ability to correctly identify irrelevant information, with potential for false positives and false negatives

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core mechanism of transforming abductive reasoning into forward reasoning through hypothesis addition is well-supported by the experimental results, showing consistent improvements across all dataset levels and both model types.

- **Medium confidence**: The information pruning module's effectiveness is supported by quantitative metrics, but the analysis lacks detailed examination of pruning errors and their impact on reasoning accuracy.

- **Medium confidence**: Claims about efficiency improvements (2 LLM calls vs. 5) are supported, but the computational overhead of the pruning step and its impact on overall latency are not discussed.

## Next Checks

1. **Real-world application test**: Apply CauseJudger to naturally occurring abductive reasoning problems (e.g., medical diagnosis cases, crime investigation scenarios) to assess performance on ambiguous, incomplete real-world data.

2. **Ablation study on pruning errors**: Conduct detailed analysis of IPM's false positive and false negative rates, and measure how these errors propagate through the reasoning chain to affect final accuracy.

3. **Cross-model generalization**: Test the framework with smaller or differently-architected LLMs (e.g., LLaMA, Mistral) to determine whether the performance gains are framework-dependent or primarily driven by the underlying model's reasoning capabilities.
