## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive review of Continual Graph Learning (CGL), addressing the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in graph-based models when learning sequential tasks. The authors categorize CGL methods into three main approaches: regularization-based, memory-replay-based, and parameter-isolation-based techniques. They highlight the unique challenges of CGL, such as preserving graph topology and handling concept drift in nodes due to inter-task edges. The paper also introduces CGL benchmarks and datasets, offering a fair comparison platform for different methods. Future directions include improving the trade-off between effectiveness and space complexity, addressing task-free CGL, and extending CGL to multimodal and heterogeneous graphs.

## Method Summary
The paper synthesizes CGL approaches by categorizing them into three main techniques: regularization-based methods that constrain weight updates to preserve previous knowledge, memory-replay-based methods that store representative data from past tasks, and parameter-isolation-based methods that allocate separate parameters for different tasks. The review emphasizes the unique challenges of CGL, including the need to preserve graph topology while preventing catastrophic forgetting, and introduces evaluation metrics such as average performance (AP) and average forgetting (AF). The paper also outlines benchmark datasets and proposes future research directions for improving CGL methods.

## Key Results
- CGL methods are categorized into regularization-based, memory-replay-based, and parameter-isolation-based techniques
- Unique challenges include preserving graph topology and handling concept drift in nodes due to inter-task edges
- Future directions include improving the trade-off between effectiveness and space complexity, addressing task-free CGL, and extending CGL to multimodal and heterogeneous graphs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CGL methods work by addressing the fundamental problem of catastrophic forgetting through different mechanisms: regularization methods constrain model parameters to preserve previous knowledge, memory-replay methods store representative data to revisit during training, and parameter-isolation methods allocate separate model components for different tasks. These approaches are effective because they explicitly account for the graph structure and node relationships that are critical to maintaining performance across sequential tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**: Neural networks that operate on graph-structured data by aggregating information from neighboring nodes. Why needed: CGL builds upon GNN architectures as the base model for graph-based learning. Quick check: Can the model perform node classification on a static graph?
- **Catastrophic Forgetting**: The phenomenon where neural networks rapidly forget previously learned information when trained on new tasks. Why needed: This is the core problem that CGL methods aim to solve. Quick check: Does performance degrade on previous tasks after training on new ones?
- **Experience Replay**: A technique that stores and revisits previous training examples to maintain knowledge. Why needed: Forms the basis for memory-replay-based CGL methods. Quick check: Can stored examples effectively prevent forgetting when replayed?
- **Regularization Techniques**: Methods that add constraints to model parameters during training to preserve important weights. Why needed: Used in regularization-based CGL to prevent overwriting useful knowledge. Quick check: Do weight constraints effectively maintain performance across tasks?
- **Parameter Isolation**: The strategy of allocating separate model parameters for different tasks. Why needed: Enables learning new tasks without interfering with previous knowledge. Quick check: Can isolated parameters prevent interference between tasks?
- **Graph Topology Preservation**: Maintaining the structural relationships in graph data during learning. Why needed: Essential for CGL since graph structure contains critical information. Quick check: Does the method preserve node connectivity and neighborhood information?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Graph Data -> GNN Backbone -> CGL Method (Regularization/Memory-Replay/Parameter-Isolation) -> Performance Metrics

**Critical Path**: Graph Data → GNN Backbone → Task-specific adaptation → Knowledge preservation → Evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Regularization methods offer low memory overhead but may limit model flexibility
- Memory-replay methods provide better performance but require significant storage
- Parameter-isolation methods completely prevent interference but scale poorly with task count

**Failure Signatures**:
- Memory explosion when storing entire computation subgraphs
- Performance degradation when graph topology is not properly preserved
- Ineffective forgetting prevention when replay buffer is too small or poorly constructed

**First Experiments**:
1. Implement ER-GNN baseline with node buffer to establish baseline performance
2. Extend with SSM to test subgraph memory approach and compare memory usage
3. Evaluate both methods using AP and AF metrics on sequential graph tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Lack of detailed experimental protocols and hyperparameter specifications across referenced studies
- No quantitative comparisons between different CGL methods on standardized benchmarks
- Limited empirical validation of proposed solutions, primarily conceptual analysis

## Confidence
- Methodological categorizations: Medium - taxonomy appears well-founded but lacks comprehensive empirical support
- Identified challenges and opportunities: High - aligns with established continual learning literature
- Experimental reproducibility: Low - insufficient detail for direct replication

## Next Checks
1. Implement and compare at least two CGL methods from different categories on the TRELLEB benchmark with standardized hyperparameters
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of graph topology preservation techniques on catastrophic forgetting
3. Evaluate memory-replay approaches using both AP and AF metrics while systematically varying memory budget constraints to assess the effectiveness-space complexity trade-off
