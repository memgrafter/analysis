core_contribution: This paper presents a novel methodology for defining gradual semantics

- Primary result: Introduces modular gradual semantics for statement graphs that handle incomplete information through abstract evaluation of statement premises

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical gap in structured argumentation by developing a methodology for gradual semantics that can handle incomplete information in statement graphs. The core innovation is a modular approach that decomposes the evaluation of statements into two stages: first evaluating the literals in a statement's premise using abstract gradual semantics, then aggregating these evaluations according to the statement's logical structure. This allows statements with partially specified premises to contribute meaningfully to the overall evaluation, unlike existing approaches that require complete information. The paper introduces dialectical conjunction (DC) semantics as a specific instantiation and demonstrates through theoretical analysis that it satisfies all properties necessary for handling incomplete information.

## Method Summary
The methodology introduces a modular decomposition approach for gradual semantics in statement graphs. The process involves evaluating each statement by first applying abstract gradual semantics to assess the literals in its premise, then aggregating these assessments according to the logical connectives present (conjunction/disjunction). This two-stage approach allows statements with incomplete premises to still play a role in the evaluation. The paper introduces DC semantics as a concrete instantiation that leverages existing abstract gradual semantics like DF-QuAD and QEM. Theoretical analysis establishes that DC semantics satisfies all proposed properties for handling incomplete information, while existing structured gradual semantics fail in such cases.

## Key Results
- The modular approach enables meaningful evaluation of statements with incomplete premises, a capability lacking in existing structured gradual semantics
- DC semantics, as a specific instantiation, satisfies all novel properties introduced for handling incomplete information
- Theoretical analysis demonstrates that existing structured gradual semantics struggle when information is incomplete, highlighting the need for the proposed approach
- The methodology provides a principled framework for handling incomplete information in structured argumentation with potential applications in argument mining and debate analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The methodology works by decomposing the evaluation of statements into two stages: abstract evaluation of premise literals followed by logical aggregation. This modular approach allows statements with incomplete information to still contribute meaningfully to the overall evaluation. The abstract gradual semantics component evaluates individual literals in the premise, providing partial assessments that can then be combined according to the statement's logical structure. This avoids the all-or-nothing approach of existing methods that require complete premise information.

## Foundational Learning
- **Statement graphs**: Graph structures representing argumentative statements and their relationships; needed to model complex argumentation scenarios
- **Gradual semantics**: Evaluation methods that provide degrees of acceptability rather than binary true/false judgments; needed for nuanced argumentation assessment
- **Abstract gradual semantics**: Evaluation methods that assess individual components without considering their logical structure; serves as the foundation for modular decomposition
- **Dialectical conjunction**: A specific instantiation of gradual semantics that combines evaluations using logical conjunction; provides concrete implementation of the methodology
- **Modular decomposition**: Breaking down complex evaluation into manageable stages; enables handling of incomplete information
- **Incomplete information handling**: Techniques for evaluating statements when premise information is partial; addresses a critical gap in existing approaches

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Abstract GS -> Premise Evaluation -> Logical Aggregation -> Statement Assessment

Critical path: The methodology follows a two-stage process where abstract gradual semantics first evaluate individual literals in a statement's premise, then these evaluations are aggregated according to the logical connectives present to produce the final statement assessment.

Design tradeoffs: The approach trades off some complexity in the evaluation process for the ability to handle incomplete information. While existing methods require complete premise information for evaluation, this methodology can provide meaningful assessments even with partial information, at the cost of additional computational steps.

Failure signatures: The methodology may fail when the underlying abstract gradual semantics is poorly chosen or when the logical structure of statements is too complex for simple conjunction/disjunction handling. The quality of the overall evaluation heavily depends on the quality of the abstract GS component.

First experiments:
1. Evaluate simple statement graphs with known truth values to verify the basic functionality of the modular approach
2. Compare the methodology's handling of incomplete information against existing approaches using synthetic incomplete data
3. Test the DC semantics instantiation with different abstract gradual semantics (DF-QuAD, QEM) to assess sensitivity to the choice of abstract GS

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- The practical applicability of the abstract gradual semantics component remains uncertain, as the paper assumes availability of suitable abstract GS without providing concrete guidance for selection
- The methodology's focus on conjunction and disjunction limits its applicability to natural argumentation, which often involves more complex logical structures
- Theoretical analysis dominates the evaluation, with limited empirical validation using real-world argumentation data
- The DC semantics, while theoretically sound, may not capture nuanced dialectical relationships in practical applications

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The modular decomposition approach and its theoretical properties are well-established
**Medium confidence**: The DC semantics instantiation provides a practical framework, though its real-world effectiveness needs validation
**Low confidence**: The handling of incomplete information through abstract GS remains somewhat theoretical without extensive empirical backing

## Next Checks

1. Empirical validation using real-world argumentation datasets to assess the practical effectiveness of DC semantics in handling incomplete information
2. Comparative analysis of different abstract GS choices on the same argumentation tasks to evaluate their impact on overall performance
3. Extension of the methodology to handle additional logical connectives beyond conjunction and disjunction to increase practical applicability
