# Assessing the Robustness of Spectral Clustering for Deep Speaker Diarization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.14286
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14286
- Reference count: 39
- Primary result: Spectral clustering's effectiveness in deep speaker diarization depends on domain-matched tuning parameter selection, with performance degrading significantly under domain mismatch.

## Executive Summary
This study examines the robustness of spectral clustering for speaker diarization when training and evaluation data come from different domains. Using AMI and DIHARD-III datasets, the research demonstrates that spectral clustering performance is highly sensitive to the selection of tuning parameters, particularly the pruning parameter α. The analysis reveals that same-domain performance significantly outperforms cross-domain scenarios, especially in challenging environments like webvideo and meeting recordings. The findings underscore the need for improved methods to estimate pruning parameters and handle domain variability in speaker diarization systems.

## Method Summary
The study employs spectral clustering with ECAPA-TDNN speaker embeddings (192-dimensional) extracted from VoxCeleb. The method constructs a cosine similarity affinity matrix, applies pruning with parameter α, computes the unnormalized Laplacian, and uses eigendecomposition with the maximum eigengap approach to estimate speaker count. K-means clustering is then applied to the spectral embeddings. The pruning parameter α is optimized on development sets, and performance is evaluated using Diarization Error Rate (DER) with a 0.25s forgiveness collar. Experiments compare same-domain and cross-domain performance on AMI (with different microphone configurations as domains) and DIHARD-III (seven distinct domains).

## Key Results
- Spectral clustering performance degrades significantly when tuning and test domains differ
- AMI corpus shows better cross-domain generalization than DIHARD-III due to lower intra-domain variability
- Speaker count estimation errors are highest in challenging domains like meetings and webvideo
- Optimal tuning parameters for AMI are numerically closer than those for DIHARD-III

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Spectral clustering's effectiveness depends on domain-matched tuning parameter selection, and mismatches degrade performance. The pruning parameter α is tuned on a development set, but when test and development domains differ, the similarity distributions shift, making the same α suboptimal. The eigengap method for k estimation is also sensitive to the affinity matrix structure, which changes with domain. The core assumption is that similarity distributions of embeddings are domain-dependent, so a single α cannot generalize across domains.

### Mechanism 2
Speaker count estimation errors increase in challenging domains (meetings, webvideo), contributing to diarization errors. The eigengap method relies on the spectral gap in the Laplacian, but in noisy, overlapping, or highly variable domains, the eigenvalue spectrum is less clean, leading to incorrect k estimation. Wrong k causes poor clustering and DER increase. The core assumption is that the spectral gap is a reliable indicator of speaker count only in domains with stable embedding structures.

### Mechanism 3
Intra-domain variability in AMI is lower than in DIHARD-III, making AMI less sensitive to domain mismatch. AMI's controlled recording environments produce more consistent embedding similarity distributions, while DIHARD-III spans far more diverse acoustic conditions and speaker behaviors, so similarity distributions vary more, making clustering parameters less transferable. The core assumption is that recording conditions directly influence embedding similarity distributions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Affinity matrix construction via cosine similarity of speaker embeddings**: Understanding cosine scoring is essential to interpret pruning and Laplacian computation. Quick check: Given two embeddings of dimension 192, how do you compute their similarity in spectral clustering?

- **Laplacian matrix and eigengap for speaker count estimation**: The number of speakers is estimated from the largest spectral gap; errors here propagate to clustering quality. Quick check: If the Laplacian's eigenvalues are [0, 2, 2, 5, 8, 12], what is the estimated number of speakers using eigengap?

- **Effect of pruning parameter α on affinity matrix sparsity**: α controls which edges survive pruning; wrong α leads to either overly dense or overly sparse graphs, harming clustering. Quick check: If α=0.7 for N=1000 embeddings, how many smallest entries per row are zeroed?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Speech enhancement (SE) → Speech activity detection (SAD) → Fixed-length segmentation → ECAPA-TDNN embedding extraction → Cosine affinity matrix → Pruning (α) → Symmetrization → Unnormalized Laplacian → Eigendecomposition (k via eigengap) → Spectral embedding → k-means clustering → DER evaluation
