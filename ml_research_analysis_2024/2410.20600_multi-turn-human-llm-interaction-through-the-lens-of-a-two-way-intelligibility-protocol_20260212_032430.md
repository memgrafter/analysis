core_contribution: The paper implements a protocol for two-way intelligibility between
  humans and LLMs using finite-state machines with message tags (RATIFY, REFUTE, REVISE,
  REJECT). Experiments on X-ray diagnosis and drug synthesis show high rates of one-way

# Multi-Turn Human-LLM Interaction Through the Lens of a Two-Way Intelligibility Protocol

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.20600
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20600

- Key outcome: Protocol for two-way intelligibility between humans and LLMs using finite-state machines with message tags (RATIFY, REFUTE, REVISE, REJECT). Experiments show high rates of one-way and two-way intelligible sessions (>90%) with improving machine performance over time.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a protocol for measuring two-way intelligibility between humans and LLMs using finite-state machines with message tags (RATIFY, REFUTE, REVISE, REJECT). The authors evaluate the protocol through controlled experiments using human-proxy databases in X-ray diagnosis and drug synthesis domains, as well as uncontrolled experiments with two human chemists of different expertise levels. Results demonstrate high rates of intelligible sessions and show that machine performance improves as interactions lengthen, supporting the protocol's utility in capturing intelligibility and enhancing collaborative human-LLM systems.

## Method Summary
The authors implement a protocol for two-way intelligibility using finite-state machines with four message tags: RATIFY, REFUTE, REVISE, and REJECT. Experiments were conducted in two settings: controlled experiments using human-proxy databases to simulate human interactions in X-ray diagnosis and drug synthesis domains, and uncontrolled experiments involving two human chemists with different expertise levels. The protocol tracks message exchanges and classifies sessions based on intelligibility levels, ranging from one-way to two-way intelligibility, with further distinctions between strong and ultra-strong intelligibility based on immediate agreement patterns.

## Key Results
- High rates of one-way and two-way intelligible sessions (often >90%) were observed across experiments
- Machine performance improved as interactions lengthened in both controlled and uncontrolled settings
- Strong intelligibility was rare and mostly limited to immediate agreement, while ultra-strong intelligibility was negligible
- Variability in interactions decreased with longer sessions, potentially due to richer context or protocol constraints

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The protocol works by establishing a structured communication framework through finite-state machines that constrain human-LLM interactions to specific message types. This structure enables systematic tracking and classification of intelligibility levels based on agreement patterns and message exchanges. The use of message tags (RATIFY, REFUTE, REVISE, REJECT) creates a shared vocabulary that both humans and LLMs can interpret consistently, facilitating the measurement of mutual understanding. The controlled experimental design with human-proxy databases allows for reproducible testing of the protocol while the inclusion of real human chemists in uncontrolled experiments provides ecological validity.

## Foundational Learning

**Finite-state machines in communication protocols**
Why needed: To systematically model and track the state transitions in human-LLM interactions
Quick check: Verify that all possible message sequences can be represented within the defined state transitions

**Message tagging taxonomy (RATIFY, REFUTE, REVISE, REJECT)**
Why needed: To create a shared vocabulary for classifying agreement and disagreement patterns
Quick check: Confirm that each tag has clear, distinct semantic boundaries and no overlap in interpretation

**Intelligibility classification framework**
Why needed: To operationalize and measure the abstract concept of mutual understanding
Quick check: Test the framework's sensitivity to detect meaningful differences in interaction quality

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**
Human interaction layer -> Message tagging system -> Finite-state machine tracker -> Intelligibility classifier -> Performance evaluation module

**Critical path**
Human input -> Message classification -> State transition -> Intelligibility assessment -> Feedback to human/LLM

**Design tradeoffs**
The protocol trades flexibility for structure by constraining interactions to four message types, which enables systematic measurement but may limit natural communication patterns. The use of human-proxy databases provides reproducibility but may sacrifice ecological validity compared to real human participants.

**Failure signatures**
Sessions may be misclassified if message tags are ambiguous or if the finite-state machine cannot capture complex reasoning patterns. The protocol may fail to detect deep understanding that doesn't manifest through the defined message types.

**First experiments**
1. Test the protocol with a single human-LLM pair across multiple interaction sessions to establish baseline intelligibility patterns
2. Vary the complexity of tasks within the same domain to assess protocol sensitivity to task difficulty
3. Implement the protocol with different LLM architectures to determine whether intelligibility patterns are model-dependent

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Controlled experiments rely on human-proxy databases that may not fully capture real human behavior
- The protocol's operational definition of intelligibility through message tags may not align with broader notions of understanding
- The distinction between strong and ultra-strong intelligibility appears subjective and may introduce classification uncertainty
- Results from X-ray diagnosis and drug synthesis domains may not generalize to other application areas

## Confidence

**Major claim clusters:**
- High: The protocol implementation and experimental methodology are well-described and reproducible. The general finding that intelligibility increases with interaction length is supported by the data.
- Medium: The claim that high rates of one-way and two-way intelligible sessions (>90%) demonstrate the protocol's utility requires further validation across diverse domains and with actual human participants rather than proxies.
- Low: The assertion that ultra-strong intelligibility was negligible and limited to immediate agreement is based on operational definitions that may not capture all forms of deep understanding.

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the experiments with actual human participants across multiple domains to validate whether human-proxy database results generalize to real human-LLM interactions.
2. Conduct longitudinal studies tracking the same human-LLM pairs over extended periods to assess whether the observed decrease in variability persists and whether it reflects improved mutual understanding or protocol-induced convergence.
3. Implement the protocol with different LLM architectures and parameter sizes to determine whether the observed intelligibility patterns are consistent across model variations or specific to the tested implementations.
