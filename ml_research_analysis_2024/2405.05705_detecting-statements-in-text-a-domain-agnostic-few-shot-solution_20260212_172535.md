# Detecting Statements in Text: A Domain-Agnostic Few-Shot Solution

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.05705
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05705
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Few-shot methodology using NLI models and active learning detects claims in text with 2.3-51.3x less annotation than fine-tuning

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a domain-agnostic approach for detecting claims in text using few-shot learning with Natural Language Inference (NLI) models and active learning via the Probabilistic Bisection Algorithm. The methodology defines classes as taxonomies of claims and dynamically tunes classification thresholds with minimal human annotation. Evaluated on three diverse tasks—climate change contrarianism, topic/stance classification, and depression symptoms detection—the approach achieves performance comparable to or better than fine-tuned models while requiring significantly less annotated data.

## Method Summary
The methodology combines BARTMNLI NLI models with Probabilistic Bisection Algorithm (PBA) for active threshold tuning. Users define classes as taxonomies of claims (logical combinations of statements), then NLI models compute entailment scores between text and claims. PBA iteratively selects examples near the current threshold estimate for human annotation, updating a probability distribution over the threshold space until convergence. This allows classification with minimal annotations while incorporating domain expertise through claim formulation.

## Key Results
- Outperforms or matches fine-tuned BERT models across all three evaluation tasks
- Achieves F1-scores of 0.87, 0.85, and 0.76 on climate contrarianism, topic/stance, and depression detection respectively
- Requires 2.3 to 51.3 times less annotation data compared to traditional fine-tuning approaches
- Threshold tuning via PBA provides significant performance boost over zero-shot NLI
- Optimal PBA parameter p typically falls in the 0.7-0.8 range

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Few-shot active learning via Probabilistic Bisection efficiently finds optimal thresholds for each claim.
- Mechanism: PBA dynamically selects examples near the current threshold estimate and updates a probability distribution over the threshold space based on human annotation.
- Core assumption: The optimal threshold for a claim is where NLI model's score distributions for "contains claim" and "does not contain claim" overlap.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The performance of these models is then boosted by annotating a minimal sample of data points, dynamically sampled using the well-established statistical heuristic of Probabilistic Bisection."
  - [section] "The Probabilistic Bisection Algorithm we use to tune the threshold of each claim requires a hyper-parameter p, which captures the probability of the threshold being in the direction indicated by the annotator."
- Break condition: If probability distribution becomes too narrow due to data sparsity or if p is set too high/low, algorithm may stop before finding accurate threshold.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Natural Language Inference models can effectively determine if a claim is entailed by a text.
- Mechanism: BARTMNLI outputs a score between 0 and 1 representing degree of entailment between text and claim. Claims are defined as statements that, if present in text, would entail the claim.
- Core assumption: NLI model is well-calibrated and domain-invariant enough to provide meaningful entailment scores for arbitrary text-claim pairs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "using Natural Language Inference models to obtain the textual entailment between these and a corpus of interest."
  - [section] "The NLI model we use in this paper is BARTMNLI, a version of the BART transformer-based model (Lewis et al. 2020) fine-tuned on the Multi-genre Natural Language Inference (MNLI) dataset (Williams, Nangia, and Bowman 2018)."
- Break condition: If NLI model is poorly calibrated or domain shift is too large, entailment scores may not reflect true claim presence.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Defining classes as taxonomies of claims allows flexible, theory-grounded classification.
- Mechanism: Users define complex classes by specifying logical relations between claims (e.g., text contains at least one claim, text contains all claims, text contains claim A but not claim B).
- Core assumption: Claims can be explicitly defined and logically combined to represent meaningful classes for the task at hand.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Representing categories of interest as arbitrarily sophisticated taxonomies of statements then allows users to explicitly incorporate their own domain expertise into the classification system."
  - [section] "More concretely, we propose a domain-agnostic methodology for the detection of statements in natural text. The methodology leverages existing transformer-based Natural Language Inference (NLI) models and a frugal annotation strategy grounded in the well-established statistical heuristic of Probabilistic Bisection."
- Break condition: If claims are poorly defined or logical relations are too complex to evaluate accurately, classification performance may suffer.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Natural Language Inference (NLI)
  - Why needed here: NLI is the core mechanism for determining if a text contains a claim. Understanding how NLI models work and their limitations is crucial for interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: What are the three possible outputs of an NLI model, and how do they relate to claim presence?

- Concept: Probabilistic Bisection Algorithm
  - Why needed here: PBA is the active learning strategy used to efficiently find optimal thresholds. Understanding how it works is important for tuning the hyperparameter p and interpreting the final probability distribution.
  - Quick check question: How does PBA use human annotations to update the probability distribution over the threshold space?

- Concept: Taxonomy Definition
  - Why needed here: The flexibility of the methodology comes from allowing users to define complex classes using claims. Understanding how to construct meaningful taxonomies is key to applying the method to new tasks.
  - Quick check question: How can claims be combined using logical operators to define more complex classes than a single claim?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Text → NLI Model (BARTMNLI) → Entailment Scores → Probabilistic Bisection Algorithm → Thresholds → Classification
- Critical path: NLI model inference is the bottleneck. Optimizing batch processing and caching entailment scores can improve performance.
- Design tradeoffs: Using a more powerful NLI model may improve accuracy but increase computational cost. Allowing more complex logical relations between claims increases flexibility but may make the classification task harder.
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on a claim may indicate that the claim is too vague, the NLI model struggles with negation, or the threshold is not well-calibrated. Unexpectedly wide or narrow probability distributions may indicate data sparsity or an inappropriate value of p.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run the methodology on a small subset of the data with a simple taxonomy to verify that the components work together as expected.
  2. Vary the hyperparameter p and observe its effect on the convergence of the Probabilistic Bisection Algorithm.
  3. Compare the performance of the methodology using different NLI models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) to assess the impact of model choice.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the Probabilistic Bisection Algorithm vary with different values of the parameter p, and what is the optimal range for this parameter?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the impact of the parameter p on the performance of the Probabilistic Bisection Algorithm in Experiment 1.
- Why unresolved: The paper suggests that a value of p from the 0.7 to 0.8 range appears to be a good default, but does not provide a definitive optimal value.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting additional experiments with a wider range of p values and analyzing the performance of the algorithm for each value would provide more insight into the optimal range for this parameter.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the threshold-tuning algorithm perform when used on separate folds of the data, and what is the impact of data sparsity on the convergence of the algorithm?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the performance of the threshold-tuning algorithm on separate folds of the data in Experiment 2.
- Why unresolved: The paper suggests that the algorithm occasionally needs to stop before satisfactorily converging on a threshold due to data sparsity, but does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the impact of data sparsity on the algorithm's performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with varying levels of data sparsity and analyzing the performance of the algorithm in each case would provide more insight into the impact of data sparsity on the algorithm's convergence.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the proposed methodology be improved to better handle negations and complex claims, and what impact would these improvements have on the performance of the algorithm?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the impact of negations and complex claims on the performance of the algorithm in Experiment 3.
- Why unresolved: The paper suggests that the algorithm may have difficulty handling negations and complex claims, but does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the impact of these factors on the algorithm's performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with different formulations of negations and complex claims and analyzing the performance of the algorithm in each case would provide more insight into the impact of these factors on the algorithm's performance.

## Limitations

- The methodology's performance depends on BARTMNLI's domain transferability, which is not systematically analyzed across truly unseen domains
- Claim taxonomies require careful formulation; poorly defined claims or complex logical relations may lead to unreliable classifications
- The PBA stopping condition (95% confidence interval < 0.20) is heuristic and may not guarantee optimal thresholds in all cases

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The methodology's core architecture (NLI + PBA + claim taxonomies) is sound and well-specified. Comparative results against multiple baselines are methodologically rigorous.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that 2.3-51.3x less annotation is needed compared to fine-tuning is based on reported annotation counts but doesn't account for potential differences in annotation complexity or domain expertise requirements.
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability of results to truly unseen domains is uncertain, as all three evaluation tasks, while diverse, share certain characteristics that may favor the NLI-based approach.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-domain robustness test**: Apply the methodology to a dataset from a significantly different domain (e.g., legal contracts, scientific literature) to evaluate NLI model transferability beyond the tested domains.

2. **Annotation complexity analysis**: Conduct a controlled study comparing the time and expertise required to annotate for PBA threshold tuning versus traditional fine-tuning, accounting for claim formulation overhead.

3. **Threshold sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary the PBA stopping condition threshold (currently 0.20) and probability parameter p (currently 0.7) across a wider range to establish their impact on final classification performance and identify potential overfitting to specific values.
