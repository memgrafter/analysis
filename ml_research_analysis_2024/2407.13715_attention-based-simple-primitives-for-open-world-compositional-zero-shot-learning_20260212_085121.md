# Attention Based Simple Primitives for Open World Compositional Zero-Shot Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2407.13715
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13715
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Achieves state-of-the-art results on CGQA with 41.07 HM score, outperforming existing methods

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Attention-based Simple Primitives (ASP), a novel approach for Open World Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (OW-CZSL) that leverages self-attention mechanisms to capture relationships between attributes and objects. The model independently predicts attributes and objects while using attention to model their interactions, addressing the challenge of generalizing from seen to unseen compositions. ASP incorporates external knowledge from ConceptNet to filter out implausible compositions, improving open-world performance. The approach is evaluated on three benchmark datasets (MIT-States, UT-Zappos, and CGQA) and demonstrates competitive performance, particularly excelling on CGQA with state-of-the-art results.

## Method Summary
ASP uses a ResNet18 backbone to extract visual features, which are projected into attribute and object spaces using separate MLPs. The model employs multi-head self-attention between attributes and objects to capture contextual relationships, applying the attention to textual embeddings and projecting them back to visual spaces. Predictions are made independently for attributes and objects using cosine similarity, then combined multiplicatively. ConceptNet provides feasibility scores to filter out implausible compositions during inference. The model is trained using cross-entropy loss on both attribute and object predictions, with separate MLPs for each dataset's specific requirements (Word2Vec for CGQA, Word2Vec/FastText for MIT-States/UT-Zappos).

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CGQA with 41.07 HM score
- Outperforms existing methods on MIT-States and UT-Zappos with competitive results
- Demonstrates superior unseen accuracy compared to compositional approaches in open-world settings
- Shows significant improvement when attention mechanism is included, validating its effectiveness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Self-attention captures attribute-object interactions better than independent classifiers
- Mechanism: Multi-head attention processes object and attribute embeddings, creating transformed embeddings that encode contextual relationships between attributes and objects
- Core assumption: Attribute-object relationships are context-dependent and benefit from learned attention patterns rather than independent prediction
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our approach involves utilizing the self-attention mechanism between attributes and objects to achieve better generalization from seen to unseen compositions"
  - [section] "We employ multi-headed attention block to capture the relationship between object labels and attributes"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus contains attention-based methods but lacks direct comparison to independent classifiers
- Break condition: If attention weights converge to uniform distribution, eliminating any learned interaction patterns

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: ConceptNet filtering improves open-world generalization by removing implausible compositions
- Mechanism: External knowledge graph provides feasibility scores that filter out impossible attribute-object pairs during inference
- Core assumption: ConceptNet contains accurate and comprehensive knowledge about real-world attribute-object relationships
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we leverage external knowledge from ConceptNet to restrict the test space to realistic compositions"
  - [section] "Following [16] we employ ConceptNet [37] to remove unfeasible compositions"
  - [corpus] Moderate - corpus shows ConceptNet usage but lacks evidence about effectiveness for CZSL specifically
- Break condition: If ConceptNet contains noisy or missing relationships, potentially removing valid compositions or keeping invalid ones

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Independent prediction of primitives with attention-based context improves open-world performance
- Mechanism: Model predicts attributes and objects separately while using attention to model their interactions, reducing test space complexity from O(A×O) to O(A+O)
- Core assumption: Open-world setting benefits more from independent prediction due to combinatorial explosion of compositions
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Our approach of independently predicting primitives performs better due to the significant reduction in our test space in open-world CZSL"
  - [section] "In open world environments, the method of independently predicting primitives offers significant advantages"
  - [corpus] Strong - multiple papers (KG-SP, Compcos) show independent vs compositional prediction trade-offs
- Break condition: If dataset size is small, compositional prediction may outperform independent prediction despite larger search space

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Self-attention mechanism
  - Why needed here: Captures contextual relationships between attributes and objects that vary depending on the composition
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between self-attention and cross-attention, and why is self-attention more appropriate for this problem?

- Concept: Zero-shot learning
  - Why needed here: Model must recognize compositions never seen during training, requiring generalization from known primitives
  - Quick check question: How does compositional zero-shot learning differ from traditional zero-shot learning in terms of input and output space?

- Concept: Knowledge graphs (ConceptNet)
  - Why needed here: Provides external validation of composition feasibility, filtering out implausible combinations
  - Quick check question: What are the limitations of using ConceptNet for filtering compositions in domain-specific datasets?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: ResNet18 feature extractor → Image encoders (ϕai, ϕoi) → Word embeddings → Multi-head attention block → Context encoders (ϕac, ϕoc) → Cosine similarity comparison → Feasibility filtering → Prediction
- Critical path: Image features → Attribute prediction → Object prediction → Composition score (product of individual scores) → Feasibility filtering → Final prediction
- Design tradeoffs: Independent prediction reduces search space but loses direct composition modeling; attention adds complexity but captures context; ConceptNet filtering improves quality but depends on external knowledge quality
- Failure signatures: Poor unseen accuracy indicates attention isn't learning useful interactions; high seen but low unseen accuracy suggests overfitting to training compositions; performance drop on specific datasets (like UT-Zappos) indicates dataset-specific limitations
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train without attention block - should see significant performance drop, validating attention's importance
  2. Train without ConceptNet filtering - should see more implausible predictions in open-world setting
  3. Vary number of attention heads - observe impact on harmonic mean to find optimal configuration

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Relies on external knowledge graphs (ConceptNet) that may contain domain-specific noise or gaps, particularly for specialized datasets like UT-Zappos
- Attention mechanism's effectiveness may diminish if attribute-object relationships become too complex or context-dependent for learned patterns to capture
- Independent prediction approach may miss synergistic effects that compositional models capture, potentially limiting performance on datasets where such relationships are crucial

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: CGQA results and state-of-the-art performance, well-supported by ablation studies
- **Medium confidence**: MIT-States and UT-Zappos results where ASP performs competitively but doesn't achieve top rankings
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability of ConceptNet filtering across all datasets due to insufficient validation of ConceptNet's coverage and accuracy

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation with different knowledge graphs**: Replace ConceptNet with alternative knowledge sources (e.g., WordNet, domain-specific ontologies) to assess robustness of the filtering mechanism across knowledge sources.

2. **Attention weight analysis**: Visualize and analyze the attention weight distributions across different datasets and composition types to verify that meaningful patterns are being learned rather than random or uniform distributions.

3. **Cross-dataset generalization**: Train on one dataset (e.g., MIT-States) and evaluate on another (e.g., CGQA) to test the model's ability to transfer learned attention patterns and primitive relationships across domains.
