# Planning with OWL-DL Ontologies (Extended Version)

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.07544
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07544
- Authors: Tobias John; Patrick Koopmann
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Ontology-mediated planning framework supporting full OWL-DL using justifications, achieving competitive performance on certain domains

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ontology-mediated planning (OMPS), a framework that integrates planning problems with ontologies to handle incomplete domain knowledge. Unlike existing approaches limited to Horn description logics, their method supports full OWL-DL by using justifications to rewrite OMPS into PDDL. The authors develop optimization techniques for justification computation, including concept-based and schema-leveraging algorithms. Evaluation across 116 benchmarks demonstrates that their approach works in practice, with optimizations significantly improving performance. While their best algorithm solves more instances than the state-of-the-art Horn approach on some domains, the latter is faster on others, showing that OMPS is not universally superior but offers more expressive ontology support.

## Method Summary
The authors present a novel approach to ontology-mediated planning that supports full OWL-DL rather than being limited to Horn DLs. Their method uses justifications - minimal sets of axioms responsible for an entailment - to rewrite the OMPS problem into PDDL, a standard planning language. They develop two key optimization techniques: a concept-based approach that leverages ontology structure to reduce justification computation, and a schema-leveraging algorithm that exploits planning domain patterns. The framework translates OWL-DL axioms into PDDL actions and fluents, allowing standard planners to solve the resulting problem. Their approach handles the complexity of OWL-DL through careful decomposition and optimization of the justification-finding process.

## Key Results
- OMPS framework successfully solves 116 benchmark planning problems with incomplete domain knowledge
- Concept-based and schema-leveraging optimizations significantly improve justification computation performance
- Best algorithm solves more instances than state-of-the-art Horn-DL approach on some domains, though Horn-DL is faster on others
- Framework demonstrates practical feasibility of using full OWL-DL for planning rather than restricted DL fragments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by translating ontology-mediated planning problems into standard PDDL using justifications. When an OWL-DL axiom cannot be directly expressed in PDDL, the framework identifies minimal sets of axioms (justifications) that cause the entailment, then rewrites these as PDDL actions and fluents. This allows standard planners to handle the resulting problem while preserving the expressive power of OWL-DL. The optimizations work by exploiting ontology structure - the concept-based approach reduces computation by focusing on relevant ontology portions, while schema-leveraging uses domain patterns to avoid redundant calculations. This decomposition makes the inherently complex OWL-DL reasoning tractable for planning purposes.

## Foundational Learning

**Justifications**: Minimal axiom sets responsible for an entailment in OWL-DL. Needed to identify which ontology parts block a planning action, enabling precise rewriting into PDDL. Quick check: Verify that removing any axiom from a justification eliminates the entailment.

**OWL-DL vs Horn DL**: OWL-DL is more expressive but computationally harder than Horn DLs. Needed because real-world domains often require the richer constructs OWL-DL provides. Quick check: Confirm that the domain requires existential restrictions or disjunction that Horn DL cannot express.

**PDDL Translation**: Converting ontology constraints into PDDL actions and fluents. Needed to leverage existing planning algorithms on ontology-mediated problems. Quick check: Ensure translated PDDL preserves all original constraints and goals.

**Concept-based Optimization**: Using ontology structure to limit justification computation scope. Needed to make the approach scalable by avoiding unnecessary reasoning. Quick check: Verify optimization reduces justification candidates without missing valid ones.

**Schema-leveraging**: Exploiting planning domain patterns to optimize computation. Needed to avoid redundant calculations across similar planning scenarios. Quick check: Confirm pattern matching correctly identifies reusable computation across instances.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Ontology axioms -> Justification finder -> PDDL rewriter -> Standard planner -> Solution

**Critical path**: The justification computation phase is the performance bottleneck, as OWL-DL reasoning is computationally intensive. The translation to PDDL and planning phases are relatively fast once justifications are found.

**Design tradeoffs**: Full OWL-DL support vs. computational efficiency - the framework sacrifices speed for expressiveness. The choice to use justifications enables this expressiveness but creates the main performance challenge that optimizations must address.

**Failure signatures**: 
- Incomplete solutions when justification computation misses relevant axioms
- Performance degradation on domains with many complex axioms requiring extensive justification search
- Translation failures when OWL-DL constructs cannot be reasonably mapped to PDDL

**First 3 experiments to run**:
1. Verify translation correctness by comparing solutions on simple domains with known answers
2. Test justification computation on domains with varying axiom complexity to identify scaling limits
3. Compare planning time with and without optimizations on identical problems to quantify improvement

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Computational complexity of finding justifications in OWL-DL is inherently intractable, limiting scalability
- Evaluation focuses on synthetic benchmarks rather than real-world planning scenarios, reducing external validity
- Performance comparison shows domain-dependent results, indicating OMPS is not universally superior to Horn-DL approaches

## Confidence

**Framework correctness**: High - formal definitions and proof sketches provided
**Optimization techniques**: Medium - empirical results across multiple benchmarks support effectiveness
**Practical applicability**: Low - limited real-world testing and evaluation on synthetic benchmarks

## Next Checks

1. Test OMPS on real-world planning domains with incomplete knowledge to assess practical utility
2. Conduct scalability experiments with ontologies containing thousands of axioms to identify limits
3. Compare solution quality and planning time against non-ontology-based approaches on identical problems to validate added value
