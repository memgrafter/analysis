# Text Proxy: Decomposing Retrieval from a 1-to-N Relationship into N 1-to-1 Relationships for Text-Video Retrieval

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.06618
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06618
- Reference count: 30
- This paper proposes Text-Video-ProxyNet (TV-ProxyNet) for text-video retrieval, achieving 2.0% to 3.3% improvement in R@1 over baseline

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel framework called Text-Video-ProxyNet (TV-ProxyNet) for text-video retrieval that decomposes the conventional 1-to-N relationship into N distinct 1-to-1 relationships. The approach replaces a single text query with a series of text proxies, each specifically aligned to individual videos through an iterative refinement process controlled by director and dash mechanisms. Experiments on MSRVTT, DiDeMo, and ActivityNet Captions demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, showing improvements of 2.0% to 3.3% in R@1 over baseline models.

## Method Summary
TV-ProxyNet decomposes text-video retrieval into N 1-to-1 relationships by generating N text proxies per query, each aligned to a specific video. The framework uses CLIP-ViP backbone with a Text Proxy Generator module that employs director and dash mechanisms to control proxy direction and distance in joint space. The iterative proxy refinement process balances textual and video information across multiple rounds, with each proxy specifically crafted for individual video alignment. The model is trained using three loss functions: query-video alignment (Lr), proxy-video alignment (Lp), and positive proxy regulation (Lpos).

## Key Results
- TV-ProxyNet achieves 2.0% to 3.3% improvement in R@1 over baseline models
- State-of-the-art performance on MSRVTT and ActivityNet Captions
- Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of proxy-video loss and positive proxy regulation loss

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Decomposing 1-to-N retrieval into N 1-to-1 relationships reduces interference from irregular data patterns
- Mechanism: Each text query generates N proxies, each tied to a unique video, forcing the model to learn video-specific patterns
- Core assumption: Irregularities in video-text pairs interfere with global semantic alignment
- Evidence anchors: Abstract and section text describe the decomposition strategy
- Break condition: If irregular factors are minimal or uniform across samples, decomposition offers little advantage

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Director and dash mechanisms precisely control proxy direction and distance in joint space
- Mechanism: Director vector points from query toward direction leader; dash scalar modulates proximity to positive/negative samples
- Core assumption: Fine-grained control over proxy position improves semantic discrimination
- Evidence anchors: Abstract and section text describe director and dash mechanisms
- Break condition: If joint space is too noisy or proxy generator is poorly initialized, learned directions may collapse

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Iterative proxy refinement balances textual and video information over multiple rounds
- Mechanism: Each round updates direction leader using cross-attention, gradually incorporating more video context
- Core assumption: Early proxies are query-dominated; later proxies incorporate more video semantics
- Evidence anchors: Abstract and section text describe iterative proxy generation
- Break condition: Too many iterations may overfit to video-specific noise; too few may leave proxies too query-centric

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cross-modal contrastive learning
  - Why needed here: Core training objective aligns text-video pairs in joint embedding space
  - Quick check question: What loss formulation ensures positive pairs are closer than negative pairs in the joint space?

- Concept: Attention-based cross-modal feature fusion
  - Why needed here: Direction leader generation relies on cross-attention between text and video proxies
  - Quick check question: How does the query token act as a guide in the cross-attention computation of direction leaders?

- Concept: Proxy-based representation augmentation
  - Why needed here: Text proxies expand semantic scope of queries without changing underlying encoder
  - Quick check question: Why does generating a proxy for each video in a batch help reduce modeling irregularity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Text/Video Encoders -> Text Proxy Generator (Direction Leader, Director, Dash) -> Contrastive Losses
- Critical path:
  1. Encode video and text using CLIP-ViP backbone
  2. Generate direction leader via cross-attention over video proxies
  3. Compute director and dash to form text proxy
  4. Apply contrastive losses (Lr, Lp, Lpos)
- Design tradeoffs:
  - More proxy iterations → better discrimination but higher compute
  - Complex dash (exp(SW)) → more flexibility but risk of instability
  - Fixed vs. learnable γ in inference → simpler but less adaptive
- Failure signatures:
  - Training loss diverges → check dash scaling or direction leader stability
  - Proxy distribution too narrow → adjust δ, η hyperparameters
  - No performance gain → verify proxy-video logits are used in inference
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run baseline CLIP-ViP, record R@1
  2. Add Lp loss only, measure improvement
  3. Add both Lp and Lpos, compare to step 2

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the text proxy path's iterative refinement process balance semantic information from text and video across different datasets?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions iterative process is designed to balance textual and video information across datasets with varying characteristics
- Why unresolved: Paper doesn't provide specific details on how model dynamically adjusts balance or adapts to different datasets
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing performance on datasets with varying information richness and analysis of balance changes across iterations

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal number of text proxies (N) to generate for each text query?
- Basis in paper: Framework decomposes 1-to-N into N 1-to-1 relationships but doesn't specify optimal N value
- Why unresolved: Paper only mentions using 2 iterations but doesn't explore impact of different numbers of proxies
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies comparing performance with different numbers of text proxies and analysis of performance vs. computational cost

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the model handle cases where textual description is ambiguous or corresponds to multiple segments within a video?
- Basis in paper: Paper acknowledges model struggles with ambiguous textual correspondences and complex content changes
- Why unresolved: While paper acknowledges issue, it doesn't provide detailed explanation of how model addresses this or strategies to improve performance
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results on datasets with ambiguous textual descriptions and analysis of model's handling of these cases

## Limitations
- Limited discussion on computational overhead introduced by generating N proxies per query
- Potential overfitting to specific dataset characteristics due to dataset-specific dash generation methods
- Paper doesn't fully address how proxy generation handles extreme semantic variations in video content

## Confidence
- High: Overall framework design and decomposition strategy are well-defined and reproducible
- Medium: Director and dash mechanisms' specific implementation details and hyperparameter tuning
- Low: Effectiveness of iterative proxy refinement in handling irregular data patterns across all datasets

## Next Checks
1. Validate director and dash mechanism implementation by reproducing proxy generation process on small dataset subset and comparing proxy distributions

2. Conduct systematic ablation study on δ and η hyperparameters across all three datasets to identify optimal values and their impact on retrieval performance

3. Measure training and inference time overhead introduced by proxy generation process and compare it to baseline CLIP-ViP performance
