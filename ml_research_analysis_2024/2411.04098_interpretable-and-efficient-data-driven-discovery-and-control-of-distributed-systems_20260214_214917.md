# Interpretable and Efficient Data-driven Discovery and Control of Distributed Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.04098
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04098
- Reference count: 40
- AE+SINDy-C achieves comparable or superior performance to model-free baselines using 5-10x fewer full-order model interactions

## Executive Summary
This work proposes AE+SINDy-C, a model-based reinforcement learning framework that combines autoencoders with sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics with control (SINDy-C) to efficiently control high-dimensional PDEs. The method learns a low-dimensional, interpretable surrogate model of PDE dynamics, enabling data-efficient training and fast rollouts while reducing the need for extensive environment interactions. Experiments on the 1D Burgers and 2D Navier-Stokes equations demonstrate that AE+SINDy-C achieves comparable or superior performance to model-free baselines using 5-10x fewer full-order model interactions.

## Method Summary
AE+SINDy-C combines autoencoders for dimensionality reduction with SINDy-C for learning sparse, interpretable dynamics in latent space. The framework uses a Dyna-style model-based reinforcement learning approach where an agent trains multiple steps on the learned surrogate model before collecting new data from the full-order PDE environment. This architecture enables efficient exploration of the control space while maintaining interpretability of the learned dynamics through sparse regression.

## Key Results
- AE+SINDy-C achieves comparable or superior performance to model-free baselines using 5-10x fewer full-order model interactions
- The learned latent-space dynamics are interpretable and parsimonious, with AE+SINDy-C independently discovering compact control representations
- Sample efficiency gains are demonstrated on both 1D Burgers equation and 2D Navier-Stokes equations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Combining SINDy-C with autoencoders enables dimensionality reduction that preserves dynamics interpretability while reducing computational cost. Autoencoders compress high-dimensional PDE state and control into low-dimensional latent spaces where SINDy-C can efficiently learn sparse, interpretable dynamics, reducing the effective state dimension from Nx to N_Lat and enabling tractable sparse regression and fast rollouts.

### Mechanism 2
Dyna-style model-based reinforcement learning using the learned surrogate model drastically reduces full-order environment interactions while maintaining performance. The agent trains kdyn-1 times on the surrogate model before collecting new data from the full-order environment, creating a feedback loop that reduces sample complexity while the learned surrogate model provides fast rollouts for more training iterations per unit of real environment interaction.

### Mechanism 3
The learned latent-space dynamics are interpretable and parsimonious, enabling discovery of the underlying physical system structure. SINDy-C in the latent space identifies a sparse set of governing terms (polynomials, trigonometric functions) that represent the system dynamics, with the resulting closed-form equations revealing the essential physical mechanisms driving the PDE behavior.

## Foundational Learning

- **Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and their discretization**: PDEs must be discretized for computational control; understanding the difference between a PDE and its discretized finite-dimensional representation is crucial.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**: The control problem is formulated as an RL task where the agent learns to maximize cumulative reward through interaction with the PDE environment; understanding how reward functions guide policy learning is essential.
- **Autoencoders and dimensionality reduction**: Autoencoders compress high-dimensional PDE states into low-dimensional latent representations suitable for SINDy-C; understanding the role of reconstruction loss in autoencoder training is important.

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Encoder networks (φx, φu) compress state and control into latent space → SINDy-C operates in latent space to learn dynamics coefficients Ξ → Decoder networks (ψx, ψu) reconstruct predictions back to observation space → RL agent (PPO) learns control policy using surrogate environment → Full-order environment provides ground truth data for training and evaluation
- **Critical path**: 1) Collect data from full-order environment (states, controls, next states) → 2) Train autoencoders + SINDy-C to learn surrogate dynamics model → 3) Use surrogate model for kdyn-1 training steps of RL agent → 4) Collect new data from full-order environment → 5) Update surrogate model and repeat
- **Design tradeoffs**: Latent space dimension vs. model accuracy (higher dimensions capture more detail but increase computational cost); kdyn frequency vs. sample efficiency (lower kdyn means more frequent full-order interactions but potentially more stable learning); dictionary function selection vs. interpretability (more complex dictionaries may capture dynamics better but reduce interpretability)
- **Failure signatures**: Surrogate model loss not converging (indicates poor autoencoder or SINDy-C training); RL performance plateaus or degrades (suggests surrogate model is inaccurate or outdated); controls become chaotic or unstable (may indicate insufficient latent space dimension or poor dictionary choice)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Train AE+SINDy-C on Burgers' equation with kdyn=5, fully observable case - verify sample efficiency vs. baseline; 2) Vary latent space dimension (2D vs 4D) on Navier-Stokes - observe impact on performance and interpretability; 3) Test robustness to observation noise by adding Gaussian noise to state measurements - verify control performance degradation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the choice of dictionary functions impact the interpretability and accuracy of the learned dynamics model? The paper mentions using polynomial and trigonometric functions as dictionary candidates but does not explore the impact of different function choices. Systematic comparison of learned dynamics and performance metrics using different dictionary function sets would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
What is the optimal update frequency kdyn for balancing sample efficiency and model accuracy across different PDE systems? The paper tests kdyn values of 5, 10, and 15 but does not provide a systematic analysis of how kdyn should be chosen based on system complexity or other factors. Empirical study varying kdyn across a range of PDE systems would establish selection criteria.

### Open Question 3
How does the AE+SINDy-C framework generalize to PDEs with different types of boundary conditions or time-dependent parameters? The paper only tests Dirichlet boundary conditions and fixed parameters, though the framework could theoretically handle more complex scenarios. Application to PDEs with Neumann/Robin boundary conditions and time-varying parameters would validate generalizability.

### Open Question 4
What are the limitations of AE+SINDy-C when dealing with PDEs that have a higher intrinsic dimensionality than those tested? The paper tests systems with 2D and 8D latent spaces but does not explore the upper bounds of the framework's scalability. Application to high-dimensional PDEs with varying latent space dimensions would measure performance degradation points.

## Limitations

- Performance depends critically on appropriate selection of latent space dimension and dictionary functions, which may require domain expertise and careful tuning
- Reliance on accurate autoencoders and SINDy-C models means poor training data or inadequate dictionary coverage can lead to significant performance degradation
- Current implementation assumes full observability of the PDE state, limiting direct applicability to partially observable systems common in real-world applications

## Confidence

- **High**: The sample efficiency improvements over model-free baselines (5-10x fewer interactions) are well-supported by experimental results on Burgers and Navier-Stokes equations
- **Medium**: The interpretability claims are supported by the parsimonious latent dynamics discovered, but the practical utility of these interpretations for scientific discovery remains to be fully demonstrated
- **Medium**: The generalizability to other PDE systems is suggested by the method's flexibility, but remains to be validated across a broader range of equation types

## Next Checks

1. Test AE+SINDy-C on a wider variety of PDEs (e.g., reaction-diffusion, wave equations) to assess generalizability beyond Burgers and Navier-Stokes
2. Evaluate performance under partial observability conditions by implementing state estimation techniques and measuring impact on control quality
3. Conduct ablation studies systematically varying latent dimension, dictionary complexity, and kdyn parameters to identify optimal configurations for different PDE classes
