## Executive Summary
This work introduces an interactive framework for learning generalizable robot skills by combining local and global trajectory modulations. It extends the kernelized movement primitives (KMP) framework with task parameterization, enabling users to incrementally improve skill accuracy and extend capabilities through direct physical corrections. By adding via-points locally with respect to objects of interest, the approach allows corrections to move with objects and supports adding new objects without retraining. An uncertainty-aware stiffness regulation scheme based on epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties facilitates compliant interaction beyond demonstrated regions. Experiments on a 7-DoF robot in a ring-loading task demonstrate successful skill correction, object addition, and extension to non-demonstrated inputs.

## Method Summary
The approach builds on kernelized movement primitives (KMP) with task parameterization to enable generalizable robot skills. Multiple local KMPs are defined in object-specific coordinate frames, with their outputs combined via a product of Gaussians to produce global trajectory distributions. Users can incrementally improve skills through interactive corrections - via-points are added locally to relevant object frames based on distance, force, or button press triggers. For regions without demonstrations, placeholder frames with high variance allow new objects to be integrated without retraining. Epistemic uncertainty from the KMP covariance decomposition drives compliant stiffness regulation, enabling safe physical interaction during skill extension.

## Key Results
- Achieves 93% success rate across 15 box configurations in ring-loading task
- Successfully corrects skill accuracy through interactive physical corrections
- Enables incremental addition of new objects without retraining
- Extends skills into non-demonstrated regions using uncertainty-aware compliance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Local via-points added in object frames allow corrections to move with objects when task parameters change.
- Mechanism: By projecting the correction into the local coordinate system of the relevant object, the via-point becomes relative to that object. When the object's pose changes, the via-point's global coordinates automatically update through the transformation chain, maintaining the intended local correction.
- Core assumption: Task parameters (b(p), A(p)) correctly represent the current object poses in the global frame.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "enabling users to incrementally improve skill accuracy and extend capabilities through direct physical corrections" and "corrections to move with objects"
  - [section]: "When a new global via-point v̄t is defined, we rely on a proximity-based criteria to determine which KMP to apply it to" and "The via-point is then mapped to the selected frame through v̄(p∗)"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus papers focus on generalizable skills but don't address moving corrections with objects specifically.
- Break condition: If the object's coordinate system changes discontinuously or the transformation parameters become corrupted, the via-point won't track correctly.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Epistemic uncertainty quantification enables compliant interaction in regions without demonstrations.
- Mechanism: The KMP covariance decomposition separates epistemic uncertainty (model uncertainty due to lack of data) from aleatoric uncertainty (data noise). By using epistemic uncertainty to drive stiffness reduction via sigmoid-weighted control, the robot becomes compliant when extending into novel regions, allowing safe physical interaction for data collection.
- Core assumption: The kernel hyperparameters and covariance decomposition accurately capture the epistemic uncertainty in novel regions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "uncertainty-aware stiffness regulation scheme based on epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties facilitates compliant interaction beyond demonstrated regions"
  - [section]: "we propose to compute the robot end-effector stiffness using GP = w1 · (δepΣ*ep)−1 + w2 · (δalΣ*al)−1" and the detailed discussion of uncertainty decomposition
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus papers mention uncertainty but don't specifically address epistemic uncertainty for compliant interaction in LfD.
- Break condition: If the kernel hyperparameters are poorly chosen or the covariance decomposition fails, the stiffness regulation won't accurately reflect epistemic uncertainty.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Placeholder frames with high variance allow incremental addition of new objects without retraining.
- Mechanism: By creating a new local KMP with large initial variance, it has minimal influence in the Gaussian product during skill execution. As via-points are added through physical corrections, the variance decreases locally, allowing the new object to participate in the skill without requiring new demonstrations.
- Core assumption: The placeholder frame's high variance truly minimizes its influence until via-points are added.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "add new objects to the task during execution and 3) extend the skill into regions where demonstrations were not provided"
  - [section]: "we employ two key steps. Firstly, we associate to the new task parameters b(P+1), A(P+1) a placeholder local KMP with the same inputs as other local KMPs, zero means and high variances"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus papers discuss incremental learning but don't specifically address placeholder frames for new objects.
- Break condition: If the placeholder variance isn't sufficiently large, it may influence the skill before via-points are added.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Task parameterization and coordinate transformations
  - Why needed here: The entire framework relies on representing objects as coordinate frames and transforming between global and local representations for skill generalization
  - Quick check question: If an object moves from position (1,0,0) to (2,0,0) in the global frame, how do the task parameters b(p) and A(p) change for that object's frame?

- Concept: Gaussian process regression and kernel methods
  - Why needed here: KMPs are built on kernel-based regression that predicts trajectory distributions, and understanding the covariance decomposition is crucial for the uncertainty-aware control
  - Quick check question: Given a set of training inputs and outputs, what happens to the KMP prediction variance as you query points move farther from the training data?

- Concept: Aleatoric vs epistemic uncertainty
  - Why needed here: The framework explicitly separates these two types of uncertainty to drive different behaviors - aleatoric for precision in demonstrated regions, epistemic for compliance in novel regions
  - Quick check question: In a scenario with perfect demonstrations but querying outside the demonstrated region, which type of uncertainty would dominate and why?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Time/robot state (s) -> Task parameterization module -> Local KMP modules -> Global fusion module -> Robot control
- Critical path: User interaction → Interaction detection → Via-point creation → Local KMP update → Global fusion → Robot control
- Design tradeoffs:
  - High kernel length scale: smoother predictions but less accurate local corrections
  - Low via-point variance: stronger influence but may overfit to single corrections
  - Placeholder variance magnitude: too low affects skill before via-points added, too high requires many via-points to become influential
- Failure signatures:
  - Robot doesn't respond to corrections: Check interaction detection thresholds and via-point variance
  - Corrections don't move with objects: Verify task parameter transformations are correct
  - Robot too stiff in novel regions: Check epistemic uncertainty computation and sigmoid parameters
  - New objects don't integrate: Verify placeholder variance is sufficiently large
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Basic TP-KMP functionality: Demonstrate skill with two boxes at different positions, verify generalization works within demonstrated region
  2. Via-point addition: Move one box to a new height, apply force correction, verify via-point is added to correct frame and skill improves
  3. New object integration: Add camera frame as placeholder, add via-points through button presses, verify robot passes in front of camera during execution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited empirical validation of epistemic uncertainty quantification and its impact on compliant interaction
- Placeholder frame mechanism for new object integration lacks rigorous testing across varying numbers of objects
- Interaction detection thresholds appear arbitrary without systematic sensitivity analysis

## Confidence
- High: Task parameterization correctly enables skill generalization to new object positions
- Medium: Local via-point addition improves skill accuracy in demonstrated regions
- Medium: Epistemic uncertainty drives appropriate stiffness regulation for safe interaction
- Low: Placeholder frames reliably enable new object integration without demonstrations

## Next Checks
1. **Epistemic Uncertainty Validation**: Systematically vary the distance of box positions from demonstrated regions and measure both predicted epistemic uncertainty and actual interaction forces to verify the stiffness regulation responds appropriately.

2. **Multi-object Scalability**: Test the framework with 5+ objects in complex configurations to evaluate whether the product-of-Gaussians approach maintains computational efficiency and whether placeholder frames continue to function reliably.

3. **Generalization Boundaries**: Create a systematic grid of box positions spanning regions far outside the demonstrated area and measure success rates to quantify the actual generalization limits of the approach.
