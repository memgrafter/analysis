# Adversarial Machine Unlearning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.07687
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07687
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: SG-Unlearn achieves best performance on most metrics, indicating successful removal of forget set's influence

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a game-theoretic framework for machine unlearning that integrates membership inference attacks (MIA) into the design of unlearning algorithms. The authors model the problem as a Stackelberg game between an unlearner and an auditor, where the unlearner adjusts the model using gradient feedback from the auditor's MIA to limit the attacker's success. The framework uses implicit differentiation to compute gradients, making it compatible with end-to-end training pipelines. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets demonstrate that the proposed method, SG-Unlearn, outperforms baseline methods in random forgetting scenarios while maintaining model utility.

## Method Summary
The method formulates machine unlearning as a Stackelberg game where an unlearner tries to remove the influence of specific training data while an auditor employs MIAs to detect forget instances. The unlearner computes gradients of the auditor's utility with respect to model weights using implicit differentiation through the auditor's optimization problem. This gradient feedback guides updates that reduce the auditor's ability to distinguish forget instances from test instances. The approach leverages differentiable optimization frameworks to enable end-to-end training of the unlearning algorithm.

## Key Results
- SG-Unlearn achieves the best performance on most metrics, including KS statistic and Wasserstein distance
- The method demonstrates a trade-off between model performance and unlearning effectiveness
- SG-Unlearn outperforms baseline methods in random forgetting scenarios but struggles with class-wise forgetting due to distributional differences

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The unlearner can proactively adjust the model to limit the auditor's success by leveraging gradient feedback from the auditor's optimization problem.
- Mechanism: The unlearner computes gradients of the auditor's utility with respect to the unlearning model's weights using implicit differentiation through the auditor's optimization problem. These gradients guide updates that reduce the auditor's ability to distinguish forget instances from test instances.
- Core assumption: The auditor's optimization problem is differentiable and has regularity conditions (e.g., convexity) that allow implicit function theorem application.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "uses implicit differentiation to obtain the gradients that limit the attacker's success"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Stackelberg game framework enables the unlearner to anticipate and counter sophisticated membership inference attacks.
- Mechanism: By modeling unlearning as a sequential game where the unlearner moves first and knows the auditor will play a best response, the unlearner can select model parameters that minimize the auditor's utility even under optimal attack strategies.
- Core assumption: The auditor will indeed launch the strongest possible MIA against the unlearned model.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "we model the unlearning problem as a Stackelberg game in which an unlearner strives to unlearn specific training data from a model, while an auditor employs MIAs"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Differentiable optimization layers enable seamless integration of unlearning into end-to-end training pipelines.
- Mechanism: The auditor's optimization problem is formulated using specialized modeling languages (e.g., cvxpy) and converted into differentiable layers using tools like cvxpylayers, allowing gradient computation through the entire Stackelberg game.
- Core assumption: The auditor's optimization problem can be expressed in a form compatible with differentiable optimization frameworks.
- Evidence anchors: [section] "we capitalize on tools from Differentiable Optimization (DO) to compute the gradients"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Stackelberg games (leader-follower games)
  - Why needed here: The framework models the sequential interaction between unlearner (leader) and auditor (follower), where the unlearner can anticipate and counter the auditor's optimal response.
  - Quick check question: In a Stackelberg game, which player moves first and has the advantage of knowing the other player's best response?

- Concept: Implicit function theorem
  - Why needed here: Enables gradient computation through the auditor's optimization problem without explicit closed-form solutions, by relating optimal parameters to problem inputs via optimality conditions.
  - Quick check question: What regularity conditions must hold for the implicit function theorem to apply to an optimization problem?

- Concept: Differentiable optimization
  - Why needed here: Allows the auditor's optimization problem to be treated as a differentiable layer in the computational graph, enabling end-to-end training of the unlearning algorithm.
  - Quick check question: What types of optimization problems can be expressed using cvxpy and converted to differentiable layers with cvxpylayers?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Unlearner module -> Auditor module -> Differentiable optimization layer -> Game solver
- Critical path:
  1. Forward pass: Compute unlearner loss on retain set
  2. Construct auditing dataset from forget and test instances
  3. Auditor optimization: Solve SVM classification on auditing data
  4. Backward pass: Compute gradients through differentiable optimization layer
  5. Update unlearning model parameters using combined gradients
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Auditor strength vs computational cost: Stronger auditors (e.g., neural networks) provide better evaluation but increase optimization complexity
  - Trade-off parameter α: Controls balance between model utility and unlearning effectiveness
  - Optimization frequency: How often to solve the Stackelberg game vs standard training
- Failure signatures:
  - Unlearning ineffective: High MIA accuracy, large Wasserstein distance between forget and test instance losses
  - Model utility loss: Significant drop in test accuracy on non-forget instances
  - Computational bottleneck: Long runtime due to matrix inversions in gradient computation
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify gradient computation: Compare gradients from implicit differentiation vs finite differences on a small synthetic dataset
  2. Test Stackelberg equilibrium: Run game with known optimal auditor strategy and verify unlearner converges to optimal counter-strategy
  3. Evaluate integration: Run end-to-end pipeline on CIFAR-10 with random forgetting, measuring MIA accuracy and test accuracy across epochs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of SG-Unlearn scale with larger and more complex datasets, such as ImageNet?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper only evaluates the method on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets, which are relatively small compared to large-scale datasets commonly used in deep learning.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any experimental results or analysis on larger datasets, leaving the scalability of the method unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments on larger datasets like ImageNet and comparing the performance of SG-Unlearn with other unlearning methods would provide insights into the scalability of the approach.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the choice of the trade-off parameter α in the unlearner's cost function affect the balance between model utility and unlearning effectiveness?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the parameter α balances the loss L and the auditor's utility M in the unlearner's cost function, but does not provide a systematic study on the impact of different α values.
- Why unresolved: The paper only presents results for a single value of α (α = 1) and does not explore the sensitivity of the method to this parameter.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting a thorough analysis of the method's performance across a range of α values and identifying the optimal setting for different datasets and unlearning scenarios would help understand the impact of this parameter.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of SG-Unlearn compare to other unlearning methods that use different attack models, such as neural network-based attacks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the framework can incorporate various attack models, including neural network-based attacks, but only evaluates the method using a linear SVM-based attack.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any comparative analysis of the method's performance using different attack models, leaving the impact of the attack model choice on the unlearning effectiveness unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments using different attack models, such as neural network-based attacks, and comparing the performance of SG-Unlearn with other unlearning methods that use the same attack models would help assess the impact of the attack model choice on the unlearning effectiveness.

## Limitations
- The approach shows degraded performance on class-wise forgetting scenarios where distributional differences between forget and test instances create challenges
- Computational complexity remains high due to matrix inversions in gradient computation
- The auditor model (linear SVM) may be weaker than real-world adversaries

## Confidence
- Theoretical framework: High - well-grounded in established game theory concepts
- Empirical validation: Medium - shows clear improvements over baseline methods
- Ablation studies: Low - limited analysis on key design choices (α parameter, auditor strength)
- Comparison to state-of-the-art: Low - only compares against basic baselines

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies on the trade-off parameter α to understand its impact on the utility-unlearning tradeoff
2. Test the framework with stronger auditor models (e.g., neural networks) to evaluate robustness against sophisticated attacks
3. Perform runtime analysis comparing SG-Unlearn against retraining baselines across different dataset sizes
