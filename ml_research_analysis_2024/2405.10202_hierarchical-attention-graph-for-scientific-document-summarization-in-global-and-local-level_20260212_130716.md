- This paper addresses the challenge of extractive summarization for long scientific documents, which requires modeling both local intra-sentence relations and global inter-sentence relations.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces HAESum, a hierarchical attention graph framework for extractive summarization of long scientific documents. The method addresses the challenge of simultaneously modeling both local intra-sentence relations and global inter-sentence relations, which existing approaches struggle to capture effectively. HAESum uses a two-stage approach: first constructing a heterogeneous graph to model word-sentence relationships at the local level, then applying a novel hypergraph self-attention layer to capture high-order inter-sentence relations at the global level. Experimental results on Arxiv and PubMed datasets demonstrate that HAESum outperforms state-of-the-art baselines including graph-based, neural extractive, neural abstractive, and large language model approaches.

## Method Summary
HAESum employs a hierarchical approach to extractive summarization. The method first constructs a local heterogeneous graph where word nodes are connected to their containing sentence nodes, with edge weights based on word importance. Sentence representations are initialized using CNN and BiLSTM layers applied to word embeddings (GloVe). A heterogeneous graph attention layer updates these representations by aggregating information from connected nodes. Next, a hypergraph is constructed where hyperedges connect sentences within the same document section, capturing higher-order relationships beyond pairwise connections. A hypergraph self-attention layer processes these structures to learn sentence representations that incorporate both local and global information. Finally, an MLP with LayerNorm produces sentence scores, and the model is trained using binary cross-entropy loss on ground truth extractive summaries.

## Key Results
- HAESum achieves state-of-the-art performance on Arxiv and PubMed datasets, outperforming strong baselines
- The hierarchical approach significantly improves ROUGE scores compared to methods that model only local or global relations
- Ablation studies confirm that both the heterogeneous graph component and hypergraph self-attention layer are essential for optimal performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The hierarchical graph structure enables effective modeling of both intra-sentence and inter-sentence relations in long scientific documents.
- Mechanism: The method first constructs a local heterogeneous graph to model word-sentence relationships (intra-sentence relations), then applies a hypergraph self-attention layer to capture high-order inter-sentence relations. This two-stage approach allows for bottom-up learning of semantic representations.
- Core assumption: Scientific documents have a natural hierarchical discourse structure where understanding words is necessary to understand sentences, and understanding sentences is necessary to understand sections.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The long input hinders the simultaneous effective modeling of both global high-order relations between sentences and local intra-sentence relations which is the most critical step in extractive summarization."
  - [section] "Sentences are composed of words and, in turn, contribute to forming sections. By understanding the meaning of individual tokens, we get the meaning of the sentence and thus the content of the section."
  - [corpus] Found 25 related papers. Weak evidence for this specific hierarchical approach.
- Break condition: If the document structure is not hierarchical or if local and global relations cannot be effectively separated into distinct modeling stages.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The hypergraph self-attention layer captures high-order inter-sentence relations more effectively than pairwise approaches.
- Mechanism: Instead of modeling only pairwise sentence relationships, the hypergraph self-attention layer uses hyperedges to connect multiple sentences that belong to the same section, capturing higher-order relationships. The self-attention mechanism allows for weighted aggregation of information from all connected nodes.
- Core assumption: Sentences within the same section often express the same main idea, and understanding these multi-way relationships is crucial for document comprehension.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "a novel hypergraph self-attention layer is introduced to further enhance the characterization of high-order inter-sentence relations"
  - [section] "Inter-sentence connections may not only be pairwise but could also involve triplets or higher-order relations (Ding et al., 2020)."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no specific papers on hypergraph self-attention for summarization found.
- Break condition: If the document sections are not meaningful units for summarization or if the computational cost of hypergraph operations becomes prohibitive.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Separating the learning of local and global relations through different graph structures prevents information loss and improves representation quality.
- Mechanism: The approach uses a heterogeneous graph for local word-sentence relationships and a hypergraph for global sentence relationships, rather than updating all relationships simultaneously. This separation allows each level to focus on its specific type of relation.
- Core assumption: Simultaneous updating of different types of relations in a single graph structure leads to information loss and insufficient learning of semantic representations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "However, existing methods mostly focus on one type of relation, neglecting the simultaneous effective modeling of both relations, which can lead to insufficient learning of semantic representations."
  - [section] "These approaches rely on updating relations at different levels simultaneously but ignore the hierarchical structure of scientific documents."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct support for this specific separation strategy.
- Break condition: If the computational overhead of maintaining two separate graph structures outweighs the benefits, or if the information flow between local and global representations becomes bottlenecked.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and message passing
  - Why needed here: The method relies on GNNs to update node representations through message passing in both the heterogeneous graph and hypergraph structures.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how node representations are updated in a graph neural network using message passing?

- Concept: Attention mechanisms and self-attention
  - Why needed here: The heterogeneous graph attention layer and hypergraph self-attention layer both use attention mechanisms to weight the importance of neighboring nodes/hyperedges when updating representations.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between standard attention and self-attention in the context of graph neural networks?

- Concept: Hierarchical discourse structure in scientific documents
  - Why needed here: The method exploits the natural hierarchical structure of scientific documents (words → sentences → sections) to guide the modeling approach.
  - Quick check question: How does the hierarchical structure of scientific documents differ from that of news articles, and why does this matter for summarization?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input: Document with sentences and words
  - Local Encoder: Heterogeneous graph with attention layers
  - Global Encoder: Hypergraph self-attention layers
  - Output: Sentence scores for extractive summarization
  - Key modules: Graph construction, heterogeneous attention, hypergraph self-attention, prediction layer

- Critical path:
  1. Document → Word/sentence tokenization
  2. Word embeddings (GloVe) + sentence features (CNN + BiLSTM)
  3. Heterogeneous graph construction and message passing
  4. Hypergraph construction and self-attention processing
  5. MLP + LayerNorm for final scoring
  6. Binary cross-entropy loss optimization

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Heterogeneous graph vs. homogeneous graph: Heterogeneous allows modeling word-sentence relationships but adds complexity
  - Hypergraph vs. pairwise graph: Hypergraph captures higher-order relations but is computationally more expensive
  - Separate vs. joint modeling: Separate modeling (local then global) prevents information loss but requires more computation
  - Pre-trained vs. learned encoders: Using CNN/BiLSTM instead of BERT reduces dependency on large models but may lose some semantic richness

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on short documents (hypergraph overhead not justified)
  - Degradation when section boundaries are unclear or absent
  - Overfitting on small datasets due to complex architecture
  - High computational cost making training impractical

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation study: Remove hypergraph component to measure impact of high-order relations
  2. Ablation study: Remove heterogeneous graph component to measure impact of local relations
  3. Hyperparameter sensitivity: Vary maximum sentence length and number of sentences to find optimal input size

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would incorporating additional hierarchical discourse structures at different granularities (e.g., sentence-section information or dependency parsing trees) impact the performance of HAESum?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors acknowledge this as a limitation in their conclusion, stating "We believe that incorporating other hierarchical discourse structures at different granularities... could further enhance model performance."
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses solely on intra-sentence and inter-sentence relations, leaving the impact of other hierarchical structures unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments applying HAESum with additional hierarchical structures (e.g., sentence-section information or dependency parsing trees) against the current HAESum model, measuring performance differences on scientific document summarization tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the specific mechanisms by which the hypergraph self-attention layer (HGSAT) improves upon the hypergraph attention network (HGAT) in capturing high-order inter-sentence relations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state "we use the self-attention mechanism to fully explore the relations between nodes and hyperedges" and show HGSAT outperforms HGAT in experiments.
- Why unresolved: While the authors demonstrate superior performance, they don't provide a detailed analysis of the specific improvements in relation capture.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies comparing different components of HGSAT (e.g., self-attention mechanism vs. different weight matrices) and qualitative analysis of the attention patterns to illustrate how high-order relations are better captured.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of HAESum scale with extremely long documents (e.g., exceeding 1000 sentences) compared to other state-of-the-art methods?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions "simultaneously increasing this hyperparameter leads to significant computational consumption" when discussing the maximum number of sentences per document.
- Why unresolved: The authors only test up to 200 sentences per document, leaving the model's behavior on extremely long documents unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance benchmarking of HAESum on datasets with documents containing 1000+ sentences, comparing against other state-of-the-art methods in terms of summarization quality and computational efficiency.

## Limitations
- The hypergraph self-attention layer lacks direct comparison to simpler alternatives like multi-head attention on pairwise graphs
- Reliance on document section boundaries assumes well-structured documents, which may not generalize to less formal scientific writing
- Computational complexity of the hierarchical approach is not fully characterized, raising concerns about scalability to very long documents

## Confidence
- High confidence in the core observation that modeling both local and global relations improves scientific document summarization performance
- Medium confidence in the specific hierarchical architecture design and its superiority over alternatives
- Low confidence in the claim that hypergraph self-attention is necessary rather than sufficient for capturing high-order relations

## Next Checks
1. Implement a baseline using standard pairwise graph attention without hypergraph structure and compare performance to isolate the contribution of high-order relations versus other architectural choices
2. Test the model on scientific documents with varying levels of structural organization (well-structured vs. less structured) to assess generalization beyond clean section boundaries
3. Measure training/inference time and memory usage to quantify the computational overhead of the hierarchical approach compared to simpler graph-based methods
