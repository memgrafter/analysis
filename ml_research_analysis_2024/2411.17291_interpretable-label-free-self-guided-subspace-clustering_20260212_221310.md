# Interpretable label-free self-guided subspace clustering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.17291
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17291
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: LFSG SC achieves clustering performance within 5-7% of oracle versions using pseudo-labels for hyperparameter optimization

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a label-free self-guided subspace clustering (LFSG SC) method that enables hyperparameter optimization for subspace clustering algorithms without requiring labeled data. The method generates pseudo-labels from the SC algorithm itself and uses these to compute clustering quality metrics (ACC/NMI) for HPO. By iteratively refining hyperparameter intervals based on smoothness assumptions, LFSG SC typically achieves clustering performance within 5-7% of oracle versions, making it suitable for domains where labeled data is unavailable.

## Method Summary
LFSG SC operates by generating pseudo-labels through subspace clustering algorithms and computing ACC/NMI between neighboring partitions to identify optimal hyperparameter intervals. The method iteratively refines these intervals by splitting them into halves or thirds until a relative error criterion (ε = 0.001) is met. For single-parameter algorithms, it searches over a predefined grid [λ₁:λ₂:λM], while for two-parameter algorithms it optimizes one parameter while fixing the other. The approach also provides interpretability through visualization of subspace bases estimated from clustering partitions, allowing domain experts to guide search space refinement when needed.

## Key Results
- LFSG SC achieves clustering accuracy within 5-7% of oracle versions across six datasets (MNIST, USPS, EYaleB, ORL, COIL20, COIL100)
- The method works with various SC algorithms including LSR, kernel LSR, graph-filtering LSR, SSC, LRSSC, LMVSC, and MLME
- Out-of-sample extension is implemented using point-to-subspace distance criterion for kernel-based algorithms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The algorithm uses pseudo-labels generated by the SC algorithm itself to compute clustering quality metrics (ACC/NMI) for hyperparameter optimization without requiring external labels.
- Mechanism: The algorithm iteratively refines hyperparameter intervals based on smoothness assumptions until a relative error criterion is met. For each candidate hyperparameter value, it generates pseudo-labels from the SC algorithm and computes ACC or NMI between neighboring pseudo-label sets.
- Core assumption: ACC and NMI are smooth functions of hyperparameter values, allowing the selection of subintervals where these metrics are maximized.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "LFSG SC uses pseudo-labels generated by the SC algorithm itself to compute clustering quality metrics (ACC/NMI) for HPO"
  - [section 3.1] "Assuming that ACC (or NMI) is a smooth function of hyperparameter values it is possible to select subintervals of hyperparameters"
- Break condition: The smoothness assumption fails when ACC/NMI exhibits oscillatory behavior with respect to hyperparameter values, causing the algorithm to converge to suboptimal hyperparameter regions.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The method enables label-free hyperparameter optimization for existing subspace clustering algorithms by iteratively refining hyperparameter search intervals.
- Mechanism: Starting with a predefined hyperparameter grid, the algorithm identifies subintervals where performance metrics are maximal, then recursively splits these intervals (halves or thirds) until the relative error between consecutive hyperparameter values falls below a threshold.
- Core assumption: The performance metric (ACC/NMI) reaches its maximum within identifiable subintervals that can be progressively refined.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "These subintervals are then iteratively further split into halves or thirds until a relative error criterion is satisfied"
  - [section 3.1] "The subinterval (1)(1)14,,ttλλ++ is refined according to the following rules"
- Break condition: If neighboring hyperparameter values produce pseudo-labels with high similarity but poor actual clustering performance (as shown in Figure 2), the algorithm may converge to incorrect hyperparameter values.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The approach provides interpretability by visualizing subspace bases estimated from clustering partitions, enabling domain experts to guide hyperparameter search refinement.
- Mechanism: After obtaining clustering partitions, the algorithm estimates subspace bases through SVD decomposition and visualizes cluster representatives, allowing experts to assess partition quality and adjust the hyperparameter search space if needed.
- Core assumption: Visual inspection of subspace bases can reveal whether clustering partitions are meaningful and guide search space refinement.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We also make our proposed method interpretable by visualizing subspace bases, which are estimated from the computed clustering partitions"
  - [section 3.5] "We propose a method to interpret clustering results from SC algorithms through the visualization of subspace bases estimated from the obtained clustering partitions"
- Break condition: If the visualization quality is inadequate or the relationship between visual patterns and clustering quality is unclear, experts cannot effectively guide search space refinement.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Subspace clustering and self-expressive models
  - Why needed here: The algorithm relies on subspace clustering algorithms that assume data points lie in a union of linear subspaces and can be represented as linear combinations of other data points
  - Quick check question: What is the fundamental assumption behind subspace clustering algorithms that enables them to generate pseudo-labels for self-guided optimization?

- Concept: Spectral clustering and graph Laplacians
  - Why needed here: The method uses spectral clustering on normalized graph Laplacians derived from data affinity matrices to assign final cluster labels
  - Quick check question: How does the normalized graph Laplacian matrix relate to the data affinity matrix in spectral clustering?

- Concept: Hyperparameter optimization in unsupervised learning
  - Why needed here: The algorithm must optimize hyperparameters without external labels, requiring alternative quality metrics and search strategies
  - Quick check question: What are the key challenges in hyperparameter optimization when no labeled validation data is available?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: SC algorithm wrapper -> Pseudo-label generator -> Performance metric calculator (ACC/NMI) -> Interval refinement controller -> Visualization module
- Critical path: Hyperparameter grid generation -> Pseudo-label generation -> Performance metric computation -> Interval refinement -> Convergence check -> Optimal hyperparameter output
- Design tradeoffs: Dense hyperparameter grids provide better coverage but increase computational cost; less dense grids reduce computation but may miss optimal values if the smoothness assumption doesn't hold
- Failure signatures: Oscillatory performance metrics across hyperparameter values, convergence to suboptimal hyperparameters despite good pseudo-label similarity, or visualization indicating poor partition quality
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement LSR SC with pseudo-label generation on MNIST, verify ACC/NMI smoothness across λ values
  2. Add interval refinement logic and test convergence on ORL dataset with varying ε thresholds
  3. Implement visualization of subspace bases for a simple case (e.g., COIL20) and validate expert-guided search space refinement

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of LFSG SC compare to other label-free hyperparameter optimization methods for subspace clustering, such as those based on internal clustering quality metrics?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions internal clustering quality metrics as an alternative approach to label-independent HPO, but does not directly compare LFSG SC to these methods.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on demonstrating the effectiveness of LFSG SC compared to oracle versions of various SC algorithms, but does not benchmark against other label-free methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical comparisons of LFSG SC and other label-free methods on the same datasets and SC algorithms, using metrics like clustering accuracy and NMI.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the choice of the initial hyperparameter search space affect the performance and convergence of LFSG SC?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the method critically depends on the quality of the initial assessment of the hyperparameter search space and suggests visualizing clustering partitions to refine the search space if needed.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a systematic study of how different initial search spaces impact the method's performance or convergence speed.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments varying the size and density of the initial search space, measuring the impact on final clustering performance and the number of iterations required for convergence.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the smoothness assumption of ACC and NMI as functions of hyperparameters be formally justified or relaxed for certain types of SC algorithms or datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper assumes that ACC and NMI are smooth functions of hyperparameters to enable the iterative refinement of the search space, but does not provide a formal justification or discuss potential violations of this assumption.
- Why unresolved: The smoothness assumption is crucial for the method's effectiveness, but its validity may depend on the specific SC algorithm and dataset characteristics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical analysis or empirical studies investigating the smoothness of ACC and NMI for various SC algorithms and datasets, potentially identifying cases where the assumption may not hold.

## Limitations

- The smoothness assumption for ACC/NMI metrics may fail in practice, particularly for complex clustering landscapes
- The method's effectiveness depends heavily on the quality of pseudo-labels generated by the underlying SC algorithm
- Visualization-based interpretability requires domain expertise to be meaningful and may not scale well to high-dimensional data

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The iterative interval refinement approach is well-defined and the pseudo-label generation mechanism is clearly specified. The mathematical framework for computing ACC/NMI between neighboring partitions is explicit.
- **Medium confidence**: The smoothness assumption for performance metrics is theoretically sound but may not hold universally across all datasets and algorithms. The convergence behavior with respect to the relative error threshold needs empirical validation.
- **Low confidence**: The effectiveness of visualization-based interpretability for guiding hyperparameter search refinement is not extensively validated. The method's performance on datasets significantly different from the six tested datasets is unknown.

## Next Checks

1. Test the smoothness assumption empirically by computing ACC/NMI across dense hyperparameter grids for all six datasets and visualizing metric landscapes to identify oscillatory patterns.
2. Implement a quantitative evaluation of the visualization-based interpretability component by having domain experts assess partition quality and measure correlation between visual insights and actual clustering performance.
3. Evaluate the method's robustness to different relative error thresholds (ε values) and interval refinement strategies (halves vs thirds) across multiple runs to assess stability of the selected hyperparameters.
