# Development of Pre-Trained Transformer-based Models for the Nepali Language

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.15734
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15734
- Reference count: 13
- Primary result: Transformer-based models for Nepali language developed with 27.5 GB corpus

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the development of transformer-based language models specifically for the Nepali language, addressing the critical scarcity of monolingual resources for this low-resource language. The authors collected what they claim is the largest Nepali text corpus (27.5 GB) by scraping 99 news websites and trained three different transformer architectures - BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2 - using Byte-Pair Encoding tokenization. Notably, they conducted instruction tuning experiments for the first time in Nepali NLP, demonstrating significant improvements in both understanding and generation tasks.

The resulting models achieved state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, with RoBERTa reaching 95.60 on the Nep-gLUE benchmark, outperforming previous models by 2 percentage points. The GPT-2 variants showed particularly strong performance in text generation tasks, achieving ROUGE scores of up to 20.42 (ROUGE-1), 15.89 (ROUGE-2), and 17.76 (ROUGE-L) in abstractive summarization. These models provide a foundation for future research in Nepali language processing and demonstrate the potential of large-scale pretraining even for low-resource languages.

## Method Summary
The authors developed transformer-based language models for Nepali through a systematic approach. They began by collecting a large monolingual corpus through web scraping of 99 Nepali news websites, resulting in 27.5 GB of text data. The corpus was preprocessed and tokenized using Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), which is particularly effective for morphologically rich languages like Nepali. Three transformer architectures were then trained: BERT for bidirectional understanding, RoBERTa as an optimized BERT variant, and GPT-2 for autoregressive generation. Additionally, the researchers conducted instruction tuning experiments, marking the first application of this technique to Nepali NLP. The models were evaluated on standard benchmarks including Nep-gLUE and text generation tasks using ROUGE scores.

## Key Results
- RoBERTa achieved 95.60 on Nep-gLUE benchmark, outperforming previous models by 2 points
- GPT-2 variants achieved ROUGE-1: 20.42, ROUGE-2: 15.89, ROUGE-L: 17.76 in abstractive summarization
- Models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple Nepali language tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of these transformer-based models for Nepali stems from their ability to capture complex linguistic patterns through self-supervised pretraining on large-scale monolingual data. The Byte-Pair Encoding tokenization effectively handles Nepali's morphological complexity by breaking words into subword units, allowing the models to generalize better to unseen words. The pretraining process enables the models to learn rich contextual representations that transfer well to downstream tasks. Instruction tuning further enhances this capability by teaching the models to follow natural language instructions, making them more versatile for practical applications.

## Foundational Learning

Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE): A subword tokenization algorithm that iteratively merges frequent character pairs
- Why needed: Handles out-of-vocabulary words and morphological complexity in Nepali
- Quick check: Verify vocabulary size and coverage on held-out Nepali text

Transformer architecture: Neural network architecture using self-attention mechanisms
- Why needed: Captures long-range dependencies and bidirectional context in language
- Quick check: Confirm attention patterns on Nepali sentence pairs

Instruction tuning: Fine-tuning models on instruction-response pairs
- Why needed: Enables models to follow natural language instructions for task execution
- Quick check: Test model responses to simple Nepali instructions

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Data collection -> Preprocessing & BPE tokenization -> Model pretraining -> Instruction tuning -> Evaluation
Critical path: The most critical path is the quality and representativeness of the training corpus, as all downstream performance depends on it. The BPE tokenization quality is also crucial for handling Nepali morphology effectively.

Design tradeoffs: The choice between BERT (bidirectional) and GPT-2 (autoregressive) architectures reflects a tradeoff between understanding and generation capabilities. RoBERTa represents an optimization of BERT that removes the next sentence prediction task and uses dynamic masking, which proved beneficial for Nepali.

Failure signatures: Poor performance on morphologically complex words, inability to handle code-switching between Nepali and English, or degradation on domains outside news (social media, literature).

First experiments:
1. Evaluate vocabulary coverage of BPE tokenization on diverse Nepali text samples
2. Test model performance on morphologically complex Nepali words
3. Assess cross-domain generalization by testing on non-news Nepali text

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper highlights several open questions regarding the generalization of these models to domains beyond news text, the optimal size and diversity of training corpora for low-resource languages, and the effectiveness of instruction tuning for morphologically rich languages.

## Limitations
- The 27.5 GB corpus was scraped exclusively from news websites, potentially introducing topical and stylistic bias
- The claim of being the "largest" corpus lacks explicit comparison metrics or verification
- Evaluation primarily relies on benchmark tests rather than diverse real-world application testing

## Confidence
- High confidence: Technical implementation of transformer models and Nep-gLUE benchmark results (95.60 for RoBERTa, specific ROUGE scores for GPT-2)
- Medium confidence: Dataset representativeness and generalizability across Nepali language use cases
- Low confidence: Claimed novelty of instruction tuning without methodological transparency and comparative analysis

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a comprehensive linguistic analysis of the scraped corpus to quantify topical distribution and identify potential biases compared to other Nepali text sources
2. Perform ablation studies comparing instruction-tuned models with base models on the same tasks to isolate the contribution of instruction tuning
3. Evaluate the models across multiple Nepali text domains (social media, literature, formal documents) to assess generalization beyond the news domain
