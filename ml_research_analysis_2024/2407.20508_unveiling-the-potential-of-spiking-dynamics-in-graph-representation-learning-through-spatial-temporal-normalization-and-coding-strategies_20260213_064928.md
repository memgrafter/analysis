# Unveiling the Potential of Spiking Dynamics in Graph Representation Learning through Spatial-Temporal Normalization and Coding Strategies

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.20508
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20508
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Graph SNNs achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art GNNs on semi-supervised node classification tasks while significantly reducing computational costs and alleviating oversmoothing.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a spiking neural network framework for graph representation learning that combines spiking dynamics with graph convolution operations. The authors address the challenge of applying SNNs to non-Euclidean graph data by proposing a novel spatial-temporal feature normalization (STFN) technique to improve training efficiency and model stability. Their framework supports both rate coding and temporal coding strategies, instantiated in GC-SNN and GA-SNN models. Experimental results show competitive performance with state-of-the-art GNNs on semi-supervised node classification tasks while significantly reducing computational costs. The proposed method also demonstrates effectiveness in alleviating the oversmoothing problem in deeper network structures and provides advantages for neuromorphic hardware deployment.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a graph SNN framework that integrates spiking dynamics with graph convolution operations through an iterative spiking message passing approach. The framework includes a novel spatial-temporal feature normalization (STFN) algorithm that normalizes membrane potentials across both spatial and temporal dimensions independently for each node. Two model variants are introduced: GC-SNN using graph convolution and GA-SNN using graph attention mechanisms. The framework supports both rate coding and rank order coding strategies, enabling tradeoffs between accuracy and computational efficiency. Training is performed using gradient descent with a cross-entropy loss function and a gradient substitution method.

## Key Results
- Graph SNNs achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art GNNs on Cora, Pubmed, and Citeseer datasets for semi-supervised node classification
- The STFN technique significantly improves convergence and stability during training of graph SNNs
- Rate coding achieves higher accuracy while rank order coding provides faster inference with slightly lower accuracy
- The framework effectively alleviates the oversmoothing problem in deeper network structures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Spatial-temporal feature normalization (STFN) addresses the lack of effective normalization techniques for spiking dynamics in graph scenarios.
- Mechanism: STFN normalizes membrane potentials across both spatial (node feature) and temporal dimensions independently for each node, aligning distributions with threshold levels.
- Core assumption: Membrane potential distributions vary significantly across nodes and time steps in graph SNNs, hindering convergence.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We introduce the spatial-temporal feature normalization (STFN) algorithm, which accounts for temporal neuronal dynamics and aligns membrane potential representations with threshold levels, significantly improving convergence and performance."
  - [section 3.3] "This method normalizes the instantaneous membrane potentials across both feature and temporal dimensions for each node, thereby enhancing the SNN's ability to extract latent features from aggregated signals within a graph."
- Break Condition: If node distributions do not require normalization or if normalization disrupts spike timing accuracy.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The iterative spiking message passing framework enables integration of graph convolution operations with spiking dynamics.
- Mechanism: By unfolding binary node features across temporal and spatial dimensions and iteratively applying graph filters with spiking dynamics, the framework reconciles graph convolution with spike communication.
- Core assumption: Graph convolution operations can be adapted to work within the temporal dynamics of spiking neurons through iterative message passing.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "This approach allows for the effective merging of graph convolution operations and spiking dynamics, leveraging the unique properties of SNNs for processing complex, structured information."
- Break Condition: If the iterative process fails to converge or if graph information is lost during temporal unfolding.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Different coding strategies (rate vs. rank order) offer tradeoffs between accuracy and computational efficiency.
- Mechanism: Rate coding uses spike frequency over time windows for information encoding, while rank order coding uses the sequence of first spikes, enabling faster inference at potential accuracy cost.
- Core assumption: Temporal encoding schemes can be effectively integrated into the graph learning framework without breaking its core functionality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.5] "Rank Order Coding assumes that biological neurons encode information based on the order of firing within a neuron ensemble."
  - [section 4.4] "For graph learning tasks, ROC achieves slightly lower accuracy than RC, but with significantly reduced inference time steps compared to RC."
- Break Condition: If temporal encoding significantly degrades graph representation quality or if the framework cannot support multiple coding schemes.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron model
  - Why needed here: Provides the fundamental spiking dynamics for the SNN framework, modeling how membrane potentials accumulate and generate spikes.
  - Quick check question: How does the LIF model handle membrane potential decay and spike generation thresholds?

- Concept: Graph convolution operations (spectral and spatial)
  - Why needed here: Enables the framework to aggregate information from neighboring nodes in graph-structured data.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between spectral and spatial graph convolution approaches?

- Concept: Normalization techniques (batch, layer, group normalization)
  - Why needed here: Provides the theoretical foundation for STFN, though adapted for spiking dynamics and graph data.
  - Quick check question: How do traditional normalization methods differ from STFN in handling temporal and spatial dimensions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input layer -> Binary spike encoding of node features -> Spiking message passing layers (graph convolution/attention) -> STFN modules -> Output layer (readout function)

- Critical path:
  1. Encode node features as binary spikes
  2. Iteratively propagate and update spiking features through graph convolution
  3. Apply STFN normalization at each layer
  4. Decode final spiking outputs for task prediction
  5. Train using gradient substitution and cross-entropy loss

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Time window length vs. accuracy: Longer windows improve accuracy but increase computational cost
  - Coding strategy: Rate coding offers higher accuracy, rank order coding enables faster inference
  - STFN parameters: Balancing normalization strength against preserving spiking dynamics

- Failure signatures:
  - Vanishing gradients in deep networks (mitigated by residual connections and STFN)
  - Oversmoothing of node representations (addressed by spiking dynamics and STFN)
  - Poor convergence due to unnormalized membrane potentials (solved by STFN)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Reproduce baseline GCN performance on Cora dataset to establish comparison point
  2. Implement GC-SNN without STFN to measure normalization impact on convergence
  3. Compare rate coding vs. rank order coding on a small graph dataset to quantify accuracy/speed tradeoff
