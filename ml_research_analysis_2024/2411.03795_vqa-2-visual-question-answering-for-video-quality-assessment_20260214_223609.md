# VQA$^2$: Visual Question Answering for Video Quality Assessment

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2411.03795
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03795
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: VQA2 introduces the first VQA instruction dataset for video quality assessment with 157,735 instruction pairs across three stages, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both scoring and understanding tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents VQA2, the first Visual Question Answering instruction dataset specifically designed for video quality assessment. The dataset spans three stages with 157,735 instruction pairs covering various video types and quality attributes. The authors develop VQA2-Scorers and VQA2-Assistant models that leverage interleaved visual and motion tokens to enhance spatial-temporal quality perception. VQA2-Scorers achieves state-of-the-art performance in video quality scoring tasks, while VQA2-Assistant excels in video quality understanding tasks, outperforming GPT-4o on the Q-bench-video benchmark.

## Method Summary
The VQA2 approach uses LLaVA-OneVision-Chat-7B as a base model with integrated SlowFast-R50 motion extractor. The method employs a three-stage training strategy: Stage-1 focuses on distortion recognition (spatial and motion), Stage-2 on video quality scoring, and Stage-3 on video quality understanding. During training, keyframe sequences and motion feature sequences are interleaved to enhance perception of spatial-temporal quality details. The VQA2-Scorers model is trained on 86,961 video-quality pairs from KonIQ-10k, LIVE-Qualcomm, and LIVE-VQC datasets, while VQA2-Assistant is trained on 70,774 instruction pairs from multiple datasets including Waterloo, LSVQ, and KADID-10k.

## Key Results
- VQA2-Scorers achieves state-of-the-art performance on UGC-VQA and Streaming-VQA tasks with SRCC and PLCC metrics.
- VQA2-Assistant outperforms GPT-4o on the Q-bench-video benchmark for video quality understanding tasks.
- The interleaved visual and motion token approach demonstrates strong versatility across both scoring and question-answering tasks.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Interleaving visual and motion tokens enhances perception of spatial-temporal quality details in videos.
- **Mechanism**: The model processes keyframe sequences and motion feature sequences in an interleaved manner during training, allowing the model to learn both spatial and temporal quality attributes simultaneously.
- **Core assumption**: Low-level visual quality assessment requires both spatial and temporal information, and interleaving these tokens during training enables the model to better capture the relationship between them.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "The VQA2 series models interleave visual and motion tokens to enhance the perception of spatial-temporal quality details in videos."
  - [section 4.2] "During training, the keyframe sequences and motion feature sequences are input in an interleaved manner."
- **Break condition**: If the interleaving process does not significantly improve the model's performance on tasks that require temporal information (e.g., video quality understanding tasks), or if it negatively impacts the model's performance on tasks that primarily rely on spatial information.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: The VQA2 Instruction Dataset's three-stage construction improves the model's capabilities in both video quality scoring and understanding.
- **Mechanism**: The dataset is constructed in three stages: Stage-1 focuses on distortion recognition, Stage-2 on video quality scoring, and Stage-3 on video quality understanding. This staged approach allows the model to first learn basic quality attribute perception, then precise scoring, and finally nuanced quality understanding.
- **Core assumption**: A staged training approach, where the model learns progressively more complex tasks, leads to better overall performance than training on all tasks simultaneously.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "The dataset spans three stages with 157,735 instruction pairs covering various video types and quality attributes."
  - [section 3] Describes the three stages of dataset construction and their respective focuses.
- **Break condition**: If the staged training approach does not lead to better performance compared to training on all tasks simultaneously, or if the performance on one stage negatively impacts the performance on another stage.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: GPT extension of human-annotated data significantly increases the dataset size and diversity without sacrificing quality.
- **Mechanism**: Human experts annotate a subset of videos, and then GPT is used to extend these annotations into a larger number of question-answer pairs, increasing the dataset's size and diversity.
- **Core assumption**: GPT can generate high-quality question-answer pairs based on human-annotated data, and this extension process does not introduce significant noise or bias into the dataset.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "Our dataset spans three stages with 157,735 instruction pairs covering various video types and quality attributes."
  - [section 3.4] Describes the GPT extension process for the Stage-3 instruction set.
- **Break condition**: If the GPT-generated question-answer pairs are of significantly lower quality than the human-annotated pairs, or if the extension process introduces significant bias into the dataset.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and their application in video quality assessment.
  - **Why needed here**: Understanding the capabilities and limitations of LMMs is crucial for designing effective video quality assessment models.
  - **Quick check question**: What are the key differences between LMMs and traditional computer vision models, and how do these differences impact their application in video quality assessment?

- **Concept**: Video quality assessment metrics (e.g., PLCC, SRCC) and their interpretation.
  - **Why needed here**: Evaluating the performance of video quality assessment models requires understanding and interpreting these metrics.
  - **Quick check question**: What is the difference between PLCC and SRCC, and how do these metrics reflect the performance of a video quality assessment model?

- **Concept**: Visual Question Answering (VQA) and its role in video quality assessment.
  - **Why needed here**: VQA is the framework used in this paper for video quality assessment, so understanding its principles is essential.
  - **Quick check question**: How does VQA differ from traditional video quality assessment approaches, and what are the advantages and disadvantages of using VQA for video quality assessment?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: LLaVA-OneVision-Chat-7B base -> SigLIP vision tower -> SlowFast-R50 motion extractor -> fully connected layers (projectors) -> Qwen-2 LLM decoder
- **Critical path**: Vision Tower/Motion Extractor → Vision/Motion Projector → LLM Decoder
- **Design tradeoffs**: The choice of base model, vision tower, and motion extractor involves tradeoffs between model size, computational efficiency, and performance.
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Poor performance on tasks requiring temporal information: Indicates issues with the motion extractor or the interleaving of motion tokens.
  - Poor performance on tasks requiring spatial information: Indicates issues with the vision tower or the interleaving of visual tokens.
  - Overfitting: Indicates that the model is too complex for the available training data.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Evaluate the model's performance on a simple video quality scoring task without any temporal information.
  2. Evaluate the model's performance on a video quality understanding task that requires both spatial and temporal information.
  3. Compare the model's performance with and without the motion feature extraction module to assess its impact on the model's overall performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How does the performance of VQA2 models change when trained on different ratios of human-annotated versus GPT-generated data in Stage-3?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The paper mentions that Stage-3 data is expanded through GPT following human expert annotation, but does not explore the impact of different human/GPT data ratios.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper does not conduct experiments varying the proportion of human versus synthetic data in Stage-3.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Training multiple versions of the VQA2-Assistant with varying percentages of human-annotated data (e.g., 100%, 75%, 50%, 25%) in Stage-3 and comparing their performance on quality understanding tasks.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: What is the impact of using different video frame sampling rates on the performance of VQA2 models for temporal quality assessment?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper mentions that keyframe sequences are extracted at low sampling rates (1 frame per second) but does not explore how different sampling rates affect performance.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper does not conduct experiments with varying frame sampling rates to determine optimal temporal resolution for quality assessment.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Training and evaluating VQA2 models using different frame sampling rates (e.g., 1fps, 5fps, 10fps, 30fps) and measuring their performance on temporal quality understanding tasks.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: How does the interleaving of visual and motion tokens affect the model's ability to detect specific types of temporal distortions beyond just flicker and stuttering?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper states that interleaving visual and motion tokens enhances perception of spatial-temporal quality details, but only validates this for flicker and stuttering distortions.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper does not test the model's performance on other temporal distortions like motion blur, judder, or warping.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Creating a dataset with diverse temporal distortions and comparing VQA2 models with and without motion token interleaving on their ability to detect and analyze these distortions.

### Open Question 4
- **Question**: Can the VQA2-Assistant generalize to quality assessment tasks for video modalities not seen during training, such as VR videos or 360-degree videos?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The paper focuses on UGC, streaming, and AIGC videos but does not test the model on novel video formats.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper does not evaluate the model's performance on video types outside its training distribution.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Testing the VQA2-Assistant on quality assessment tasks for VR, 360-degree, or other novel video formats and comparing its performance to specialized models for these modalities.

## Limitations

- The computational cost of the three-stage training approach may limit practical adoption of the method.
- The GPT-based data augmentation raises questions about the quality and consistency of generated responses, though the human-annotated subset provides a quality anchor.
- The exact contribution of token interleaving to performance improvements is not fully disentangled from other architectural choices in the ablation studies.

## Confidence

- **High**: The VQA2 dataset construction methodology and its comprehensive coverage of video quality assessment tasks; the model's state-of-the-art performance on UGC-VQA and Streaming-VQA benchmarks; the effectiveness of VQA2-Assistant on video quality understanding tasks.
- **Medium**: The specific contribution of token interleaving to performance improvements; the generalization of results across different video domains; the long-term stability of the three-stage training approach.
- **Low**: The exact impact of GPT-generated data on model performance; the scalability of the approach to longer videos or different quality assessment contexts.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct controlled ablation studies isolating the contribution of token interleaving from other architectural components to precisely quantify its impact on spatial-temporal quality perception.
2. Evaluate model performance across additional video quality assessment benchmarks beyond the Q-bench-video dataset to test generalizability to diverse video content and quality attributes.
3. Perform human evaluation studies comparing model-generated quality scores and explanations against expert assessments to validate the practical utility and interpretability of the VQA2 models.
