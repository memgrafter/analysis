core_contribution: This study addresses the gap in understanding how multilingual
  LLMs interpret similes and idioms across different languages. By evaluating multiple
  models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o mini, Gemini 1.5, Llama 3.1, and Qwen2) on two existing
  datasets (MABL and MAPS) and two newly created Persian datasets, the research explores
  various prompt engineering strategies including chain-of-thought, few-shot, and

# Comparative Study of Multilingual Idioms and Similes in Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2410.16461
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16461
- **Reference count**: 32
- **Key outcome**: This study addresses the gap in understanding how multilingual LLMs interpret similes and idioms across different languages.

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates how large language models handle multilingual idioms and similes across different languages and prompt strategies. The research team tested multiple models including GPT-3.5, GPT-4o mini, Gemini 1.5, Llama 3.1, and Qwen2 using both existing datasets (MABL and MAPS) and newly created Persian datasets. The evaluation explored various prompt engineering approaches including chain-of-thought, few-shot, and translation-based methods. Results reveal significant performance variations across figurative types, languages, and prompting strategies, with open-source models showing competitive performance in most languages but struggling particularly with low-resource languages for similes. The study finds that idiom interpretation is nearing saturation for many languages, suggesting a need for more challenging evaluation benchmarks.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates multilingual LLMs on figurative language understanding through systematic testing of multiple models across different languages and prompt strategies. The evaluation uses two existing datasets (MABL and MAPS) along with newly created Persian datasets to test both idioms and similes. Various prompt engineering techniques are employed including chain-of-thought reasoning, few-shot learning examples, and translation-based approaches. The research compares performance across different model sizes and architectures, examining how prompt strategies affect interpretation accuracy. The study focuses on Persian as a low-resource language example while testing performance across multiple high-resource languages to establish comparative baselines.

## Key Results
- Model performance varies significantly by figurative type, language, and prompt strategy
- Open-source models perform competitively in most languages but struggle with low-resource languages for similes
- Idiom interpretation is nearing saturation for many languages, suggesting need for more challenging evaluations
- Larger models benefit less from chain-of-thought prompting
- Translation effectiveness depends on the language and task

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of multilingual LLMs in interpreting figurative language depends on their training data composition, cross-lingual transfer capabilities, and prompt engineering strategies. Models trained on diverse multilingual corpora can leverage semantic similarities across languages to interpret figurative expressions. The chain-of-thought prompting helps models reason through ambiguous expressions by breaking down interpretation into logical steps. Few-shot examples provide context for understanding culturally specific expressions, while translation-based approaches can bridge gaps when direct training data is limited. However, the success of these mechanisms varies significantly based on the resource level of the target language and the type of figurative expression being evaluated.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multilingual training data composition** - Understanding how models are trained on diverse language corpora is essential for predicting cross-lingual transfer performance. Quick check: Examine model documentation for training language distribution.
- **Figurative language types** - Idioms and similes require different interpretation mechanisms (fixed meaning vs. comparative reasoning). Quick check: Test model on both types to observe performance gaps.
- **Prompt engineering strategies** - Chain-of-thought, few-shot, and translation approaches affect model reasoning differently. Quick check: Compare performance across prompting strategies on same examples.
- **Cross-lingual transfer mechanisms** - Models leverage shared semantic structures across languages for interpretation. Quick check: Test same figurative expression across multiple languages.
- **Resource level impact** - Low-resource languages have less training data, affecting performance. Quick check: Compare high vs low resource language performance.
- **Evaluation metric selection** - Automatic metrics may not capture cultural nuances in figurative interpretation. Quick check: Compare automatic vs human evaluation scores.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Dataset preparation -> Prompt engineering -> Model inference -> Evaluation metrics -> Performance analysis

**Critical Path**: The evaluation pipeline flows from dataset selection through prompt strategy application to model inference and metric computation. The critical path involves dataset preparation, prompt engineering selection, model inference execution, and performance evaluation across different languages and figurative types.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The study balances between using established benchmarks (MABL, MAPS) and creating new Persian datasets. Using existing datasets provides comparability but may not capture all linguistic nuances. Creating new datasets allows for targeted evaluation but limits cross-study comparisons. The choice of prompt strategies represents another tradeoff between computational cost and performance gains.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation occurs when models encounter low-resource languages, particularly for similes requiring comparative reasoning. Chain-of-thought prompting shows diminishing returns for larger models. Translation-based approaches fail when source and target languages have significantly different figurative expression patterns. Models struggle with culturally specific idioms that lack direct equivalents across languages.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test the same evaluation framework on additional low-resource languages beyond Persian
2. Develop and evaluate more challenging idiom datasets with culturally nuanced expressions
3. Conduct human evaluation studies comparing LLM interpretations with native speaker judgments

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Study focuses on Persian as a low-resource language example, but broader applicability to other genuinely low-resource languages remains untested
- Evaluation relies on existing datasets (MABL and MAPS) and newly created Persian datasets, which may not fully represent diversity of figurative expressions across languages
- Does not explore potential impact of cultural context or pragmatic understanding on model performance

## Confidence

| Claim Cluster | Confidence Level |
|---|---|
| Model performance varies significantly by figurative type, language, and prompt strategy | High |
| Idiom interpretation is nearing saturation for many languages | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Test the same evaluation framework on additional low-resource languages beyond Persian to determine if observed performance gaps are consistent across different language families and resource levels
2. Develop and evaluate more challenging idiom datasets that include culturally nuanced expressions, proverbs with multiple interpretations, or idioms requiring pragmatic understanding
3. Conduct human evaluation studies comparing LLM interpretations with native speaker judgments to validate accuracy of automatic evaluation metrics used in the study
