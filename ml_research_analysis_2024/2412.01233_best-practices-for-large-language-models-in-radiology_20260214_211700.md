# Best Practices for Large Language Models in Radiology

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.01233
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01233
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Systematic review of best practices for integrating LLMs into radiology workflows

## Executive Summary
Large language models are transforming radiology by automating report generation, summarization, and quality assurance. This review outlines best practices for integrating LLMs into radiology workflows, emphasizing their potential to process complex imaging data and clinical information. The authors present a comprehensive framework for optimizing LLM performance through prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and fine-tuning with domain-specific data. Key challenges such as hallucinations, data security, and reproducibility are addressed, with recommendations for iterative optimization and interdisciplinary collaboration.

## Method Summary
The review synthesizes current literature and expert consensus on LLM integration in radiology, identifying three main optimization strategies: prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation, and fine-tuning. The authors emphasize starting with prompt refinement and RAG before considering fine-tuning, while addressing challenges around data privacy, bias, and model evaluation. Recommendations include using locally deployed open models for privacy, collaborating across disciplines, and implementing rigorous validation frameworks.

## Key Results
- LLMs can significantly improve radiology workflows through automated report generation and quality assurance
- Retrieval-augmented generation substantially enhances factual correctness compared to native prompting
- Iterative optimization starting with prompt engineering provides the most practical path to effective LLM deployment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs improve radiology workflows by processing complex imaging data and clinical information to produce actionable insights.
- Mechanism: LLMs leverage transformer architectures with attention mechanisms to dynamically weight relationships between input elements, enabling them to integrate multimodal data (text, images) and generate contextually relevant outputs.
- Core assumption: The attention mechanism effectively captures long-range dependencies in radiology data, allowing LLMs to synthesize imaging findings with clinical context.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "LLMs offers an opportunity to improve the management and interpretation of the vast data in radiology."
  - [section]: "The attention mechanism is particularly notable as it allows the model to dynamically weight the importance of different input parts based on their relevance in the context."
  - [corpus]: Found 25 related papers (using 8). Average neighbor FMR=0.43, average citations=0.0. Top related titles include "Deep Learning for Accelerated and Robust MRI Reconstruction: a Review."
- Break condition: If attention mechanisms fail to capture critical relationships in multimodal radiology data, leading to confabulations or irrelevant outputs.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances LLM outputs by incorporating external, curated information.
- Mechanism: RAG pairs the LLM with a retrieval module that sources information from databases or curated sites, matching content to queries by similarity. This reduces confabulations and improves factual correctness.
- Core assumption: External information sources are reliable, up-to-date, and relevant to the radiology query.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and fine-tuning with domain-specific data."
  - [section]: "Using RAG with curated, high-quality sources considerably boosts the factual correctness and quality of LLM outputs over natively prompting the LLM."
  - [corpus]: Found 25 related papers (using 8). Average neighbor FMR=0.43, average citations=0.0. Top related titles include "PARROT: An Open Multilingual Radiology Reports Dataset."
- Break condition: If retrieved information is outdated, irrelevant, or of poor quality, leading to incorrect or misleading LLM outputs.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Fine-tuning LLMs on radiology-specific data improves their performance on domain-specific tasks.
- Mechanism: Fine-tuning adjusts the LLM's parameters using radiology reports, images, and clinical data, enabling it to better understand domain-specific terminology and tasks.
- Core assumption: Domain-specific fine-tuning data is representative, high-quality, and sufficiently diverse to capture the nuances of radiology.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Fine-tuning with domain-specific data."
  - [section]: "Fine-tuning the model with task-specific data is the most resource-intensive optimization step, as the model is permanently modified towards more specialized radiological applications, requiring additional training data."
  - [corpus]: Found 25 related papers (using 8). Average neighbor FMR=0.43, average citations=0.0. Top related titles include "MGH Radiology Llama: A Llama 3 70B Model for Radiology."
- Break condition: If fine-tuning data is biased, incomplete, or not representative of real-world radiology scenarios, leading to poor generalization or harmful outputs.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Transformer architecture
  - Why needed here: Understanding how transformers process and generate text is crucial for effectively using and adapting LLMs in radiology.
  - Quick check question: What are the three essential components of a transformer, and how do they contribute to its ability to process language?

- Concept: Attention mechanism
  - Why needed here: The attention mechanism allows LLMs to weigh the importance of different input parts, which is critical for integrating imaging findings with clinical context.
  - Quick check question: How does the attention mechanism enable LLMs to capture long-range dependencies in radiology data?

- Concept: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
  - Why needed here: RAG enhances LLM outputs by incorporating external information, reducing confabulations and improving factual correctness in radiology applications.
  - Quick check question: What are the key steps in the RAG process, and how does it improve the quality of LLM outputs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - LLM backbone (e.g., transformer-based model) -> Attention mechanism for weighting input relationships -> Retrieval module for external information sourcing -> Fine-tuning pipeline for domain-specific adaptation -> Evaluation framework for assessing outputs

- Critical path:
  1. Choose appropriate LLM architecture and size
  2. Curate and prepare domain-specific fine-tuning data
  3. Implement RAG for external information incorporation
  4. Fine-tune the LLM on radiology-specific tasks
  5. Evaluate outputs using both automated metrics and human expert assessment

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model size vs. computational resources and inference latency
  - General-purpose vs. domain-specific performance
  - Open vs. closed models (control vs. performance)
  - Local vs. cloud deployment (privacy vs. scalability)

- Failure signatures:
  - Confabulations or incorrect outputs due to insufficient attention to critical relationships
  - Poor generalization due to biased or incomplete fine-tuning data
  - Low factual correctness due to unreliable external information sources
  - High computational costs or slow inference due to model size or inefficient architecture

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Prompt engineering with general-purpose LLM to assess baseline performance on radiology tasks
  2. Implement RAG with curated guidelines and evaluate impact on factual correctness
  3. Fine-tune LLM on radiology report data and compare performance to prompt-only approach

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different open-source LLM architectures (e.g., transformer vs. mixture-of-experts) compare in radiology-specific tasks when fine-tuned with domain data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses various model architectures including transformers, mixture-of-experts (MoE), and structured state space models, noting that larger models tend to perform better but at higher computational costs.
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions these architectures but does not provide comparative performance data specifically for radiology tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing the performance of different LLM architectures (transformer-based, MoE, etc.) on standardized radiology benchmarks after fine-tuning with radiology-specific datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between model size, computational resources, and performance for radiology applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that larger models tend to perform better but at higher computational costs, and mentions parameter-efficient techniques like LoRA and quantization as alternatives.
- Why unresolved: While the paper discusses the trade-offs, it does not provide specific guidelines or empirical data on the optimal balance for different radiology use cases.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic studies comparing the performance, computational requirements, and practical utility of different model sizes and fine-tuning techniques across various radiology tasks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we effectively evaluate and mitigate biases in LLMs specifically for radiology applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses various types of biases (e.g., gender, race, clinical confounding bias) that can affect LLM outputs and mentions that careful curation of training data and alignment efforts can help mitigate these biases.
- Why unresolved: While the paper acknowledges the issue of bias, it does not provide specific evaluation frameworks or mitigation strategies tailored to radiology contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of radiology-specific bias evaluation metrics and mitigation techniques, along with empirical studies demonstrating their effectiveness.

## Limitations

- Limited empirical validation exists for many proposed best practices, as most recommendations derive from adjacent domains or theoretical reasoning
- Few published studies directly compare different optimization strategies (prompt engineering vs RAG vs fine-tuning) in controlled radiology settings
- Data privacy requirements vary significantly across institutions and jurisdictions, complicating generalization of deployment recommendations

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: LLMs can meaningfully assist with radiology report generation and quality assurance when properly implemented
- **Medium confidence**: RAG significantly improves factual correctness compared to native prompting, based on limited direct comparisons
- **Low confidence**: Specific recommendations for fine-tuning approaches and dataset sizes due to lack of standardized benchmarks

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical comparison study**: Conduct controlled experiments comparing prompt engineering, RAG, and fine-tuning approaches on identical radiology tasks using standardized metrics for factual correctness and clinical relevance

2. **Longitudinal deployment analysis**: Track LLM performance and error rates across multiple radiology departments over 6-12 months to identify real-world failure modes and adaptation needs

3. **Bias and fairness audit**: Systematically evaluate LLM outputs across diverse patient populations and imaging modalities to quantify and mitigate potential demographic biases in automated reporting
