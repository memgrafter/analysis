# Cross-Lingual Conversational Speech Summarization with Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2408.06484
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06484
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: Cross-lingual conversational speech summarization is challenging due to limited resources; using GPT-4 to generate synthetic summaries from translations and adapting Mistral-7B yields promising results

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of cross-lingual conversational speech summarization, which is hindered by limited resources, particularly the lack of translated conversational speech and summary datasets. The authors tackle this problem by leveraging the Fisher and Callhome Spanish-English Speech Translation corpus, supplementing it with summaries generated by GPT-4 from reference translations. They establish a baseline cascade-based system using open-source speech recognition and machine translation models, and evaluate various large language models (LLMs) for summarization. The study reveals that adapting the Mistral-7B model for this task significantly outperforms off-the-shelf models and achieves performance comparable to GPT-4. This demonstrates the potential of using large, API-based models like GPT-4 to generate evaluation and adaptation data for cross-lingual speech summarization. The authors plan to explore contextual summarization and incorporate additional information from alternative hypotheses for transcription and translation in future work.

## Method Summary
The authors address cross-lingual conversational speech summarization by creating a synthetic dataset using GPT-4 to generate summaries from translated speech transcripts in the Fisher and Callhome Spanish-English Speech Translation corpus. They establish a baseline cascade system combining open-source ASR and MT models, then evaluate several LLMs for the summarization task. The approach includes fine-tuning Mistral-7B on the generated summaries and comparing its performance against both off-the-shelf models and GPT-4. The evaluation uses ROUGE scores to measure summary quality against reference summaries.

## Key Results
- GPT-4 generated summaries from reference translations enable creation of synthetic training data for cross-lingual speech summarization
- Adapted Mistral-7B significantly outperforms off-the-shelf LLMs on the task
- Mistral-7B achieves performance comparable to GPT-4 despite being a much smaller model
- The cascade approach combining ASR, MT, and summarization models provides a practical baseline

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging large language models to bridge the data scarcity gap in cross-lingual speech summarization. By using GPT-4 to generate high-quality summaries from translated transcripts, the authors create a synthetic dataset that enables adaptation of smaller, more efficient models like Mistral-7B. The cascade architecture allows each component (ASR, MT, summarization) to be optimized independently while maintaining practical feasibility.

## Foundational Learning
- **Cross-lingual speech summarization**: Why needed - enables information access across language barriers; Quick check - Can you explain the difference between monolingual and cross-lingual summarization?
- **Cascade vs. end-to-end systems**: Why needed - understanding architectural tradeoffs; Quick check - What are the advantages and disadvantages of cascade approaches?
- **Synthetic data generation**: Why needed - addresses data scarcity in low-resource scenarios; Quick check - How can large language models be used to generate training data?
- **Model adaptation vs. zero-shot**: Why needed - determines when fine-tuning is necessary; Quick check - When would you choose to adapt a model versus using it zero-shot?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: ASR model → MT model → LLM summarization

**Critical path**: Speech input → ASR transcription → Machine translation → LLM summarization → Output summary

**Design tradeoffs**: The cascade approach trades potential error accumulation for modularity and the ability to use best-in-class components for each stage. End-to-end alternatives could reduce error propagation but require more training data and computational resources.

**Failure signatures**: 
- ASR errors propagate to summaries, particularly for proper nouns and technical terms
- Translation errors can introduce factual inaccuracies or loss of nuance
- Summarization models may miss key conversational elements or fail to maintain coherence across longer dialogues

**First 3 experiments to run**:
1. Evaluate baseline cascade system with ground truth transcripts to isolate MT and summarization performance
2. Compare adapted Mistral-7B against other open-source LLMs on a held-out validation set
3. Test the system with noisy ASR output to understand error propagation effects

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Small dataset size limits generalizability of findings
- Cascade approach introduces potential error propagation from ASR through MT to summarization
- Focus on Spanish-English limits applicability to other language pairs
- ROUGE scores may not fully capture conversational summary quality

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The feasibility of using API-based models to generate synthetic data for cross-lingual summarization tasks
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of Mistral-7B adaptation compared to off-the-shelf models, given the relatively small evaluation dataset
- **Medium confidence**: The comparative performance to GPT-4, as this depends on the quality and representativeness of the generated summaries

## Next Checks
1. Expand evaluation to include human assessment of summary quality, particularly focusing on coherence and informativeness rather than just ROUGE scores
2. Test the approach on additional language pairs beyond Spanish-English to assess generalizability
3. Compare cascade approach performance against potential end-to-end speech-to-summary models as they become available
