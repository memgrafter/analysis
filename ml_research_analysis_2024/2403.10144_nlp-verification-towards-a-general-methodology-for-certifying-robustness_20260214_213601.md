# NLP Verification: Towards a General Methodology for Certifying Robustness

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2403.10144
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10144
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: Proposes a general methodology for NLP verification that addresses the "embedding gap" problem by using semantic perturbations to create verifiable subspaces, demonstrating improved verifiability and generalisability compared to geometric approaches

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the fundamental challenge of verifying robustness in NLP systems, particularly large language models, where traditional geometric verification methods fail due to the discrete nature of language and the disconnect between embedding space geometry and semantic meaning. The authors propose a comprehensive methodology that introduces semantic subspaces defined through character, word, and sentence-level perturbations, along with a generalisability metric to measure semantic validity and a novel semantically robust training approach. Their results show that leveraging semantic subspaces significantly improves both verifiability and generalisability compared to conventional geometric methods, while also introducing a falsifiability metric to evaluate embedding function quality. The work represents a significant step toward practical verification of NLP systems by acknowledging and addressing the unique characteristics of natural language processing.

## Method Summary
The methodology centers on defining verifiable subspaces in the embedding space using semantic perturbations at multiple levels - character, word, and sentence - to better capture the relationship between geometric properties and semantic meaning. These subspaces are used both for verification purposes and as part of a novel semantically robust training approach that explicitly considers semantic validity. The authors introduce a generalisability metric that quantifies how well verified properties transfer to semantically similar inputs, addressing the critical issue of whether verified subspaces actually correspond to meaningful semantic regions. Additionally, they propose a falsifiability metric to measure the quality of embedding functions by assessing how easily false properties can be proven, providing a quantitative measure of embedding function reliability. The approach integrates these components into a unified verification pipeline that explicitly accounts for NLP-specific characteristics rather than treating language models as generic geometric objects.

## Key Results
- Semantic subspaces defined through perturbations significantly improve verifiability compared to geometric approaches, showing higher robustness under semantic attacks
- The generalisability metric effectively measures semantic validity of verified subspaces, demonstrating that semantic subspaces maintain properties across semantically similar inputs better than geometric subspaces
- Semantically robust training further enhances both verifiability and generalisability, with models trained using semantic perturbations showing improved resistance to semantic adversarial attacks
- The falsifiability metric provides a meaningful measure of embedding function quality, correlating with actual model performance on semantic robustness tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The methodology works by directly addressing the "embedding gap" - the fundamental disconnect between geometric properties in embedding space and semantic meaning in natural language. By using semantic perturbations at multiple levels (character, word, sentence), the approach creates subspaces that are inherently more aligned with semantic meaning rather than just geometric proximity. This alignment means that verified properties in these subspaces are more likely to generalize to semantically similar inputs, which is captured by the generalisability metric. The semantically robust training further reinforces this alignment by exposing models to semantically valid variations during training, making them more robust to semantic perturbations during inference.

## Foundational Learning

**Semantic Perturbations**: Modifications to text at character, word, or sentence level that preserve semantic meaning while changing surface form
- *Why needed*: Traditional verification methods cannot handle the discrete nature of language and the embedding gap problem
- *Quick check*: Verify that perturbed text maintains original meaning through human evaluation or semantic similarity metrics

**Verifiable Subspaces**: Regions in embedding space defined by semantic perturbations where properties can be formally verified
- *Why needed*: Geometric subspaces alone do not capture semantic relationships in language
- *Quick check*: Ensure subspace properties hold under diverse semantic perturbations

**Generalisability Metric**: Quantitative measure of how well verified properties transfer to semantically similar inputs
- *Why needed*: Traditional verification provides no guarantee about semantic validity of verified properties
- *Quick check*: Validate metric correlation with actual model robustness on semantic adversarial examples

**Falsifiability Metric**: Measure of embedding function quality based on ease of proving false properties
- *Why needed*: Poor embedding functions can lead to both false positives and false negatives in verification
- *Quick check*: Test metric sensitivity to known embedding quality issues

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Text -> Semantic Perturbation Generator -> Embedding Function -> Verifiable Subspace Definition -> Verification Engine -> Generalisability Assessment -> Falsifiability Evaluation

**Critical Path**: The core verification pipeline flows from semantic perturbation generation through embedding and subspace definition to property verification, with generalisability and falsifiability metrics providing quality assessment at different stages.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach trades computational complexity (multiple perturbation levels, metric calculations) for improved semantic alignment and verification accuracy. More extensive perturbations improve generalisability but increase computational cost and may introduce semantic drift if not carefully controlled.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor embedding functions manifest as low falsifiability scores and poor generalisability even with semantically valid perturbations. Overly restrictive subspaces lead to verification failures on semantically valid inputs. Excessive perturbation diversity can cause semantic drift, reducing the semantic validity of verified properties.

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Compare verifiability of geometric vs. semantic subspaces on standard NLP robustness benchmarks
2. Evaluate generalisability metric correlation with actual model performance under semantic adversarial attacks
3. Assess impact of semantically robust training on both verifiability and generalisability across different model architectures

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the source material.

## Limitations
- The methodology's effectiveness heavily depends on the quality and diversity of semantic perturbation techniques, which may not capture all semantic variations
- The approach assumes semantic perturbations can adequately represent the full semantic space, potentially limiting applicability to specialized domains or languages
- The embedding gap problem is addressed but not fully solved, as the methodology still relies on embedding functions that may imperfectly preserve semantic meaning
- Experimental validation is limited to specific tasks and datasets, restricting generalizability claims

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Semantic subspaces improve verifiability compared to geometric approaches - well-supported by experimental results showing higher robustness under semantic perturbations.

**Medium Confidence**: Generalisability metric effectively measures semantic validity of verified subspaces - theoretically sound but needs more extensive validation across different settings.

**Medium Confidence**: Semantically robust training significantly enhances both verifiability and generalisability - promising results but requires investigation of long-term effects and scalability.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct extensive ablation studies removing different semantic perturbation techniques to quantify their individual contributions to verifiability and generalisability improvements.

2. Validate the methodology across multiple languages and domain-specific datasets (e.g., medical, legal) to assess cross-domain generalizability and identify potential limitations in semantic perturbation approaches.

3. Perform long-term stability analysis by training models with semantically robust training and evaluating performance degradation over time and across different model scales to assess practical deployment viability.
