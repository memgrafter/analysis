# Video as the New Language for Real-World Decision Making

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.17139
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17139
- Authors: Sherry Yang, Jacob Walker, Jack Parker-Holder, Yilun Du, Jake Bruce, Andre Barreto, Pieter Abbeel, Dale Schuurmans

- Primary result: Video generation models can serve as a unified interface for diverse tasks in the physical world, similar to how language models have become a general-purpose tool for digital tasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes video generation models as a unified interface for real-world decision making, analogous to how language models serve as general-purpose tools for digital tasks. The authors demonstrate that video generation can be applied to various domains including robotics, self-driving, and scientific simulations. They show that video data captures information about the physical world that is difficult to express in language, such as visual details, physics, and behavior. The paper presents examples of using video generation for planning, simulation, and reasoning tasks, while identifying challenges like dataset limitations, model heterogeneity, hallucination, and limited generalization that need to be addressed.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes converting diverse real-world tasks into conditional video generation problems. Three main approaches are discussed: autoregressive models, diffusion models, and masked models for video generation. The method leverages in-context learning to specify tasks by providing example input-output pairs structured in a unified image/video space. For embodied applications, the approach conditions video generation on action inputs to predict future visual observations, enabling simulation of environment dynamics. The unified interface aims to absorb internet-scale video knowledge and represent diverse tasks across computer vision, robotics, self-driving, and scientific domains.

## Key Results
- Video generation can serve as planners, agents, compute engines, and environment simulators through techniques like in-context learning, planning, and reinforcement learning
- Internet-scale video data (YouTube has over ten thousand years of consecutive video watching) provides rich physical information not easily captured in language
- Video generation can convert classical computer vision tasks into a unified framework and potentially simulate complex real-world dynamics for robotics and self-driving applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Video generation models can serve as unified interfaces for diverse tasks by converting them into conditional video generation problems
- Mechanism: Classical computer vision tasks can be converted into video generation tasks by structuring inputs and outputs into a unified image/video space and using in-context learning to specify desired tasks
- Core assumption: Video generation models can learn to map between structured input-output pairs when provided as examples
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "video can serve as a unified interface that can absorb internet knowledge and represent diverse tasks"; [section] "Recent work has shown that it is possible to convert diverse vision tasks into a video generation task"
- Break condition: If video generation models cannot learn the mapping between structured input-output pairs, or if the structured space is insufficient to capture all task variations

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Video generation models can simulate complex real-world dynamics for robotics and self-driving applications
- Mechanism: By conditioning video generation on action inputs, models can predict future visual observations, effectively simulating environment dynamics for policy evaluation and training
- Core assumption: The visual dynamics of real-world systems can be captured in video generation models trained on internet data or real-world recordings
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "video generation can serve as planners, agents, compute engines, and environment simulators"; [section] "Action-conditioned video generation can possibly simulate the environment dynamics of complex computer games"
- Break condition: If the visual dynamics cannot be adequately captured, or if the simulation quality is insufficient for reliable policy training

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Video generation models can answer complex how-to questions by synthesizing detailed visual demonstrations
- Mechanism: Text-to-video models can generate video responses to instructional queries, providing detailed visual demonstrations that are more interpretable than text responses alone
- Core assumption: Video generation models can synthesize coherent, detailed sequences that demonstrate task completion steps
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "videos synthesized by today's text-to-video models are generally too short/simple, not containing enough information to fully answer users' questions"; [section] "In Figure 2, we illustrate videos generated by a text-to-video model in response to a set of how-to inquiries"
- Break condition: If generated videos lack sufficient detail or coherence to demonstrate task completion, or if the model cannot handle the complexity of real-world tasks

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Conditional video generation
  - Why needed here: The paper's core approach relies on conditioning video generation models on various inputs (text, images, actions) to solve different tasks
  - Quick check question: What are the three common factorization approaches for conditional video generation mentioned in the paper?

- Concept: In-context learning
  - Why needed here: The paper uses in-context learning to specify tasks to video generation models by providing example input-output pairs
  - Quick check question: How does the paper propose to use in-context learning for converting vision tasks into video generation problems?

- Concept: Diffusion models vs autoregressive models
  - Why needed here: The paper discusses different video generation architectures and their tradeoffs for different applications
  - Quick check question: What are the key advantages and disadvantages of diffusion models compared to autoregressive models for video generation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Video generation model (diffusion, autoregressive, or masked) -> Conditioning mechanism (text, image, action) -> In-context learning system for task specification -> Action extraction or inverse dynamics module -> Reward or evaluation system for simulation-based training

- Critical path: Video generation → Task specification (in-context) → Action extraction → Execution or simulation → Evaluation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model architecture choice (diffusion vs autoregressive vs masked) affects generation speed and quality
  - Conditioning type affects the range of tasks that can be addressed
  - Resolution and temporal consistency tradeoffs impact simulation fidelity

- Failure signatures:
  - Hallucination (objects appearing/disappearing unexpectedly)
  - Limited generalization to out-of-distribution inputs
  - Temporal inconsistency in generated sequences
  - Slow generation speed for real-time applications

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple text-to-video model and test it on basic how-to queries
  2. Convert a classical computer vision task (e.g., depth estimation) into a video generation problem
  3. Train an action-conditioned video generation model on a simple game environment and test its simulation capabilities

- Low Confidence: The assertion that video generation will become a "general-purpose tool" comparable to language models for digital tasks, requires overcoming substantial technical challenges

## Next Checks

1. **Benchmark Against Specialized Systems**: Implement the video generation approach for a specific robotics task (e.g., block stacking) and directly compare performance against a specialized reinforcement learning solution on metrics like success rate, sample efficiency, and robustness to perturbations.

2. **Hallucination Analysis**: Systematically measure hallucination rates in video generation outputs across different domains (robotics, self-driving, scientific) using automated metrics (object consistency, physical plausibility) and human evaluation to quantify the severity of this limitation.

3. **Cross-Domain Transfer Test**: Train a video generation model on one domain (e.g., simple game environments) and evaluate its ability to generalize to structurally similar but unseen domains (e.g., different game mechanics) to measure the true generalization capabilities claimed in the paper.
