# A Context-Aware Approach for Enhancing Data Imputation with Pre-trained Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.17712
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17712
- Reference count: 40
- Authors: Ahatsham Hayat; Mohammad Rashedul Hasan
- Key outcome: Introduces CLAIM, a novel LLM-based imputation method showing up to 10% improvement over baselines across MCAR, MAR, and MNAR scenarios

## Executive Summary
This paper presents CLAIM (Context-aware Language-driven Imputation Method), a novel approach for handling missing data in tabular datasets using pre-trained language models. Rather than relying on traditional numerical estimation techniques, CLAIM transforms datasets into natural language descriptions where missing values are replaced with contextually relevant descriptors generated by LLMs. The method then fine-tunes the LLM on this enriched dataset to improve downstream classification performance. Experiments across multiple datasets and missingness patterns demonstrate CLAIM's superior performance compared to baseline imputation methods.

## Method Summary
CLAIM converts numeric data into contextualized natural language descriptions, then uses LLMs to generate contextually relevant descriptors for missing values. The method creates missingness-aware datasets by replacing missing values with these descriptors, then fine-tunes pre-trained LLMs on the enriched dataset for downstream classification tasks. The approach leverages LLMs' knowledge and reasoning capabilities to create feature-specific descriptors rather than generic placeholders, and employs QLoRA for efficient fine-tuning on resource-constrained environments.

## Key Results
- CLAIM achieves up to 10% improvement in classification accuracy over best-performing baseline imputation methods
- Demonstrates superior performance across all missingness patterns (MCAR, MAR, MNAR)
- Shows robustness in challenging MNAR scenarios where traditional methods struggle
- Context-specific descriptors outperform generic descriptors like "NaN" by providing explicit contextual information

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: CLAIM transforms missing value imputation into a language modeling task by converting numeric data into contextualized natural language descriptions.
- Mechanism: Numeric values are described in natural language and missing values are replaced with contextually relevant descriptors generated by LLMs, creating a language-aligned dataset for fine-tuning.
- Core assumption: LLMs can leverage their pre-trained knowledge to generate contextually appropriate descriptors for missing values that improve downstream task performance.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states CRILM uses LMs to create contextually relevant descriptors; section confirms CLAIM utilizes contextually relevant natural language descriptors.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Fine-tuning LLMs on missingness-aware contextualized datasets improves downstream classification performance compared to traditional imputation methods.
- Mechanism: After transforming the dataset with natural language descriptors for missing values, the LLM is fine-tuned on this enriched dataset to learn patterns that account for missingness context.
- Core assumption: LLMs can learn from the explicit context provided by missing value descriptors to make better predictions than methods that rely on numerical imputation.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract demonstrates up to 10% improvement over baselines; evaluations reveal superior performance over existing techniques.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Context-specific descriptors for missing values perform better than generic descriptors in LLM-based imputation tasks.
- Mechanism: The method generates unique, feature-specific descriptors rather than generic ones, providing explicit context for the LLM.
- Core assumption: LLMs can utilize their extensive training on diverse language uses and contexts to better interpret and manage missing data when described in contextually accurate ways.
- Evidence anchors: Analysis of context-specific versus generic descriptors shows generic descriptors consistently perform worse; experimental findings illuminate influence of missing data phrasing.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Missing data mechanisms (MCAR, MAR, MNAR)
  - Why needed here: Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for evaluating CLAIM's effectiveness across different missingness scenarios
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes MNAR from MAR, and why is MNAR considered the most challenging for imputation?

- Concept: Natural language processing and LLM fine-tuning
  - Why needed here: CLAIM relies on LLMs' ability to process natural language descriptions and generate contextually relevant descriptors
  - Quick check question: How does fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM differ from training a model from scratch, and why is this approach used in CLAIM?

- Concept: Data imputation techniques and evaluation metrics
  - Why needed here: To understand how CLAIM compares to baseline methods and to properly assess its performance improvements
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between single imputation and multiple imputation approaches?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing module -> LLM descriptor generation module -> Dataset enrichment module -> LLM fine-tuning module -> Evaluation module
- Critical path: Data preprocessing → LLM descriptor generation → Dataset enrichment → LLM fine-tuning → Downstream task performance
- Design tradeoffs: Using natural language descriptions increases data size but aligns with LLM strengths; context-specific descriptors improve performance but require more LLM generation time; fine-tuning large LLMs is computationally expensive but leverages pre-trained knowledge
- Failure signatures: Poor LLM-generated descriptors lead to loss of contextual information; fine-tuning instability results in inconsistent downstream performance; computational constraints limit model size or training duration
- First 3 experiments: 1) Implement data preprocessing module to convert numeric dataset to natural language format; 2) Test LLM descriptor generation on datasets with known missing values to evaluate context relevance; 3) Compare fine-tuning results on enriched vs. original datasets for simple classification task

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does CLAIM perform on extremely large datasets (e.g., millions of rows and hundreds of features) compared to traditional imputation methods?
- Basis in paper: Inferred from mentions of scalability challenges and computational requirements
- Why unresolved: Experiments used relatively small datasets (up to 50 features); computational requirements and bottlenecks on massive datasets remain unexplored
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments on large-scale datasets (1M+ rows, 100+ features) showing performance, runtime, and resource usage

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the choice of LLM architecture (encoder-only, decoder-only, or encoder-decoder) affect CLAIM's performance in data imputation?
- Basis in paper: Explicit use of decoder-only LLM (LLaMA 2) without exploring different architectures
- Why unresolved: Different LLM architectures have varying strengths in handling sequential data and context; optimal architecture remains unexplored
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing CLAIM's performance using different LLM architectures (BERT, GPT, T5) on same datasets

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can CLAIM be extended to handle missing data in non-tabular formats, such as time-series, images, or unstructured text?
- Basis in paper: Inferred from focus on tabular datasets and mentions of potential future work
- Why unresolved: Adapting CLAIM to non-tabular data formats would require significant modifications to contextualization and descriptor generation processes
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrations of CLAIM's effectiveness in handling missing data in non-tabular formats with necessary adaptations

## Limitations

- Results may not generalize to larger-scale datasets or domains beyond tabular classification
- Computational requirements for LLM fine-tuning remain substantial compared to traditional methods
- Study does not address temporal dependencies in data or scalability with increasing feature dimensionality

## Confidence

*High Confidence:* The mechanism that contextual language descriptions improve LLM alignment with imputation tasks is well-supported by experimental results showing up to 10% improvement over baselines across multiple missingness patterns.

*Medium Confidence:* The claim that context-specific descriptors outperform generic ones is supported by experimental evidence, but underlying reasons for performance gap could be explored further.

*Low Confidence:* The assertion that CLAIM offers a cost-effective solution for resource-constrained environments is questionable given computational demands of LLM fine-tuning.

## Next Checks

1. **Scalability Test:** Evaluate CLAIM's performance and computational efficiency on larger datasets (>10,000 samples) and with higher missingness ratios (>30%) to assess practical scalability limits.

2. **Domain Transferability:** Apply CLAIM to non-tabular data types (e.g., time series, images with metadata) to test the generalizability of the language modeling approach beyond UCI classification datasets.

3. **Descriptor Generation Robustness:** Conduct ablation studies replacing the conversational LLM with simpler heuristic-based descriptor generation to quantify the contribution of LLM-generated context versus the language modeling framework itself.
