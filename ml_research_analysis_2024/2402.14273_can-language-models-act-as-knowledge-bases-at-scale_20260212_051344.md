core_contribution: 'This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can
  effectively function as large-scale knowledge bases (KBs) by memorizing, recalling,
  and reasoning with structured knowledge. The study focuses on three key aspects:
  (1) the efficiency of LMs with different sizes in memorizing knowledge from a large-scale
  KB (Wikidata); (2) the flexibility of recalling memorized knowledge in response
  to natural language queries; and (3) the capability to infer new knowledge through
  reasoning.'

# Can Language Models Act as Knowledge Bases at Scale?
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.14273
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14273
- Reference count: 39
- Language models can memorize and recall structured knowledge from Wikidata, with larger models showing better performance but struggling with long-tail knowledge

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether large language models can effectively function as knowledge bases by memorizing, recalling, and reasoning with structured knowledge from Wikidata. The study demonstrates that larger models learn faster and achieve higher performance in knowledge memorization, but struggle with long-tail knowledge and complex reasoning tasks. The authors propose an importance sampling algorithm for efficient training and show that finetuning on natural language queries significantly improves free-form query handling. However, inverse reasoning capabilities remain notably weaker than compositional reasoning, indicating limitations in current knowledge representation approaches.

## Method Summary
The authors propose an importance sampling algorithm to train language models more efficiently on Wikidata's 46 million (subject, relation, object) triplets. They evaluate T5 and LLaMA-2 models of different sizes using exact match (EM) and F1 scores for fixed-form information recall. The study then finetunes trained models on a natural language QA dataset (PopQA) to assess flexibility in handling free-form queries. Finally, they evaluate the models' ability to infer missing facts through inverse and compositional reasoning, comparing performance before and after KB training.

## Key Results
- Larger language models learn faster and achieve higher performance in memorizing structured knowledge from Wikidata
- Finetuning trained models on natural language QA datasets significantly improves their performance on free-form queries
- Models show better compositional reasoning capabilities than inverse reasoning when inferring missing facts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
None

## Foundational Learning
- Importance sampling: Prioritizes more informative training examples to improve learning efficiency; needed for handling large-scale knowledge bases; quick check: compare training speed with and without importance sampling
- Exact match (EM) and F1 scores: Evaluation metrics for knowledge recall accuracy; needed to quantify model performance on structured knowledge; quick check: verify metric calculations on sample outputs
- Inverse vs compositional reasoning: Different reasoning patterns for knowledge inference; needed to understand model reasoning capabilities; quick check: test simple inverse and compositional queries

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Importance sampling algorithm -> Language model training -> Knowledge recall evaluation -> Finetuning on natural queries -> Reasoning capability assessment
- Critical path: Efficient training through importance sampling is essential for achieving high performance in knowledge memorization and recall
- Design tradeoffs: Larger models provide better performance but require more computational resources and struggle more with long-tail knowledge
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on long-tail knowledge, weaker inverse reasoning compared to compositional reasoning
- First experiments:
  1. Test knowledge recall accuracy on a subset of Wikidata with different model sizes
  2. Evaluate free-form query performance before and after finetuning
  3. Compare inverse and compositional reasoning capabilities on simple inference tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Study focuses primarily on Wikidata's structured knowledge, which may not represent the diversity of real-world knowledge bases
- Evaluation metrics may not capture all aspects of knowledge base functionality, particularly nuanced reasoning capabilities
- Long-tail knowledge performance gap between model sizes suggests potential scalability limitations
- Inverse reasoning capabilities remain notably weaker than compositional reasoning

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Larger LMs learn faster and achieve higher performance in structured knowledge memorization and recall
- Medium Confidence: Effectiveness of finetuning on improving free-form query handling given specific dataset and task constraints
- Medium Confidence: Reasoning capabilities demonstrated, particularly the difference between compositional and inverse reasoning performance

## Next Checks
1. Test finetuned models on a more diverse set of real-world knowledge base queries across multiple domains to assess generalization
2. Evaluate models' performance on temporal and context-dependent knowledge to understand limitations in handling dynamic information
3. Conduct ablation studies on different sampling strategies and training durations to optimize knowledge memorization process and reduce long-tail performance gap
