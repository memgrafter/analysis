# Infer Induced Sentiment of Comment Response to Video: A New Task, Dataset and Baseline

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.06115
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06115
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proposed VC-CSA method achieves 73.52 micro-F1 for opinion and 62.99 micro-F1 for emotion classification on the CSMV dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a new task, Multi-modal Sentiment Analysis for Comment Response of Video Induced (MSA-CRVI), which focuses on inferring the induced sentiment of viewers from their comments on micro-videos. The authors create the largest dataset of its kind, CSMV, containing 107,267 comments and 8,210 micro-videos with a duration of 68.83 hours. To address the challenges of this task, they propose a Video Content-aware Comment Sentiment Analysis (VC-CSA) method, which employs multi-scale temporal representation, consensus semantic learning, and golden feature grounding to effectively model the correlation between comments and videos. Experiments show that VC-CSA significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

## Method Summary
The VC-CSA method addresses the MSA-CRVI task by leveraging three key modules: Multi-scale Temporal Representation uses multiple 1D-CNN layers to capture video features at different temporal granularities; Consensus Semantic Learning employs a transformer with consensus tokens to bridge the semantic gap between comments and videos; and Golden Feature Grounding uses second-order attention to identify the most relevant video segments for each comment. The model fuses processed video and text features for sentiment classification into opinion (positive/negative/neutral) and emotion (8 Plutchik wheel categories) labels. The approach uses pre-extracted I3D visual features and RoBERTa text embeddings as inputs.

## Key Results
- VC-CSA achieves 73.52 micro-F1 for opinion classification and 62.99 micro-F1 for emotion classification on the CSMV dataset
- The model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by significant margins across all evaluation metrics
- Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each proposed module, with multi-scale temporal representation and golden feature grounding showing the most significant contributions
- Qualitative analysis shows VC-CSA effectively grounds comments to relevant video content, capturing viewer attention to different video segments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multi-scale temporal representation captures viewer attention to different video segments across varying granularities.
- Mechanism: Multiple 1D-CNN layers progressively expand temporal context, creating a hierarchy of visual features from fine to coarse granularity.
- Core assumption: Comments reference video content at different temporal scales, requiring representation at multiple resolutions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Comments could focus on different temporal-granularity content within the video...This implies the necessity for carefully encoding video temporal features and precisely processing the grounding video information."
  - [abstract] "We propose a Video Content-aware Comment Sentiment Analysis (VC-CSA) method...which employs multi-scale temporal representation, consensus semantic learning, and golden feature grounding"
- Break condition: If video content lacks temporal structure or if all comments reference the same temporal scale.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Consensus semantic learning bridges the semantic gap between comments and videos through shared token representations.
- Mechanism: Consensus tokens act as intermediaries between video and comment features, enabling information exchange while masking direct attention connections.
- Core assumption: Comments and videos share underlying semantic concepts despite lacking direct textual correspondence.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The comments, being responses to a video, do not describe the video content directly, creating a semantic gap between the video and the comments"
  - [section] "We introduce a video-comment consensus transformer to capture the shared semantic occurrences between comment and video"
- Break condition: If comments are completely unrelated to video content or if semantic mapping is impossible.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Golden feature grounding filters redundant video information to identify the most relevant segments for each comment.
- Mechanism: Second-order grounding uses attention score trends to compute global temporal weights, eliminating redundancy from continuous frames.
- Core assumption: Continuous video frames exhibit high similarity, requiring post-processing to extract distinctive features.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "To accurately interpret the sentiment of comment related to a video, it is important to ground the video content referenced by the comment"
  - [section] "We design Golden Feature Grounding module, which comprises a two-steps approach to compute grounding weight"
- Break condition: If video segments are too dissimilar or if attention scores don't follow smooth temporal patterns.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multi-modal sentiment analysis
  - Why needed here: MSA-CRVI combines visual, audio, and textual modalities to infer induced sentiment from comments
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes induced sentiment analysis from traditional sentiment analysis of video speakers?

- Concept: Temporal feature encoding
  - Why needed here: Video content requires temporal modeling to understand how different segments relate to viewer comments
  - Quick check question: How does temporal granularity affect the relationship between video content and viewer comments?

- Concept: Semantic grounding
  - Why needed here: Comments reference video content indirectly, requiring methods to establish semantic connections
  - Quick check question: Why can't we simply match comment keywords with video transcript content?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Video encoder (I3D) → Multi-scale temporal representation → Consensus semantic learning → Golden feature grounding → Fusion module → Classifier
  - Text encoder (RoBERTa) → Consensus semantic learning → Fusion module → Classifier
  - Classifier outputs: Opinion (positive/negative/neutral) and Emotion (8 categories)

- Critical path:
  1. Encode video and text features
  2. Apply multi-scale temporal representation to video
  3. Use consensus transformer to bridge semantic gap
  4. Apply golden feature grounding to identify relevant video segments
  5. Fuse processed features for sentiment classification

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Multi-scale representation vs. computational efficiency
  - Consensus tokens vs. direct attention mechanisms
  - Second-order grounding vs. simpler attention-based approaches

- Failure signatures:
  - Low agreement between video and comment sentiment
  - Model performance drops significantly when video features are removed
  - Comments with ambiguous sentiment remain unclassified

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare multi-scale vs. single-scale temporal representation performance
  2. Test consensus token vs. direct attention mechanisms for semantic bridging
  3. Evaluate first-order vs. second-order grounding approaches for feature selection

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the diversity of video topics and styles in micro-videos affect the accuracy of sentiment analysis?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that micro-videos are more diverse in content and format than monologues and dialogues, and the CSMV dataset includes videos from 35 different hashtags covering various topics.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of how this diversity impacts sentiment analysis accuracy across different topics and styles.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive analysis comparing sentiment analysis accuracy across different video topics and styles in the CSMV dataset, along with insights into the challenges and strategies for handling diverse content.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the limitations of using visual features extracted from videos (like I3D) compared to using raw video data for sentiment analysis?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that due to privacy concerns, only visual features extracted using the I3D model are published, not the original videos.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not discuss the potential limitations or differences in performance when using extracted features versus raw video data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments using both extracted features and raw video data, analyzing the impact on sentiment analysis performance and identifying any trade-offs.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the temporal complexity of comments, which may refer to different parts of the video, affect the grounding of video content for sentiment analysis?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the challenge of modeling the correlation between comments and their corresponding micro-videos due to temporal complexity, as comments may focus on different temporal-granularity content within the video.
- Why unresolved: The paper proposes the Multi-scale Temporal Representation module but does not provide a detailed analysis of its effectiveness in handling comments that refer to different parts of the video.
- What evidence would resolve it: An in-depth analysis of the Multi-scale Temporal Representation module's performance in grounding video content for comments that refer to different temporal segments, along with insights into potential improvements or alternative approaches.

## Limitations
- Dataset is limited to TikTok platform and may not generalize to other video platforms or content types
- Imbalanced distribution of sentiment labels (65.72% positive) could bias model performance toward certain categories
- Reliance on pre-extracted I3D features rather than raw video content limits reproducibility and may miss relevant visual information

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The architectural design of VC-CSA with multi-scale temporal representation, consensus semantic learning, and golden feature grounding is clearly specified and demonstrates superior performance over baseline methods
- **Medium confidence**: The experimental results showing VC-CSA outperforming baselines are reliable within the constraints of the CSMV dataset, but the absolute performance scores may not generalize to other datasets or real-world applications
- **Low confidence**: Claims about the general applicability of MSA-CRVI to other platforms or content types are not empirically validated beyond the TikTok dataset used in this study

## Next Checks
1. Test VC-CSA on video-comment datasets from different platforms (e.g., YouTube, Instagram) to assess generalizability beyond TikTok content
2. Conduct a more detailed ablation study that isolates the contribution of each module to identify which components are essential versus complementary
3. Perform human annotation studies to assess the reliability of the induced sentiment labels and compare human performance with VC-CSA to establish a performance ceiling
