core_contribution: The paper introduces multi-channel sign language translation (MCSLT)
  as a task to predict glosses across multiple signal channels (manual, non-manual,
  co-occurring) rather than a single linear gloss sequence. To evaluate MCSLT, it
  proposes SignBLEU, a metric that generalizes BLEU to capture both sequential and

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces multi-channel sign language translation (MCSLT) as a task to predict glosses across multiple signal channels rather than a single linear gloss sequence. To evaluate MCSLT, the authors propose SignBLEU, a metric that generalizes BLEU to capture both sequential and concurrent signals using temporal and channel n-grams. The metric was validated through system-level and segment-level experiments on three sign language corpora with varied linguistic structures. Results show SignBLEU consistently correlates better with human judgment than competing metrics like BLEU, TER, chrF, METEOR, and ROUGE.

## Method Summary
The SignBLEU metric extends BLEU to handle multi-channel sign language data through blockification (converting time-aligned annotations to unit-less sequences of co-signed blocks) and linearization (converting blocks to text for LLM processing). The method involves fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs (BLOOM-CLP-German, Ko-GPT-Trinity, TinyLlama) on three sign language corpora, then calculating n-gram precision for both temporal and channel dimensions. The metric combines these scores with a brevity penalty to produce the final SignBLEU score.

## Key Results
- SignBLEU consistently correlates better with human judgment than BLEU, TER, chrF, METEOR, and ROUGE
- The metric captures both sequential (temporal) and concurrent (channel) information in sign language
- Benchmark MCSLT scores are provided for three sign language corpora with varied linguistic structures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: SignBLEU's multi-channel n-gram extraction better captures semantic overlap in sign language than traditional BLEU.
- Mechanism: By calculating both temporal (sequential) and channel (co-occurring) n-grams, SignBLEU can account for simultaneous manual and non-manual signals that are lost in linear gloss representations.
- Core assumption: Sign language meaning is distributed across multiple articulators and temporal overlap, not just in sequence order.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "introduce a new task named multi-channel sign language translation (MCSLT) and present a novel metric, SignBLEU, designed to capture multiple signal channels"
  - [section] "To model the complex form of multiple signal channels, we introduce two transformations: blockification and linearization"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus-level validation of n-gram correlation with meaning
- Break condition: If non-manual signals are not semantically important for the target sign language domain, the channel gram component adds noise rather than signal.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: SignBLEU correlates better with human judgments than existing metrics.
- Mechanism: The inclusion of both manual and non-manual channels in evaluation aligns more closely with how native signers assess translation quality.
- Core assumption: Human evaluation of sign language translation quality depends on both manual and non-manual signal fidelity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We found that SignBLEU consistently correlates better with human judgment than competing metrics"
  - [section] "At the segment level, SignBLEU has high correlation with human evaluation of translation naturalness and fidelity"
  - [corpus] Moderate - tested on three corpora but only human evaluation on one (NIASL2021)
- Break condition: If the target sign language relies primarily on manual signals (e.g., emergency alerts), manual-only metrics may correlate equally well.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Blockification preserves critical overlap information while enabling metric calculation.
- Mechanism: Converting time-aligned annotation to a unit-less sequence of co-signed blocks maintains temporal alignment without requiring duration modeling.
- Core assumption: The spatial and temporal relationships between signs are critical for meaning, even without exact duration.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Blockification converts time-aligned annotation data (e.g., ELAN's EAF format) to a unit-less sequence of co-signed blocks"
  - [section] "Although this process removes duration information, it facilitates the modeling of sign overlap and alignment"
  - [corpus] Moderate - three corpora used but no ablation on blockification vs alternatives
- Break condition: If duration or precise timing is semantically critical (e.g., rhythm-based signs), blockification may lose necessary information.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Sign language as a multi-channel language
  - Why needed here: Understanding why SignBLEU differs from BLEU requires grasping that sign language conveys meaning through multiple simultaneous channels
  - Quick check question: What are the three main types of signals in sign language that SignBLEU attempts to capture?

- Concept: N-gram precision in evaluation metrics
  - Why needed here: SignBLEU extends the n-gram precision concept from BLEU to handle multi-dimensional sign data
  - Quick check question: How does temporal n-gram calculation in SignBLEU differ from standard BLEU n-gram calculation?

- Concept: Correlation vs causation in metric validation
  - Why needed here: The paper shows correlation with human judgment but doesn't prove SignBLEU causes better translation quality
  - Quick check question: What type of experimental design would be needed to establish causation rather than just correlation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Data preprocessing: Blockification (time-aligned → blocks) → Linearization (blocks → text) → n-gram extraction (temporal + channel) → precision scoring → brevity penalty → composite score

- Critical path:
  1. Convert reference and hypothesis annotations to block format
  2. Generate n-grams for both temporal and channel dimensions
  3. Calculate modified precision for each n-gram type
  4. Apply brevity penalty
  5. Combine scores with appropriate weights

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Blockification removes duration information but simplifies overlap modeling
  - Linearization enables use of LLMs but loses alignment information
  - Multi-channel grams increase sensitivity but also computational complexity

- Failure signatures:
  - Low SignBLEU scores despite high BLEU scores may indicate missing non-manual or co-occurring signals
  - High variance across gram orders suggests corpus characteristics mismatch
  - Poor correlation with human judgment on manual-only channels may indicate non-manual signal importance

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare SignBLEU-t1c1 (simple variant) with BLEU on a small synthetic dataset with known overlap
  2. Test blockification on a single ELAN file with clear non-manual annotations to verify block matrix correctness
  3. Calculate correlation between text-side BLEU and SignBLEU on a small sample of the test corpus to verify mechanism 2

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does SignBLEU perform when applied to sign languages with significantly different linguistic structures, such as those with classifier predicates or verb agreement systems that are not present in the corpora used in this study?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper validates SignBLEU on three sign language corpora with varied linguistic structures, but does not explore sign languages with unique grammatical features like classifier predicates or verb agreement.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not test SignBLEU on corpora containing these specific linguistic features, so its effectiveness for such sign languages remains unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing SignBLEU on corpora of sign languages with classifier predicates or verb agreement and comparing its correlation with human judgment to that of other metrics would provide evidence of its performance for these languages.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of different blockification strategies on SignBLEU scores, and how can we determine the optimal strategy for a given sign language corpus?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that blockification involves combining annotation tiers by articulator and segmenting the signing timeline, but does not explore alternative strategies or provide guidelines for choosing the best one.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not compare different blockification strategies or provide a method for determining the optimal strategy for a specific corpus, leaving this as an open question.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimenting with various blockification strategies on a sign language corpus and analyzing their impact on SignBLEU scores and correlation with human judgment would help determine the optimal strategy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does SignBLEU perform when evaluating sign language translation models that generate not only glosses but also non-manual signals and co-occurring manual signals, as opposed to models that only predict manual glosses?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper introduces MCSLT and SignBLEU to evaluate models that predict multiple signal channels, but the benchmark scores are based on models fine-tuned on linearized data, which primarily focuses on manual glosses.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not evaluate SignBLEU on models that generate non-manual signals and co-occurring manual signals, so its effectiveness for such models is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training and evaluating sign language translation models that generate non-manual signals and co-occurring manual signals using SignBLEU and comparing the results to those of models that only predict manual glosses would provide evidence of SignBLEU's performance for multi-channel models.

## Limitations

- Human validation is limited to only one corpus (NIASL2021) with 50 segments evaluated
- Blockification process discards duration information which may be semantically critical for certain sign language phenomena
- Computational complexity increases with multi-channel gram extraction, potentially limiting scalability

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The architectural design of SignBLEU and its mathematical formulation are sound and well-documented
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that SignBLEU consistently correlates better with human judgment than competing metrics is supported by experiments on three corpora, but only one has direct human validation data
- **Low Confidence**: The assertion that SignBLEU will generalize to all sign languages and translation scenarios is premature given limited language testing

## Next Checks

1. **Human Validation Expansion**: Conduct human evaluation studies on the German-DGS and English-ASL corpora (Public DGS Corpus and NCSLGR) to verify that SignBLEU's correlation with human judgment holds across all three languages tested, not just Korean-KSL.

2. **Duration Sensitivity Test**: Design an ablation study comparing SignBLEU performance with and without blockification on a corpus where duration is known to be semantically important (e.g., signs with temporal emphasis), to quantify the impact of discarding duration information.

3. **Non-manual Signal Importance Analysis**: Perform a controlled experiment on a sign language corpus where non-manual signals are artificially removed from both reference and hypothesis to determine if SignBLEU's advantage over BLEU diminishes, validating whether the metric's improvement is truly due to capturing multi-channel information rather than other factors.
