## Executive Summary
This paper introduces DKL-KAN, a scalable deep kernel learning approach that uses Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as an alternative to traditional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) in deep kernel learning. The method combines the expressive power of KANs with the flexibility of Gaussian processes to create a more interpretable and effective model for regression tasks. Two variants of DKL-KAN are proposed and compared against DKL-MLP: one with the same number of neurons and layers, and another with approximately the same number of trainable parameters.

## Method Summary
The approach uses KANs with learnable univariate activation functions (splines) instead of fixed linear weights in the deep network component of deep kernel learning. The model is evaluated on UCI regression datasets using RBF kernels with KISS-GP for scalability. Two DKL-KAN variants are implemented: DKL-KAN1 with the same architecture as DKL-MLP (3 hidden layers with 256, 128, 64 neurons) and DKL-KAN2 with similar trainable parameters. Training uses empirical cumulative distribution function normalization and Adam optimization.

## Key Results
- DKL-KAN outperforms DKL-MLP on datasets with fewer observations, particularly for modeling discontinuities
- DKL-KAN demonstrates superior performance in accurately estimating prediction uncertainty, especially in regions lacking training data
- DKL-MLP exhibits better scalability and higher test prediction accuracy on datasets with large number of observations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: DKL-KAN outperforms DKL-MLP on datasets with fewer observations by leveraging learnable activation functions to better capture discontinuities.
- Mechanism: KAN replaces fixed linear weights with learnable univariate activation functions (e.g., splines), allowing the network to adaptively shape its response to input data. This enables better modeling of non-smooth, discontinuous relationships, which is especially valuable when data is scarce and each observation carries more information.
- Core assumption: The Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem holds, and the underlying data-generating function can be approximated by a composition of univariate functions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "DKL-KAN demonstrates superior performance in modeling discontinuities and accurately estimating prediction uncertainty, particularly in regions lacking training data."
  - [section]: "Due to DKL's joint supervised learning of input transformation and regression, the neural network captures the discontinuity in the reduced 2D feature space for both MLP and KAN."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: DKL-KAN improves uncertainty estimation in low-data regions by increasing epistemic uncertainty where training data is sparse.
- Mechanism: The adaptive activation functions in KANs allow the model to more accurately represent the complexity of the data, leading to better separation between aleatory (data) and epistemic (model) uncertainty. This results in higher epistemic uncertainty in unobserved regions, reflecting model uncertainty more faithfully.
- Core assumption: The Gaussian process layer accurately propagates uncertainty from the deep kernel, and the deep network does not overfit to training data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "DKL-KAN exhibits increasing epistemic uncertainty in regions where training data is not present."
  - [section]: "In contrast, DKL-KAN exhibits increasing epistemic uncertainty in regions where training data is not present. The behavior of DKL-MLP with respect to uncertainty bounds is not ideal..."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: For large datasets, DKL-MLP scales better than DKL-KAN due to computational efficiency and parameter sharing.
- Mechanism: DKL-MLP uses fixed linear weights, which are computationally cheaper and more memory-efficient than KAN's learnable activation functions. This allows DKL-MLP to handle more data points and larger architectures without prohibitive computational cost.
- Core assumption: Computational cost and memory usage are the primary bottlenecks for scaling deep kernel methods.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Conversely, DKL-MLP exhibits better scalability and higher test prediction accuracy on datasets with large number of observations."
  - [section]: "However, we do see DKL-KAN1 outperform all other GP models for ctslice dataset."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Gaussian Processes (GPs) and kernel methods
  - Why needed here: DKL builds on GPs; understanding kernels, marginal likelihood, and uncertainty quantification is essential to grasp how deep kernels extend GP expressiveness.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the kernel function in a GP, and how does it relate to similarity between data points?

- Concept: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and universal approximation
  - Why needed here: DKL uses a DNN to transform inputs before applying the GP kernel; understanding how DNNs learn representations and the universal approximation theorem explains why deep kernels can capture complex patterns.
  - Quick check question: How does a deep neural network enable a GP to model non-smooth or anisotropic functions?

- Concept: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and learnable activation functions
  - Why needed here: KANs replace fixed linear weights with learnable univariate functions, which is the key architectural innovation being tested in DKL-KAN.
  - Quick check question: How do KANs differ from MLPs in terms of function approximation and interpretability?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input -> KAN (or MLP) -> Reduced feature space -> GP kernel -> Output

- Critical path:
  1. Transform inputs with KAN (or MLP)
  2. Apply GP kernel to transformed features
  3. Optimize marginal likelihood jointly over kernel and network parameters

- Design tradeoffs:
  - KANs: More expressive, better for discontinuities, higher computational cost
  - MLPs: Faster, better scalability, fixed linear weights
  - KISS-GP vs SKIP: Dimensionality determines scalability strategy

- Failure signatures:
  - Overfitting: KANs too expressive for small datasets, poor generalization
  - Underfitting: Insufficient network capacity to capture data complexity
  - Poor uncertainty: GP fails to inflate epistemic uncertainty in data-sparse regions

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train DKL-KAN1 and DKL-MLP on a small UCI dataset (e.g., Solar); compare RMSE and uncertainty estimates.
  2. Train both models on a large UCI dataset (e.g., Kin40k); compare training time and test accuracy.
  3. Evaluate both models on a synthetic step function; visualize predictive mean and uncertainty bands.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do DKL-KAN models compare to other advanced neural network architectures like transformers or graph neural networks in terms of scalability and performance on large datasets?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that DKL-KAN performs better on smaller datasets but DKL-MLP shows better scalability and accuracy on larger datasets, indicating a need for comparison with other advanced architectures.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on comparing DKL-KAN with DKL-MLP but does not explore comparisons with other advanced architectures that are known for handling large datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing DKL-KAN with transformers and graph neural networks on various large-scale datasets, evaluating both computational efficiency and predictive accuracy.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the theoretical limits of KANs in approximating complex functions, and how do these limits compare to those of MLPs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem as the foundation for KANs, but does not delve into theoretical limits or compare these limits with MLPs.

- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies using various activation functions in KANs, including splines, B-splines, and other alternatives, across diverse datasets to determine their effects on performance and interpretability.

## Limitations

- Limited theoretical analysis: The paper lacks detailed theoretical analysis of KANs' approximation capabilities compared to MLPs
- Narrow dataset scope: Evaluation focuses primarily on UCI datasets, which may not fully represent real-world complexities

## Confidence

- Low confidence in generalizability beyond UCI datasets without additional validation

## Next Checks

1. Conduct controlled experiments varying KAN depth and width to identify optimal architectures and understand overfitting risks
2. Implement memory and time complexity analysis comparing DKL-KAN vs DKL-MLP across varying dataset sizes and dimensions
3. Test on non-UCI datasets with known discontinuities and noise characteristics to validate real-world applicability
