# Understanding Fairness in Recommender Systems: A Healthcare Perspective

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.03893
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03893
- Authors: Veronica Kecki; Alan Said
- Reference count: 23
- Key outcome: Participants prefer accuracy-focused fairness metrics over equality-focused ones in healthcare scenarios, with no consensus on a single fairness metric.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates public understanding of fairness in healthcare recommender systems through a survey examining preferences for four fairness metrics across high-stakes (ICU allocation) and low-stakes (vitamin deficiency screening) healthcare scenarios. The research reveals that participants generally prefer accuracy-focused metrics (Equal Accuracy, Equalized Odds) over equality-focused ones (Demographic Parity), with preferences showing context-dependency based on scenario stakes. A significant portion of participants (21%) selected "N/A" when choosing metrics, indicating limited understanding of fairness concepts. The findings suggest that fairness perceptions are complex and context-dependent, highlighting the need for improved public education on algorithmic fairness and context-sensitive approaches to fairness in AI systems.

## Method Summary
The study employed an online survey distributed through social media channels to higher education sector contacts, collecting 131 responses. Participants were presented with two healthcare scenarios (high-stakes ICU allocation and low-stakes vitamin deficiency screening) and asked to choose between four algorithmic fairness metrics: Demographic Parity, Equal Accuracy, Equalized Odds, and Positive Predictive Value. The survey design was based on previous research but adapted for the survey context, with scenarios converted to represent different stake levels. Data was collected via Google Forms and analyzed to identify preference patterns and understanding levels of fairness concepts.

## Key Results
- Accuracy-focused metrics (Equal Accuracy, Equalized Odds) were preferred over equality-focused metrics (Demographic Parity) in both scenarios
- 34% chose Equalized Odds in the high-stakes scenario while 35% chose Equal Accuracy in the low-stakes scenario
- Only 11-14% selected the equality-focused Demographic Parity metric
- 21% of participants selected "N/A - I do not understand the options," indicating limited comprehension of fairness metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Context-sensitive fairness preferences emerge when participants are presented with contrasting high-stakes versus low-stakes healthcare scenarios.
- Mechanism: By structuring survey questions to vary the perceived gravity of healthcare decisions, the study reveals that participants' fairness metric preferences shift systematically based on scenario stakes. This occurs because participants implicitly weigh the consequences of errors differently in life-threatening versus routine medical contexts.
- Core assumption: Participants accurately perceive the relative stakes of scenarios and adjust their fairness preferences accordingly.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our findings reveal that fairness is a complex and often misunderstood concept, with a generally low level of public understanding regarding fairness metrics in recommender systems."
  - [section] "The high-stake condition in Scenario 1 was identical to [ 8], whereas the condition in Scenario 2 was adapted for the survey and converted into a low-stake condition."
  - [corpus] Corpus evidence weak - no direct support found for scenario-based fairness preference shifts.
- Break condition: If participants cannot distinguish between scenario stakes or if their choices remain constant regardless of scenario context.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Accuracy-focused fairness metrics are preferred over equality-focused metrics in healthcare contexts, regardless of stakes.
- Mechanism: Participants consistently choose metrics that optimize for correct outcomes (Equal Accuracy, Equalized Odds) rather than those ensuring equal representation (Demographic Parity), indicating that accuracy is prioritized when health outcomes are involved.
- Core assumption: Participants understand that accuracy directly impacts health outcomes and therefore value it more highly than equality metrics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our findings reveal that fairness is a complex and often misunderstood concept, with a generally low level of public understanding regarding fairness metrics in recommender systems."
  - [section] "The results indicate a trend of participants preferring accuracy over equality, regardless of the scenario's stakes."
  - [corpus] "Why it's so damn hard to make AI fair and unbiased" supports the general difficulty in balancing fairness and accuracy.
- Break condition: If participants consistently choose equality-focused metrics or if accuracy does not correlate with perceived fairness in healthcare.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Lack of consensus on fairness metrics indicates that fairness is inherently subjective and context-dependent.
- Mechanism: The distribution of preferences across multiple fairness metrics, with no single metric achieving majority support, demonstrates that individuals weigh different aspects of fairness differently based on personal values and contextual understanding.
- Core assumption: Participants have diverse backgrounds and value systems that influence their interpretation of fairness.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "These findings reveal that fairness perceptions are complex and context-dependent, with no single metric achieving universal acceptance."
  - [section] "While accuracy is favored in both scenarios, the specific preferences for Equal Accuracy and Equalized Odds reflect nuanced differences in how participants perceive fairness in healthcare contexts."
  - [corpus] Corpus evidence weak - no direct support found for subjective fairness preferences.
- Break condition: If a clear majority consistently prefers one fairness metric across all contexts and scenarios.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Fairness metrics in machine learning (Demographic Parity, Equal Accuracy, Equalized Odds, Positive Predictive Value)
  - Why needed here: Understanding these specific metrics is essential for interpreting participant choices and the study's conclusions about public fairness perceptions.
  - Quick check question: What is the fundamental difference between equality-focused metrics (like Demographic Parity) and accuracy-focused metrics (like Equal Accuracy)?

- Concept: Trade-offs between different fairness definitions
  - Why needed here: The study demonstrates that improving one fairness metric typically worsens another, which is crucial for understanding why participants struggle to reach consensus.
  - Quick check question: Why is it impossible to optimize for all fairness metrics simultaneously in algorithmic decision-making?

- Concept: Context sensitivity in fairness perception
  - Why needed here: The study's main finding is that fairness preferences vary based on the stakes of the healthcare scenario, requiring understanding of how context influences ethical decision-making.
  - Quick check question: How might a person's fairness preference change between a life-threatening ICU allocation scenario versus a routine vitamin deficiency screening?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Survey distribution system -> Participant responses -> Data cleaning -> Statistical analysis -> Result interpretation
- Critical path: Survey distribution → Participant responses → Data cleaning → Statistical analysis → Result interpretation
- Design tradeoffs: Large sample size vs. detailed understanding (surveys vs. interviews), standardization vs. context richness (fixed scenarios vs. open-ended), breadth vs. depth (multiple metrics vs. focused analysis)
- Failure signatures: Low response rates, misunderstanding of fairness metrics (high "N/A" selections), inconsistent preferences across similar scenarios, demographic bias in responses
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test survey comprehension by running a pilot with 20 participants and measuring metric understanding through follow-up questions
  2. Validate scenario stakes by having participants rate the relative importance of each scenario before making fairness choices
  3. Check demographic effects by analyzing whether preferences vary significantly across age, gender, or professional backgrounds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does public perception of fairness in healthcare recommender systems vary across different demographic groups (age, gender, socioeconomic status)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The study collected demographic data (age, gender, geographic location) but did not analyze how these factors influenced fairness preferences.
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions demographic diversity in the sample but does not provide analysis of how different groups might perceive fairness differently.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis of fairness preferences segmented by demographic variables would reveal whether certain groups have systematically different fairness priorities.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Would providing participants with more detailed explanations of fairness metrics change their preferences?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The study notes that 21% selected "N/A - I do not understand the options" and acknowledges that participants had limited prior knowledge of fairness metrics.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges comprehension issues but doesn't test whether better explanations would lead to different choices.
- What evidence would resolve it: A follow-up study where participants receive comprehensive education about fairness metrics before making their selections would show if understanding influences preferences.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do fairness preferences change when participants face scenarios with different resource constraints or availability?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The study contrasts high-stakes and low-stakes scenarios but doesn't explore how varying resource availability (e.g., limited vs. abundant resources) affects fairness perceptions.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests two fixed scenarios without varying the underlying resource constraints that might influence fairness decisions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the same fairness metrics across scenarios with different resource availability levels would reveal whether scarcity affects fairness preferences.

## Limitations

- Sample Representativeness: The 131 responses were collected primarily from the higher education sector through social media channels, with 76% from Sweden, limiting generalizability to broader populations.
- Conceptual Understanding: The study doesn't explicitly measure baseline understanding before presenting choices, raising questions about whether responses reflect genuine preferences or reactions to metric descriptions.
- Scenario Fidelity: The conversion of the ICU allocation scenario to a "low-stakes" vitamin deficiency screening scenario may not maintain the same decision-making complexity, potentially confounding the comparison between high and low-stakes conditions.

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The finding that accuracy-focused metrics are preferred over equality-focused metrics is well-supported by the data with consistent patterns across both scenarios.
- Medium Confidence: The claim that fairness preferences are context-dependent and that no single metric achieves universal acceptance is supported by the data distribution but may be influenced by sample limitations.
- Low Confidence: The assertion that fairness is "often misunderstood" and that improved public education is needed is based on limited evidence about actual comprehension versus simple preference variation.

## Next Checks

1. **Baseline Understanding Assessment**: Conduct a pre-survey comprehension test to measure participants' understanding of fairness metrics before presenting scenario choices, to distinguish between genuine preference patterns and comprehension limitations.

2. **Cross-Cultural Validation**: Replicate the study with diverse demographic samples across different countries and socioeconomic backgrounds to test whether the observed preference patterns hold beyond the Swedish higher education context.

3. **Decision-Making Complexity Analysis**: Design follow-up experiments varying the complexity and stakes of healthcare scenarios while controlling for other variables to isolate the specific contextual factors that drive fairness metric preferences.
