# On the Fly Detection of Root Causes from Observed Data with Application to IT Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.06500
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06500
- Reference count: 23
- T-RCA algorithm demonstrates superior performance in detecting root causes of anomalies in threshold-based IT systems

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces T-RCA, a novel algorithm for on-the-fly detection of root causes in threshold-based IT systems. The method combines causal discovery from offline data with subgraph traversal for online anomaly detection. T-RCA leverages a new structural causal model tailored for IT systems and achieves high F1-scores on both simulated and real monitoring data, outperforming alternative approaches in root cause analysis.

## Method Summary
The T-RCA algorithm employs a two-phase approach to root cause analysis. In the offline phase, it learns causal relationships from historical data using causal discovery techniques. During online operation, when anomalies are detected, the algorithm performs subgraph traversal to identify potential root causes based on the learned causal structure. The method includes an agent-based extension to handle cases where root causes may be causally related. The algorithm is designed specifically for threshold-based IT systems and integrates anomaly detection with causal inference.

## Key Results
- T-RCA achieves high F1-scores in root cause detection on both simulated and real IT monitoring data
- The algorithm outperforms alternative methods in identifying root causes of anomalies
- Performance remains strong even when applied to data generated from alternative models
- The agent-based extension successfully relaxes the assumption of non-causal relationships between root causes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithm works by first learning the causal structure of the IT system from historical data, then using this structure to efficiently navigate through potential causes when anomalies occur. By focusing on threshold-based systems, it can exploit specific characteristics of these systems to improve detection accuracy. The combination of offline causal discovery with online subgraph traversal allows for real-time root cause analysis while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Foundational Learning
- Causal Discovery: Learning causal relationships from observational data; needed to build the initial causal graph; quick check: verify learned structure matches known relationships in synthetic data
- Subgraph Traversal: Efficient navigation through causal graphs to identify root causes; needed for real-time analysis; quick check: measure traversal time vs graph size
- Threshold-based Systems: Systems with defined operational thresholds; needed for model assumptions; quick check: validate threshold definitions against system specifications
- Agent-based Extension: Distributed approach to handle causally related root causes; needed to relax model assumptions; quick check: test performance with multiple interacting root causes

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Historical Data -> Causal Discovery -> Causal Graph -> Anomaly Detection -> Subgraph Traversal -> Root Cause Identification

Critical Path: Anomaly Detection triggers Subgraph Traversal which uses Causal Graph to identify Root Causes

Design Tradeoffs: The method prioritizes accuracy over computational efficiency by performing detailed subgraph traversal, but this is balanced by the offline learning phase which reduces online computation requirements.

Failure Signatures: Poor causal discovery leads to incorrect root cause identification; noisy anomaly detection can trigger unnecessary traversals; complex causal relationships may exceed agent-based extension capabilities.

First Experiments:
1. Test T-RCA on a simple synthetic IT system with known root causes to verify basic functionality
2. Evaluate performance degradation as the number of monitored components increases
3. Compare detection accuracy when root causes are causally related vs independent

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Assumption of non-causal relationships between root causes, partially addressed by agent-based extension
- Reliance on threshold-based systems may limit applicability to other IT architectures
- Experimental validation based on specific systems may not generalize to all IT infrastructures
- Limited comparison with state-of-the-art methods in terms of computational efficiency

## Confidence
- High confidence in algorithm design and basic functionality
- Medium confidence in experimental results given limited validation scope
- Low confidence in performance on diverse real-world scenarios due to limited testing

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate T-RCA's performance on IT systems with complex causal relationships between potential root causes to validate the agent-based extension
2. Conduct a scalability analysis to assess the algorithm's performance on large-scale IT infrastructures with hundreds or thousands of monitored components
3. Compare T-RCA's computational efficiency and resource usage against other state-of-the-art causal discovery methods in real-time anomaly detection scenarios
