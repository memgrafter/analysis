# GraphKAN: Enhancing Feature Extraction with Graph Kolmogorov Arnold Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.13597
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13597
- Reference count: 6
- First application of KANs to GNNs, improving feature extraction on node classification

## Executive Summary
GraphKAN introduces the first application of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to graph neural networks (GNNs) for enhanced feature extraction. By replacing traditional MLPs and fixed activation functions with learnable spline-based univariate functions along network edges, GraphKAN addresses information loss and poor scaling issues in conventional GNNs. The method demonstrates superior performance on node classification tasks using real-world temporal signal data from axial-flow pump monitoring, achieving higher accuracy especially in few-shot classification scenarios.

## Method Summary
GraphKAN replaces traditional MLPs and fixed activation functions in GNNs with KANs, which utilize learnable spline-based univariate functions along network edges. This approach aims to capture more complex feature representations while reducing information loss. The method was evaluated on a node classification task using temporal signal data from axial-flow pump monitoring, comparing against a standard GCN baseline to demonstrate improved feature extraction capabilities.

## Key Results
- Achieved higher test accuracy than GCN baseline: 89.3% vs 83.7% in BG_3, 87.1% vs 81.5% in BG_4
- Maintained manageable time consumption under one minute
- Produced better-clustered intermediate features in t-SNE visualizations, indicating superior feature extraction

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
GraphKAN's mechanism leverages learnable spline-based univariate functions instead of fixed activations and MLPs, allowing the network to adaptively learn optimal transformations along edges. This flexibility enables better capture of complex feature relationships in graph data, reducing information loss during propagation. The spline-based approach provides smooth, continuous transformations that can better model the underlying data distribution compared to discrete activation functions.

## Foundational Learning
- Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs): Why needed - provide adaptive, learnable transformations instead of fixed activations; Quick check - verify spline parameters are updated during training
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): Why needed - handle graph-structured data effectively; Quick check - confirm message passing operates correctly on graph topology
- Spline-based functions: Why needed - offer smooth, continuous transformations for better feature representation; Quick check - validate spline interpolation accuracy and stability

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Input -> Graph Structure -> KAN Layers -> Output Layer

**Critical Path**
Data preprocessing → Graph construction → KAN layer processing → Classification output

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Advantage: Adaptive feature transformations improve accuracy
- Disadvantage: Increased computational complexity and potential numerical instability
- Balance: Managed by keeping training time under one minute

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor accuracy with fixed activations
- Numerical instability in spline calculations
- Overfitting with insufficient regularization

**3 First Experiments**
1. Verify basic forward pass through KAN layers
2. Compare accuracy with standard GCN baseline
3. Test with varying numbers of labeled nodes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to single real-world application (axial-flow pump monitoring)
- Performance gains only demonstrated on node classification task
- Comparison against only one baseline (GCN) without ablation studies

## Confidence
High: Specific accuracy improvements over GCN baseline are clearly demonstrated
Medium: Broader claims about KANs enhancing GNNs generally, due to limited task and dataset diversity
Medium: Clustering visualization findings, as they are qualitative observations

## Next Checks
1. Test GraphKAN on diverse GNN benchmarks (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed) and tasks (link prediction, graph classification) to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing KAN-based layers against standard MLPs with various activation functions within the same architecture
3. Perform runtime and memory profiling on graphs of varying sizes and densities to quantify scalability and computational overhead
