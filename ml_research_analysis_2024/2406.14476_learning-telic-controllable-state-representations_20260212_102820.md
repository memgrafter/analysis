- Primary result: Introduces telic-controllability framework for learning state representations that balance goal flexibility and policy complexity in bounded agents.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a computational framework for learning state representations in bounded agents, where the descriptive and prescriptive aspects of purposeful behavior are coupled through goal-directed telic states. The key contribution is the concept of telic-controllability, which characterizes the tradeoff between the granularity of a telic state representation and the policy complexity required to reach all telic states. The authors propose an algorithm for learning telic-controllable state representations and demonstrate it using a simulated navigation task.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a framework where an agent learns state representations that are "telic-controllable" - meaning the representation allows the agent to reach all desired telic states (goal configurations) with bounded computational resources. The algorithm learns a mapping from the underlying state space to telic states, balancing the granularity of the representation against the complexity of the resulting policy. The framework uses a measure of controllability to quantify how well the learned representation enables reaching all telic states, and optimizes this measure while penalizing excessive policy complexity.

## Key Results
- Demonstrates that agents can adaptively adjust their state representations when goals change, enabling efficient policy generation under bounded computational resources
- Shows that deliberate ignorance—knowing what to ignore—is crucial for learning state representations that balance goal flexibility and cognitive complexity
- Validates the framework through a simulated navigation task, demonstrating the tradeoff between telic state granularity and policy complexity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by explicitly modeling the relationship between state representations and goal-directed behavior. By treating telic states as the interface between perception and action, the agent can learn representations that are optimized for goal achievement rather than environmental fidelity. The controllability measure ensures that the learned representation maintains sufficient information to reach all desired goals while the complexity penalty prevents the agent from creating unnecessarily fine-grained representations that would require excessive computational resources.

## Foundational Learning
- Telic states: Purpose-driven states that represent goal configurations; needed to bridge descriptive and prescriptive aspects of behavior
- Telic controllability: Measure of how well a state representation enables reaching all telic states; needed to quantify the representation-policy tradeoff
- Bounded rationality: Computational constraints on agent decision-making; needed to justify the complexity penalty in the optimization
- Goal-directed behavior: Actions taken to achieve specific objectives; needed to define the telic states and evaluation criteria
- State abstraction: Process of mapping detailed states to more abstract representations; needed to understand how information is preserved or discarded

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Environment -> State abstraction function -> Telic state representation -> Policy -> Actions
**Critical path**: The learning algorithm iteratively adjusts the state abstraction function to maximize controllability while minimizing policy complexity
**Design tradeoffs**: Granularity vs. complexity tradeoff; representation fidelity vs. computational efficiency; flexibility vs. specificity
**Failure signatures**: 
- Local optima in the learning algorithm where the agent settles for suboptimal representations
- Over-abstraction leading to inability to distinguish between telic states
- Under-abstraction resulting in excessive policy complexity
- Failure to adapt representations when goal distributions change significantly

**First experiments**:
1. Simple grid-world navigation with varying numbers of goals to test adaptability
2. Navigation task with dynamic goal addition/removal to test representation flexibility
3. Comparison with baseline state abstraction methods on identical tasks to validate performance gains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided in the source material.

## Limitations
- Computational tractability concerns in high-dimensional environments, as demonstrated only on simple navigation tasks
- Lack of rigorous empirical validation across diverse domains and environments
- Uncertainty about scaling when the number of telic states grows exponentially or in continuous action spaces
- Underspecified criteria for distinguishing useful ignorance from harmful information loss
- No convergence guarantees or analysis of local optima issues in the proposed learning algorithm

## Confidence
- Theoretical framework soundness: High
- Empirical validation across domains: Medium
- Scalability analysis: Low
- Algorithmic convergence guarantees: Low
- Relationship between granularity and complexity: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on high-dimensional environments with continuous state spaces to evaluate scalability and computational tractability
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the impact of different levels of telic state granularity on policy performance across varying environmental complexities
3. Implement the framework with different goal-switching scenarios to assess the robustness of adaptive state representation adjustment
