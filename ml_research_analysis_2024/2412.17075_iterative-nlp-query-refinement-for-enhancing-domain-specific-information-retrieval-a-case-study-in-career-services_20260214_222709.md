# Iterative NLP Query Refinement for Enhancing Domain-Specific Information Retrieval: A Case Study in Career Services

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.17075
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17075
- Reference count: 2
- Low retrieval performance in domain-specific information retrieval using TF-IDF models was improved by iterative, semi-automated query refinement, increasing average top similarity scores from ~0.18 to 0.42.

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of low retrieval performance in domain-specific information retrieval using traditional TF-IDF models, where generic queries yield poor semantic matches. The authors propose an iterative, semi-automated query refinement method that incorporates domain-specific terms and structured descriptors extracted from top-ranked documents. Tested on five career services queries, this approach significantly improved average top similarity scores from approximately 0.18 to 0.42, with statistical significance confirmed (p = 0.0422). The method enhances query relevance without requiring complex neural models, making it practical for resource-constrained environments.

## Method Summary
The proposed method implements an iterative, semi-automated query refinement process for domain-specific information retrieval. Starting with generic user queries, the system extracts domain-specific terms and structured descriptors from top-ranked documents in initial retrieval results. These extracted terms are then used to refine and expand the original query iteratively. The approach leverages TF-IDF as the underlying retrieval model, making it computationally efficient and suitable for environments with limited resources. The refinement process continues until convergence or a predefined threshold is met, with the goal of improving semantic matching between queries and relevant documents in specialized domains like career services.

## Key Results
- Average top similarity scores increased from ~0.18 to 0.42 using iterative query refinement
- Statistical significance confirmed with p-value of 0.0422
- Method demonstrated effectiveness on five career services queries without requiring neural models
- Practical implementation suitable for resource-constrained environments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by iteratively incorporating domain-specific vocabulary that emerges from analyzing top-ranked documents in initial retrieval results. Traditional TF-IDF models struggle with domain-specific queries because they rely on exact term matching rather than semantic understanding. By extracting and integrating specialized terminology from relevant documents back into the query, the system effectively bridges the semantic gap between generic user language and domain-specific document content. This semi-automated refinement process leverages the inherent structure and terminology of the target domain to create more contextually appropriate queries that better match the specialized vocabulary used in relevant documents.

## Foundational Learning
- **TF-IDF Vector Space Model**: Fundamental to understanding how traditional retrieval works and why it fails with domain-specific queries - quick check: can you explain why "career counseling" might not retrieve relevant documents without domain adaptation?
- **Semantic Gap in Information Retrieval**: The disconnect between user query language and document vocabulary that causes poor retrieval performance - quick check: identify examples where users and documents use different terminology for the same concept.
- **Iterative Refinement Strategies**: The concept of using retrieval results to improve subsequent queries - quick check: can you outline how feedback loops work in information retrieval systems?
- **Domain-Specific Terminology Extraction**: Methods for identifying specialized vocabulary from text corpora - quick check: describe how you would extract domain-specific terms from a set of documents.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
User Query -> Initial TF-IDF Retrieval -> Top Document Analysis -> Term Extraction -> Query Refinement -> Enhanced TF-IDF Retrieval

**Critical Path:**
The critical path follows the iterative cycle: initial query processing, document retrieval, top document analysis for domain terms, query expansion, and re-retrieval. Each iteration depends on successful completion of the previous step, with convergence occurring when similarity scores stabilize or improvement plateaus.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The approach trades computational complexity for improved relevance by avoiding neural models while accepting potentially slower convergence through multiple refinement iterations. This makes it suitable for resource-constrained environments but may require more processing time compared to single-pass neural approaches.

**Failure Signatures:**
Poor performance manifests as: (1) minimal similarity score improvement across iterations, (2) extracted terms not representing true domain vocabulary, or (3) query expansion introducing noise rather than relevance. Monitoring similarity score trajectories helps identify these failure modes early.

**First Experiments:**
1. Run baseline TF-IDF retrieval on a set of domain-specific queries and record initial similarity scores
2. Implement top document term extraction and test on sample documents to verify domain vocabulary identification
3. Execute single iteration of query refinement and measure similarity score improvement to validate the refinement mechanism

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to single domain (career services) and small set of five queries, raising generalizability concerns
- TF-IDF baseline may not reflect current state-of-the-art retrieval performance compared to neural approaches
- Practical impact on end-user satisfaction remains unclear without user studies or task-completion metrics

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Statistical significance of improvement (p = 0.0422) and measured similarity score increases are well-documented and reproducible
- **Medium Confidence**: The practical impact of 0.24 average similarity score improvement on actual information retrieval tasks remains unclear
- **Medium Confidence**: Assumption that domain-specific terms from top documents consistently improve relevance may not hold for all query types

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the experiment across multiple domain-specific corpora (e.g., legal, medical, technical documentation) to assess generalizability
2. Compare performance against neural retrieval models (e.g., BERT-based retrievers) to establish relative effectiveness
3. Conduct user studies measuring actual task completion rates and satisfaction scores to validate whether similarity improvements translate to meaningful user experience gains
