# Red Teaming Visual Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.12915
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12915
- Reference count: 22
- Key outcome: RTVLM dataset exposes VLM vulnerabilities, showing up to 31% performance gap with GPT-4V; red teaming alignment improves performance by 10-13% without harming downstream tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces RTVLM, the first comprehensive red teaming dataset for visual language models (VLMs), targeting vulnerabilities across faithfulness, privacy, safety, and fairness dimensions. The authors demonstrate that prominent open-sourced VLMs struggle significantly with red teaming challenges, showing up to 31% performance gaps compared to GPT-4V. They also show that applying red teaming alignment through supervised fine-tuning with RTVLM data improves model robustness without degrading performance on standard benchmarks.

## Method Summary
The authors constructed RTVLM through human annotation and GPT-4 self-instruct generation, creating 5,200 samples across 10 subtasks. They evaluated VLMs using GPT-4V as an evaluator with detailed scoring criteria. For alignment experiments, they applied supervised fine-tuning to LLaVA-v1.5 using RTVLM data with GPT-4V's answers as supervision. The evaluation measured performance on RTVLM test set, MM-Hal, and MM-Bench to assess improvements in red teaming capabilities while maintaining general performance.

## Key Results
- 10 prominent open-sourced VLMs show up to 31% performance gap compared to GPT-4V on RTVLM
- Red teaming alignment via RTVLM boosts LLaVA-v1.5 performance by 10% on RTVLM test set and 13% on MM-Hal
- No performance degradation observed on MM-Bench after alignment fine-tuning
- GPT-4V serves as reliable evaluator with high agreement with human annotators

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: RTVLM exposes VLM vulnerabilities through multi-dimensional red teaming
- Mechanism: Dataset construction combines human annotation and GPT-4 self-instruct generation to create novel question-image pairs that probe specific failure modes across faithfulness, privacy, safety, and fairness dimensions
- Core assumption: VLMs trained on standard datasets will struggle with carefully crafted adversarial inputs not present in their training data
- Evidence anchors: 31% performance gap between open-sourced VLMs and GPT-4V; all 10 tested VLMs exhibit varying degrees of struggle
- Break condition: If VLMs are trained on comprehensive red teaming datasets similar to RTVLM, they would show significantly reduced performance gaps

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Red teaming alignment using RTVLM improves VLM performance without harming downstream tasks
- Mechanism: Fine-tuning LLaVA-v1.5 with RTVLM data teaches the model to better handle red teaming scenarios including refusing harmful requests and interpreting misleading inputs
- Core assumption: Targeted red teaming data can teach VLMs to handle adversarial scenarios while maintaining general capabilities
- Evidence anchors: 10% improvement on RTVLM test set, 13% on MM-Hal, no degradation on MM-Bench
- Break condition: If fine-tuning overfits to RTVLM-specific patterns, it might harm generalization or fail to generalize to new red teaming scenarios

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: GPT-4V serves as reliable evaluator for VLM red teaming performance
- Mechanism: Detailed scoring criteria and prompts enable GPT-4V to consistently assess VLM responses across 4 dimensions
- Core assumption: GPT-4V's superior performance makes it a good reference point, and its evaluation aligns well with human judgment
- Evidence anchors: High agreement between human and GPT-4/GPT-4V evaluations; follows established evaluation practices
- Break condition: If GPT-4V has its own biases or blind spots, it might not be a reliable reference point

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Red teaming methodology
  - Why needed here: Understanding red teaming is crucial for grasping why RTVLM was designed to test specific failure modes and how to interpret results
  - Quick check question: What's the difference between traditional testing and red teaming when evaluating AI models?

- Concept: Multi-modal adversarial examples
  - Why needed here: RTVLM targets vulnerabilities from text-vision combinations, requiring understanding of adversarial examples in multi-modal contexts
  - Quick check question: Why might VLMs be more vulnerable to certain types of attacks compared to pure text-based models?

- Concept: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for alignment
  - Why needed here: The alignment experiments rely on SFT with RTVLM data, essential for interpreting results and implementing similar approaches
  - Quick check question: How does SFT differ from other alignment techniques like RLHF in terms of what it can teach a model?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data collection (human annotation + GPT-4 self-instruct) → Dataset creation → Model evaluation (GPT-4V/GPT-4) → Alignment fine-tuning (SFT + LoRA) → Re-evaluation (MMBench, MM-Hal, RTVLM)
- Critical path: Data collection → Dataset creation → Model evaluation → Alignment fine-tuning → Re-evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Balances comprehensive coverage with practical size for fine-tuning; uses GPT-4V supervision for quality but may introduce bias
- Failure signatures: Poor RTVLM performance but good on other benchmarks suggests lack of red teaming alignment; large performance gaps indicate varying robustness
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate a VLM on RTVLM test set to establish baseline performance
  2. Fine-tune the same VLM with RTVLM data using SFT
  3. Re-evaluate on both RTVLM test set and downstream benchmarks to measure improvement and check for performance degradation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we develop more effective methods for red teaming visual language models (VLMs)?
- Basis in paper: RTVLM is presented as a first step, but current VLMs still lack red teaming alignment, suggesting need for more effective methods
- Why unresolved: Paper presents RTVLM as initial approach but doesn't provide comprehensive solution for advanced red teaming techniques
- What evidence would resolve it: New red teaming methods that significantly improve VLM robustness against multimodal jailbreaking, visual misleading, and privacy breaches

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we ensure fairness and reduce biases in VLMs across different demographics, especially underrepresented groups?
- Basis in paper: Paper identifies biases in VLMs particularly around race and gender, with darker-skinned and Native American groups scoring lower
- Why unresolved: While biases are identified, comprehensive solutions for ensuring fairness across demographics are not provided
- What evidence would resolve it: Extensive experiments evaluating fairness across diverse demographics and effective bias mitigation techniques

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we enhance privacy protection capabilities of VLMs to prevent disclosure of sensitive information?
- Basis in paper: Open-source VLMs often fail to refuse answering questions about personal information, while GPT-4V demonstrates better privacy protection
- Why unresolved: Need for comprehensive solutions to enhance privacy protection capabilities is identified but not fully addressed
- What evidence would resolve it: New privacy protection methods that significantly improve VLMs' ability to identify and refuse answering questions about sensitive personal information

## Limitations

- Heavy reliance on GPT-4V as evaluator with incomplete specification of evaluation prompts and scoring criteria
- Potential bias from using GPT-4V's answers as supervision in alignment experiments
- 31% performance gap may be influenced by factors beyond red teaming capabilities (architecture, training data differences)
- Limited analysis of whether improvements generalize to unseen red teaming scenarios

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Existence of performance gaps between open-sourced VLMs and GPT-4V on RTVLM; effectiveness of SFT with RTVLM data in improving performance on both RTVLM and MM-Hal benchmarks

**Medium Confidence**: Reliability of GPT-4V as evaluator for red teaming tasks; claim that red teaming alignment improves robustness without harming downstream performance

**Low Confidence**: Generalizability of RTVLM findings to real-world scenarios; long-term effectiveness of alignment approach against evolving adversarial techniques

## Next Checks

1. **Evaluation Protocol Replication**: Conduct human-only evaluation of VLM responses on RTVLM using same scoring criteria to verify agreement rates with GPT-4V evaluation and assess potential evaluator bias

2. **Generalization Test**: Evaluate alignment-enhanced models on separate red teaming dataset (not RTVLM) to determine if improvements are due to genuine robustness or overfitting to RTVLM-specific patterns

3. **Adversarial Attack Analysis**: Design and apply adversarial attacks specifically targeting RTVLM dataset and evaluation process to assess dataset vulnerability to manipulation and robustness of evaluation methodology
