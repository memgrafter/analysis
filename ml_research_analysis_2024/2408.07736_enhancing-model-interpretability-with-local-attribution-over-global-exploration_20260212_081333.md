core_contribution: The paper addresses the problem of model interpretability in AI,
  where current attribution methods often assign intermediate states to spaces not
  contributing to attribution results, leading to attribution errors. The authors
  introduce the concept of local spaces, where attribution is valid and precise, and
  propose the Local Attribution (LA) method.

# Enhancing Model Interpretability with Local Attribution over Global Exploration

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2408.07736
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07736
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** LA method improves Insertion Score by 38.21% and reduces Deletion Score by 11.52% compared to state-of-the-art attribution methods.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical limitation in model interpretability: attribution methods often assign importance to regions that don't contribute to predictions when intermediate states fall out-of-distribution (OOD). The authors introduce Local Attribution (LA), a method that constrains attribution within defined "local spaces" where intermediate states remain in-distribution. By combining targeted and untargeted adversarial attacks, LA ensures that attribution results reflect the actual decision-making process of the model. The method is mathematically rigorous, with proofs demonstrating compliance with attribution axioms, and shows significant performance improvements across multiple CNN architectures.

## Method Summary
The Local Attribution method addresses attribution errors by defining local spaces where intermediate states remain in-distribution and attribution is valid. LA combines targeted adversarial attacks (selecting categories other than the most probable) with untargeted attacks to explore the local space while maintaining distributional constraints. The method introduces an exploration function that ensures transformed samples stay within the defined local space (ε-Local Space). This approach prevents attribution from being assigned to regions that don't actually contribute to the model's prediction, addressing a fundamental flaw in existing attribution methods. The paper provides detailed mathematical derivations proving LA's compliance with attribution axioms and demonstrates its effectiveness through extensive experiments on ImageNet.

## Key Results
- LA achieves an average 38.21% improvement in Insertion Score across four CNN models compared to state-of-the-art methods
- Deletion Score is reduced by 11.52% on average, indicating better localization of important features
- LA outperforms 11 baseline attribution methods in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations
- The method shows consistent improvements across different model architectures including Inception-v3, ResNet-50, VGG16, and MaxViT-T

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
LA works by ensuring that attribution analysis occurs within local spaces where intermediate states remain in-distribution. When attribution methods explore the input space globally, they often encounter regions where the model's behavior is undefined or unreliable, leading to incorrect attribution. By constraining exploration through adversarial attacks while maintaining local space constraints, LA ensures that each intermediate state contributes meaningfully to the attribution result. The combination of targeted attacks (to explore relevant directions) and untargeted attacks (to ensure comprehensive coverage) allows LA to capture the true decision boundaries within the local space.

## Foundational Learning
- **Local Attribution Spaces**: Regions in input space where intermediate states remain in-distribution and model behavior is reliable - needed to ensure attribution validity and can be verified by checking KL divergence between transformed samples and original distribution.
- **Adversarial Attacks in Attribution**: Using adversarial examples not to fool the model but to explore local decision boundaries systematically - required for comprehensive attribution coverage and testable by measuring attribution coverage across different attack strengths.
- **Attribution Axiom Compliance**: Mathematical properties that ensure attribution methods satisfy basic requirements like sensitivity and implementation invariance - essential for method validity and verifiable through formal proofs.
- **Insertion/Deletion Scores**: Complementary metrics where Insertion measures how quickly correct class probability increases when adding pixels, and Deletion measures how quickly it decreases when removing pixels - needed to evaluate attribution quality bidirectionally and computable from ranked attribution maps.
- **Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Spaces**: Regions where the model encounters inputs far from training distribution, leading to unreliable predictions - critical to avoid for meaningful attribution and detectable through distributional distance metrics.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Images -> Local Space Definition -> Targeted/untargeted Adversarial Attacks -> Intermediate States Filtering -> Attribution Computation -> Insertion/Deletion Scores

**Critical Path**: The core algorithm flow is: (1) define local space around input using ε parameter, (2) generate adversarial samples through targeted attacks on non-predicted classes and untargetal attacks, (3) filter samples that remain within local space using exploration function u, (4) compute attribution from valid intermediate states, (5) evaluate using insertion and deletion metrics.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades computational efficiency for attribution accuracy - LA requires multiple adversarial attack iterations compared to single-pass methods. The spatial range hyperparameter s controls the exploration breadth versus attribution precision tradeoff. Larger s values explore more of the local space but risk including OOD samples, while smaller s values are computationally efficient but may miss important attribution regions.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor attribution quality manifests as either (1) overly dispersed attribution maps if local space constraints are too loose, or (2) overly concentrated maps if constraints are too strict. Computational inefficiency appears when the exploration function u requires excessive iterations to find valid samples within the local space.

**First Experiments**:
1. Implement LA with varying spatial range s (5, 10, 15) on a single model to identify the optimal value for attribution quality versus computational cost.
2. Compare LA's attribution maps qualitatively against Integrated Gradients on sample ImageNet images to visually assess improvement in localization.
3. Measure the computational overhead of LA by timing attribution computation on a subset of ImageNet compared to baseline methods.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly stated in the provided content.

## Limitations
- The method's computational overhead is not thoroughly characterized, potentially limiting scalability to larger models or datasets.
- Implementation details for the exploration function u are not fully specified, affecting reproducibility.
- The method's generalizability to non-image domains and different model architectures beyond CNNs is not explored.

## Confidence
**High confidence** in core claims about attribution accuracy improvements, supported by rigorous mathematical proofs and consistent experimental results across multiple models and metrics.

**Medium confidence** in practical implementation details and computational efficiency characterization, as specific implementation choices and overhead measurements are not fully specified.

**Low confidence** in generalizability to non-image domains and different model types, as the paper focuses exclusively on image classification with CNNs without exploring other modalities.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies varying the spatial range hyperparameter s across a wider range (5-20) to determine optimal values and assess sensitivity to this critical parameter.
2. Evaluate LA method on additional model architectures beyond the four CNNs tested, including transformer-based models, to assess generalizability.
3. Compare computational efficiency with baseline methods by measuring attribution computation time on the full ImageNet test set to quantify the trade-off between improved accuracy and increased computational cost.
