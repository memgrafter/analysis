# Efficient Video Diffusion Models via Content-Frame Motion-Latent Decomposition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.14148
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14148
- Reference count: 36
- This paper introduces CMD, an efficient latent video diffusion model that extends pretrained image diffusion models to video generation.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents CMD (Content-frame Motion-diffusion), an efficient framework for video generation that extends pretrained image diffusion models to handle video data. CMD decomposes videos into content frames and motion latents using a lightweight autoencoder, allowing it to leverage the rich visual knowledge captured by pretrained image models while significantly reducing computational costs. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on WebVid-10M with substantially improved efficiency compared to existing methods.

## Method Summary
CMD employs a two-stage framework that first trains an autoencoder to encode videos as content frames and motion latents, then uses these representations for video generation. The content frame captures the spatial appearance information through a weighted sum of video frames, while motion latents encode temporal dynamics. A pretrained image diffusion model (Stable Diffusion) is fine-tuned to generate content frames from text prompts, and a lightweight diffusion model generates motion latents conditioned on the content frames and text embeddings. This decomposition enables CMD to generate high-resolution videos efficiently while maintaining quality comparable to or better than existing methods.

## Key Results
- Achieves FVD score of 238.3 on WebVid-10M, 18.5% better than previous state-of-the-art of 292.4
- Generates 512x1024 resolution videos in just 3.1 seconds
- Requires only 15.2GB memory for 30-frame video generation, compared to 40.1GB for full 3D attention methods
- 16.4% higher CLIPSIM score than prior works on WebVid-10M

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
CMD works by decomposing the video generation task into two simpler sub-problems: generating static content frames and generating motion patterns. By leveraging pretrained image diffusion models for content generation, CMD inherits rich visual priors learned from massive image datasets. The motion latent space captures temporal dynamics in a compressed form, allowing efficient generation of coherent motion. This decomposition significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining quality, as the model only needs to learn motion dynamics rather than generating each frame independently.

## Foundational Learning
- **Video diffusion models**: Understanding how diffusion processes extend from images to videos is crucial for grasping CMD's approach. Why needed: CMD builds upon video diffusion foundations but adds the content-motion decomposition. Quick check: Can explain how video diffusion differs from image diffusion in handling temporal dimensions.
- **Latent space representation**: The autoencoder encodes videos into compressed latent representations. Why needed: CMD's efficiency gains come from operating in this compressed latent space rather than pixel space. Quick check: Can describe how autoencoder compresses spatial and temporal information.
- **Conditioning in diffusion models**: CMD conditions motion generation on content frames and text embeddings. Why needed: Understanding how conditioning works is essential for grasping the model architecture. Quick check: Can explain how cross-attention mechanisms enable conditioning in diffusion models.
- **Video decomposition**: Separating spatial and temporal components in videos. Why needed: CMD's core innovation is this decomposition strategy. Quick check: Can articulate how content frames and motion latents complement each other.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Text Embedding -> Content Diffusion -> Content Frame -> Motion Diffusion -> Motion Latents -> Video Decoder -> Generated Video

**Critical Path**: The generation process follows a sequential pipeline where text embeddings condition the content diffusion model, which outputs content frames that then condition the motion diffusion model. The motion latents generated are combined with content frames through the video decoder to produce the final video output.

**Design Tradeoffs**: CMD trades some generation flexibility for significant efficiency gains. The fixed autoencoder architecture limits the ability to adapt to different video characteristics but enables substantial memory savings. The lightweight motion diffusion model cannot capture extremely complex motion patterns but is sufficient for most natural videos.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor content frame generation leads to unrealistic spatial details, while inadequate motion latent generation results in temporally incoherent videos. The autoencoder's reconstruction quality directly impacts overall performance, particularly for videos with complex motion patterns.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test the autoencoder's ability to reconstruct simple videos with minimal motion to verify basic functionality
2. Evaluate content frame generation quality by comparing with ground truth frames for static scenes
3. Assess motion latent generation by examining the temporal coherence of generated motion patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: How does the quality of the autoencoder impact the overall performance of CMD, and can it be improved by using different latent spaces or training techniques? The paper suggests that autoencoder quality may limit performance, particularly for videos with extremely dynamic motion, and proposes training in low-resolution pixel space or using combined image-video latent spaces as potential improvements.

**Open Question 2**: What is the optimal model size for CMD, and how does it affect generation quality and computational efficiency? The paper notes that current model size is relatively small compared to other text-to-video models and suggests that larger models might improve quality, but does not provide detailed analysis of the trade-offs.

**Open Question 3**: How does the use of negative prompts affect the quality of generated videos in CMD, and what are the best practices for incorporating them? The paper mentions that negative prompts have been used in other text-to-video works to improve quality but does not apply them in CMD or analyze their impact.

## Limitations
- Evaluation primarily conducted on WebVid-10M dataset, which may not represent diverse real-world scenarios
- Reported improvements based on relatively small validation sets (500 videos) and limited user studies (30 videos)
- Memory and speed measurements specific to NVIDIA A100 GPUs may not generalize to other hardware
- Does not thoroughly explore trade-offs between quality and efficiency across different video resolutions and durations

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core methodology of decomposing videos into content frames and motion latents is well-justified and technically sound
- **Medium confidence**: The claimed efficiency improvements (memory reduction, speed gains) are based on controlled experiments but may vary in real-world applications
- **Medium confidence**: The generation quality improvements (FVD score, user study results) are promising but based on limited evaluation datasets and sample sizes

## Next Checks
1. **Dataset generalization**: Evaluate CMD on additional diverse video datasets (e.g., Kinetics, Something-Something) to assess its generalization capabilities beyond WebVid-10M
2. **Resolution and duration scaling**: Test the model's performance and efficiency across different video resolutions (e.g., 1080p) and durations (e.g., 5-10 seconds) to understand practical limitations
3. **Cross-modal evaluation**: Conduct experiments with other modalities like audio-driven video generation or text-to-video with more complex prompts to evaluate the model's robustness and versatility
