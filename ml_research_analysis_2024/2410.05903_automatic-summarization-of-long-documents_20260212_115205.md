# Automatic Summarization of Long Documents

- This paper addresses the challenge of summarizing long documents that exceed transformer input size limitations using three novel preprocessing algorithms.

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the challenge of summarizing long documents that exceed transformer context limits by proposing three novel preprocessing algorithms: central truncation, document skimming, and summarization with keyword extraction. These methods distill text to fit within model context sizes while retaining important information. Experiments on datasets with documents up to 70,000 words show significant improvements in BERTScore compared to state-of-the-art models like Unlimiformer. While ROUGE scores are competitive, the authors demonstrate that simple methods can be effective for long document summarization, with document skimming performing well while being computationally efficient.

## Method Summary
The authors propose three algorithms to preprocess long documents for summarization. Central truncation splits the context budget between document start and end to preserve key introductory and concluding information. Document skimming samples segments uniformly across the document with a fixed probability to provide broad coverage while controlling token count. Summarization with keyword extraction uses LDA to identify document themes, then selects segments most similar to extracted keywords. All methods aim to reduce document length while retaining important information for downstream summarization models like BART or LongT5.

## Key Results
- Central truncation with head-and-tail retention significantly outperforms baseline truncation methods
- Document skimming with post-sampling removal achieves strong performance while being computationally efficient
- BERTScore improvements demonstrate better semantic similarity capture compared to ROUGE metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Central truncation with head-and-tail retention captures important content while reducing input size.
- Mechanism: By splitting context budget between document start and end, this method preserves key introductory and concluding information that are often most salient.
- Core assumption: Key document content is often found at the beginning and end, not in the middle.
- Evidence anchors: Prior work (Sun et al., 2019) shows head-and-tail truncation performs better than head-only or tail-only truncation for long text genre classification.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Document skimming with random segment sampling provides a broad view while fitting within context limits.
- Mechanism: Documents are split into segments, each sampled with fixed probability to ensure representation from different parts while controlling expected token count.
- Core assumption: Uniform sampling across the document captures a representative subset without bias toward any section.
- Evidence anchors: Mathematical derivation ensures expected token count equals model size for controlled sampling.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Keyword extraction with LDA identifies most relevant segments for summarization.
- Mechanism: Single-topic LDA extracts keywords representing core meaning, then segments are embedded and compared to keyword embeddings using cosine similarity.
- Core assumption: Keywords from single-topic LDA capture essential themes, and segments with high similarity contain most relevant information.
- Evidence anchors: Algorithm demonstrates picking segments based on similarity to keyword embeddings in examples.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Understanding context size limitations in transformer models
  - Why needed here: Methods are designed to work around quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms that limit input length
  - Quick check question: What is the computational complexity of self-attention mechanism in transformers, and why does it limit context size?

- Concept: Familiarity with BERTScore and ROUGE evaluation metrics
  - Why needed here: Paper uses these metrics to evaluate summary quality, with BERTScore capturing semantic similarity better than ROUGE
  - Quick check question: How does BERTScore differ from ROUGE in evaluating text generation, and why might BERTScore be preferred for summarization?

- Concept: Knowledge of sentence transformers and embedding similarity
  - Why needed here: Document skimming and keyword extraction methods rely on embedding segments and comparing using cosine similarity
  - Quick check question: How are sentence transformers used to generate embeddings for text segments, and why is cosine similarity appropriate for comparing these embeddings?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Document → Segmentation → Distillation (via one of three algorithms) → Summarization Model → Summary Output
- Critical path: Document → Segmentation → Distillation (via one of the three algorithms) → Summarization Model → Summary Output
- Design tradeoffs: Central truncation is fast but may lose middle content; document skimming is simple but relies on uniform content distribution; keyword extraction is accurate but computationally expensive
- Failure signatures: Poor ROUGE scores indicate loss of content; low BERTScore suggests poor semantic similarity; high redundancy in output points to issues in segment selection
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run central truncation on sample long document and compare ROUGE/BERTScore to baseline
  2. Test document skimming with and without post-sampling redundancy removal on medium-length document
  3. Apply summarization with keyword extraction on document with clear central themes and evaluate semantic similarity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the choice of segmentation strategy significantly impact the quality of summaries generated by the proposed algorithms?
- Basis in paper: Authors state that ensuring uniformity of segment length while preserving coherence is essential and encourage future work to experiment with different segmenters
- Why unresolved: Only basic sentence tokenizer with modifications was used, without extensive exploration of alternative segmentation strategies
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing algorithms using various segmentation strategies (semantic, hierarchical) on same datasets would provide insights into segmentation impact

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do the proposed algorithms perform on datasets with documents significantly longer than 70,000 words?
- Basis in paper: Authors tested algorithms on documents up to 70,000 words but mention document length may be up to ten times context size of model used
- Why unresolved: Experiments were limited to certain document lengths without exploring performance on extremely long documents
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing algorithms on datasets with documents exceeding 70,000 words and comparing to existing methods would provide insights into scalability

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does performance of proposed algorithms compare to human-generated summaries for long documents?
- Basis in paper: Authors used automatic evaluation metrics but acknowledge that best way to evaluate generated natural language is by humans
- Why unresolved: Human evaluations were not conducted due to cost and time constraints
- What evidence would resolve it: Human evaluations where judges compare algorithm-generated summaries to human-written summaries would provide insights into perceived quality

## Limitations

- Performance evaluation relies on synthetic long documents created by concatenation rather than naturally occurring long documents
- Computational cost analysis is limited, particularly for the expensive keyword extraction method
- Paper does not address potential bias in segment selection when documents have non-uniform information distribution
- Claims about practical efficiency of document skimming relative to keyword extraction lack sufficient empirical support

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Central truncation mechanism is well-grounded in prior work showing head-and-tail retention effectiveness for long text classification. Mathematical framework for document skimming's expected token count is clearly specified and verifiable.

**Medium Confidence**: BERTScore improvements are consistently demonstrated across datasets, though semantic advantage over ROUGE is asserted rather than extensively validated with human evaluation. Keyword extraction approach using LDA is theoretically sound but computationally expensive.

**Low Confidence**: Claims about practical efficiency of document skimming method relative to keyword extraction lack sufficient empirical support. Assertion that simple methods can be effective needs more rigorous ablation studies.

## Next Checks

1. **Human Evaluation Study**: Conduct human assessment comparing semantic quality and coherence of summaries generated by each preprocessing method to validate BERTScore improvements and investigate why ROUGE scores remain competitive rather than superior.

2. **Computational Efficiency Benchmark**: Implement comprehensive runtime analysis comparing all three preprocessing methods on documents of varying lengths, including GPU/CPU utilization metrics and memory requirements to quantify computational expense of keyword extraction versus efficiency of simpler methods.

3. **Real-World Document Testing**: Apply preprocessing methods to naturally occurring long documents from diverse domains (legal documents, scientific papers, books) rather than concatenated synthetic documents to assess performance on realistic document structures and evaluate information preservation across different content types.
