core_contribution: The study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) augmented
  with tools can recognize incomplete conditions where necessary tools are unavailable
  or user information is insufficient. To evaluate this, the authors constructed a

  from two existing datasets (APIBank and ToolBench).

# Can Tool-augmented Large Language Models be Aware of Incomplete Conditions?

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2406.12307
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12307
- **Reference count:** 17
- **Key outcome:** State-of-the-art LLMs struggle to identify incomplete conditions with 51-80% accuracy, particularly when user utterances are incomplete

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether tool-augmented large language models can recognize incomplete conditions where necessary tools are unavailable or user information is insufficient. The authors constructed a new benchmark dataset by systematically removing tools or essential information from existing datasets to evaluate model performance. Results show that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle significantly with this task, achieving accuracy scores between 51-80% across different models and scenarios. To address these limitations, the authors propose a novel prompting-based reasoning strategy that improves models' ability to assess information sufficiency and tool availability, demonstrating significant performance gains in recognizing incomplete conditions.

## Method Summary
The researchers created a benchmark dataset by systematically removing tools or essential information from two existing datasets (APIBank and ToolBench) to simulate incomplete conditions. They evaluated multiple state-of-the-art LLMs on their ability to recognize when conditions were incomplete and explain why tools could not be used. The evaluation focused on single-turn scenarios where models had to determine if they had sufficient information and available tools to complete tasks. The proposed solution involves a prompting-based reasoning strategy that explicitly instructs models to assess both information sufficiency and tool availability before making tool-use decisions.

## Key Results
- LLMs achieved only 51-80% accuracy in recognizing incomplete conditions across different models and scenarios
- Models performed particularly poorly when user utterances were incomplete or missing critical information
- The proposed prompting-based reasoning strategy significantly improved models' ability to identify incomplete conditions and provide correct explanations
- Even state-of-the-art models struggled to determine why tools could not be used in incomplete condition scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The prompting-based reasoning strategy works by explicitly guiding models through a systematic assessment process. Instead of directly attempting tool usage, models are instructed to first verify information completeness and tool availability. This structured approach helps models avoid premature tool selection and encourages them to recognize when conditions are insufficient for task completion. The strategy leverages the model's inherent reasoning capabilities while providing clear guidance on what aspects to evaluate before making tool-use decisions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Tool augmentation basics**: Understanding how external tools are integrated with LLMs is essential for grasping why incomplete conditions pose challenges
  - Why needed: Provides context for the core problem being addressed
  - Quick check: Can explain how tools extend LLM capabilities beyond their training data

- **Information sufficiency assessment**: Models must evaluate whether provided user information contains all necessary details for task completion
  - Why needed: Core capability that LLMs currently lack in recognizing incomplete conditions
  - Quick check: Can distinguish between complete and incomplete user requests

- **Tool availability verification**: Checking whether required tools are present in the available toolkit before attempting task execution
  - Why needed: Essential for preventing failed tool calls when necessary tools are missing
  - Quick check: Can identify when a required tool is absent from the available set

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
User Input -> Information Sufficiency Checker -> Tool Availability Checker -> Decision Module -> Tool Selection/Explanation

**Critical Path:**
The critical path involves sequential verification: first assessing information completeness, then checking tool availability, and finally making a decision to either proceed with tool selection or provide an explanation for why the task cannot be completed.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The prompting-based approach trades computational efficiency for accuracy by adding explicit reasoning steps. While this increases inference time, it significantly improves the model's ability to recognize incomplete conditions. The strategy also requires careful prompt engineering to balance guidance without over-constraining the model's natural reasoning capabilities.

**Failure Signatures:**
- Premature tool selection without proper condition verification
- Inability to articulate why specific tools cannot be used
- Confusion between insufficient information and unavailable tools
- Failure to recognize missing critical user information

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test baseline LLM performance on artificially incomplete conditions from APIBank dataset
2. Apply prompting-based reasoning strategy and measure accuracy improvements
3. Conduct ablation studies varying prompt instruction wording to identify optimal formulation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Benchmark construction relies on artificially modified datasets rather than naturally occurring incomplete conditions
- Evaluation focuses on single-turn scenarios, potentially underestimating performance in multi-turn dialogues
- The proposed solution may not generalize beyond specific instruction templates used in the study
- 51-80% accuracy range suggests inherent ambiguity in determining correct recognition of incomplete conditions

## Confidence

**High confidence:**
- Core finding that current LLMs struggle with recognizing incomplete conditions is well-supported by experimental results across multiple models

**Medium confidence:**
- Proposed prompting-based solution demonstrates effectiveness within controlled settings but requires real-world validation
- Systematic approach to constructing incomplete condition scenarios is methodologically sound but may lack ecological validity

## Next Checks

1. Test the prompting-based reasoning strategy on a separate, independently constructed dataset with naturally occurring incomplete conditions
2. Evaluate model performance across multiple dialogue turns to assess whether context accumulation improves incomplete condition recognition
3. Conduct ablation studies to determine which components of the prompting strategy contribute most significantly to performance improvements, testing variations in instruction wording and structure
