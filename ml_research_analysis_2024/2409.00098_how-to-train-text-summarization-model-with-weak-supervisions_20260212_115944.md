# How to Train Text Summarization Model with Weak Supervisions

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2409.00098
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00098
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: Novel approach for training text summarization models using weak supervision signals, achieving ROUGE-1 scores of 27.73% and 30.75% on topic-based CNN and DailyMail datasets respectively.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach for training text summarization models using weak supervision signals without labeled data. The method decomposes the complex objective of topic-based summarization into simpler tasks (informativeness and relevance) and generates supervision signals for each component. As a case study, the approach is applied to topic-based extractive summarization, leveraging various supervision signals including general summary labels, rule-based indicators, semantic similarity metrics, and QA-induced supervision from a pre-trained model. The model is trained on the CNN/DailyMail dataset and evaluated on topic-based CNN and DailyMail datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline approaches.

## Method Summary
The approach decomposes topic-based summarization into simpler sub-tasks (informativeness and relevance) and generates supervision signals for each component through different methods: general summary labels from the CNN/DailyMail dataset, rule-based indicators for relevance, semantic similarity metrics using BERT embeddings, and QA-induced supervision from a pre-trained QA model. These supervision signals are integrated as soft labels (values between 0 and 1) through weighted combination, enabling end-to-end training without labeled data. The model uses BERTSum architecture for extractive summarization, training on the CNN/DailyMail dataset and evaluating on topic-based datasets.

## Key Results
- Achieved ROUGE-1 scores of 27.73% and 30.75% on topic-CNN and topic-DailyMail datasets respectively
- Outperformed baseline approaches despite not using topic-based reference summaries during training
- Demonstrated that all supervision signals (general summary labels, rule-based supervision, semantic similarity, QA supervision) are helpful for topic-based summarization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Decomposing complex topic-based summarization into simpler sub-tasks enables supervision without labeled data
- Mechanism: The approach breaks down the overall objective into informativeness and relevance, then generates supervision signals for each component (general summary labels, rule-based indicators, semantic similarity metrics, QA-induced supervision). These signals are integrated as soft labels (values between 0 and 1) rather than hard binary labels.
- Core assumption: Complex tasks can be effectively decomposed into simpler sub-tasks where supervision can be generated through different methods
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the method decomposes the complex objective of topic-based summarization into simpler tasks and generates supervision signals for each"
  - [section 3.2] "In label-free scenarios, supervision is regarded as a replacement of labels to guide the learning process... each supervision is regarded as 'soft' relaxation of binary labels, so it ranges from 0 to 1"
- Break condition: If the decomposition creates sub-tasks that cannot be supervised independently, or if the integration of multiple supervision signals fails to represent the combined effect accurately

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multiple diverse supervision signals can be combined effectively through weighted integration
- Mechanism: The approach uses weighted combination of supervision signals (general summary labels, rule-based indicators, semantic similarity, QA supervision) where each signal contributes to the final soft label. The weights (λs) sum to 1, ensuring the integrated supervision remains between 0 and 1.
- Core assumption: Different types of supervision signals can be meaningfully combined through simple weighted averaging to represent the overall objective
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "Suppose we have already collected a number of supervisions, denotedY. In the learning procedure, the target is the integration of all the supervisions... The target is to minimize the following objective function"
  - [section 3.3] "hyperparameterλs are between 0 and 1, weighing the importance of certain supervision in the whole objective. We assume the sum of all λs equal to 1 to guarantee0 ≤ ˜yi ≤ 1"
- Break condition: If certain supervision signals conflict significantly or if the weighted averaging fails to capture the relative importance of different signals for the task

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Pre-trained models can provide high-quality supervision for related tasks
- Mechanism: The approach uses a pre-trained QA model (trained on SQuAD) to generate supervision by treating the topic as a question and the document as context. The QA model's output serves as a pseudo-summary that can be aligned with the document to create supervision labels.
- Core assumption: Related tasks (QA and topic-based summarization) share enough structure that supervision from one can effectively guide learning in the other
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3] "Supervision can also come from pre-trained model from related task. Question Answering on SQuAD dataset... This task is similar to topic-based summarization, where topic can be seen as the question, documents correspond to context paragraph"
- Break condition: If the QA model's output quality degrades significantly or if the alignment between QA answers and summary requirements becomes too weak

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Weak supervision and soft labels
  - Why needed here: The method relies on generating supervision signals without labeled data, using soft labels (values between 0 and 1) instead of hard binary labels
  - Quick check question: How does the approach ensure integrated supervision values stay between 0 and 1 when combining multiple signals?

- Concept: Task decomposition and multi-task learning
  - Why needed here: The method decomposes topic-based summarization into simpler sub-tasks (informativeness and relevance) and learns from multiple supervision sources
  - Quick check question: What are the two main sub-tasks that the topic-based summarization objective is decomposed into?

- Concept: Semantic similarity and embedding representations
  - Why needed here: The method uses BERT-based sentence embeddings and word embeddings to measure semantic similarity between topics, sentences, and reference summaries
  - Quick check question: Which specific embedding method is used to represent topics and sentences for measuring semantic similarity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input layer (Topic + Document sentences) -> BERTSum encoder -> Binary classification head -> Supervision integration module -> Loss function

- Critical path:
  1. Preprocess input (split sentences, add topic at beginning)
  2. Pass through BERTSum encoder
  3. Apply binary classification head to get probabilities
  4. Compute integrated supervision from multiple sources
  5. Calculate cross-entropy loss
  6. Backpropagate and update parameters

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using soft labels vs. hard labels: Soft labels provide more nuanced supervision but require careful integration
  - Fixed weights vs. learned weights: The current approach uses fixed equal weights, which is simpler but may not capture optimal signal importance
  - BERTSum vs. other architectures: BERTSum provides strong pre-trained initialization but adds computational overhead

- Failure signatures:
  - If integrated supervision values are consistently near 0 or 1, it may indicate supervision signals are too strong or conflicting
  - If ROUGE scores don't improve with added supervision, the integration mechanism may be failing
  - If training loss plateaus early, supervision signals may be providing insufficient guidance

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test with only general summary labels (ext-label) to establish baseline performance
  2. Add rule-based supervision incrementally to measure impact on relevance
  3. Test with all supervision signals except QA to verify QA contribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different types of weak supervision signals contribute differently to model performance in topic-based summarization?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "we find that all of the supervisions are helpful on topic-based summarization" and "Among all of the supervisions, rule-based supervision and general summary label are most important supervisions for the task."
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies that all supervision types are helpful and ranks two as most important, it doesn't provide a detailed quantitative breakdown of each type's contribution or examine potential interactions between different supervision types.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic ablation study showing performance changes when each supervision type is individually added or removed, along with interaction analysis between different supervision combinations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the proposed weak supervision framework be effectively applied to other complex NLP tasks beyond topic-based summarization?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper concludes "Future work could expand the current work in multiple scientific domains, e.g., computer vision, gene expression estimation, multi-omics data integration, target identification, drug discovery, clinical trial management, and phenotype prediction."
- Why unresolved: The paper only demonstrates the framework on one specific task (topic-based summarization) without validating its applicability to other domains or NLP tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies applying the framework to multiple other NLP tasks, comparing performance against standard supervised approaches.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal way to balance and weight different types of supervision signals in the learning objective?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions "hyperparameterλs are between 0 and 1, weighing the importance of certain supervision in the whole objective" but states "we set all the hyperparameterλ equal to each other" without exploring optimization strategies.
- Why unresolved: The paper uses equal weighting for all supervision signals without investigating whether this is optimal or exploring methods for automatically learning the best weights.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing performance with different weighting strategies, including learned weights versus fixed weights, and analysis of sensitivity to weight changes.

## Limitations

- Limited evidence for QA supervision effectiveness: The paper claims QA-induced supervision significantly improves performance but provides limited evidence about the quality of these generated pseudo-summaries or how well they align with the actual topic-based summarization task.
- Unclear supervision integration mechanism: While the paper describes weighted combination of supervision signals, it doesn't empirically validate whether this simple averaging is optimal or whether certain signal combinations create conflicts.
- Limited generalizability demonstration: The decomposition approach and supervision generation methods are demonstrated only for topic-based extractive summarization, with unclear applicability to other tasks or domains.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core decomposition framework (breaking complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks with generated supervision) is theoretically sound and supported by the experimental results showing improved performance over baselines.

**Medium Confidence**: The specific implementation details for supervision integration and the claim that multiple diverse signals can be effectively combined through weighted averaging. While the math is correct, the empirical validation is limited.

**Low Confidence**: The claim that QA supervision from a pre-trained SQuAD model significantly contributes to topic-based summarization performance, given the task mismatch and lack of evidence about pseudo-summary quality.

## Next Checks

1. **Supervision Quality Analysis**: Generate and manually evaluate a sample of QA-induced pseudo-summaries to assess their relevance and quality for topic-based summarization. Compare their alignment with human-written summaries on the same topics.

2. **Supervision Ablation Study**: Conduct a systematic ablation study testing different combinations and weightings of supervision signals (not just the "all" vs "ext-label" comparison) to identify which signals contribute most and whether certain combinations create conflicts.

3. **Cross-Domain Transfer Test**: Apply the same decomposition and supervision generation framework to a different summarization task (e.g., generic extractive summarization) to test whether the approach generalizes beyond topic-based summarization.
