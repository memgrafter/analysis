# On Inherent Adversarial Robustness of Active Vision Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.00185
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00185
- Authors: Amitangshu Mukherjee; Timur Ibrayev; Kaushik Roy
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Active vision methods achieve 2-3× greater robustness than passive baselines under black-box transfer attacks

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the inherent adversarial robustness of active vision systems by comparing them to passive convolutional networks under black-box transfer attacks. The core insight is that active vision methods process inputs through multiple distinct fixation points and downsampled glimpses, making them less vulnerable to adversarial noise compared to passive methods that process every pixel uniformly. The authors demonstrate that active vision methods like GFNet and FALcon achieve 2-3 times greater robustness than passive baselines, with accuracy improvements ranging from 37-58% under various state-of-the-art attacks.

## Method Summary
The paper evaluates inherent adversarial robustness by generating adversarial samples using PGD, MIFGSM, VMIFGSM, and Patchwise-IFGSM attacks on surrogate models (ResNet34, ResNet50, DenseNet121), then testing these samples on target models including ResNet50, Adv-T, FALcon, and GFNet. The experiments use the ImageNet dataset with 50,000 test samples, maintaining consistent 96×96 resolution for all GFNet inferences. Robustness is measured by accuracy under attack (Accs→t), representing the percentage of adversarial examples generated using surrogate model Si that are correctly classified by target model Ti.

## Key Results
- Active vision methods achieve 2-3× greater robustness than passive convolutional networks under black-box transfer attacks
- Accuracy improvements range from 37-58% under various state-of-the-art attacks (PGD, MIFGSM, VMIFGSM, Patchwise-IFGSM)
- The combination of multi-fixation processing and downsampling provides inherent robustness without requiring specialized adversarial training
- Qualitative visualizations show how the multi-fixation approach helps avoid adversarial patches and improves resilience

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Processing adversarial inputs through multiple fixation points provides robustness by reducing uniform exposure to adversarial noise.
- Mechanism: Active vision methods like GFNet and FALcon process images through multiple distinct fixation points and downsampled glimpses, which allows them to make multiple predictions from different perspectives of the same image.
- Core assumption: Adversarial noise is non-uniformly distributed across the image, so different fixation points will encounter different levels of noise.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "performing inference from distinct fixation points makes active vision methods less vulnerable to malicious inputs"
  - [section 5.4]: "Due to its non-uniformity and imperceptible criteria, the adversarial noise does not affect each point equally"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct mentions of this specific mechanism in corpus papers
- Break condition: If adversarial attacks become perfectly uniform across the image or if fixation points cluster around the same noisy regions

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Learning in a downsampled resolution inherently reduces the impact of adversarial noise.
- Mechanism: Active vision methods train on downsampled images (e.g., 96x96), which distorts the adversarial noise along with the image features, reducing its effectiveness.
- Core assumption: Adversarial perturbations are crafted at full resolution but lose effectiveness when downsampled
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.3]: "Downsampling inherently causes reduction in features. Adversarial imperceptible noise is crafted based on the image in its original resolution"
  - [section 5.3]: "Setting 2 shows that simply downsampling adversarial images to lower resolutions is beneficial"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus doesn't specifically discuss downsampling effects on adversarial noise
- Break condition: If adversarial attacks are specifically designed to target downsampled representations or if downsampling is applied after attack generation

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Active vision methods can avoid adversarial patches by focusing on different object regions through sequential glimpses.
- Mechanism: By sequentially focusing on different parts of an object through foveation, these methods can avoid concentrating on adversarial regions while still capturing necessary features.
- Core assumption: Adversarial patches are localized and can be avoided by proper fixation point selection
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "how performing inference from distinct fixation points makes active vision methods less vulnerable to malicious inputs"
  - [section 5.4.2]: "Although noise affects the method, its inherent processing from multiple fixations makes it less susceptible"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus doesn't specifically discuss adversarial patch avoidance
- Break condition: If adversarial patches cover the entire object or if fixation points are forced to concentrate on the same regions

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Adversarial robustness in machine learning
  - Why needed here: Understanding how neural networks can be made resistant to carefully crafted inputs that cause misclassification
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between targeted and non-targeted adversarial attacks?

- Concept: Active vision and human visual processing
  - Why needed here: The paper builds on biological inspiration from how human eyes process visual information through saccades and foveation
  - Quick check question: How do saccades and foveation differ from uniform image processing?

- Concept: Black-box threat models
  - Why needed here: The experiments evaluate inherent robustness without knowledge of the target model's architecture
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between black-box and white-box adversarial attacks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input preprocessing -> Downsampling to lower resolutions -> Patch proposal network selects fixation points -> Sequential glimpse extraction and local encoding -> Aggregation and final classification

- Critical path:
  1. Input image → downsampling
  2. Global encoder processes downsampled image
  3. Patch proposal network selects fixation points
  4. Sequential glimpse extraction and local encoding
  5. Aggregation and final classification

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Resolution vs. robustness: Lower resolution provides more robustness but may lose fine details
  - Number of fixation points vs. computational cost: More points provide better coverage but increase computation
  - Sequential vs. parallel processing: Sequential allows dynamic focus but is slower than parallel processing

- Failure signatures:
  - If adversarial noise covers the entire object uniformly
  - If fixation points consistently select noisy regions
  - If downsampling destroys critical features needed for classification
  - If the sequential attention mechanism gets stuck in local minima

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare clean accuracy vs. adversarial accuracy for both active and passive methods
  2. Test robustness with different downsampling resolutions (e.g., 96x96 vs 128x128)
  3. Evaluate performance with varying numbers of fixation points (e.g., 5 vs 20)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the choice of fixation point distribution strategy affect the adversarial robustness of active vision methods?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that FALcon processes inputs from multiple predefined fixation points distributed across the image grid.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not systematically analyze the impact of different fixation point distribution strategies (e.g., uniform vs. density-based) on adversarial robustness.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments showing the adversarial robustness of active vision methods under different fixation point distribution strategies.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can active vision methods be effectively combined with existing adversarial defense strategies to further enhance robustness?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates the inherent robustness of active vision methods and mentions the possibility of adapting adversarial training methods into active vision methods.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the potential synergy between active vision methods and existing adversarial defense strategies.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments evaluating the combined effect of active vision methods and various adversarial defense strategies on robustness against different types of attacks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of active vision methods scale with the complexity of the input data (e.g., higher resolution, more objects)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on ImageNet classification and mentions the ability of FALcon to detect multiple objects, but does not extensively explore the scalability of active vision methods.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comprehensive analysis of how the performance of active vision methods changes with varying input complexity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the adversarial robustness of active vision methods on datasets with different input complexities (e.g., higher resolution, more objects per image) and varying the number of fixation points or glimpses accordingly.

## Limitations

- The paper only evaluates black-box transfer attacks, not white-box attacks where attackers know the active vision architecture
- No experiments with adaptive attacks specifically designed to exploit active vision fixation point selection mechanisms
- Experiments conducted at a single resolution (96×96) without exploring the full tradeoff space between resolution and robustness

## Confidence

- Core robustness claims: Medium-High
- Mechanism explanations: Medium
- Generalization across attack types: Medium
- Practical deployment implications: Low

## Next Checks

1. Test white-box attacks against active vision models to assess whether their inherent robustness holds when attackers can directly optimize against their architecture
2. Conduct ablation studies varying the number of fixation points and downsampling factors to isolate which mechanism contributes most to robustness
3. Evaluate performance on real-world datasets beyond ImageNet to verify that results generalize to practical applications with different object scales and distributions
