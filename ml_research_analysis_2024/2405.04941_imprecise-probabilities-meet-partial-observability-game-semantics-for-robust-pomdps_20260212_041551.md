# Imprecise Probabilities Meet Partial Observability: Game Semantics for Robust POMDPs

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2405.04941
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04941
- **Authors**: Eline M. Bovy; Marnix Suilen; Sebastian Junges; Nils Jansen
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: RPOMDPs can be interpreted as partially observable stochastic games where different uncertainty assumptions yield different optimal values

## Executive Summary
This paper develops a game-theoretic framework for robust partially observable Markov decision processes (RPOMDPs) where transition probabilities are uncertain and represented by sets. The authors interpret RPOMDPs as two-player partially observable stochastic games between an agent and nature, with the agent maximizing rewards and nature minimizing them. They introduce "stickiness" parameters that control when nature's choices for uncertain probabilities must remain fixed, generalizing static and dynamic uncertainty assumptions from robust MDPs. The framework establishes POSG semantics for RPOMDPs and proves existence of Nash equilibria for finite-horizon cases, providing a unified approach to understanding and solving RPOMDPs.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a game-theoretic framework that interprets RPOMDPs as partially observable stochastic games between an agent and nature. They introduce "stickiness" parameters that control when nature's choices for uncertain probabilities must remain fixed, generalizing static and dynamic uncertainty assumptions from robust MDPs. The key theoretical contribution is showing that different uncertainty assumptions (including stickiness and order of play) can lead to different optimal values in RPOMDPs, unlike in robust MDPs where these assumptions are known to coincide. They establish POSG semantics for RPOMDPs and prove existence of Nash equilibria for finite-horizon cases. The framework is used to classify existing RPOMDP literature and explain differences in their solution methods.

## Key Results
- Different uncertainty assumptions (static, dynamic, and stickiness parameters) can lead to different optimal values in RPOMDPs, unlike in robust MDPs where these assumptions coincide
- POSG semantics provide a unified framework for understanding RPOMDPs as two-player games between an agent and nature
- Existence of Nash equilibria is proven for finite-horizon RPOMDPs under various uncertainty assumptions
- The framework successfully classifies and explains differences between existing RPOMDP solution methods in the literature

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by explicitly modeling the interaction between an agent and nature as a game, where nature's strategic behavior in choosing uncertain transition probabilities directly affects the agent's optimal strategy. The "stickiness" parameters create a spectrum between static uncertainty (where nature's choices are fixed throughout) and dynamic uncertainty (where nature can adapt choices based on observations). This game-theoretic interpretation captures the inherent tension in robust decision-making under partial observability, where the agent must balance exploration and exploitation while accounting for worst-case scenarios. By formalizing this interaction through POSG semantics, the framework reveals that the order of play and timing of nature's decisions fundamentally impact optimal strategies, explaining why different solution approaches in the literature yield different results.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Robust POMDPs (RPOMDPs)**: MDPs with partial observability where transition probabilities are uncertain and represented by sets
   - Why needed: Captures real-world scenarios where transition dynamics are imperfectly known
   - Quick check: Verify that all transition probabilities belong to specified uncertainty sets

2. **Partially Observable Stochastic Games (POSGs)**: Multi-agent stochastic games with partial observability
   - Why needed: Provides the theoretical foundation for modeling agent-nature interactions
   - Quick check: Confirm that the POSG formulation correctly captures all observation-action transitions

3. **Stickiness Parameters**: Parameters controlling when nature's choices for uncertain probabilities must remain fixed
   - Why needed: Generalizes static and dynamic uncertainty assumptions, providing a spectrum of modeling options
   - Quick check: Test edge cases where stickiness parameters are set to extreme values

4. **Nash Equilibria in POSGs**: Solution concept where no player can unilaterally improve their payoff
   - Why needed: Provides the optimality criterion for agent-nature interactions in RPOMDPs
   - Quick check: Verify that computed strategies form a Nash equilibrium through best-response analysis

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Nature's uncertainty sets -> Stickiness parameters -> Agent's belief updates -> POSG state transitions -> Nash equilibrium computation

**Critical Path**: Uncertainty specification → Stickiness parameter selection → POSG construction → Nash equilibrium computation → Optimal policy extraction

**Design Tradeoffs**: Static vs dynamic uncertainty assumptions affect computational complexity and solution conservatism; higher stickiness provides more stable solutions but may be overly conservative; finite vs infinite horizon affects equilibrium existence and computation methods

**Failure Signatures**: Non-convergence of Nash equilibrium computation suggests incompatible uncertainty assumptions; belief state explosion indicates need for approximation methods; unexpected policy behavior may indicate incorrect stickiness parameter calibration

**First Experiments**:
1. Implement a simple grid world with known uncertainty sets and test how different stickiness parameters affect optimal policies
2. Compare solutions from static vs dynamic uncertainty assumptions on a benchmark RPOMDP problem
3. Apply the framework to a partially observable variant of a well-studied robust MDP problem and verify theoretical predictions about value differences

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations

- The POSG semantics and Nash equilibrium existence proofs are established for finite-horizon cases only, with infinite-horizon analysis remaining unexplored
- Computational complexity of solving these games is not addressed, leaving open questions about practical tractability
- Stickiness parameters, while providing theoretical flexibility, may be difficult to calibrate in real-world applications without domain expertise

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The claim that different uncertainty assumptions lead to different optimal values in RPOMDPs compared to robust MDPs, as this is the central theoretical contribution with supporting proofs
- **Medium confidence**: The POSG semantics framework, as the existence proofs are sound but may not generalize to all practical scenarios
- **Medium confidence**: The classification of existing RPOMDP literature, as it depends on accurate interpretation of previous works' assumptions

## Next Checks

1. Implement a prototype solver for finite-horizon RPOMDPs under different uncertainty assumptions and compare solutions to verify theoretical predictions about value differences

2. Extend the POSG framework to infinite-horizon cases and test whether Nash equilibria still exist under common discount factors or average reward criteria

3. Apply the framework to a concrete robotics or control domain where transition uncertainties are well-characterized, and validate whether the theoretical differences in assumptions translate to meaningful performance differences in practice
