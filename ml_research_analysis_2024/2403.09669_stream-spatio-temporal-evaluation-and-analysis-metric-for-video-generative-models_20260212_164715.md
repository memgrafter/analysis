# STREAM: Spatio-TempoRal Evaluation and Analysis Metric for Video Generative Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.09669
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09669
- Authors: Pum Jun Kim; Seojun Kim; Jaejun Yoo
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: STREAM offers independent evaluation of spatial and temporal aspects of video generative models, addressing limitations of existing metrics

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces STREAM, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess the spatial and temporal aspects of video generative models independently. Unlike existing metrics, which primarily focus on spatial quality, STREAM offers a comprehensive analysis by evaluating both realism and diversity of videos (STREAM-S) as well as their temporal naturalness (STREAM-T). The metric is validated through a series of experiments, including synthetic toy data and real video datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting both spatial and temporal degradations. STREAM is shown to be robust across various video lengths and resolutions, providing bounded evaluation scores that offer granular insights into model performance.

## Method Summary
STREAM evaluates video generative models by separating spatial and temporal analysis. The method uses frame-wise embeddings from an image network to avoid conflating spatial and temporal information. For temporal evaluation (STREAM-T), it applies FFT to frame embeddings, fits power law distributions to frequency amplitudes, and measures skewness differences between real and generated videos. For spatial evaluation (STREAM-S), it extends the P&R framework using mean amplitude at frequency zero to estimate fidelity and diversity. The metric produces bounded scores that provide detailed insights into model performance across both dimensions.

## Key Results
- STREAM-T successfully detects temporal distortions in videos generated by temporal degradation models
- STREAM-S provides reliable assessment of spatial quality across different video resolutions and lengths
- The metric demonstrates bounded evaluation scores with granular insights into both spatial and temporal aspects

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Frame-wise embeddings enable separate evaluation of spatial and temporal aspects
- Core assumption: Frame-wise embeddings preserve sufficient information for both spatial and temporal evaluation
- Evidence: Abstract and section 2.2 describe using image embedding network for independent frame encoding
- Break condition: If frame-wise embeddings lose critical temporal dependencies

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Frequency domain analysis with power law fitting enables robust temporal flow measurement
- Core assumption: Natural signals exhibit 1/f fluctuation patterns capturable through power law distributions
- Evidence: Section 2.3 describes FFT application and power law fitting for temporal analysis
- Break condition: If power law assumption fails for generated videos

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Mean amplitude at frequency zero enables proper video data support estimation
- Core assumption: Mean amplitude adequately represents spatial characteristics while being computationally tractable
- Evidence: Section 2.4 describes using mean amplitude for P&R-based spatial evaluation
- Break condition: If mean amplitude loses critical spatial information

## Foundational Learning

- Power law distributions and 1/f fluctuation in natural signals
  - Why needed: Method relies on power law fitting to frequency amplitudes for temporal evaluation
  - Quick check: What is the mathematical form of a power law distribution used for frequency analysis?

- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and frequency domain analysis
  - Why needed: FFT converts frame embeddings into frequency domain for temporal flow analysis
  - Quick check: What information does amplitude at frequency zero represent in FFT analysis?

- Precision and Recall metrics for generative models
  - Why needed: STREAM-S extends P&R framework to video evaluation using mean amplitude
  - Quick check: How does original P&R metric estimate data support using k-nearest neighbors?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Image embedding network -> FFT module -> Power law fitting -> Skewness calculation -> Histogram module -> Correlation module

- Critical path: 1) Embed frames using image network 2) Apply FFT along temporal axis 3) For each feature dimension: fit power law and calculate skewness 4) Build histograms of skewness values 5) Calculate correlation between real/fake histograms (STREAM-T) 6) Use mean amplitude for P&R-based spatial evaluation (STREAM-S)

- Design tradeoffs: Image vs video embeddings (separation vs temporal cues), frequency zero vs all frequencies (simplicity vs detail), power law assumption (tractability vs applicability)

- Failure signatures: STREAM-T scores don't decrease with temporal degradation, STREAM-S scores don't decrease with visual degradation, high variance in measurements

- First experiments: 1) Test power law fitting on diverse video models 2) Compare STREAM-S with variants using different frequency components 3) Conduct human correlation study between STREAM scores and perceptual quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided text.

## Limitations

- Power law assumption may not hold for all video generative models, particularly those using non-naturalistic generation techniques
- Using mean amplitude as single representative point may oversimplify spatial complexity of videos
- Effectiveness of frame-wise embeddings depends on assumption that temporal information can be captured without video-specific temporal modeling

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Separation of spatial and temporal evaluation through frame-wise embeddings is well-justified and theoretically sound

**Medium Confidence**: FFT-based temporal analysis and skewness calculation are standard signal processing techniques with predictable behavior

**Low Confidence**: Assumption that human perception correlates with statistical differences in power law distributions is not directly validated

## Next Checks

1. Test power law fitting approach on broader range of video generative models, including those producing non-naturalistic temporal patterns

2. Conduct experiments comparing STREAM-S with variants using different frequency components to quantify information loss

3. Perform user study to establish correlation between STREAM scores and human judgments of spatial quality and temporal naturalness across multiple video generative models
