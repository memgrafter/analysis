# An Investigation on Machine Learning Predictive Accuracy Improvement and Uncertainty Reduction using VAE-based Data Augmentation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.19063
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19063
- Reference count: 32
- Primary result: VAE-based data augmentation improves DNN prediction accuracy and reduces uncertainty in nuclear engineering applications with limited data

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether data augmentation using variational autoencoder (VAE)-based deep generative models can improve deep neural network (DNN) prediction accuracy and reduce predictive uncertainty for nuclear engineering applications with limited experimental data. The approach trains a VAE on original TRACE simulation data to generate synthetic samples, then incrementally expands training datasets with these samples to train multiple DNNs. Conformal prediction computes confidence intervals for DNN predictions, while Bayesian neural networks quantify prediction uncertainties. Results show that augmenting training data with VAE-generated samples consistently reduces DNN prediction errors (MAE, RMSE, and standard deviation), narrows confidence interval widths, and decreases prediction uncertainties across all void fraction outputs.

## Method Summary
The methodology employs a systematic approach to data augmentation using VAE-based deep generative models for improving DNN performance. The process begins by training a VAE on original TRACE simulation data, which serves as the foundation for generating synthetic samples. These synthetic samples are then incrementally added to the training dataset in controlled batches. Multiple DNNs are trained on these progressively augmented datasets, allowing for comparative analysis of model performance as synthetic data volume increases. Conformal prediction is used to compute confidence intervals for the DNN predictions, providing a measure of prediction reliability. Bayesian neural networks are employed to quantify prediction uncertainties, offering additional insights into model confidence. The study evaluates performance across various metrics including mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and standard deviation of predictions, while also monitoring the width of confidence intervals as an indicator of uncertainty reduction.

## Key Results
- VAE-generated synthetic samples consistently reduce DNN prediction errors (MAE, RMSE, and standard deviation) across all void fraction outputs
- Confidence interval widths narrow with data augmentation, indicating reduced predictive uncertainty
- Performance improvements plateau after adding approximately 400 synthetic samples, suggesting optimal balance between bias and variance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of VAE-based data augmentation stems from its ability to learn the underlying data distribution from limited experimental data and generate realistic synthetic samples that expand the training space. By training on these augmented datasets, DNNs can learn more robust feature representations and generalize better to unseen data. The VAE's probabilistic nature ensures that generated samples capture the variability present in the original data while maintaining physical plausibility. This expanded training set helps DNNs avoid overfitting to sparse data points and improves their ability to interpolate between known examples. The combination of conformal prediction and Bayesian neural networks provides complementary uncertainty quantification approaches that benefit from the enriched training data, leading to more reliable confidence estimates and reduced prediction uncertainties.

## Foundational Learning
- Variational Autoencoders (VAEs): Why needed - Generate realistic synthetic data by learning data distribution; Quick check - Verify VAE reconstruction quality on validation set
- Conformal Prediction: Why needed - Provide statistically valid confidence intervals for predictions; Quick check - Validate coverage probability meets theoretical guarantees
- Bayesian Neural Networks: Why needed - Quantify prediction uncertainties through probabilistic modeling; Quick check - Compare uncertainty estimates with cross-validation error bars

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: TRACE data -> VAE training -> Synthetic sample generation -> Incremental dataset expansion -> Multiple DNN training -> Performance evaluation -> Uncertainty quantification
Critical path: Data augmentation through VAE generation is the key step that enables subsequent improvements in DNN performance and uncertainty reduction
Design tradeoffs: Balance between synthetic sample quantity (improving generalization) and potential bias introduction (degrading accuracy)
Failure signatures: Performance degradation when VAE distribution mismatch occurs, or when synthetic samples introduce unrealistic patterns
First experiments: 1) Test VAE reconstruction quality on held-out data, 2) Monitor confidence interval coverage as synthetic samples increase, 3) Evaluate whether uncertainty reduction correlates with actual prediction accuracy improvements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results may not generalize to datasets with fundamentally different distributions or noise characteristics
- Reliance on TRACE simulation data may not capture full complexity of real experimental measurements
- Uncertainty reduction claims need further validation to distinguish between genuine reliability improvement and variance reduction from larger training sets

## Confidence
High: VAE-generated synthetic samples improve DNN prediction accuracy when training data is limited
Medium: Uncertainty reduction claims and relationship between confidence interval narrowing and actual prediction quality
Medium: Application of conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification given exchangeability assumptions

## Next Checks
1. Test VAE-based augmentation on experimental datasets with known noise characteristics to validate robustness beyond simulation data
2. Compare uncertainty quantification using conformal prediction against cross-validation error estimates to assess calibration accuracy
3. Evaluate whether the performance plateau at 400 samples persists across different nuclear engineering problems and input feature dimensionalities
