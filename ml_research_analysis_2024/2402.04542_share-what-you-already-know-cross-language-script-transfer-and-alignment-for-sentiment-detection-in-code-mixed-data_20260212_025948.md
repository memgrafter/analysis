# Share What You Already Know: Cross-Language-Script Transfer and Alignment for Sentiment Detection in Code-Mixed Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.04542
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04542
- Reference count: 13
- Weighted F1-scores: 75.09% (Nepali-English), 73.46% (Hindi-English)

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses sentiment detection in code-mixed data where one language is written in romanized script and another in native script. The authors propose a cross-language-script transfer method that leverages pre-trained knowledge from both scripts through language-specific encoders, cross-attention mechanisms, and Earth Mover's Distance (EMD)-based alignment. Experiments on Nepali-English and Hindi-English datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms baseline models, achieving weighted F1-scores of 75.09% and 73.46% respectively. Model interpretation using SHAP reveals effective sharing of language-specific knowledge between representations.

## Method Summary
The proposed method uses two language-specific encoders (MuRIL-based) for romanized and native scripts, followed by cross-attention to transfer knowledge between representations. An EMD-based alignment mechanism minimizes the distance between hidden representations from both encoders while preserving script-specific information. A regularization loss prevents over-alignment. The model is trained using cross-entropy loss combined with alignment and regularization losses, with hyperparameters tuned via grid search. The approach aims to leverage the richer semantic representations available when text is in its native script compared to romanized forms.

## Key Results
- Achieved weighted F1-scores of 75.09% on Nepali-English and 73.46% on Hindi-English datasets
- Outperformed baseline models including Multilingual BERT, XLM-T, and MuRIL
- SHAP interpretation revealed sharing of language-specific knowledge between representations
- Error analysis highlighted need for better cleaning of romanized data to improve performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Cross-language-script transfer improves sentiment detection by leveraging pre-trained knowledge from both scripts
- Mechanism: Language-specific encoders for each script with cross-attention to share semantic knowledge between representations
- Core assumption: Native script representations are more semantically meaningful than romanized forms for pre-trained multilingual models
- Break condition: If romanized and native script representations aren't semantically aligned or cross-attention fails to transfer knowledge

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Cross-script alignment using Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) minimizes distance between representations of the same text in different scripts
- Mechanism: Calculates EMD between hidden representations from both language-specific models, encouraging alignment while preserving script-specific information
- Core assumption: Minimizing EMD between script representations improves performance by creating shared semantic space
- Break condition: If alignment causes representations to become too similar, losing script-specific advantages

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Model interpretation using SHAP reveals cross-script transfer enables sharing of language-specific knowledge
- Mechanism: SHAP values show which words influence predictions, demonstrating effective use of both romanized and native script information
- Core assumption: SHAP interpretation accurately reveals contribution of cross-script knowledge sharing
- Break condition: If SHAP interpretation doesn't align with actual model behavior

## Foundational Learning

- **Cross-attention mechanism**: Enables knowledge transfer between representations from different language scripts by allowing each representation to attend to the other. *Quick check: How does cross-attention differ from standard self-attention in transformer models?*

- **Earth Mover's Distance (EMD)**: Provides measure of similarity between probability distributions of script representations, enabling effective alignment without parallel data. *Quick check: Why might EMD be preferred over simpler distance metrics like Euclidean distance for representation alignment?*

- **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**: Allows interpretation of model's decision-making process, revealing how cross-script knowledge transfer influences predictions. *Quick check: What is the key theoretical foundation of SHAP that makes it suitable for model interpretation?*

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Input → Language-specific encoders → Cross-attention → Alignment → Regularization → Output
- **Critical path**: Input → Language-specific encoders → Cross-attention → Alignment → Regularization → Output
- **Design tradeoffs**: 
  - Separate models for each script vs. single multilingual model: Separate models allow better utilization of native script knowledge but increase computational cost
  - EMD alignment vs. simpler alignment methods: EMD provides more comprehensive alignment but is computationally more expensive
  - Cross-attention vs. concatenation of representations: Cross-attention allows more nuanced knowledge transfer but adds complexity
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Performance drops when switching between romanized and native script inputs
  - Alignment loss dominates training, causing representations to become too similar
  - SHAP interpretation shows minimal contribution from one script's knowledge
  - Model fails to generalize to unseen code-mixed examples
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Ablation study: Compare model performance with and without cross-attention to validate knowledge transfer mechanism
  2. Layer analysis: Test different layer combinations for alignment to find optimal representation extraction points
  3. Script swap: Train on romanized script and test on native script (and vice versa) to measure cross-script generalization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the impact of standardizing romanized Nepali on sentiment analysis performance?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Error analysis revealed misclassifications mainly due to absence of standardized approach for writing Nepali using Latin/Roman script
- Why unresolved: Paper suggests standardization can enhance performance but doesn't quantify this impact
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with standardized romanized Nepali dataset and comparing performance

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the proposed model handle code-mixed text involving languages with different syntactic structures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper acknowledges challenge when transfer involves languages with different syntactic structures (e.g., Nepali/Hindi SOV vs English SVO)
- Why unresolved: While acknowledging the challenge, paper doesn't provide detailed analysis or solution
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating model's performance on code-mixed datasets with different syntactic structures

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of i-th layer for alignment and regularization affect the model's performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper mentions optimal performance frequently achieved around layers preceding last layers
- Why unresolved: Paper provides some insights but doesn't explore full range of possibilities or comprehensive analysis
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with wider range of i-th layer choices and analyzing performance on various datasets

## Limitations
- Quality of romanized text preprocessing identified as potential performance bottleneck
- Limited detailed implementation specifications for critical components like EMD loss computation
- Absolute F1-scores suggest substantial room for improvement in code-mixed sentiment detection
- Performance gains may not generalize beyond Nepali-English and Hindi-English language pairs

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims:**
- Cross-attention mechanism effectively transfers knowledge between language-specific representations
- Proposed method outperforms baseline models on both datasets
- Native script representations are more semantically meaningful than romanized forms

**Medium Confidence Claims:**
- EMD-based alignment approach minimizes distance while preserving script-specific information
- Regularization loss effectively prevents over-alignment
- Performance improvements primarily driven by cross-script knowledge transfer

**Low Confidence Claims:**
- Specific hyperparameter choices are optimal for this task
- Transliteration quality using IndicXlit library is sufficient
- Observed performance gains would generalize to other language pairs

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-attention Ablation Study**: Systematically remove cross-attention mechanism and retrain model to quantify exact contribution of knowledge transfer to overall performance. Compare weighted F1-scores with and without cross-attention.

2. **Script-Swap Generalization Test**: Train model exclusively on romanized script data and evaluate on native script test sets (and vice versa). This tests whether alignment mechanism truly enables cross-script generalization or if model learns to process both scripts independently.

3. **Layer-wise Alignment Analysis**: Conduct experiments testing alignment at different transformer layers (e.g., layers 4, 8, 12) to identify whether proposed layer selection is optimal. Plot F1-scores against alignment layer position to determine if current choice maximizes knowledge transfer effectiveness.
