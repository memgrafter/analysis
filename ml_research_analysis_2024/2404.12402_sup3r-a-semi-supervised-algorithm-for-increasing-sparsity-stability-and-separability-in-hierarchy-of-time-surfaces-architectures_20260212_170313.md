# Sup3r: A Semi-Supervised Algorithm for increasing Sparsity, Stability, and Separability in Hierarchy Of Time-Surfaces architectures

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.12402
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12402
- Reference count: 21
- Primary result: Sup3r achieves comparable accuracy to ANNs on N-MNIST while reducing processed events by 28%

## Executive Summary
Sup3r is a semi-supervised learning algorithm designed to enhance the performance of Hierarchy of Time-Surfaces (HOTS) networks for event-based data processing. HOTS networks, which use time surfaces and clustering for feature extraction, face challenges in accuracy and compatibility with neuromorphic hardware. Sup3r addresses these limitations by enabling end-to-end online training, extracting class-informative patterns, rejecting confounding features, and reducing the number of processed events. The algorithm leverages semi-supervised learning to improve sparsity, stability, and separability in HOTS networks, facilitating continual and incremental learning without forgetting.

## Method Summary
Sup3r is a semi-supervised learning algorithm that improves HOTS networks by enabling end-to-end online training. It uses a feedback-time-vector to aggregate outputs and compute a descriptor S that measures sparsity, stability, and separability. Positive S increases centroids toward relevant features; negative S pushes them away. Thresholds are adapted to reject non-relevant events, reducing computation. The algorithm combines unsupervised local signals and supervised global signals to enable continual learning and adaptation to distribution shifts.

## Key Results
- Achieves comparable accuracy to similarly sized ANNs trained with backpropagation on N-MNIST dataset
- Reduces the number of processed events by 28%
- Enables end-to-end online training without external classifiers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Sup3r learns class-relevant features by rejecting non-class-relevant events through feedback-driven threshold adaptation.
- Mechanism: The feedback-time-vector (ftv) aggregates outputs from the final layer, computes a descriptor S that measures sparsity, stability, and separability. Positive S increases centroids toward relevant features; negative S pushes them away. Thresholds are adjusted to reject non-relevant events.
- Core assumption: The feedback signal can accurately distinguish class-relevant from irrelevant features.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Sup3r learns class-informative patterns, mitigates confounding features, and reduces the number of processed events."
  - [section] "The first term allows centroids to only move in the direction of a set of features when they are associated with an increase in S."
- Break condition: If feedback signal fails to differentiate class-relevant from irrelevant features, the algorithm will learn noise and lose accuracy.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Sup3r enables continual and incremental learning by combining unsupervised and supervised signals.
- Mechanism: Local signal from the next layer (unsupervised) keeps centroids adapting to distribution shifts. Global signal G (supervised) ensures class separability. This allows adaptation without forgetting.
- Core assumption: Unsupervised local signal is sufficient to maintain feature relevance during continual learning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Moreover, Sup3r facilitates continual and incremental learning, allowing adaptation to data distribution shifts and learning new tasks without forgetting."
  - [section] "It is important to note that the local signal is entirely unsupervised, as there is no need to know the correct label to calculate it."
- Break condition: If unsupervised signal fails to maintain feature relevance during continual learning, the network will forget previously learned tasks.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Sup3r reduces the number of processed events by rejecting non-class-relevant events through threshold adaptation.
- Mechanism: Individual thresholds thk_n are adjusted based on feedback signal S. Events falling outside thresholds are rejected, reducing computation and energy consumption.
- Core assumption: Threshold adaptation effectively filters out non-class-relevant events without losing important information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Sup3r enhances sparsity, stability, and separability in the HOTS networks."
  - [section] "We also update nearby thresholds with a competitive rule to reduce the number of events produced by the network."
- Break condition: If threshold adaptation becomes too aggressive, it may reject important class-relevant events, reducing accuracy.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Time Surfaces and Time Vectors
  - Why needed here: Time surfaces encode relative timing between events, forming the basis for feature extraction in HOTS networks.
  - Quick check question: How do time surfaces differ from traditional image representations?
- Concept: Clustering and Feature Extraction
  - Why needed here: HOTS uses clustering (e.g., k-means) to extract recurring patterns from time surfaces.
  - Quick check question: Why might clustering be preferred over supervised learning for initial feature extraction?
- Concept: Feedback Mechanisms in Neural Networks
  - Why needed here: Sup3r uses feedback from the output layer to guide learning in earlier layers.
  - Quick check question: How does feedback from the output layer influence learning in earlier layers?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Time surface generation -> Clustering -> Feedback-time-vector -> Learning rule (Sup3r) -> Threshold adaptation -> Classification
- Critical path: Time surface generation -> Clustering -> Feedback-time-vector -> Learning rule -> Threshold adaptation -> Classification
- Design tradeoffs: Sup3r trades off computational complexity for improved accuracy and reduced energy consumption. The use of feedback mechanisms and threshold adaptation adds complexity but enables continual and incremental learning.
- Failure signatures: Loss of accuracy due to failure to distinguish class-relevant from irrelevant features, failure to adapt to distribution shifts, or excessive rejection of important events.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test Sup3r on a simple synthetic dataset to verify feature extraction and classification accuracy.
  2. Evaluate Sup3r's ability to adapt to distribution shifts by introducing class shifts in the synthetic dataset.
  3. Test Sup3r's incremental learning capability by training on multiple tasks sequentially.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How does Sup3r compare to other neuromorphic algorithms like Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) trained with backpropagation through time in terms of accuracy, latency, and energy efficiency on various datasets?
- How does the choice of hyperparameters (e.g., learning rates, time constants, number of centroids) affect the performance of Sup3r, and what is the optimal set of hyperparameters for different tasks and datasets?
- How does Sup3r perform on more complex datasets and deep-layered architectures, and what are the limitations of the algorithm in terms of scalability and generalization?
- How can Sup3r be adapted to work with other popular Spiking Neural Network models like Integrate and Fire neurons, and what are the challenges and benefits of such adaptations?

## Limitations

- Evaluation is based solely on the N-MNIST dataset, which may not generalize to other event-based datasets or real-world applications.
- Performance comparison with other HOTS variants and traditional ANNs is limited, making it difficult to assess the algorithm's relative advantages.
- The paper does not provide detailed information on hyperparameter tuning, which is crucial for reproducing and optimizing the algorithm's performance.

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate Sup3r on multiple event-based datasets (e.g., DVS128 Gesture, N-Caltech101) to assess generalization and robustness.
2. Conduct a detailed ablation study to quantify the contributions of each mechanism (feature extraction, continual learning, event reduction) to overall performance.
3. Implement and test Sup3r on neuromorphic hardware to verify the claimed energy efficiency improvements and assess real-world applicability.
