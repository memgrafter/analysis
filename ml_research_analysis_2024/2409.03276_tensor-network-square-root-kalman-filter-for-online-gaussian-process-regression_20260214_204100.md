## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Tensor Network Square Root Kalman Filter (TNSRKF), a novel approach for online Gaussian process regression that addresses the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional recursive estimation problems. The TNSRKF overcomes the positive definiteness issue present in the state-of-the-art Tensor Network Kalman Filter (TNKF) by computing the square root covariance factor in tensor train (TT) format instead of the full covariance matrix. The method demonstrates successful estimation of 4^14 parameters on a standard laptop while maintaining numerical stability and providing superior prediction accuracy compared to existing approaches.

## Method Summary
The TNSRKF represents the M×M square root covariance factor as a tensor train matrix (TTm), allowing for efficient recursive updates while maintaining numerical stability. The method uses alternating linear scheme (ALS) optimization to update both the weight mean and covariance factor in TT format. This approach computes the square root of the covariance matrix rather than the full covariance matrix, avoiding the positive definiteness issues that plague the TNKF. The recursive updates maintain the TT format throughout, enabling scalable computation for high-dimensional problems. The method is equivalent to the conventional Kalman filter when using full-rank TTs but provides significant advantages for sparse representations.

## Key Results
- Successfully estimated 4^14 parameters on a standard laptop using TNSRKF
- Demonstrated superior prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification compared to TNKF
- Effective performance on real-life system identification using cascaded tanks benchmark data
- Maintains numerical stability while scaling to high-dimensional problems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The TNSRKF works by leveraging the tensor train decomposition to represent the square root of the covariance matrix in a compressed format. Instead of storing and updating the full M×M covariance matrix, which becomes intractable for large M, the method stores the Cholesky factor in TT format. This reduces the storage complexity from O(M^2) to O(Mrd^2), where r is the TT-rank and d is the problem dimension. The alternating linear scheme optimization efficiently updates both the mean and covariance factor while preserving the TT structure. This approach maintains the numerical properties of the square root filter (avoiding loss of positive definiteness) while achieving the scalability benefits of tensor network methods.

## Foundational Learning

**Tensor Train (TT) Decomposition**: Factorizes high-dimensional tensors into a chain of 3rd-order tensors. Why needed: Enables representation of exponentially large covariance matrices with polynomial storage complexity. Quick check: Verify that TT-ranks remain bounded during recursive updates.

**Square Root Kalman Filter**: Computes the Cholesky factor of the covariance matrix rather than the covariance itself. Why needed: Maintains numerical stability by avoiding loss of positive definiteness in covariance updates. Quick check: Confirm that updated covariance factors remain positive definite.

**Alternating Linear Scheme (ALS)**: Iterative optimization method for updating TT representations. Why needed: Provides efficient way to update tensor network parameters while maintaining format constraints. Quick check: Monitor ALS convergence rates across different problem scales.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: GP Model -> Kernel Matrix -> Tensor Train Mean -> Tensor Train Covariance Root -> ALS Updates -> Prediction

**Critical Path**: Measurement update → TT covariance root update (ALS) → TT mean update (ALS) → Prediction

**Design Tradeoffs**: TT-rank selection balances accuracy vs. computational cost; higher ranks improve approximation quality but increase storage and computation time. The ALS optimization trades convergence speed for implementation simplicity and guaranteed format preservation.

**Failure Signatures**: Rank deficiency leading to ill-conditioned updates; ALS convergence failure indicating poor initialization or inappropriate TT-ranks; numerical instability when TT-ranks grow unbounded during recursion.

**First Experiments**:
1. Implement TNSRKF on synthetic GP regression with known solution to verify correctness
2. Compare TNSRKF vs TNKF on benchmark problems with varying dimensions
3. Test rank-adaptive TNSRKF on time-varying systems to assess tracking performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but several areas remain unexplored including systematic rank selection strategies, convergence analysis for rank-adaptive variants, and comprehensive comparison with alternative tensor network formats.

## Limitations
- Numerical stability claims require validation across diverse real-world applications beyond benchmark problems
- ALS optimization convergence properties in high-dimensional settings remain incompletely characterized
- TT-rank selection methodology lacks a comprehensive theoretical framework for automatic rank determination
- Computational complexity analysis focuses on storage rather than full operation counts

## Next Checks

1. Systematic comparison against alternative tensor-based Kalman filtering approaches (e.g., hierarchical tensor formats, tensor ring decompositions) on standardized benchmarks

2. Rigorous convergence analysis of ALS optimization for rank-adaptive TNSRKF across varying problem conditions

3. Implementation and testing on a large-scale industrial system identification problem with >10^6 parameters to verify claimed scalability limits
