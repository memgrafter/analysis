# DreamStruct: Understanding Slides and User Interfaces via Synthetic Data Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.00201
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00201
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Synthetic data generation method for slides and UIs achieved 10.95% improvement in slide element recognition and 5.20% improvement in UI element recognition

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of manually collecting and annotating data for computational understanding of structured visuals like slides and user interfaces. The authors introduce a synthetic data generation method that uses code generation to create labeled visual datasets. By generating HTML with embedded semantic attributes and rendering them into images, the method produces structured visuals with built-in labels. The approach creates two synthetic datasets - DreamSlides (10,053 slides) and DreamUI (9,774 UIs) - and demonstrates performance improvements across element recognition, image captioning, and image classification tasks compared to models trained on human-annotated data.

## Method Summary
The method involves a three-phase pipeline: (1) Ideation - generating design concepts using an LLM from seed examples and design principles, (2) Generation - producing labeled HTML/CSS/JavaScript code from descriptions with embedded semantic attributes for annotations, and (3) Production - post-processing code, rendering to images, filtering low-quality samples, and replacing placeholders with real images. The approach leverages GPT-4 to generate diverse design concepts and code, then uses rendering and filtering to produce final synthetic datasets suitable for training computer vision models.

## Key Results
- 10.95% improvement in slide element recognition by training on synthetic slides
- 5.20% improvement in UI element recognition by pretraining on synthetic UIs
- Performance gains across three tasks: element recognition, image captioning, and image classification
- Synthetic datasets (DreamSlides and DreamUI) contain 10,053 and 9,774 samples respectively

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Code generation enables structured visual understanding by embedding task-specific labels directly into the visual layout. The pipeline uses HTML with embedded semantic attributes (e.g., data-type, name="screentype") to carry labels during rendering, so the visual output is tied to structured metadata. Core assumption: Semantic HTML with embedded attributes preserves label alignment when rendered into images. Evidence: "generate synthetic, structured visuals with target labels using code generation" and "we instruct the LLM to add additional semantic HTML attributes as the targeted annotations". Break condition: If rendering alters or removes the embedded metadata, or if the generated HTML does not conform to valid HTML/CSS, the label-image alignment fails.

### Mechanism 2
Synthetic data diversity compensates for limited human-annotated data by covering design variations that are hard to capture manually. The pipeline generates large volumes of diverse slides/UI layouts by varying descriptions, applying design principles, and using image generation APIs for variability. Core assumption: Synthetic diversity approximates real-world variability sufficiently for pretraining and fine-tuning. Evidence: "performance improvements... with gains such as 10.95% improvement in slide element recognition" and "the generated corpus of design concepts are consistent with descriptions maintain the pairwise BERTscore < 0.7". Break condition: If synthetic examples are too divergent from real-world distributions, model performance may degrade when applied to real data.

### Mechanism 3
Transfer learning from synthetic to real data works because the synthetic data provides a broad initialization of visual concepts. Models pretrained on synthetic datasets are fine-tuned on small amounts of human-annotated data, leveraging synthetic pretraining to reach performance levels close to fully supervised models. Core assumption: Synthetic pretraining establishes useful feature representations that transfer to real tasks. Evidence: "achieved 10.95% improvement by training on synthetic slides... 5.20% improvement by pretraining on synthetic UIs" and "we adopted a two-stage training approach... pretraining step is crucial as it initializes the model's weights with knowledge gained from the synthetic UI data". Break condition: If the synthetic and real data distributions differ too greatly, fine-tuning may not bridge the gap and performance may plateau.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: HTML/CSS rendering and semantic attributes
  - Why needed here: The method relies on generating HTML with embedded labels, so understanding how semantic attributes survive rendering is critical.
  - Quick check question: What happens to a `data-type` attribute when an HTML element is rendered to an image?

- Concept: Large language model prompting and temperature control
  - Why needed here: The pipeline uses LLM-generated design concepts; controlling diversity via temperature affects dataset quality.
  - Quick check question: How does changing the temperature parameter affect the diversity of generated descriptions?

- Concept: Transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies
  - Why needed here: The method combines synthetic pretraining with fine-tuning on human data, so understanding when and how to fine-tune is essential.
  - Quick check question: Why might pretraining on synthetic data improve performance even when fine-tuning on a small real dataset?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Ideation -> Generation -> Production -> Model training -> Evaluation
- Critical path: Ideation → Generation → Production → Model training → Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Diversity vs. realism: Higher temperature increases variety but may reduce label accuracy
  - Synthetic scale vs. annotation cost: Large synthetic datasets offset the need for expensive human annotation
  - Rendering fidelity vs. speed: Complex layouts take longer to render but may improve realism
- Failure signatures:
  - Low CLIP score after rendering → visual-text alignment broken
  - CSS/HTML errors in generated code → layout issues or missing elements
  - Overlaps or overflow in rendered images → poor design quality
  - Model overfitting to synthetic styles → poor generalization to real data
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Generate 100 synthetic slides with fixed design principles and check if embedded labels survive rendering
  2. Train a small object detector on synthetic data and evaluate on a real slide dataset
  3. Vary temperature in design concept generation and measure impact on model performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the quality of generated code (e.g., HTML/CSS) impact the downstream model performance for element recognition and image captioning tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that "sometimes the generated layouts fail to follow the specific guidelines, or the generated code adds the metadata into the wrong place" and that "this results in CSS styling errors as well as overflow and overlaps in the generated layouts."
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a systematic analysis of how code generation quality affects model performance. It only mentions that some errors occur and could be fixed during post-processing.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled experiment varying the quality of generated code and measuring its impact on model performance for the different tasks (element recognition, image captioning, image classification) would provide concrete evidence.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the visual content generation process (e.g., using Bing Image Search and DALL-E) impact the overall quality and diversity of the synthetic datasets, particularly for UI elements?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that "the generated images may not be consistent in style throughout the layout" because they don't pass additional contextual information for the screen.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of how the visual content generation process affects the overall quality and diversity of the synthetic datasets. It only mentions the potential issue of style inconsistency.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis of the visual content generated for different types of UI elements and its impact on the quality and diversity of the synthetic datasets would provide concrete evidence.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the synthetic data generation process be extended to handle more complex visual elements and design patterns beyond slides and UIs?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on slides and UIs as the primary application domains, but the method is described as "applicable to various types of structured visuals."
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the potential for extending the synthetic data generation process to other types of structured visuals, such as charts, diagrams, or infographics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the synthetic data generation process to other types of structured visuals and evaluating its effectiveness would provide concrete evidence.

## Limitations
- Approach relies heavily on quality of LLM-generated design concepts and code, which may introduce systematic biases
- Performance gains demonstrated primarily on controlled tasks; generalization to broader real-world scenarios remains untested
- Rendering pipeline assumes standard HTML/CSS compliance, but complex layouts may not render consistently across different browsers or rendering engines

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The three-phase pipeline structure (Ideation → Generation → Production) is technically sound and well-defined; the use of semantic HTML attributes for label preservation during rendering is a reliable mechanism; the reported performance improvements on controlled benchmarks are reproducible given access to the synthetic datasets
- Medium Confidence: The synthetic data diversity sufficiently approximates real-world variability for effective pretraining; transfer learning from synthetic to real data works as described for the tested tasks; the CLIP-based filtering effectively ensures visual-text alignment quality
- Low Confidence: The scalability of this approach to other visual domains beyond slides and UIs; long-term model performance as the synthetic data distribution diverges from evolving real-world designs; the robustness of the method against adversarial or unusual design patterns

## Next Checks
1. Test model performance on a held-out real-world dataset not used in fine-tuning to assess generalization
2. Conduct ablation studies varying temperature parameters in design concept generation to quantify impact on model performance
3. Measure annotation cost savings by comparing time required to create equivalent human-annotated datasets versus synthetic generation
