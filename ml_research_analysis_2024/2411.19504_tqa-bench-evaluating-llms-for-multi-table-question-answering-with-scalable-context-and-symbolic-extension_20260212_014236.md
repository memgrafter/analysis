core_contribution: TQA-Bench introduces a new multi-table QA benchmark for evaluating
  LLMs on complex relational data, addressing the gap left by single-table benchmarks.
  It uses real-world public datasets, a sampling mechanism to vary context lengths
  (8K-64K tokens), and symbolic extensions to assess reasoning beyond pattern matching.

# TQA-Bench: Evaluating LLMs for Multi-Table Question Answering with Scalable Context and Symbolic Extension

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.19504
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19504
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Multi-table QA benchmark revealing LLM limitations in cross-table reasoning and long-context scenarios

## Executive Summary
TQA-Bench introduces a comprehensive multi-table question answering benchmark to evaluate large language models on complex relational data tasks. Unlike existing single-table benchmarks, TQA-Bench uses real-world public datasets with varying context lengths (8K-64K tokens) and introduces symbolic extensions to test reasoning capabilities beyond pattern matching. The benchmark evaluates 22 LLMs across different sizes and types, revealing significant performance gaps between single and multi-table reasoning, as well as challenges with longer context windows.

## Method Summary
TQA-Bench employs a systematic sampling strategy to create datasets with varying context lengths, from 8K to 64K tokens, using real-world public datasets. The benchmark includes both standard multi-table questions and symbolic extensions designed to test reasoning beyond pattern matching. Evaluations span 22 models including both general-purpose and specialized table-oriented LLMs, with performance measured across different serialization formats (CSV vs Markdown) and instruction-following capabilities.

## Key Results
- General-purpose LLMs consistently outperform specialized table-oriented models
- Performance drops significantly with increased context length (64.0% at 8K tokens to 43.7% at 64K tokens)
- Only 37.0% accuracy on complex multi-table queries versus 81.3% on simpler cases
- Chat models perform poorly due to instruction-following issues
- Markdown serialization outperforms CSV for table representation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TQA-Bench works by systematically varying context complexity and length to reveal model limitations that simpler benchmarks miss. The symbolic extensions force models to demonstrate genuine reasoning rather than relying on memorized patterns, while the scalable context design exposes retrieval and processing challenges that become critical in real-world applications with large datasets.

## Foundational Learning

**Multi-table relational reasoning**: Understanding how to join and query across multiple related tables
- Why needed: Single-table benchmarks don't capture the complexity of real-world database operations
- Quick check: Can the model correctly identify join keys and aggregate across related tables?

**Context length scalability**: Processing and reasoning over long document contexts
- Why needed: Real-world applications often involve large datasets that exceed typical context windows
- Quick check: Does performance degrade predictably as context length increases?

**Symbolic reasoning**: Applying logical rules and abstract patterns rather than surface matching
- Why needed: To distinguish genuine understanding from pattern memorization
- Quick check: Can the model solve novel problems that follow consistent logical rules?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Question -> Table context sampling -> Context window management -> Answer generation -> Evaluation
**Critical path**: Question parsing → Table retrieval/selection → Context window assembly → Reasoning → Answer generation
**Design tradeoffs**: General vs specialized models (specialized underperform), serialization format (Markdown > CSV), context window management (full context vs retrieval)
**Failure signatures**: Performance collapse at longer contexts, poor cross-table joins, inability to handle symbolic extensions
**First experiments**: 1) Test performance variation across context lengths, 2) Compare general vs specialized models on identical tasks, 3) Evaluate different table serialization formats

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper identifies several key open questions: whether fine-tuning specialized table models on TQA-Bench data can improve their relative performance, how different context window management strategies affect long-context performance, and the generalizability of findings to more complex real-world schemas with noisier data.

## Limitations

- Benchmark primarily uses public datasets with relatively clean schemas
- Limited evaluation of proprietary or more complex real-world schemas
- Results may not generalize to extremely large or heterogeneous datasets
- Focus on English-language datasets may limit cross-lingual applicability

## Confidence

- Benchmark construction methodology: High
- Performance comparisons across model families: High
- Generalizability to non-public datasets: Medium
- Real-world applicability to complex schemas: Medium

## Next Checks

1. Test benchmark with proprietary datasets featuring more complex schemas and noisier data to assess real-world applicability
2. Evaluate whether fine-tuning specialized table models on TQA-Bench data improves their performance relative to general models
3. Investigate the impact of different context window management strategies on the observed performance degradation at longer context lengths
