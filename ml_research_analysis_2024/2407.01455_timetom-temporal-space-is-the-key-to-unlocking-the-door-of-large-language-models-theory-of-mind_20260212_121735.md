# TimeToM: Temporal Space is the Key to Unlocking the Door of Large Language Models' Theory-of-Mind

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.01455
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01455
- Reference count: 15
- Primary result: TimeToM improves LLM Theory-of-Mind reasoning by 25-31% across benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of Theory-of-Mind (ToM) reasoning in large language models by introducing TimeToM, a method that constructs temporal space and uses it as a foundation to improve ToM capabilities. The approach leverages temporal reasoning to track when characters become aware of events, constructing Temporal Belief State Chains (TBSC) that distinguish between self-world and social world beliefs. A novel belief solver tool transforms higher-order ToM questions into first-order ones by identifying belief communication periods between characters.

## Method Summary
TimeToM improves LLM Theory-of-Mind reasoning through temporal space construction and belief state tracking. The method constructs a timeline for each story or dialogue, then builds Temporal Belief State Chains (TBSC) for each character based on their awareness of events. These TBSCs are divided into self-world beliefs (focused on object states and personal observations) and social world beliefs (focused on other characters' actions). For higher-order ToM questions, a belief solver identifies communication periods between characters and transforms the questions into first-order ones within those periods.

## Key Results
- 31% improvement on ToMI benchmark for second-order questions
- 25% improvement on BigToM benchmark for higher-order questions
- Significant gains in robustness and coherence compared to baseline methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Constructing temporal space improves LLM ToM performance by providing explicit temporal grounding for events and character awareness.
- Mechanism: Adding explicit timeline markers to stories and dialogues allows LLMs to clearly track when each character becomes aware of specific events, reducing confusion about belief states across time.
- Core assumption: LLMs lack implicit temporal reasoning capabilities and benefit from explicit temporal scaffolding.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We present TimeToM, which constructs a temporal space and uses it as the foundation to improve the ToM capabilities of LLMs in multiple scenarios."
  - [section] "Within the temporal space, we construct Temporal Belief State Chain (TBSC) for each character based on the events they are aware of on the timeline"
  - [corpus] Weak - neighbors discuss ToM reasoning but not specifically temporal scaffolding
- Break condition: If LLMs develop better implicit temporal reasoning, the explicit timeline construction may become unnecessary overhead.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Belief solver transforms higher-order ToM questions into first-order questions by identifying belief communication periods.
- Mechanism: By computing intersections of characters' perceptible time sets, the belief solver identifies when characters share belief information, allowing higher-order questions to be reframed as first-order questions within those communication periods.
- Core assumption: Higher-order ToM reasoning fundamentally relies on tracking belief communication between characters, which can be algorithmically identified.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Moreover, we design a novel tool—belief solver that, by considering belief communication between characters in temporal space, can transform a character's higher-order beliefs into another character's first-order beliefs under belief communication period."
  - [section] "We design a novel tool—belief solver, which first parses each character's perceptible time set based on their TBSC and then calculates the intersections of the time set of different characters to determine at which times they achieve belief communication."
  - [corpus] Weak - neighbors discuss ToM but not belief communication transformation
- Break condition: If belief communication patterns become too complex for simple time-set intersection, the transformation may fail.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Splitting TBSC into self-world and social world beliefs aligns with first-order and higher-order ToM question types.
- Mechanism: Self-world beliefs (focused on object states and personal observations) are used for first-order questions, while social world beliefs (focused on other characters' actions) are incorporated for higher-order questions.
- Core assumption: The cognitive distinction between self-world and social world beliefs maps cleanly onto the distinction between first-order and higher-order ToM questions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "inspired by the cognition perspective of the social world model, we divide TBSC into self-world beliefs and social world beliefs, aligning with first-order ToM (first-order beliefs) and higher-order ToM (higher-order beliefs) questions, respectively."
  - [section] "inspired by a principle of modern cognitive science...which posits that humans construct abstract models of the social world and their self-world in their minds, we split the beliefs in TBSC into self-world belief and social world belief."
  - [corpus] Moderate - neighbors discuss social reasoning but not this specific self-world/social-world distinction
- Break condition: If ToM questions don't cleanly map to this distinction, the approach may misclassify question types.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Temporal reasoning in narrative understanding
  - Why needed here: ToM questions often depend on tracking when characters learn information, requiring explicit temporal reasoning
  - Quick check question: Given a story where Alice leaves the room before Bob moves an object, can you determine what Alice knows when she returns?

- Concept: Theory of Mind hierarchy (first-order vs higher-order reasoning)
  - Why needed here: The method specifically distinguishes between questions about direct beliefs (first-order) and beliefs about beliefs (higher-order)
  - Quick check question: In the Sally-Anne test, is the question "Where will Sally look for the object?" first-order or higher-order?

- Concept: Belief state tracking across multiple agents
  - Why needed here: ToM requires tracking what each character knows and when they know it, especially when characters have different information
  - Quick check question: If three characters each observe different parts of an event sequence, can you construct their individual belief states?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Timeline construction -> TBSC construction -> Belief type determination -> Question answering (with belief solver for higher-order questions)
- Critical path: Timeline construction → TBSC construction → Belief type determination → Question answering (with belief solver for higher-order questions)
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Explicit temporal scaffolding vs implicit reasoning (more explicit = more reliable but less generalizable)
  - Belief solver as prompt vs feedback (feedback allows LLM to integrate its own reasoning)
  - Self-world vs social world separation (simplifies first-order questions but may miss nuanced interactions)
- Failure signatures:
  - Incorrect timeline construction leading to wrong TBSC
  - Belief solver producing wrong communication periods due to TBSC errors
  - Self-world/social-world misclassification causing wrong question type handling
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test baseline LLM performance vs LLM with only timeline construction on ToMI benchmark
  2. Verify belief solver correctly identifies communication periods by manual inspection on sample dialogues
  3. Compare performance when using belief solver as prompt vs feedback on higher-order ToM questions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does TimeToM's performance scale with increasingly longer and more complex dialogues in the FanToM benchmark, particularly when involving multiple characters and numerous subtopics?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that FanToM dialogues are significantly longer and involve more characters and subtopics, posing greater challenges for LLMs. However, the paper does not provide specific results on how TimeToM performs as dialogue complexity increases.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not include experiments that systematically vary dialogue length and complexity to assess TimeToM's performance limits.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with FanToM dialogues of varying lengths and complexities, and reporting TimeToM's performance metrics for each category, would provide insights into its scalability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can TimeToM be effectively adapted for multimodal Theory-of-Mind reasoning, integrating text with other modalities like images or audio?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly states that TimeToM focuses on textual modality and treats multimodal ToM reasoning as future work.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore or provide any preliminary results on extending TimeToM to handle multimodal inputs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing a multimodal version of TimeToM on datasets that include both text and other modalities, and comparing its performance to the original TimeToM, would demonstrate its effectiveness in multimodal scenarios.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the effectiveness of TimeToM's belief solver vary with different model sizes, particularly for models with fewer than 7 billion parameters?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the belief solver relies on accurate TBSC construction and notes that models with fewer than 7 billion parameters may have higher error rates in constructing TBSCs, affecting the belief solver's effectiveness.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide empirical data on how TimeToM performs with smaller models or quantify the impact of model size on the belief solver's effectiveness.
- What evidence would resolve it: Running TimeToM on models with varying parameter sizes (e.g., 1B, 3B, 7B) and analyzing the accuracy of TBSC construction and the subsequent impact on belief solver performance would clarify this relationship.

## Limitations
- Exact prompt templates for each component are not provided in the main text
- Specific implementation details of the belief solver tool are unclear
- Performance on real-world scenarios with complex belief dynamics is unknown
- Scalability to multimodal ToM reasoning is unexplored

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The core claim that explicit temporal scaffolding improves ToM reasoning is well-supported by the experimental results and aligns with cognitive science principles about temporal reasoning.
- **Medium Confidence**: The belief solver mechanism for transforming higher-order questions is plausible given the experimental improvements, but the specific implementation details are unclear.
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability of the self-world/social-world distinction across diverse ToM scenarios, as the method may not cleanly map to all question types.

## Next Checks
1. **Timeline Construction Validation**: Manually verify that the temporal space construction correctly identifies character awareness of events in a sample of stories from the benchmarks.
2. **Belief Solver Accuracy Test**: Test the belief solver's identification of communication periods by checking whether its time-set intersections match human annotations for sample dialogues.
3. **Generalization Assessment**: Apply the method to a novel dataset with more complex belief dynamics to evaluate performance beyond the benchmark scenarios.
