# Mining Potentially Explanatory Patterns via Partial Solutions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.04388
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04388
- Reference count: 35
- Primary result: Partial Solutions (PSs) improve explainability of GAs for combinatorial optimization without compromising search performance

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Partial Solutions (PSs) as a novel mechanism to enhance the explainability of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for combinatorial optimization problems. PSs represent explicit decompositions of beneficial traits found in high-fitness solutions, providing both global and local explanations. The proposed algorithm assembles PSs by balancing fitness, simplicity, and atomicity, and demonstrates consistent ability to find global optima on benchmark problems through a two-phase approach: PS catalog mining followed by pick-and-merge optimization.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes an algorithm that generates Partial Solutions (PSs) by mining high-fitness solutions and decomposing them into simpler, atomic patterns. The process involves two phases: first, a PS catalog is created by allocating 20-60% of fitness evaluations to identify and store beneficial PSs; second, a pick-and-merge algorithm uses these PSs to guide the search toward global optima. The PSs balance three key properties—high fitness, simplicity, and atomicity—to ensure both effectiveness and explainability. Experiments show that this approach maintains search performance while significantly improving the interpretability of solutions.

## Key Results
- PSs consistently find global optima on benchmark combinatorial optimization problems
- The approach improves explainability without compromising search performance
- Recommended allocation of 20-60% of fitness evaluations to PS catalog mining balances effectiveness and efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The PS approach works by explicitly extracting and representing beneficial sub-solutions (Partial Solutions) from high-fitness individuals in the GA population. These PSs act as interpretable building blocks that can be combined to construct high-quality solutions. By maintaining a catalog of these atomic, high-fitness patterns and using them to guide the search process, the algorithm preserves the evolutionary search capability while making the solution construction process more transparent and explainable.

## Foundational Learning
- **Genetic Algorithms**: Evolutionary optimization methods that use selection, crossover, and mutation to find high-fitness solutions. Why needed: Forms the base optimization framework. Quick check: Verify GA operators maintain population diversity.
- **Combinatorial Optimization**: Problems involving finding optimal combinations from finite sets. Why needed: Defines the problem domain. Quick check: Confirm problem constraints are properly encoded.
- **Partial Solutions (PSs)**: Explicit decompositions of beneficial traits from high-fitness solutions. Why needed: Core mechanism for explainability. Quick check: Validate PSs capture meaningful patterns.
- **Atomicity**: Property ensuring PSs are minimal and indivisible. Why needed: Enables clear interpretation and recombination. Quick check: Test PSs cannot be further decomposed without losing fitness.
- **Fitness-Proportionate Selection**: Method of selecting solutions based on their fitness scores. Why needed: Drives the evolutionary process. Quick check: Ensure selection pressure balances exploration and exploitation.
- **Catalog Mining**: Process of identifying and storing beneficial PSs during search. Why needed: Enables reuse of learned patterns. Quick check: Verify catalog captures diverse, high-quality PSs.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: GA Population -> Fitness Evaluation -> PS Catalog Mining -> Pick-and-Merge Algorithm -> Final Solution

Critical Path: Initial population generation → Fitness evaluation → PS catalog mining (20-60% evaluations) → Pick-and-merge optimization → Global optimum

Design Tradeoffs: The 20-60% allocation to PS mining represents a tradeoff between exploration (standard GA search) and exploitation (using learned PSs). Higher allocation improves explainability but reduces standard search capability.

Failure Signatures: If PSs are too complex, they lose interpretability; if too simple, they lose effectiveness. Poor PS selection can lead to premature convergence or suboptimal solutions.

First Experiments:
1. Run the algorithm on a small combinatorial problem with known optima to verify global optimum finding
2. Vary the PS catalog allocation percentage (10%, 40%, 70%) to determine optimal balance
3. Compare solution explainability with standard GA using human evaluation or automated metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalizability to problem types beyond tested combinatorial optimization benchmarks remains unproven
- Computational overhead when scaling to larger problem instances may be significant
- 20-60% allocation recommendation may not be optimal for all problem types
- Limited user-centric validation of explainability improvements

## Confidence
- Algorithm finding global optima on benchmark problems: High
- Effectiveness in improving explainability without compromising search: High
- 20-60% allocation being universally applicable: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test the PS approach on a wider variety of combinatorial optimization problems, including those with different structures and constraints, to assess generalizability.
2. Conduct user studies to empirically measure the perceived explainability improvements and compare them against alternative explanation methods.
3. Analyze the computational overhead and scalability of the PS approach on larger problem instances to determine practical limitations and optimization opportunities.
