# Data-driven grapheme-to-phoneme representations for a lexicon-free text-to-speech

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.10465
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10465
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Lexicon-free G2P approach achieves 3.96 ± 0.05 MOS, outperforming traditional rule-based and neural G2P methods

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a lexicon-free approach to Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) conversion for Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems. The method leverages self-supervised learning with HuBERT to obtain data-driven phoneme representations from unlabeled speech data, eliminating the need for expert-crafted lexicons. The approach involves pre-training HuBERT on unlabeled speech, extracting frame-level phoneme targets using k-means clustering, and training a G2P transformer model on paired phoneme targets and text data. The resulting TTS system achieves a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of 3.96 ± 0.05, demonstrating competitive performance compared to traditional lexicon-based approaches.

## Method Summary
The method uses self-supervised learning to obtain data-driven phoneme representations instead of fixed representations like ARPABET or IPA. It involves pre-training a HuBERT model on unlabeled speech data to learn latent acoustic representations, then using k-means clustering to discover phoneme-like units without linguistic labels. A transformer-based G2P model is trained on paired phoneme targets (extracted from labeled speech) and text data. The resulting phoneme sequences are then used to train a Tacotron 2 TTS model. The entire pipeline is lexicon-free, requiring only paired text and speech data for training.

## Key Results
- Lexicon-free G2P approach achieves MOS of 3.96 ± 0.05
- Outperforms traditional rule-based and neural G2P methods that rely on lexicons
- Demonstrates that data-driven phoneme representations can effectively replace expert-crafted lexicons

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Self-supervised learning with HuBERT eliminates the need for expert-crafted phoneme lexicons.
- Mechanism: HuBERT pre-trains on unlabeled speech to learn latent acoustic representations, then k-means clustering discovers phoneme-like units without linguistic labels.
- Core assumption: Frame-level clusters from HuBERT representations correspond to meaningful phoneme-like units for downstream G2P modeling.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We eliminate both of these issues by using recent advances in self-supervised learning to obtain data-driven phoneme representations instead of fixed representations."
  - [section 3]: "HuBERT encoder e takes ˜X as input and predicts an output distribution over target vocabulary at each time step p(zt| ˜X, t), where zt is frame level target obtained via acoustic unit discovery."
  - [corpus]: Weak - neighbor papers discuss pronunciation-lexicon free ASR but lack direct evidence HuBERT-based phoneme discovery matches linguistic phoneme sets.
- Break condition: If k-means clustering fails to produce stable, repeatable phoneme-like units across speakers or languages, G2P performance degrades.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Using data-driven phoneme sets improves TTS naturalness over fixed phoneme sets.
- Mechanism: Custom phoneme units discovered by HuBERT better capture language-specific phonetic patterns than universal ARPABET/IPA mappings.
- Core assumption: The number of k-means clusters (k=100) is sufficient to represent the language's phonetic inventory.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The lexicons are generated using a fixed phoneme set, usually, ARPABET or IPA, which might not be the most optimal way to represent phonemes for all languages."
  - [section 5.1]: "A total of 3 iterations were performed, and the 9th transformer layer outputs of the final iteration were also used in obtaining final phoneme targets to train the G2P model."
  - [corpus]: Weak - neighbors focus on multilingual or lightweight G2P but don't benchmark data-driven vs fixed phoneme sets directly.
- Break condition: If cluster granularity is too coarse, subtle phonemes merge; if too fine, model overfits and loses generalization.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Lexicon-free G2P enables low-resource language adaptation.
- Mechanism: G2P model learns from paired unlabeled speech-derived phonemes and text without requiring expert lexicon creation.
- Core assumption: Small labeled text corpus combined with abundant unlabeled speech is sufficient for phoneme discovery and G2P training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Building a lexicon is an expensive and highly cumbersome task, as it requires multiple language experts to propose and then verify its validity."
  - [section 4]: "We use the paired (Pi, ti) to train our G2P transformer model as described in Section 2."
  - [corpus]: Missing - no neighbor explicitly demonstrates lexicon-free adaptation for low-resource languages.
- Break condition: If text-to-speech quality drops significantly when moving to low-resource languages due to poor phoneme-text alignment.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Self-supervised learning with HuBERT
  - Why needed here: Enables learning phonetic representations from unlabeled speech, bypassing need for expert lexicon.
  - Quick check question: What role does the 9th transformer layer play in the phoneme discovery process?

- Concept: K-means clustering for acoustic unit discovery
  - Why needed here: Transforms continuous HuBERT embeddings into discrete phoneme-like symbols for G2P training.
  - Quick check question: How does varying k affect phoneme granularity and downstream TTS performance?

- Concept: Sequence-to-sequence transformer G2P modeling
  - Why needed here: Maps grapheme sequences to discovered phoneme sequences for TTS input.
  - Quick check question: Why might transformer G2P outperform RNN-based approaches in this lexicon-free setting?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  HuBERT pre-training -> K-means clustering on 9th layer -> Transformer G2P -> Tacotron 2 TTS

- Critical path:
  1. Pre-train HuBERT on unlabeled speech (LibriSpeech 960h)
  2. Extract 9th layer features from labeled speech (LJSpeech)
  3. Apply k-means clustering → phoneme targets
  4. Train G2P transformer on (phoneme targets, text) pairs
  5. Train Tacotron 2 TTS on (phonemes, audio) pairs

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Cluster count k: Too small loses phonetic detail; too large causes overfitting and model complexity.
  - HuBERT layer choice: Earlier layers capture finer acoustic detail; later layers offer more abstract phoneme-like units.
  - G2P model size: Larger models may capture more complex mappings but risk overfitting with limited data.

- Failure signatures:
  - Low MOS: Indicates poor phoneme-to-speech mapping, likely from noisy phoneme targets or weak G2P training.
  - Unstable phoneme clusters: Shows poor acoustic unit discovery, possibly due to insufficient unlabeled speech data.
  - High G2P PER: Suggests mismatch between discovered phoneme set and grapheme-to-phoneme mapping complexity.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Vary k (50, 100, 150) to find optimal phoneme granularity for English TTS.
  2. Compare MOS between lexicon-free G2P vs rule-based vs neural G2P with lexicon.
  3. Test robustness by training G2P on small labeled set (e.g., 1h) and evaluate TTS quality.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the optimal number of clusters (k) vary across different languages when using the proposed data-driven phoneme representation approach?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that for English, k=100 was optimal based on ablation studies, but this might not be the case for other languages.
- Why unresolved: The paper only explores the optimal k value for English and doesn't investigate how it might differ for other languages with different phonetic characteristics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting similar ablation studies on a diverse set of languages and comparing the optimal k values across them would provide insights into how the phoneme representation requirements vary across languages.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of the lexicon-free G2P approach compare to traditional methods when applied to low-resource languages?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests that the method could be easily extended to low-resource languages as future work, but doesn't provide any empirical evidence for this claim.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on English and doesn't test the approach on low-resource languages, leaving the question of its effectiveness in such scenarios unanswered.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing the proposed approach on several low-resource languages and comparing its performance to traditional lexicon-based methods would provide empirical evidence for its effectiveness in such scenarios.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of using different intermediate layers of the HuBERT model for extracting speech features on the quality of the resulting phoneme representations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using the 9th transformer layer of HuBERT for feature extraction, but doesn't explore the impact of using other layers.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't provide a systematic comparison of using different layers of HuBERT for feature extraction, leaving the question of the optimal layer for this task unanswered.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments using different layers of HuBERT for feature extraction and comparing the quality of the resulting phoneme representations and G2P model performance would provide insights into the optimal layer for this task.

## Limitations
- The optimal number of clusters (k=100) is determined empirically for English only, without cross-linguistic validation
- The approach's effectiveness for low-resource languages remains unproven, despite claims of easy adaptation
- The paper doesn't provide evidence that discovered phoneme clusters correspond to linguistically meaningful units

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The technical feasibility of using HuBERT representations for downstream tasks is well-established. The overall pipeline architecture (HuBERT → clustering → G2P → TTS) follows standard practices in self-supervised learning and sequence modeling.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that data-driven phonemes outperform fixed phoneme sets is partially supported by the MOS results, but lacks direct comparative analysis of phoneme set quality. The assertion that this approach eliminates the need for expert lexicons is valid for the training pipeline but doesn't address deployment considerations.

**Low Confidence**: The claim about improved low-resource language adaptation has no empirical validation in the paper. The mechanism by which discovered phoneme clusters correspond to linguistic phonemes is assumed rather than demonstrated.

## Next Checks

1. **Phoneme Set Quality Analysis**: Compare the discovered 100-cluster phoneme set against standard IPA for English by measuring coverage, uniqueness, and linguistic interpretability. Analyze whether clusters correspond to distinct phonemes or capture contextual variations.

2. **Cross-Lingual Generalization Test**: Apply the same pipeline to a morphologically rich language (e.g., Finnish or Turkish) with limited labeled data to evaluate whether data-driven phoneme discovery provides advantages over fixed phoneme sets in non-English scenarios.

3. **Cluster Sensitivity Study**: Systematically vary the number of clusters (k=50, 100, 150, 200) and measure impacts on both phoneme discovery quality (via clustering metrics) and downstream TTS performance (via MOS and intelligibility metrics).
