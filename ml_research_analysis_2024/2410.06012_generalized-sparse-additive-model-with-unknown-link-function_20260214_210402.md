# Generalized Sparse Additive Model with Unknown Link Function

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.06012
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06012
- Authors: Peipei Yuan; Xinge You; Hong Chen; Xuelin Zhang; Qinmu Peng
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: GSAMUL can simultaneously estimate the link function, component functions, and perform variable selection using bilevel optimization with B-splines and MLP.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces GSAMUL, a novel sparse additive model that can estimate an unknown link function, component functions, and perform variable selection simultaneously. The approach uses B-spline basis functions to represent component functions and a multi-layer perceptron to estimate the link function, with ℓ2,1-norm regularization for sparsity. The estimation is formulated as a bilevel optimization problem, leveraging training and validation data to optimize different components. The method demonstrates strong performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets, even when datasets contain irrelevant variables.

## Method Summary
GSAMUL extends sparse additive models by incorporating an unknown link function, estimated via a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Component functions are represented using B-spline basis functions, with an ℓ2,1-norm regularizer to induce group sparsity for variable selection. The estimation problem is formulated as a bilevel optimization, where the outer problem optimizes the link function parameters using validation data, while the inner problem estimates component functions using training data. This nested structure enables adaptive learning of both smooth and structured components.

## Key Results
- GSAMUL effectively selects informative variables while accurately estimating component and link functions, even with irrelevant variables present.
- The method outperforms baseline approaches (SpAM, GLMUL, GAMUL, PLAMUL) on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
- Theoretical convergence guarantees are provided for the approximate optimization procedure, ensuring reliable performance.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GSAMUL can jointly estimate the unknown link function, component functions, and perform variable selection by leveraging a bilevel optimization framework.
- Mechanism: The outer problem optimizes the link function parameters using validation data, while the inner problem estimates the component functions using training data with an ℓ2,1-norm regularizer for sparsity. This nested structure enables adaptive learning of both smooth and structured components.
- Core assumption: Splitting data into training and validation sets provides independent feedback loops for each subproblem, enabling stable and decoupled optimization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We integrate this estimation into a bilevel optimization problem, where the data is split into training set and validation set."
  - [section III.A] "Calculating the optimal ˆα and ˆθ requires two nested loops of optimization."
- Break condition: If training and validation data are not i.i.d. or if the link function mapping is highly discontinuous, bilevel optimization may not converge reliably.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: B-spline basis functions provide a flexible and computationally efficient representation of component functions.
- Mechanism: Each component function is approximated as a linear combination of truncated B-spline basis functions, allowing smooth, localized adjustments while maintaining interpretability and convexity in the parameter space.
- Core assumption: The true component functions can be well-approximated by a finite linear combination of B-splines with a bounded number of basis functions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section II.B] "Denote the bounded and orthonormal basis functions on X j as {ψ jk : k = 1, · · · , ∞}. Then, the component functions can be written as f j(X j) = P∞ k=1 α jkψ jk(X j)."
  - [section II.B] "Then, we obtain f j(X j) = dXk=1 α jkψ jk(X j)."
- Break condition: If the true function has discontinuities or very high-frequency components, B-splines may require an impractically large number of basis functions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: ℓ2,1-norm regularization induces group sparsity across spline coefficients, enabling simultaneous variable selection and function estimation.
- Mechanism: The penalty ∑j∥αj∥2 encourages entire coefficient vectors for irrelevant variables to shrink to zero, effectively removing them from the model while preserving active variables.
- Core assumption: The number of truly informative variables is small relative to the total number of predictors.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section II.B] "Inspired by this, we employ the ℓ2,1-norm regularizer Ω( f ) = inf{ pXj=1 ∥α j∥2 : f = pXj=1 ΨT j α j, αj ∈ Rd} as the penalty to address the sparsity of the component functions."
  - [section II.B] "If the j-th variable is not truly informative, we expect that α j = (α j1, . . . , αjd)T ∈ Rd satisfies ∥α j∥2 = (Pd k=1 |α jk|2) 1 2 = 0."
- Break condition: If many variables have small but non-zero effects, ℓ2,1 may over-penalize and discard useful predictors.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: B-spline basis representation
  - Why needed here: Provides a smooth, localized, and computationally tractable way to represent nonparametric component functions without resorting to fully nonparametric regression.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a B-spline basis and a Fourier basis in terms of locality and smoothness properties?

- Concept: Bilevel optimization
  - Why needed here: Allows decoupling of link function and component function estimation by using separate validation and training data streams.
  - Quick check question: How does bilevel optimization differ from a single-loop alternating minimization scheme in terms of convergence guarantees?

- Concept: ℓ2,1-norm group sparsity
  - Why needed here: Enables simultaneous selection of entire variables (rather than individual basis coefficients) in additive models, preserving interpretability.
  - Quick check question: Why does ℓ2,1 regularization lead to group-wise sparsity while ℓ1 does not?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data → B-spline basis expansion → Additive part estimation (α) → Link function estimation (θ) → Prediction → Validation → Hyperparameter update

- Critical path: Data → B-spline basis expansion → Additive part estimation (α) → Link function estimation (θ) → Prediction → Validation → Hyperparameter update

- Design tradeoffs:
  - B-splines vs. kernel methods: B-splines offer computational efficiency and interpretability but may need many bases for complex functions.
  - MLP vs. parametric link functions: MLPs are more flexible but increase model complexity and risk overfitting.
  - ℓ2,1 vs. ℓ1 regularization: ℓ2,1 induces group sparsity but may be less sparse than ℓ1.

- Failure signatures:
  - Link function estimates diverge: Likely due to poor bilevel convergence or insufficient validation data.
  - All αj shrink to zero: Likely due to overly aggressive λ or poor basis representation.
  - Component functions fail to capture nonlinearity: Likely due to insufficient B-spline order or too few basis functions.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Synthetic data with known additive structure and link function; verify component and link function recovery.
  2. Synthetic data with irrelevant variables; verify sparsity and variable selection.
  3. Real-world dataset with known interpretable structure; compare RSSE with baseline additive models.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the effect of using different types of neural networks (beyond MLP) to estimate the unknown link function in GSAMUL?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that neural networks can be used to estimate component functions, but uses MLP specifically for the link function.
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates MLP for the link function and does not explore other neural network architectures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments using different neural network architectures (e.g., CNNs, RNNs) for the link function in GSAMUL, showing performance differences.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of GSAMUL scale with the number of irrelevant variables in high-dimensional datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions adding 20 irrelevant variables to real-world datasets, but does not extensively explore high-dimensional scenarios with many irrelevant variables.
- Why unresolved: The experiments with irrelevant variables are limited in scope and do not fully characterize GSAMUL's performance in high-dimensional settings.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extensive experiments with varying numbers of irrelevant variables (e.g., 50, 200, 500) on high-dimensional datasets, showing how GSAMUL's performance changes.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the theoretical justification for using a bilevel optimization framework in GSAMUL?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using bilevel optimization to estimate the link function and component functions, but does not provide a detailed theoretical justification for this choice.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the practical implementation and empirical evaluation of GSAMUL, but does not delve into the theoretical foundations of the bilevel optimization approach.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical analysis comparing the advantages and disadvantages of bilevel optimization versus other optimization frameworks for estimating unknown link functions in GAMs.

## Limitations

- The bilevel optimization approach may not scale well to very high-dimensional problems due to computational complexity.
- Convergence guarantees assume exact solution of the inner problem, but the paper relies on approximate solutions via gradient descent.
- The method's performance in extremely high-dimensional settings with many irrelevant variables is not thoroughly explored.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: GSAMUL can reliably estimate both the link function and component functions while performing variable selection. Supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets.
- **High confidence**: Using B-splines for component functions and an MLP for the link function is well-justified and consistent with existing literature. However, computational efficiency compared to simpler alternatives is not thoroughly evaluated.
- **Medium confidence**: The bilevel optimization framework provides effective decoupling of link function and component function estimation, but scalability to very high-dimensional problems remains uncertain.

## Next Checks

1. **Scalability Test**: Evaluate GSAMUL's performance on datasets with dimensions p > 100 to assess whether the bilevel optimization framework remains tractable and the variable selection remains effective.

2. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary the number of B-spline basis functions and MLP architecture parameters to determine the robustness of the method to these hyperparameters.

3. **Real-World Application**: Apply GSAMUL to a domain with known interpretable additive structure (e.g., epidemiology or economics) to validate its practical utility for scientific discovery and prediction.
