# Exploring The Neural Burden In Pruned Models: An Insight Inspired By Neuroscience

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.16716
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16716
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Pre-compressing input data via token merging improves accuracy of highly sparse pruned Vision Transformers by reducing neural burden

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates performance degradation in pruning-during-training methods for Vision Transformers by introducing the concept of "Neural Burden" - the overload artificial neurons experience when compensating for pruned connections while adapting to training data. Drawing inspiration from neuroscience, the authors propose a simple solution: pre-compressing input data via token merging before pruning. Experiments on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that this approach improves accuracy for highly sparse models (75-95% sparsity) across different learning rates and model configurations, showing that data compression can effectively reduce neural burden during pruning.

## Method Summary
The method involves training a four-layer Vision Transformer with iterative dynamic weight pruning during training. The key innovation is a pre-compression module that applies token merging to reduce the information load on neurons before pruning begins. The pruning follows a cubic sparsity schedule, and the model is trained for 40-60 epochs with learning rates ranging from 1.25e-3 to 1e-2. Token merging uses bipartite soft matching to combine similar tokens between the patch embedding and transformer encoder layers, effectively reducing the number of tokens that must be processed by the network.

## Key Results
- Token merging improves accuracy for highly sparse pruned models (75-95% sparsity) on CIFAR-10
- Performance improvements are consistent across different learning rates (1.25e-3 to 1e-2)
- The method shows particular effectiveness at higher sparsity levels where neural burden is most pronounced
- Results validate the neural burden hypothesis that information overload contributes to pruning performance degradation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Pre-compressing input data via token merging reduces neural burden by lowering the amount of information that remaining artificial neurons must process during pruning.
- Mechanism: When pruning-during-training, artificial neurons must compensate for lost information from pruned connections while adapting to training data. By pre-compressing input tokens, the information load on each neuron is reduced, allowing them to focus on learning the compressed representation rather than simultaneously compensating for pruned connections and fitting data.
- Core assumption: The performance degradation in pruned models is primarily due to information overload on artificial neurons rather than simply having fewer parameters.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The authors propose "Neural Burden" - the idea that artificial neurons become overloaded during pruning as they must compensate for lost information while adapting to training data.
  - [section] "Research in neuroscience has indicated that the brain performs better under low-load conditions compared to high-load situations... in order to alleviate the Neural Burden and the performance degradation of pruning methods, we propose adding a simple plug-and-play data compression module before pruning to pre-compress information sent to neural networks."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in related papers about neural burden concept.
- Break condition: If token merging causes excessive information loss that outweighs the benefits of reduced neural burden, performance may degrade rather than improve.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The dynamic pruning strategy allows recovery from "errors" by reactivating pruned parameters when needed.
- Mechanism: During iterative pruning, parameters can be reactivated if they become important again. This creates a more flexible pruning process where the network can adjust to the changing information landscape as pruning progresses.
- Core assumption: The network can effectively utilize the ability to reactivate pruned parameters to maintain performance while still achieving sparsity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "applying such updating strategy allows to recover from 'errors', i.e. parameters during pruning can become activated again."
  - [abstract] "we adopt a relatively simple method for dynamic weight pruning... By updating the mask with the threshold, the model reaches a new intermediate sparsity."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in related papers about dynamic reactivation during pruning.
- Break condition: If the threshold for reactivation is too high or the pruning rate too aggressive, the network may not have sufficient opportunity to recover from errors.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Highly sparse models benefit more from data compression because they have fewer neurons to distribute the computational load.
- Mechanism: As sparsity increases, each remaining neuron must handle more of the computational load. Pre-compressing input data reduces this load proportionally, providing greater relative benefit as sparsity increases.
- Core assumption: The relationship between sparsity and benefit from data compression is monotonic and positive.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "According to the results in Table 1 and Table 2, our proposed solution improved the performance of highly sparse pruned networks in most experimental configurations."
  - [abstract] "Experiments on CIFAR-10 show their approach improves accuracy for highly sparse models (75-95% sparsity) across different learning rates and model configurations."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in related papers about sparsity-specific benefits of data compression.
- Break condition: If the data compression ratio is too high, information loss may outweigh the benefits of reduced neural burden, especially at lower sparsity levels.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Vision Transformer architecture and tokenization
  - Why needed here: The paper specifically addresses ViT models and uses token merging as the data compression method, so understanding how ViTs process tokens is essential.
  - Quick check question: How does a Vision Transformer convert an image into tokens, and what is the typical patch size used?

- Concept: Model pruning techniques and sparsity
  - Why needed here: The paper focuses on pruning-during-training and explores how different sparsity levels affect performance, requiring understanding of pruning methods and their impact.
  - Quick check question: What are the three main categories of pruning strategies, and how does pruning-during-training differ from the other two?

- Concept: Information theory and data compression
  - Why needed here: The paper draws inspiration from neuroscience's information compression mechanisms and applies token merging as a form of data compression.
  - Quick check question: How does the bipartite soft matching algorithm used for token merging measure similarity between tokens?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input image -> Patch embedding -> Token merging module -> Transformer encoder -> Head layer -> Structure compression module -> Sparsity target
- Critical path: Input image -> Patch embedding -> Token merging (data compression) -> Transformer encoder -> Classification head
- Design tradeoffs: Token merging provides data compression but loses information; dynamic pruning allows flexibility but adds complexity; simpler methods are used for both components to maintain accessibility
- Failure signatures: Performance degradation when compression ratio is too high; no improvement when sparsity is low; inconsistent results across different learning rates
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run iterative pruning on ViT with 75% sparsity without data compression to establish baseline
  2. Apply token merging with 0.2 compression ratio and compare performance
  3. Test different compression ratios (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8) at 90% sparsity to find optimal ratio

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does neural burden vary across different model architectures (CNNs vs Transformers) and training regimes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions investigating neural burden in pruning-during-training methods but doesn't compare across architectures or training strategies.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses specifically on Vision Transformers and doesn't explore whether the neural burden phenomenon is universal across different neural network architectures or whether it manifests differently in other training paradigms.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies measuring neural burden indicators (gradient magnitudes, weight norms) across CNNs, Transformers, and other architectures under various training regimes (pre-training, fine-tuning, continual learning).

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal trade-off between data compression ratio and model performance preservation in different pruning scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper experiments with different data compression ratios (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8) but doesn't provide theoretical analysis of the optimal trade-off or explore whether this trade-off varies with sparsity levels or model architectures.
- Why unresolved: The experimental results show effectiveness but don't establish the theoretical relationship between compression ratio and performance preservation, nor do they explore how this relationship changes with different pruning scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical modeling of the information-theoretic relationship between data compression ratio and performance retention, validated through systematic experiments across different sparsity levels and architectures.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can neural burden be predicted or measured during training to inform dynamic pruning strategies?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates that neural burden exists and affects training dynamics, but doesn't propose methods to predict or measure it in real-time to guide pruning decisions.
- Why unresolved: The paper shows that neural burden affects gradient magnitudes and weight norms during training, suggesting it could be monitored, but doesn't explore whether this information could be used to make more intelligent pruning decisions during training.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of real-time neural burden monitoring techniques that could be integrated into pruning algorithms to dynamically adjust pruning rates based on burden indicators.

## Limitations
- The neural burden concept remains theoretical without direct empirical validation of information overload on artificial neurons
- The paper doesn't provide theoretical analysis of the optimal trade-off between compression ratio and performance preservation
- Limited exploration of how neural burden varies across different model architectures and training regimes

## Confidence

- Token merging as effective data compression method: Medium
- Dynamic pruning reactivation mechanism: Low
- Sparsity-specific benefits of data compression: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Measure and compare the actual information content/complexity processed by neurons with and without token merging during training to empirically validate the "neural burden" concept
2. Analyze the frequency and impact of parameter reactivation in the dynamic pruning scheme through detailed logging and visualization
3. Conduct ablation studies systematically varying compression ratios and sparsity levels to quantify the relationship between these factors and identify optimal operating points
