# Role-Playing Simulation Games using ChatGPT

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.09161
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09161
- Reference count: 0
- One-line primary result: LLM-based chatbots enable asynchronous role-playing simulations that enhance active learning and metacognitive skills in distance education

## Executive Summary
This study presents a method for using ChatGPT to create role-playing simulation games that enhance active learning and metacognitive skills in distance education. Students engage in negotiation scenarios using LLM-based chatbots, practicing real-world skills like change management and decision-making. The approach was tested in a master's course on cloud computing impact, where students used ChatGPT to simulate budget approval negotiations. This demonstrates how LLMs can create immersive, interactive learning experiences that mirror real-life situations, overcoming time and location constraints.

## Method Summary
The method involves creating custom prompts to initiate ChatGPT conversations that simulate real-world scenarios, such as budget approval negotiations in cloud migration projects. Students interact with ChatGPT as an interlocutor, playing specific roles in the scenario. After the simulation, students reflect on their experiences during the simulation, which can inform future assignments and aid the development of new simulation games. The approach was tested with master's students in a course on the impact of cloud computing, where they used ChatGPT to negotiate budget approval for cloud projects.

## Key Results
- ChatGPT enables asynchronous role-playing simulations that overcome time and location constraints
- Students can practice real-world skills like change management and decision-making through LLM-based chatbot interactions
- Reflection on personal experiences during simulations enhances learning outcomes and informs future assignments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: ChatGPT enables asynchronous role-playing simulations that overcome time and location constraints.
- Mechanism: By using a fixed prompt to initialize the role-play, ChatGPT acts as an interlocutor that students can interact with independently at any time.
- Core assumption: The LLM can maintain consistent character behavior and contextually relevant responses throughout the negotiation scenario.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This allowed the students to engage with the game independently, overcoming time and location constraints."
  - [section] "The conversation in ChatGPT was initiated with a fixed prompt...which allowed for different flows and outcomes for each student."
- Break condition: If the LLM produces inconsistent or contextually inappropriate responses that break immersion, the simulation loses educational value.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Role-playing with ChatGPT develops metacognitive skills including critical thinking and problem solving.
- Mechanism: Students must formulate strategic arguments and anticipate counterarguments in real-time, requiring them to reflect on their reasoning and adjust approaches.
- Core assumption: The cognitive load of negotiating with an AI interlocutor sufficiently challenges students' analytical skills.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "LLMs can boost students' interest in learning by allowing them to practice real-life scenarios using ChatGPT."
  - [section] "These games enable students to improve their analytical skills by analysing information, clearly expressing their opinions, anticipating the outcomes of different decisions, and comparing their understanding with that of others."
- Break condition: If students treat the interaction as a simple Q&A rather than strategic negotiation, the metacognitive benefits diminish.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Immediate feedback and reflection opportunities enhance learning outcomes from the simulation.
- Mechanism: Students can iterate through multiple negotiation attempts and receive prompt responses, then reflect on their experiences to improve future performance.
- Core assumption: The immediacy of AI responses and the ability to replay scenarios enables effective learning cycles.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "In addition to role-playing, students should also reflect on their personal experiences during the simulation."
  - [section] "These reflections can inform future assignments and aid the development of new simulation games."
- Break condition: If reflection is not systematically incorporated or if students don't engage in multiple practice rounds, the learning impact is reduced.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Prompt engineering for educational simulations
  - Why needed here: The quality and specificity of the initial prompt determines the consistency and educational value of the role-play
  - Quick check question: What key elements should a role-play prompt include to ensure the LLM maintains the correct character and scenario context?

- Concept: Metacognitive skill development through simulation
  - Why needed here: Understanding how simulation-based learning transfers to real-world skills helps design effective educational interventions
  - Quick check question: How does practicing negotiation scenarios with an AI differ from traditional role-play with human partners in terms of skill development?

- Concept: Asynchronous learning design
  - Why needed here: The simulation's effectiveness depends on understanding how students engage with self-paced, AI-mediated learning experiences
  - Quick check question: What are the key design considerations for ensuring student engagement in asynchronous role-playing scenarios?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Prompt template -> LLM interface -> Student interaction layer -> Reflection component -> Instructor feedback mechanism
- Critical path: Prompt → LLM interaction → Student response → Reflection → Instructor feedback
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Fixed vs. dynamic prompts: Fixed prompts ensure consistency but may limit scenario variation
  - Open-ended vs. guided responses: More open-ended interactions provide richer learning but harder to assess
  - Individual vs. group simulations: Individual offers flexibility but misses peer learning opportunities
- Failure signatures:
  - Students disengage after initial attempts
  - LLM responses become repetitive or contextually inappropriate
  - Students focus on "gaming" the system rather than genuine skill development
  - Technical barriers prevent smooth interaction
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test prompt variations with 5-10 students to identify optimal prompt structure for maintaining scenario consistency
  2. Run pilot with small cohort using different reflection methods (structured vs. open-ended) to measure impact on learning outcomes
  3. Implement instructor feedback loop with one course to establish verification protocols and measure effectiveness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the long-term impacts of using LLM-based role-playing simulations on students' metacognitive skills like critical thinking and problem-solving?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that LLMs can contribute to the development of metacognitive skills such as critical thinking and problem-solving, but does not provide long-term impact data.
- Why unresolved: The study was an initial exploration without longitudinal assessment of skill development over time.
- What evidence would resolve it: A longitudinal study tracking students' metacognitive skill development over multiple semesters using pre/post assessments and real-world performance metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the effectiveness of LLM-based role-playing simulations compare to traditional role-playing methods or other active learning techniques?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper presents LLM simulations as beneficial but doesn't compare their effectiveness against traditional methods.
- Why unresolved: The study focused on implementing LLM simulations without comparative analysis to other pedagogical approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments comparing learning outcomes, engagement levels, and skill development between LLM-based simulations and traditional role-playing or other active learning methods.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the optimal prompt structures and configurations for different types of role-playing scenarios and educational contexts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention plans to test different prompts in different scenarios but haven't determined optimal configurations yet.
- Why unresolved: The initial case study used a single prompt structure without exploring variations or optimizations for different scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experimentation with various prompt structures across multiple educational contexts, measuring student engagement, learning outcomes, and simulation quality.

## Limitations

- The study lacks specific details about prompt structure, evaluation criteria, and quantitative learning outcome measures
- The effectiveness of the simulation depends heavily on the quality of the initial prompt and the student's ability to engage meaningfully with the AI interlocutor
- Without systematic assessment of student learning gains or comparison with traditional teaching methods, it's difficult to establish the approach's educational value beyond anecdotal evidence

## Confidence

- **Medium**: The basic mechanism of using ChatGPT for asynchronous role-play is plausible and aligns with known LLM capabilities, but effectiveness depends on prompt quality and student engagement
- **Low**: Claims about metacognitive skill development lack empirical validation or specific measurement methods
- **Low**: The assertion that this overcomes time and location constraints assumes students will engage meaningfully with self-paced AI interactions without systematic support structures

## Next Checks

1. Conduct controlled experiments comparing learning outcomes between ChatGPT-based simulations and traditional role-play methods, using pre/post assessments of negotiation and decision-making skills
2. Implement systematic prompt testing with diverse student cohorts to identify optimal prompt structures that maintain scenario consistency across multiple interaction cycles
3. Develop and validate rubrics for assessing student performance in LLM-mediated negotiations, including measures of strategic thinking, argument quality, and reflection depth
