# Introducing Syllable Tokenization for Low-resource Languages: A Case Study with Swahili

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2406.15358
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15358
- **Reference count**: 5
- **Primary result**: Syllable tokenization for Swahili improved fluency (4.76) and meaning (4.63) compared to BPE (3.28, 3.27) and WordPiece (4.52, 4.49) in human evaluation.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a syllable tokenizer for Swahili, motivated by the language's rich syllabic structure and agglutinative morphology. The tokenizer splits words into syllables (e.g., "anakula" → "a-na-ku-la") to create syllable embeddings. These embeddings are used to fine-tune GPT-2 for text generation in Swahili. Human evaluation (Likert scale 1-5) showed that syllable tokenization improved fluency (4.76) and meaning (4.63) compared to BPE (3.28, 3.27) and WordPiece (4.52, 4.49). The method effectively captures Swahili linguistic properties, outperforming generic tokenizers.

## Method Summary
The study proposes a syllable tokenizer for Swahili that splits words into syllables based on the language's phonological rules. The tokenizer uses a vocabulary of 219 syllables and is used to fine-tune GPT-2 for text generation. The authors compare the performance of the syllable tokenizer to BPE and WordPiece tokenizers using human evaluation on 100 generated sentences. The GPT-2 model is fine-tuned on 272,934 Swahili sentences from Wikipedia using Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 5e-4, linear decay, and 1e+2 warmup steps for 5 epochs with a batch size of 2.

## Key Results
- Syllable tokenization improved fluency (4.76) and meaning (4.63) in human evaluation compared to BPE (3.28, 3.27) and WordPiece (4.52, 4.49)
- The method effectively captures Swahili linguistic properties, outperforming generic tokenizers
- The vocabulary size of 219 syllables significantly improves computational efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Syllable tokenization captures the morphological structure of agglutinative languages like Swahili, enabling better word embeddings.
- Mechanism: By splitting words into their syllable constituents, the tokenizer preserves the meaningful subword units that carry grammatical and semantic information.
- Core assumption: Each syllable in Swahili carries distinct meaning, and preserving these units leads to better language representation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] The paper states that Swahili is highly agglutinative and has many polysemous features, with morphology depending on prefixes and suffixes which are syllables.
  - [section 3] The motivation section explains that the position of each syllable in a word bears syntactic and semantic meaning.
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus; this is based on linguistic analysis of Swahili.
- Break condition: If a language's syllables do not consistently carry meaning or if the syllable structure is not well-defined, this mechanism may fail.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The small vocabulary size (219 syllables) improves computational efficiency and reduces noise in embeddings.
- Mechanism: By using a finite set of syllables instead of a larger vocabulary, the model can learn more robust and less sparse representations.
- Core assumption: A smaller, more consistent vocabulary leads to better generalization and less overfitting.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3] The paper notes that the vocabulary size is 219, significantly improving computation efficiency.
  - [abstract] The tokenizer requires no particular neural network and splits words into syllable constituents.
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus; this is an inference from the methodology.
- Break condition: If the syllable inventory is too small to capture necessary linguistic variations, or if the language has a more complex syllabic structure.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: GPT-2 can generalize to Swahili when fine-tuned with syllable embeddings, leveraging its large parameter capacity.
- Mechanism: The large transformer model can adapt to new languages given appropriate tokenization that captures linguistic features.
- Core assumption: The language model's capacity is sufficient to learn from the new tokenization scheme and generalize to unseen text.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2] The paper uses the standard GPT-2 implementation and fine-tunes it on Swahili corpora.
  - [abstract] The results show that GPT-2 generates syllable embeddings that effectively represent Swahili.
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus; this is based on the experimental results.
- Break condition: If the model's capacity is insufficient for the target language's complexity, or if the tokenization scheme introduces too much noise.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Tokenization in NLP
  - Why needed here: Understanding how different tokenization strategies affect language model performance is crucial for this work.
  - Quick check question: What are the main differences between word-level, character-level, and subword tokenization?

- Concept: Agglutinative languages
  - Why needed here: Swahili is an agglutinative language, and understanding this property is key to why syllable tokenization works.
  - Quick check question: How does the morphological structure of agglutinative languages differ from fusional or isolating languages?

- Concept: Fine-tuning large language models
  - Why needed here: The paper fine-tunes GPT-2 on Swahili, so understanding this process is important.
  - Quick check question: What are the key considerations when fine-tuning a pre-trained model on a low-resource language?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Swahili text corpus → Syllable tokenizer → Syllable embeddings → GPT-2 fine-tuning → Text generation
  - Human evaluation → Quality assessment

- Critical path:
  1. Prepare Swahili text corpus
  2. Implement syllable tokenizer
  3. Fine-tune GPT-2 with syllable embeddings
  4. Generate Swahili text
  5. Evaluate output quality

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Vocabulary size vs. expressiveness: A larger vocabulary might capture more nuances but could lead to sparsity and computational inefficiency.
  - Token granularity: Finer-grained tokenization (e.g., character-level) might capture more information but could lose meaningful word boundaries.

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor text generation quality: Indicates issues with tokenization or model fine-tuning.
  - Unnatural language structure: Suggests the tokenizer is not capturing the language's morphology correctly.
  - Computational inefficiency: Could be due to an overly large vocabulary or complex tokenization scheme.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement and test the syllable tokenizer on a small Swahili text sample to verify correct syllable segmentation.
  2. Fine-tune GPT-2 with syllable embeddings on a small subset of the Swahili corpus and generate sample text to check for basic fluency.
  3. Compare the syllable tokenizer's performance against BPE and WordPiece on a held-out validation set using perplexity or human evaluation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed syllable tokenizer perform on other agglutinative and syllabic languages beyond Swahili, such as Kinyarwanda, Lingala, or Luganda?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state they leave the analysis of the syllable tokenizer on other low-resource languages (especially African languages) for future work due to differences in morphologies, rules, syllables, vocabulary, and words.
- Why unresolved: The study only validated the syllable tokenizer on Swahili, and the authors acknowledge that differences in linguistic properties between Swahili and other languages may affect the tokenizer's performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical evaluation of the syllable tokenizer on multiple African languages with varying morphological and syllabic structures, comparing its performance to existing tokenizers like BPE and WordPiece.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the syllable tokenizer improve the performance of other NLP tasks beyond text generation, such as named entity recognition or machine translation, for Swahili or other languages?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors focus on text generation with GPT-2 and do not explore other NLP tasks. However, they suggest that syllable tokenization could improve the performance of mainstream NLP models on low-resource languages.
- Why unresolved: The study only evaluates the syllable tokenizer in the context of text generation with GPT-2 and does not investigate its impact on other NLP tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing the syllable tokenizer's effectiveness on various NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, or machine translation, for Swahili and other languages.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the syllable tokenizer's performance compare to other language-specific tokenization methods, such as Jieba for Chinese or MeCab for Japanese, when applied to Swahili or other languages?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors compare the syllable tokenizer to BPE, WordPiece, and BERT tokenizers but do not consider other language-specific tokenization methods. They mention Jieba, MeCab, and Morfessor as examples of language-specific tokenizers.
- Why unresolved: The study only compares the syllable tokenizer to generic tokenization methods and does not explore its performance relative to other language-specific tokenization approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of the syllable tokenizer's performance against other language-specific tokenization methods on various languages, including Swahili, Chinese, Japanese, and others, across multiple NLP tasks.

## Limitations

- Small human evaluation sample size (100 sentences) limits statistical significance
- Focus on single agglutinative language (Swahili) raises questions about generalizability
- Limited comparison to only BPE and WordPiece tokenizers, missing newer subword approaches

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The claim that syllable tokenization reduces vocabulary size compared to word-level tokenization is well-supported by the paper's demonstration of 219 syllables versus typical word vocabularies.

**Medium Confidence**: The superiority of syllable tokenization for fluency and meaning in human evaluation is moderately supported but limited by the small sample size and potential rater bias.

**Low Confidence**: The generalizability of this approach to other low-resource agglutinative languages is speculative, as the paper only validates on Swahili.

## Next Checks

1. **Linguistic validation of syllable segmentation rules**: Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the syllable tokenizer's accuracy on a diverse Swahili corpus, examining edge cases and complex morphological constructions to verify that syllables consistently carry meaning and preserve grammatical information.

2. **Cross-linguistic generalization study**: Implement the syllable tokenizer for at least two other agglutinative languages (e.g., Turkish, Finnish) with different syllabic structures and evaluate whether the performance gains observed in Swahili extend to these languages.

3. **Extended human evaluation protocol**: Expand the human evaluation to include grammaticality judgments, semantic coherence assessment, and inter-rater reliability measures, while increasing the sample size to at least 500 sentences to ensure statistical significance.
