# Enhancing Answer Attribution for Faithful Text Generation with Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2410.17112
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17112
- **Reference count**: 15
- **Primary result**: Proposed improvements to answer attribution achieve significant reductions in "No Relation" claims, with direct segmentation reducing this metric from 52.2% to 48.5% for independent claims.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of answer attribution in Large Language Models by improving how claims are extracted from generated responses and matched to evidence sources. The authors identify that existing methods struggle with claim independence and context, leading to poor evidence retrieval performance. Through a systematic analysis of claim enrichment and direct segmentation approaches, they demonstrate that providing full context upfront (direct segmentation) significantly outperforms post-hoc enrichment, reducing the share of claims with no relation to evidence from 52.2% to 48.5% for independent claims. The study establishes claim independence as a key factor in attribution accuracy and provides a framework for evaluating and improving these systems.

## Method Summary
The paper analyzes existing answer attribution methods on the ExpertQA dataset, which contains complex questions with long, descriptive GPT-4-generated responses. The authors evaluate claim independence and usefulness using manual annotation and automated methods with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. They propose two improvements: claim enrichment (adding context to non-independent claims) and direct segmentation (generating claims with full context upfront). Evidence retrieval is performed using Google Search and evaluated using DeBERTa-v3-large and GPT-3.5 with NLI prompts to classify claim-evidence relationships. The minimum viable reproduction plan involves segmenting responses, evaluating claim independence, retrieving evidence, and assessing claim-evidence relations.

## Key Results
- Direct segmentation with GPT-4 significantly reduces "No Relation" share from 52.2% to 48.5% for independent claims compared to existing methods
- Non-independent claims exhibit substantially worse retrieval performance with a "No Relation" share of 69.9%
- Claim enrichment increases claim length from 121.4 to 155.6 characters but only partially recovers independence with a 16.2 percentage point reduction in "No Relation" claims

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Direct segmentation with context outperforms claim enrichment in both independence and retrieval accuracy.
- **Mechanism**: By providing the full answer and question context upfront, the segmentation model can generate claims that are already independent and contextualized, reducing the need for post-hoc enrichment and minimizing error propagation.
- **Core assumption**: GPT-4 can leverage full context to produce atomic, independent claims more reliably than GPT-3.5 when given sentence-level input.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section] "Direct segmentation by GPT-4 records a combined 'Missing + No Relation' share of 48.5% for independent claims and 81.6% for non-independent claims."
  - [abstract] "The proposed methods are evaluated on the ExpertQA dataset, showing significant improvements in retrieval performance."
- **Break condition**: If the segmentation model fails to handle complex domain-specific language or lengthy answers, context may not be sufficient to ensure independence.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Non-independent claims significantly degrade evidence retrieval performance.
- **Mechanism**: Claims that depend on external context are more likely to retrieve irrelevant or no evidence, as the semantic similarity search cannot bridge the contextual gap.
- **Core assumption**: Retrieval models like SBERT rely on exact semantic overlap, so missing context leads to poor match quality.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section] "Originally non-independent claims exhibit worse performance than the originally independent claims, with a 'No Relation' share of 69.9%."
  - [section] "The stricter nature of DeBERTa predictions makes it better suited for claim-evidence relation prediction."
- **Break condition**: If the retrieval model incorporates cross-encoder architectures or query expansion, the dependency on claim independence may be reduced.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Claim enrichment partially recovers independence but increases claim length, which may hurt retrieval.
- **Mechanism**: By adding context to non-independent claims, enrichment makes them verifiable, but the increased length can dilute semantic focus and reduce retrieval precision.
- **Core assumption**: Longer claims have broader semantic scope, leading to more false positives in retrieval.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section] "The enrichment by GPT-4 increased it to 155.6 characters, and the enrichment by GPT-3.5 to 145.9 characters."
  - [section] "Claims that were not successfully enriched exhibit worse performance than the originally non-independent claims, with a 'No Relation' share of 78.2%."
- **Break condition**: If retrieval models are optimized for long-context embeddings, the length penalty may be negligible.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Atomic claims and their role in attribution
  - **Why needed here**: Atomic claims ensure each piece of information can be independently verified, which is critical for accurate evidence retrieval and attribution.
  - **Quick check question**: Why is it important for a claim to be atomic in the context of answer attribution?

- **Concept**: Context dependency and its impact on claim independence
  - **Why needed here**: Claims that rely on external context are harder to verify and retrieve, leading to lower attribution accuracy.
  - **Quick check question**: What makes a claim "non-independent," and how does this affect its retrievability?

- **Concept**: Semantic similarity search and embedding models
  - **Why needed here**: Evidence retrieval relies on finding semantically similar text chunks, so understanding how embeddings capture meaning is essential.
  - **Quick check question**: How do embedding models like SBERT and Ada 2.0 differ in their approach to semantic search?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Query → Answer Segmentation → Claim Relevance → Evidence Retrieval → NLI → Attribution
- **Critical path**: Answer segmentation → Evidence retrieval → NLI relation prediction.
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Sentence-level vs. context-aware segmentation: trade-off between granularity and independence.
  - Embedding model choice: SBERT (semantic depth) vs. Ada 2.0 (retrieval optimization).
  - Context window size: 256 vs. 512 characters—affects retrieval recall and precision.
- **Failure signatures**:
  - High "No Relation" rate → Poor claim independence or weak semantic overlap.
  - Empty or malformed claims → Segmentation model errors.
  - Retrieval timeouts → Embedding or vector store misconfiguration.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Compare sentence-level vs. context-aware segmentation on a sample of 50 questions.
  2. Evaluate embedding models (SBERT vs. Ada 2.0) on claim-evidence retrieval accuracy.
  3. Test NLI models (GPT-3.5 vs. DeBERTa) on claim-evidence relation classification.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the performance of claim enrichment be further improved beyond the current 16.2 percentage point reduction in "No Relation" claims?
- Basis in paper: [explicit]
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates that claim enrichment can significantly improve retrieval performance, the current approach still leaves many claims without context and does not achieve an 80% success rate. This suggests that the enrichment process could be further optimized or that alternative methods might be more effective.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the enriched claims' retrieval performance against a control group with no enrichment, or testing alternative enrichment strategies such as using domain-specific models or incorporating additional context from the question or answer.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the answer segmentation process be further optimized to generate more independent claims without relying on LLMs like GPT-4?
- Basis in paper: [explicit]
- Why unresolved: The paper shows that GPT-4 is effective in generating independent claims, but it is a general-purpose model and may not be the most efficient or accurate choice for this task. A more specialized model or a combination of models might be better suited for this purpose.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments using different models, including smaller, domain-specific models, to segment answers into independent claims and evaluating their performance against GPT-4.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the retrieval process be optimized to improve the accuracy of evidence selection, particularly for complex or domain-specific queries?
- Basis in paper: [explicit]
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies that the main challenge in answer attribution lies in the precise retrieval of relevant evidence snippets, especially for complex queries. The current retrieval process, while improved by claim enrichment and direct segmentation, still faces limitations in handling such cases.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing different retrieval strategies, such as incorporating domain-specific embeddings, using more sophisticated context window splitters, or employing multi-stage retrieval processes to enhance the accuracy of evidence selection.

## Limitations

- The study relies heavily on GPT-4 for both claim generation and evaluation, creating potential circularity in performance assessments
- Lack of detailed implementation specifications for the DeBERTa-v3-large NLI model introduces uncertainty in reproducibility
- The absence of explicit criteria for determining claim independence makes it difficult to validate the enrichment process

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core finding that non-independent claims significantly degrade retrieval performance (supported by empirical "No Relation" share measurements)
- **Medium confidence**: The superiority of direct segmentation over enrichment, as this relies on single-model comparisons without ablation studies
- **Low confidence**: The claim that increased claim length from enrichment directly causes retrieval degradation, as no corpus evidence directly links these variables

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a controlled experiment comparing enriched vs. directly segmented claims from the same non-independent source to isolate the impact of enrichment methodology
2. Perform ablation studies on the NLI models (GPT-3.5 vs. DeBERTa) using a held-out test set to verify relation prediction consistency
3. Implement the claim independence evaluation using a separate annotation team to eliminate potential GPT-4 evaluation bias
