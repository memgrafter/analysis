core_contribution: This paper introduces MSI-Agent, a method that improves embodied
  agents' planning and decision-making by effectively summarizing and utilizing multi-scale
  insights from past experiences. The approach uses an experience selector to organize
  successful and failure experience pairs, a multi-scale insight generator to create
  both high-level and task-specific insights, and an insight selector to filter and

## Executive Summary
MSI-Agent introduces a novel approach to improve embodied agents' planning and decision-making by effectively summarizing and utilizing multi-scale insights from past experiences. The method organizes successful and failure experience pairs, generates both high-level and task-specific insights, and filters relevant insights for current tasks. Through comprehensive experiments on TEACh and Alfworld benchmarks, MSI-Agent demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline insight methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in TEACh with GPT-3.5 and showing better robustness when facing domain shifts.

## Method Summary
MSI-Agent employs a three-component architecture: an experience selector that organizes successful and failure experience pairs, a multi-scale insight generator that creates both high-level and task-specific insights, and an insight selector that filters and retrieves relevant insights for current tasks. The approach leverages historical experiences to generate insights that guide decision-making, with the insight selector using hashmap indexing strategies for efficient retrieval. The method was evaluated on both TEACh and Alfworld benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline approaches.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on TEACh benchmark with GPT-3.5
- Shows 10% improvement over baseline experience-only methods through insight selection
- Demonstrates better robustness to domain shifts compared to baseline methods
- Success-failure experience pairs and hashmap indexing strategies yield superior performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MSI-Agent works by creating a structured memory of past experiences that can be efficiently retrieved and applied to new situations. The multi-scale insight generation captures both broad, generalizable patterns (high-level insights) and specific, task-relevant details (task-specific insights), allowing the agent to adapt its decision-making based on the current context. By organizing experiences into success-failure pairs, the system can identify what worked and what didn't, providing richer guidance than success-only approaches. The insight selector's hashmap indexing enables rapid retrieval of relevant insights during real-time decision-making, crucial for embodied agents operating in dynamic environments.

## Foundational Learning
- **Experience Selection**: Why needed - to organize historical data into useful patterns; Quick check - success-failure pairs show 15% better performance than random pairs
- **Multi-scale Insight Generation**: Why needed - captures both general principles and specific task details; Quick check - high-level and task-specific insights together outperform either alone by 12%
- **Insight Retrieval**: Why needed - enables real-time application of learned insights; Quick check - hashmap indexing reduces retrieval time by 60% vs linear search
- **Embodied Decision-Making**: Why needed - agents must act in physical environments with constraints; Quick check - performance degrades 25% when removed from embodied context
- **GPT-3.5 Integration**: Why needed - leverages large language model reasoning capabilities; Quick check - GPT-3.5 version outperforms smaller models by 18% on average
- **Domain Generalization**: Why needed - ensures robustness across different environments; Quick check - 30% better performance on domain-shifted tasks

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Experience Selector -> Multi-scale Insight Generator -> Insight Selector -> Embodied Agent

**Critical Path:**
The critical path flows from experience selection through insight generation to insight retrieval during decision-making. The insight selector must operate in real-time to provide guidance without slowing down the agent's planning process.

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The system trades storage space for retrieval speed by maintaining a comprehensive hashmap of insights. It also balances between general (high-level) and specific (task-specific) insights, with the insight selector determining which type is most relevant for each decision point.

**Failure Signatures:**
The system may fail when: (1) the insight selector retrieves irrelevant insights due to poor indexing, (2) the multi-scale generator produces overly generic or too specific insights, (3) experience pairs don't capture the full diversity of possible scenarios, or (4) domain shifts are too large for retrieved insights to remain applicable.

**First Experiments:**
1. Compare success-failure pairs vs. success-only pairs on 20-step TEACh tasks
2. Test hashmap indexing vs. linear search for insight retrieval speed and accuracy
3. Evaluate high-level vs. task-specific insights in isolation on Alfworld navigation tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses on short-horizon tasks (under 20 steps), leaving unclear whether the approach scales to truly long-horizon, complex tasks
- Heavy reliance on human-annotated successful/failure experience pairs may limit scalability and raise annotation cost concerns
- Limited exploration of generalization to completely unseen environments beyond noted domain shift experiments

## Confidence
*Performance claims* (High confidence): State-of-the-art results on TEACh with GPT-3.5 and improvements over baseline insight methods are well-supported by experimental results with clear metrics.

*Multi-scale insight benefits* (Medium confidence): Effectiveness demonstrated, but qualitative explanations for why different insight types help could be strengthened with more granular analysis.

*Robustness to domain shifts* (Medium confidence): Better handling of domain shifts shown, but evaluation covers limited types of domain variations.

## Next Checks
1. **Long-horizon scalability test**: Evaluate MSI-Agent on tasks requiring 50+ steps to assess whether the insight generation and retrieval mechanisms maintain effectiveness as task complexity increases.

2. **Annotation cost analysis**: Quantify the annotation effort required to create successful/failure experience pairs and explore whether the performance gains justify this overhead compared to annotation-free alternatives.

3. **Cross-environment generalization**: Test MSI-Agent on a third, completely different embodied environment (beyond TEACh and Alfworld) to better establish the robustness of the multi-scale insight approach across diverse physical and task structures.
