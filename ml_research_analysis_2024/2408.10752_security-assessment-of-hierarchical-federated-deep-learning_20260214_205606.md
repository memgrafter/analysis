# Security Assessment of Hierarchical Federated Deep Learning

## Quick Facts

- This work evaluates the security of hierarchical federated learning (HFL) under various adversarial attacks.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the security vulnerabilities of hierarchical federated learning (HFL) architectures under various adversarial attacks. The authors compare 3-level and 4-level HFL systems against centralized learning and standard federated learning approaches, examining both inference-time and training-time attacks with and without defense mechanisms. Their comprehensive evaluation reveals that while HFL models demonstrate strong resilience to untargeted attacks, they remain vulnerable to targeted attacks, particularly when malicious clients are positioned in overlapping edge server areas. The study identifies neural cleanse and adversarial training as effective defense mechanisms, with 4-level HFL showing superior performance.

## Method Summary
The authors conduct a systematic evaluation of HFL security by implementing multiple attack scenarios across different architectural configurations. They deploy 3-level and 4-level HFL systems and compare their performance against centralized and standard federated learning baselines. The evaluation framework incorporates both inference-time attacks (like FGSM and PGD) and training-time backdoor attacks, with and without defense mechanisms. The experiments utilize MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, measuring attack success rates and model performance across various client distributions and malicious client positioning scenarios.

## Key Results
- HFL models show high resilience to untargeted adversarial attacks but remain vulnerable to targeted attacks
- Neural cleanse method significantly reduces targeted attack success rates
- 4-level HFL architecture demonstrates superior performance in resisting inference-time attacks when combined with adversarial training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Hierarchical federated learning distributes computation across multiple levels of aggregation, creating natural defense barriers against certain attack vectors. The multi-tiered architecture introduces additional points of validation and model aggregation, which can filter out some malicious updates before they reach the global model. However, the overlapping nature of edge servers in HFL creates potential vulnerabilities where targeted attacks can exploit communication patterns between levels.

## Foundational Learning
- **Federated Learning**: Distributed machine learning where clients train locally and share model updates rather than raw data. Essential for understanding privacy-preserving distributed training.
  - Why needed: Forms the baseline comparison for HFL security assessment
  - Quick check: Can be implemented with simple averaging of client updates

- **Adversarial Attacks**: Techniques that manipulate input data or training processes to compromise model integrity. Critical for evaluating security robustness.
  - Why needed: Provides the threat models against which HFL security is measured
  - Quick check: Can be demonstrated with small perturbations causing misclassification

- **Neural Cleanse**: Defense mechanism that detects and mitigates backdoor attacks by analyzing model behavior. Important for understanding attack prevention strategies.
  - Why needed: Shows practical methods for defending against targeted attacks in HFL
  - Quick check: Works by identifying anomalous model behaviors indicating backdoors

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Client devices -> Edge servers -> Cloud aggregator -> Global model

**Critical Path**: Client training -> Edge aggregation -> Cloud aggregation -> Model distribution

**Design Tradeoffs**: HFL balances communication efficiency with security complexity, where additional aggregation layers provide security benefits but increase latency and computational overhead.

**Failure Signatures**: Targeted attack success indicates compromised edge server communication channels; untargeted attack resilience suggests effective aggregation filtering.

**First Experiments**:
1. Deploy basic HFL with MNIST dataset to establish baseline performance
2. Implement FGSM attack on 3-level HFL to measure untargeted attack resilience
3. Test neural cleanse defense against backdoor attacks in 4-level architecture

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited to MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, restricting real-world applicability
- Evaluation focuses only on 3-level and 4-level HFL architectures
- Does not address performance trade-offs between security enhancements and model accuracy

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Experimental methodology for evaluating attack resilience and defense mechanisms is well-established and reproducible.

**Medium Confidence**: Comparative analysis between HFL and other learning architectures is methodologically sound but may not capture all variations.

**Low Confidence**: Generalizability to complex real-world scenarios requires further validation.

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate defense mechanisms across diverse datasets with varying complexity and distributions
2. Test additional HFL architectural configurations with different numbers of edge servers
3. Conduct real-world deployment simulations incorporating communication overhead and device heterogeneity
