# M5 -- A Diverse Benchmark to Assess the Performance of Large Multimodal Models Across Multilingual and Multicultural Vision-Language Tasks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2407.03791
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03791
- **Reference count**: 27
- **Primary result**: Introduces M5, a benchmark for evaluating large multimodal models across 41 languages and five vision-language tasks, revealing substantial performance disparities between high- and low-resource languages

## Executive Summary
M5 is the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate large multimodal models (LMMs) on diverse vision-language tasks within a multilingual and multicultural context. The benchmark includes eight datasets covering five tasks and 41 languages, with a focus on underrepresented languages and culturally diverse images. The authors introduce two novel datasets, M5-VGR (visual grounding) and M5-VLOD (visio-linguistic outlier detection), including a new task that challenges models to identify culturally irrelevant or misleading objects in images. Through extensive evaluation of four LMMs across eight datasets, the study reveals substantial task-agnostic performance disparities between high- and low-resource languages, with smaller models sometimes outperforming larger ones in multilingual settings.

## Method Summary
The M5 benchmark evaluates large multimodal models across five vision-language tasks: visual question answering, image captioning, visual grounding, visio-linguistic outlier detection, and visual entailment. It covers 41 languages and includes eight datasets, two of which are newly introduced: M5-VGR (visual grounding) and M5-VLOD (visio-linguistic outlier detection). The benchmark uses a standardized evaluation protocol with region-based accuracy for visual grounding and accuracy-based evaluation for other tasks. Images are sourced from existing datasets and manually annotated for cultural diversity, with annotations verified by native-level speakers. The study evaluates four LMMs (LLaVA-1.5, Qwen-VL, InternVL, and Maxi) across all datasets and tasks.

## Key Results
- M5 reveals substantial performance disparities between high- and low-resource languages across all evaluated tasks
- Smaller models sometimes outperform larger ones in multilingual settings, challenging the assumption that model size correlates with multilingual performance
- The newly introduced M5-VLOD task demonstrates that LMMs struggle with culturally sensitive outlier detection, highlighting limitations in cultural understanding
- Performance drops significantly for languages with fewer than 500 test instances, raising concerns about reliability for truly low-resource languages

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
M5 works by systematically evaluating LMMs across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts, exposing task-agnostic performance gaps that single-language benchmarks miss. The benchmark's strength lies in its comprehensive coverage of 41 languages and five distinct vision-language tasks, combined with carefully curated culturally diverse images and annotations. By introducing novel tasks like visio-linguistic outlier detection, M5 challenges models to demonstrate not just linguistic competence but also cultural sensitivity. The standardized evaluation protocol enables fair comparisons across different model architectures and sizes, revealing that factors beyond model scale—such as training data composition and cultural representation—significantly impact multilingual performance.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multimodal Learning**: Why needed - to process and integrate visual and textual information simultaneously; Quick check - models must handle both image inputs and language queries effectively
- **Cross-lingual Transfer**: Why needed - to enable knowledge sharing across languages with varying resource availability; Quick check - performance should correlate with linguistic similarity and training data overlap
- **Cultural Context Modeling**: Why needed - to capture culturally specific meanings and associations in images and text; Quick check - models should correctly identify culturally relevant vs. irrelevant objects
- **Zero-shot Generalization**: Why needed - to evaluate models on languages and cultural contexts not seen during training; Quick check - performance should degrade gracefully as language distance from training data increases
- **Task-agnostic Evaluation**: Why needed - to assess consistent model behavior across different vision-language tasks; Quick check - performance patterns should be comparable across VQA, captioning, and other tasks

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Images -> Vision Encoder -> Multimodal Fusion -> Language Decoder -> Task-specific Output

**Critical Path**: Vision encoder processes images → Multimodal transformer fuses visual and textual representations → Language decoder generates task outputs

**Design Tradeoffs**: The study compares models of different sizes (7B vs 34B parameters) to reveal that larger models don't necessarily perform better in multilingual settings, suggesting that architectural choices and training data composition may be more important than scale for cross-lingual performance

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation is task-agnostic and correlates with language resource availability, with particularly poor results for low-resource languages (<500 instances) and culturally sensitive tasks like outlier detection

**First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate a baseline model on M5-VLOD to establish performance on culturally sensitive outlier detection
2. Compare performance across language families (e.g., Romance vs. Sino-Tibetan) to identify linguistic influence patterns
3. Test model performance with and without cross-lingual training data to quantify transfer benefits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Uneven language coverage with only 11 languages having ≥500 test instances limits reliability for truly low-resource languages
- Cultural diversity claims may be biased by original image sources (Open Images, ImageNet-9) not designed for multicultural representation
- Manual annotation involved only three native-level annotators per image, potentially missing broader cultural interpretations
- Findings about smaller models outperforming larger ones are based on a limited set of models and may not generalize

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Performance disparities between high- and low-resource languages, general performance decline pattern, introduction of novel datasets
- **Medium confidence**: Claim that larger models don't necessarily outperform smaller ones in multilingual settings
- **Low confidence**: Assertion that M5 comprehensively captures "diverse vision-language tasks within a multilingual and multicultural context"

## Next Checks
1. Expand evaluation for the 30 languages with fewer than 500 test instances to better understand performance in truly low-resource settings
2. Replicate cultural sensitivity annotations with a larger and more diverse group of annotators from different cultural backgrounds
3. Test multilingual performance trends with additional LMM families beyond the current selection to validate whether observed patterns hold across the broader model landscape
