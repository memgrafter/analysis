# Position: Topological Deep Learning is the New Frontier for Relational Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.08871
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08871
- Reference count: 40
- Position paper arguing TDL represents the new frontier for relational learning

## Executive Summary
Topological Deep Learning (TDL) emerges as a novel approach to relational learning that leverages topological features to enhance deep learning models. This paper establishes TDL as the new frontier for relational learning by demonstrating its ability to complement existing graph representation learning and geometric deep learning approaches. The authors identify key open problems across theoretical foundations, practical applications, software development, complexity and scalability, and explainability, while proposing concrete research directions for each. They highlight compelling applications where TDL has demonstrated competitive advantages, including victories in D3R Grand Challenges for drug design, SARS-CoV-2 evolution analysis, and molecular property prediction.

## Method Summary
TDL operates by representing data as simplicial or cellular complexes rather than traditional graphs, enabling the capture of multi-way interactions through higher-dimensional topology. The method pipeline involves: (1) constructing simplicial/cellular complexes from raw data, (2) extracting topological features via persistent homology or Hodge Laplacians, (3) applying neural network layers with message-passing schemes that aggregate information across hyperedges, and (4) producing predictions through output layers. While the paper doesn't specify a single training procedure, it outlines various approaches and emphasizes the need for specialized software packages and benchmark datasets for proper evaluation.

## Key Results
- TDL complements graph representation learning by incorporating topological concepts that capture multi-way interactions
- Demonstrated competitive advantages in drug design (D3R Grand Challenges), SARS-CoV-2 evolution analysis, and molecular property prediction
- Identified critical research gaps in theoretical foundations, software development, scalability, and explainability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: TDL captures multi-way interactions that pairwise graph models miss
- **Mechanism**: Simplicial complexes and cell complexes encode n-way interactions as higher-dimensional simplices, enabling message-passing schemes that aggregate information across entire hyperedges rather than just pairs
- **Core assumption**: Multi-way interactions in data are semantically meaningful and improve downstream task performance
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "TDL may complement graph representation learning and geometric deep learning by incorporating topological concepts"
  - [section] "In TDL, multi-way interactions between entities constitute useful features capable of embedding topological structure via deep learning algorithms"
  - [corpus] No direct citations, but neighboring papers focus on higher-order message-passing and oversquashing
- **Break Condition**: If multi-way interactions are spurious or the computational cost of higher-order message passing outweighs accuracy gains

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: TDL models exploit manifold regularities like "remeshing symmetry"
- **Mechanism**: By representing data on simplicial/cellular complexes, TDL architectures can be designed to be invariant to different triangulations or mesh resolutions, capturing intrinsic manifold structure rather than combinatorial artifacts
- **Core assumption**: The underlying data manifold has intrinsic structure that should be preserved regardless of discretization
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section] "TDL captures regularities inherent to manifolds, such as 'remeshing symmetry'"
  - [abstract] "TDL's unique ability to capture multi-way interactions, manifold regularities, and topological equivariances"
  - [corpus] Weak - no explicit citations but neighboring papers discuss expressivity and higher-order relations
- **Break Condition**: If the manifold assumption is violated or discretization artifacts dominate

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: TDL enables principled choice of neural network architecture based on data topology
- **Mechanism**: The intrinsic topology of the data space constrains which neural architectures can represent it without distortion; TDL explicitly incorporates this constraint into model design
- **Core assumption**: Neural network expressivity is fundamentally linked to the topology of the underlying data space
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section] "Olah (2014) contributed one of the first works on TDL, showing that the topology of the underlying space must be considered when choosing a neural network architecture"
  - [abstract] "TDL's unique ability to capture... topological equivariances makes it particularly suited for various machine learning settings"
  - [corpus] No direct citations, but neighboring papers discuss architecture design and expressivity
- **Break Condition**: If data topology is too complex to characterize or if architectural constraints limit model performance

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Simplicial complexes and higher-dimensional topology
  - Why needed here: TDL operates on simplicial and cellular complexes rather than just graphs; understanding these structures is fundamental to grasping how TDL models work
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a 1-simplex, 2-simplex, and 3-simplex, and how do they relate to pairwise, triple, and quadruple interactions?

- **Concept**: Persistent homology and topological features
  - Why needed here: Persistent homology provides the computational tools to extract and characterize topological features that TDL models use; it's the bridge between raw data and topological representation
  - Quick check question: How does persistent homology distinguish between noise and significant topological features in data?

- **Concept**: Hodge Laplacians and combinatorial topology
  - Why needed here: Hodge Laplacians generalize graph Laplacians to higher-order structures and are crucial for understanding signal processing and message-passing on simplicial complexes
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between the 0-Hodge Laplacian and the standard graph Laplacian?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data → Simplicial/Cellular Complex Construction → Topological Feature Extraction (Persistent Homology) → Neural Network Layers (Message-Passing on Complexes) → Output Layer
- **Critical path**: Complex construction → feature extraction → message-passing → prediction
- **Design tradeoffs**: Higher-order interactions vs. computational complexity; expressivity vs. overfitting; topological priors vs. data-driven learning
- **Failure signatures**: Oversquashing (messages losing information over long paths); vanishing gradients in deep topological layers; poor performance when data topology is trivial
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Compare TDL vs. GNN on synthetic data with known higher-order structure (e.g., simplicial complex with non-trivial cycles)
  2. Test different topological priors (persistent homology features vs. Hodge Laplacian features) on molecular property prediction
  3. Evaluate scalability by training on progressively larger simplicial complexes and measuring accuracy/complexity tradeoff

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the theoretical justification for why topology is relevant in deep learning, and can it be proven that higher-order domains provide richer representations than vector spaces?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly raises this question in the section on theoretical foundations, asking how theory can justify the relevance of topology in deep learning and whether it can prove that higher-order domains provide richer representations than vector spaces.
- Why unresolved: While empirical evidence suggests TDL can outperform traditional methods, a solid theoretical foundation proving the advantages of TDL over GDL and GRL is lacking. This gap prevents a clear understanding of when and why TDL should be preferred.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical proofs demonstrating the expressiveness of TDL models compared to GNNs, or conditions under which TDL outperforms GDL/RL. Empirical studies comparing TDL to GDL/RL on a wide range of tasks, showing consistent advantages for TDL in specific scenarios.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the learning of topological representations in TDL be automated to obtain semantically meaningful topological information from data during neural network training?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies this as an open problem in the section on topological representation learning, highlighting the challenge of obtaining semantically meaningful topological information during neural network training.
- Why unresolved: Existing methods for learning topological representations often require manual intervention or prior knowledge of the data's structure. Automating this process to extract meaningful topological information without human guidance remains a significant challenge.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of algorithms that can automatically learn topological representations from data, with minimal human intervention. Evaluation of these algorithms on diverse datasets, demonstrating their ability to extract semantically meaningful topological information.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the transformer architecture for TDL models, and can it be applied to text, audio, or imaging data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly poses this question in the section on transformers in TDL, asking whether a transformer architecture exists for TDL models and if it can be applied to mainstream data types.
- Why unresolved: While graph transformers exist, extending this concept to higher-order domains like cell and simplicial complexes is unexplored. Additionally, the potential benefits and challenges of applying such a "topological transformer" to text, audio, or imaging data are unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of transformer architectures specifically designed for TDL models. Experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of these architectures on tasks involving text, audio, or imaging data, comparing their performance to existing methods.

## Limitations
- Evidence base is primarily theoretical rather than empirical, with many claims yet to be validated at scale
- Limited benchmark datasets and standardized evaluation protocols for TDL methods
- Most compelling applications cited are single-case demonstrations rather than systematic comparisons across domains

## Confidence
- High confidence: TDL provides a mathematically rigorous framework for incorporating higher-order interactions into deep learning models
- Medium confidence: TDL can capture manifold regularities and topological equivariances that traditional approaches miss
- Low confidence: TDL consistently outperforms established methods across diverse real-world applications

## Next Checks
1. **Benchmark Comparison Study**: Systematically compare TDL against state-of-the-art GNNs and geometric deep learning methods on standardized datasets (molecules, social networks, 3D shapes) using consistent evaluation protocols to quantify performance gains.

2. **Scalability Analysis**: Measure computational complexity and memory requirements of TDL models as a function of simplicial complex size and dimension, identifying breaking points where traditional approaches become preferable.

3. **Ablation Study on Topological Priors**: Isolate the contribution of topological features (persistent homology vs. Hodge Laplacians vs. higher-order message-passing) by systematically removing each component to determine which aspects drive performance improvements.
