# Graph Transductive Defense: a Two-Stage Defense for Graph Membership Inference Attacks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.07917
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07917
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: GTD reduces attack AUROC by 9.42% while increasing utility performance by 18.08% compared to LBP

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the vulnerability of graph neural networks (GNNs) to membership inference attacks (MIA) in transductive learning settings where training and testing data share the same graph structure. The authors propose Graph Transductive Defense (GTD), a two-stage defense method that combines train-test alternate training with a flattening strategy. By reducing the gap between training and testing loss distributions, GTD mitigates overfitting and improves privacy protection. Experiments on nine real-world datasets demonstrate that GTD outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods while maintaining strong utility performance.

## Method Summary
GTD is a two-stage defense method for protecting GNNs against membership inference attacks in transductive settings. The first stage employs normal training with a flattening strategy that introduces noise to label distributions when loss falls below a threshold, increasing the variance of training loss. The second stage uses pseudo-labels generated from the first stage to train on both training and test sets, ensuring both undergo the same procedure. This approach leverages the availability of entire graph topology during training to close the gap between training and testing loss distributions, making it harder for attackers to distinguish member from non-member nodes.

## Key Results
- GTD achieves 9.42% decrease in attack AUROC compared to Laplacian Binned Posterior Perturbation (LBP)
- GTD provides 18.08% increase in utility performance compared to LBP
- GTD outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods across nine real-world datasets and multiple GNN architectures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GTD reduces the gap between training and testing loss distributions, mitigating overfitting and improving privacy protection.
- Mechanism: The two-stage training schedule with flattening strategy increases the variance of training loss distribution, making it harder for attackers to distinguish between member and non-member nodes.
- Core assumption: Overfitting is a main contributor to GNN vulnerability to membership inference attacks in the transductive setting.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The gist of our approach is a combination of a train-test alternate training schedule and flattening strategy, which successfully reduces the difference between the training and testing loss distributions."
  - [section 4] "The key of flattening is to increase the mean and variance of training loss distribution, as we are introducing noise to label distribution. By flattening, training loss distribution can have larger overlap with testing one, making it harder for attackers to implement MIA."
- Break condition: If the two-stage training schedule does not effectively reduce the generalization gap, the defense mechanism may fail.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: GTD leverages the availability of the entire graph topology along with node features during training to propose a two-stage, train-test alternate training procedure.
- Mechanism: The second stage of GTD uses pseudo-labels generated from the first stage model to train the model, ensuring that both training and testing sets undergo the same procedure.
- Core assumption: Incorporating test set information during training can improve the model's generalization ability and defense capability.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We leverage the availability of the entire graph topology along with node features during training process to propose a two-stage, train-test alternate training procedure to further close the gap between the training and testing loss distributions."
  - [section 4] "The gist of the second stage is to also involve testset into training, even when we do not have access to their groundtruth labels Y Test. In this case, the testset is also 'trained', as they go through the same procedure as trainset."
- Break condition: If the pseudo-labels generated in the first stage are inaccurate, the second stage training may not be effective.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: GTD can achieve a better balance between model utility and defense performance compared to other perturbation-based defense approaches.
- Mechanism: GTD avoids explicitly adding noise to the target model predictions, thereby preserving model utility, and does not require additional data.
- Core assumption: Perturbation-based defense methods may significantly degrade the target model performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4] "Compared to state-of-the-art defense methods based on perturbations and distillation, such as LBP [Olatunji et al., 2021] for GNNs and DMP [Shejwalkar and Houmansadr, 2020] for graphless models, GTD can achieve a better balance between model utility and defense performance."
  - [section 5.2] "LBP is a perturbation-based method, which can potentially hurt the target model performance significantly. However, our method achieves defense by alleviating overfitting, which delves deeper into the core issue, instead of adversely affecting target models."
- Break condition: If the trade-off between model utility and defense performance is not optimal, GTD may not be effective.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Training data -> Stage 1 (flattening strategy) -> Pseudo-labels -> Stage 2 (train-test alternate training) -> Defense against MIA
- Critical path: The two-stage training schedule that reduces the gap between training and testing loss distributions
- Design tradeoffs: GTD trades off some model utility for improved defense capability compared to perturbation-based methods
- Failure signatures: If the generalization gap is not effectively reduced, the defense mechanism may fail
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare GTD with state-of-the-art defense methods (LBP and DMP) on various GNN architectures and datasets
  2. Analyze the changes in training and testing loss distributions before and after GTD training
  3. Conduct ablation studies to identify the main sources of improvement for GTD

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the two-stage training schedule in GTD compare to other semi-supervised learning techniques in terms of effectiveness and efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper introduces a two-stage training schedule as part of GTD, which alternates between training on the original training set and using pseudo-labels for the test set. This approach is inspired by graph self-supervised learning techniques.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a direct comparison between GTD's two-stage training schedule and other semi-supervised learning methods. It would be interesting to see how GTD's approach stacks up against other techniques in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments comparing GTD's two-stage training schedule with other semi-supervised learning techniques, such as self-training or co-training, on various graph datasets would provide insights into its relative effectiveness and efficiency.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the flattening strategy in GTD affect the convergence speed and final performance of the target model?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that GTD uses a flattening strategy to increase the variance of the training loss distribution. However, it does not provide a detailed analysis of how this strategy impacts the convergence speed and final performance of the target model.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on demonstrating the effectiveness of GTD in defending against MIA, but it does not delve into the specific effects of the flattening strategy on the target model's training dynamics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments to analyze the convergence speed and final performance of the target model with and without the flattening strategy in GTD would provide insights into its impact on the training process.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of GTD vary across different types of graph neural network architectures (e.g., GCN, GAT, SGC, etc.)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper evaluates GTD on various graph neural network architectures, including GCN, GAT, SGC, and GPRGNN. However, it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of how GTD's performance varies across these architectures.
- Why unresolved: The paper presents the results of GTD on different architectures but does not explore the reasons behind the variations in performance or identify the most suitable architectures for GTD.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments to analyze the performance of GTD across different graph neural network architectures, including a detailed analysis of the reasons behind the variations, would provide insights into the most suitable architectures for GTD.

## Limitations

- The two-stage training procedure requires access to the entire graph structure and node features during training, which may not be feasible in all scenarios
- The method's effectiveness depends on the quality of pseudo-labels generated in the first stage, and poor pseudo-label accuracy could compromise the defense
- While the paper shows superior performance against specific attack methods, the robustness against adaptive attacks or other types of inference attacks is not explored

## Confidence

- High confidence: The effectiveness of the two-stage training procedure in reducing the gap between training and testing loss distributions
- Medium confidence: The claim that GTD achieves a better balance between model utility and defense performance compared to perturbation-based methods
- Low confidence: The generalizability of the method to other types of graph neural networks and datasets beyond those tested in the experiments

## Next Checks

1. Conduct experiments to evaluate the robustness of GTD against adaptive attacks that specifically target the two-stage training procedure or the flattening strategy
2. Investigate the sensitivity of GTD's performance to the quality of pseudo-labels generated in the first stage by varying the pseudo-label accuracy threshold and observing its impact on the defense capability
3. Assess the generalizability of GTD by applying it to different types of graph neural networks (e.g., graph attention networks, graph convolutional networks) and datasets with varying graph structures and characteristics
