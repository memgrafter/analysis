# Distributed Detection of Adversarial Attacks for Resilient Cooperation of Multi-Robot Systems with Intermittent Communication

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.04547
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04547
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Distributed framework for detecting malicious agents and achieving resilient cooperation in multi-robot systems with intermittent communication

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses resilient coordination of multi-agent systems with mobile autonomous agents in adversarial settings, where malicious agents can inject deception attacks and communication is unreliable due to intermittent connectivity and DoS attacks. The authors propose a distributed framework for detecting malicious agents and achieving resilient cooperation among the remaining cooperative agents. The key innovation is characterizing network resilience to attacks using connectivity measures in an integral sense, allowing the system to tolerate intermittent link failures while maintaining consensus capabilities.

## Method Summary
The framework uses second-order dynamics agents (double integrators) communicating over unreliable, time-varying networks subject to both deception attacks and denial-of-service attacks. The method employs reconfigurable local attack detectors based on 2-hop neighborhood information that generate residuals for hypothesis testing. The system achieves resilient cooperation by isolating detected malicious agents and continuing coordination among remaining cooperative agents, with explicit bounds for network connectivity and system stability under integral connectivity conditions.

## Key Results
- Explicit bounds for network resilience to both intermittent and permanent disconnections
- Conditions under which the system is finite-gain L_p stable and achieves exponentially fast consensus/formation if malicious agents are detected and isolated
- A distributed attack detection framework with theoretical guarantees using only locally available information
- Algorithmic framework for detaching from detected malicious agents and achieving resilient cooperation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The system achieves resilient consensus by ensuring the communication network maintains connectivity in an integral sense over time.
- Mechanism: By relaxing point-wise connectivity to integral connectivity, the framework tolerates intermittent link failures and DoS attacks. The (µ, T)-PE connectivity condition ensures the algebraic connectivity remains positive on average, allowing consensus convergence even with temporary disconnections.
- Core assumption: The communication network satisfies the (µ, T)-PE connectivity condition and malicious agent behavior remains bounded.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "under the condition of connectivity in an integral sense uniformly in time, the system is finite-gain Lp stable and uniformly exponentially fast consensus and formation are achievable"
  - [section] "The (µ, T)-PE connectivity has appeared in the literature in different forms [3], [33]. It relaxes the strict point-wise in-time connectivity to the case of connectivity only in the integral sense"
- Break condition: If algebraic connectivity drops below µ for sufficiently long periods or the network fails to satisfy the integral connectivity condition, consensus cannot be guaranteed.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The distributed attack detection framework can identify and isolate malicious agents using locally available information without requiring global knowledge.
- Mechanism: Each agent uses a reconfigurable local observer based on 2-hop neighborhood information to generate residuals. These residuals are compared against dynamic thresholds to detect malicious neighbors, triggering isolation by disconnecting communication links.
- Core assumption: The network maintains sufficient connectivity (F+1 vertex connectivity for F-local adversaries) to ensure malicious agents are detectable and their attacks are not stealthy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We present a distributed and reconfigurable framework with theoretical guarantees for detecting malicious agents"
  - [section] "Lemma IV .3 states that (F + 1, T)-vertex connectivity (resp. (F + 1, T)-robustness), where F ∈ Z≥0, ensures almost no F -total (resp. F -local) set of malicious agents with the deception attacks defined in Section II-C is stealthy"
- Break condition: If the network lacks sufficient robustness/connectivity or malicious agents exploit stealthy attack strategies beyond the framework's detectability guarantees, detection will fail.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The observer-based detection framework scales better than graph-theoretic approaches while maintaining detection capability with minimal local information.
- Mechanism: The local observer complexity scales with 2-hop neighborhood size rather than complete network size, reducing computational burden. The framework can operate with only 1-hop information while still providing detection capability, albeit with degraded performance.
- Core assumption: The local information available to each agent (2-hop or 1-hop) contains sufficient information to detect malicious behavior.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Compared to centralized frameworks [18], our framework relies solely on locally available information in an integral sense"
  - [section] "We ran Algorithm 1 using only1-hop information instead of the 2-hop information in (9). The results, shown in Fig. 4(b), demonstrate that Algorithm 1's detection capability is maintained even with minimal local information"
- Break condition: If local information becomes insufficient due to sparse network topology or malicious agents strategically position themselves to evade detection with minimal information, the framework will fail.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Switched linear systems theory
  - Why needed here: The multi-agent system operates over time-varying communication networks, requiring analysis of switched system stability and observability
  - Quick check question: How does the stability analysis differ between switched systems and time-invariant systems?

- Concept: Graph theory and algebraic connectivity
  - Why needed here: Network resilience is characterized through connectivity properties, and convergence bounds depend on algebraic connectivity measures
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between vertex-connectivity and algebraic connectivity in undirected graphs?

- Concept: Distributed control and consensus algorithms
  - Why needed here: The cooperative control protocol relies on local information exchange and consensus mechanisms to achieve formation objectives
  - Quick check question: How does the control gain selection affect convergence rate and stability margins in consensus protocols?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Mobile agents with double-integrator dynamics → Local observers for attack detection → Communication network with switching topology → Distributed consensus protocol → Attack isolation mechanism
- Critical path: Agent state → Local observer → Residual generation → Threshold comparison → Attack detection → Communication link disconnection → Resilient consensus
- Design tradeoffs: 2-hop vs 1-hop information for detection accuracy vs computational complexity; threshold selection for false alarm vs missed detection rates; observer gain selection for convergence speed vs noise sensitivity
- Failure signatures: Persistent high residuals without attack detection; failure to achieve consensus despite no detected attacks; oscillatory behavior indicating instability; inability to maintain network connectivity
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement local observer on single agent with known 2-hop topology and verify residual generation with and without simulated malicious inputs
  2. Test detection framework on small network (3-5 agents) with controlled malicious agent introduction and verify isolation mechanism
  3. Scale to medium network (10-20 agents) with switching topology and evaluate consensus achievement under various attack scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the explicit bounds for network connectivity in an integral sense under different types of DoS attacks (e.g., distributed vs. centralized DoS attacks)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper provides bounds for network resilience to DoS attacks under Assumption 2, which assumes (µ, T)-PE connectivity. However, the specific bounds for different types of DoS attacks are not explicitly derived.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the general case of DoS attacks without distinguishing between different attack models. The resilience analysis relies on the (µ, T)-PE condition, which may not capture the nuances of various DoS attack strategies.
- What evidence would resolve it: Explicit derivation of bounds for network connectivity under specific DoS attack models, supported by analytical proofs and simulation results.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the proposed attack detection framework perform in the presence of false positives and false negatives, especially in large-scale networks with sparse connectivity?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the trade-off between false alarms and detection capability, but does not provide quantitative analysis of false positive/negative rates or their impact on system performance in large-scale networks.
- Why unresolved: The theoretical analysis focuses on worst-case bounds and guarantees, but does not address the practical implications of false detections in real-world scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies evaluating false positive/negative rates under various network conditions and attack scenarios, with corresponding performance metrics and visualizations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the proposed observer-based attack detection framework be extended to handle Byzantine attacks where malicious agents transmit inconsistent information to different neighbors?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly states that Byzantine attacks are not addressed, as the framework assumes malicious agents transmit consistent false information to all neighbors.
- Why unresolved: Byzantine attacks represent a more complex threat model that could significantly impact the effectiveness of the proposed detection framework.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extension of the observer design and attack detection algorithms to handle Byzantine attacks, supported by theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrating improved resilience.

## Limitations
- Framework effectiveness depends heavily on maintaining sufficient network connectivity and robustness to ensure detection capability
- Computational complexity of local observers scales with 2-hop neighborhood size, potentially prohibitive for agents with many neighbors
- Performance degradation when using only 1-hop information lacks quantitative characterization of the tradeoff

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The theoretical foundations for network resilience analysis using integral connectivity conditions and the basic observer design for residual generation. The connection between algebraic connectivity and consensus convergence is well-established in the literature.

**Medium confidence**: The detection framework's ability to identify malicious agents in practice, particularly given the simplifying assumptions about attack models and network behavior. The effectiveness of isolation mechanisms and their impact on overall system performance requires further empirical validation.

**Low confidence**: The scalability of the approach to large, highly dynamic networks and the framework's robustness to sophisticated attack strategies that may evade detection through coordinated behavior or exploitation of local information limitations.

## Next Checks

1. **Robustness testing under realistic network conditions**: Implement the framework in simulation environments with realistic communication constraints, varying packet loss rates, and dynamic topology changes beyond the idealized switching model. Measure detection rates and false alarms across different network densities and attack intensities.

2. **Scalability analysis with increasing neighborhood size**: Systematically evaluate the computational burden and detection performance as the number of neighbors in the 2-hop neighborhood grows. Compare the 2-hop implementation against the 1-hop alternative across different network topologies to quantify the performance tradeoff.

3. **Adversary strategy evaluation**: Test the framework against adaptive adversaries that modify their attack strategies based on detection attempts. Specifically, evaluate performance against coordinated attacks where multiple malicious agents work together to mask their presence, and against attacks that exploit the local information constraints to evade detection.
