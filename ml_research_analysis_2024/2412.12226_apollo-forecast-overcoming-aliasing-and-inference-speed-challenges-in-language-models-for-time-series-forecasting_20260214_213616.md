# Apollo-Forecast: Overcoming Aliasing and Inference Speed Challenges in Language Models for Time Series Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.12226
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12226
- Reference count: 13
- Achieves 35.41% improvement in WQL and 18.99% improvement in MASE metrics over state-of-the-art methods

## Executive Summary
Apollo-Forecast addresses two critical challenges in language model-based time series forecasting: aliasing distortion and slow inference speed. The framework introduces an Anti-Aliasing Quantization Module (AAQM) that employs Butterworth filters to remove high-frequency noise before tokenization, preserving signal fidelity and reducing quantization errors. Additionally, Race Decoding accelerates inference by generating preliminary predictions in parallel with the main model using a draft model. The method demonstrates significant performance improvements on real-world datasets while achieving 1.9X-2.7X faster inference speeds.

## Method Summary
Apollo-Forecast tackles aliasing distortion through its Anti-Aliasing Quantization Module (AAQM), which applies Butterworth filtering to remove high-frequency noise before the quantization process. This noise erasure mechanism preserves the integrity of low-frequency signals while eliminating quantization errors caused by high-frequency components. For inference acceleration, the framework employs Race Decoding, where a draft model generates preliminary predictions in parallel with the main model. The results are concatenated after tolerance checking, enabling faster inference without sacrificing forecast accuracy. The approach maintains the language model architecture while addressing specific time series challenges through these targeted modifications.

## Key Results
- 35.41% improvement in WQL metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods
- 18.99% improvement in MASE metrics over existing approaches
- 1.9X-2.7X faster inference speeds while maintaining accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness stems from addressing fundamental mismatches between language model tokenization and time series data characteristics. Standard quantization introduces errors when high-frequency noise is treated as meaningful signal content, leading to aliasing distortion that degrades forecast quality. By applying Butterworth filters before tokenization, AAQM removes these problematic high-frequency components while preserving the essential signal structure. The filtering operates in the frequency domain, allowing selective attenuation of noise without affecting the underlying trend and seasonal patterns. Race Decoding leverages parallel computation capabilities to reduce inference latency, with the draft model providing rapid initial estimates that are refined by the main model when needed.

## Foundational Learning

**Butterworth Filtering**: A signal processing technique for removing high-frequency noise while preserving low-frequency signal components. Needed because language model tokenization is sensitive to high-frequency noise that appears as quantization errors. Quick check: Verify filter parameters (cutoff frequency, order) are appropriate for the specific time series characteristics.

**Quantization Error Mitigation**: The process of reducing errors introduced during signal-to-token conversion. Critical because standard quantization treats all frequency components equally, leading to distortion when noise is present. Quick check: Compare quantization errors with and without AAQM on controlled noise datasets.

**Parallel Inference Architecture**: Design pattern where multiple models generate predictions simultaneously. Required to achieve the reported 1.9X-2.7X speedup while maintaining accuracy through tolerance-based result selection. Quick check: Measure inference time breakdown between draft and main model operations.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Time Series -> Butterworth Filter -> AAQM -> Tokenizer -> Language Model -> Decoder -> Race Decoding (Draft Model + Main Model) -> Output Predictions

**Critical Path**: The inference pipeline follows: data preprocessing with Butterworth filtering → AAQM quantization → token generation → parallel draft and main model processing → tolerance checking → final prediction output. The most critical components are the filter parameters and tolerance threshold settings, as they directly impact both accuracy and speed.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades memory overhead for speed (maintaining two models) and computational overhead for accuracy (parallel processing with tolerance checking). The Butterworth filter parameters represent a key tradeoff between noise removal effectiveness and signal preservation fidelity.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation occurs when: 1) Filter parameters are poorly tuned for the specific time series characteristics, 2) Tolerance thresholds are set too high or too low, 3) The draft model produces predictions that consistently fail tolerance checks, or 4) High-frequency components contain meaningful signal information that gets filtered out.

**First Experiments**: 1) Test AAQM performance on non-seasonal time series data with varying noise distributions to assess filter parameter sensitivity. 2) Implement tolerance checking failure rate analysis across different tolerance thresholds to quantify reliability trade-offs. 3) Benchmark Race Decoding performance on GPUs with varying memory capacities to determine practical deployment limits.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations
- Generalizability of AAQM across diverse time series domains remains uncertain, particularly for non-seasonal data with varying noise characteristics
- Tolerance checking mechanism lacks detailed validation criteria, making it unclear how often predictions fail the tolerance threshold
- The claimed performance improvements may not translate directly to production environments with different hardware constraints or batch sizes

## Confidence
- AAQM generalizability across domains: Medium confidence
- 35.41% WQL improvement and 18.99% MASE improvement: High confidence
- 1.9X-2.7X inference speedup: High confidence

## Next Checks
1. Test AAQM performance on non-seasonal time series data with varying noise distributions to assess filter parameter sensitivity.
2. Implement tolerance checking failure rate analysis across different tolerance thresholds to quantify reliability trade-offs.
3. Benchmark Race Decoding performance on GPUs with varying memory capacities to determine practical deployment limits.
