# Speakers Unembedded: Embedding-free Approach to Long-form Neural Diarization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.18679
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18679
- Reference count: 0
- Achieved 13% and 10% relative DER reduction over 1-pass EEND on Callhome American English and RT03-CTS datasets respectively

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of applying end-to-end neural diarization (EEND) to long-form audio with many speakers by proposing a novel embedding-free approach. The method applies EEND both locally and globally without requiring separate speaker embeddings, splitting audio into windows for local diarization before re-applying EEND globally across speaker chunks to build an affinity matrix for final clustering. The approach achieves significant relative DER reduction on standard datasets while also providing strategies for reducing computational complexity, achieving up to 70% RTF reduction with no performance impact.

## Method Summary
The proposed approach operates in two stages: first, it splits long-form audio into windows and applies EEND for local diarization to identify speakers within each window. Second, it re-applies EEND globally across speaker chunks from different windows to build an affinity matrix that captures speaker relationships across the entire recording. This affinity matrix is then used for final clustering to produce the diarization output. By avoiding separate speaker embeddings and leveraging EEND's inherent capabilities for both local and global processing, the method achieves embedding-free diarization while maintaining or improving accuracy compared to existing approaches.

## Key Results
- Achieved 13% relative DER reduction over 1-pass EEND on Callhome American English dataset
- Achieved 10% relative DER reduction over 1-pass EEND on RT03-CTS dataset
- Obtained marginal improvements over EEND-vector-clustering without requiring additional embeddings
- Achieved up to 70% RTF reduction with no performance impact through proposed optimization strategies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the strength of EEND's end-to-end modeling while addressing its limitations with long-form audio. By applying EEND locally on windowed segments, it captures speaker activity patterns within manageable temporal contexts. The global re-application of EEND across speaker chunks enables the model to establish speaker continuity and relationships across different windows, effectively building a comprehensive speaker affinity structure. This two-stage approach allows EEND to handle the scalability challenges of long-form audio without sacrificing the accuracy benefits of end-to-end modeling.

## Foundational Learning
- **EEND (End-to-End Neural Diarization)**: A neural network architecture that directly predicts speaker activities without requiring separate embedding extraction
  - *Why needed*: Traditional diarization systems require separate speaker embedding extraction, which adds complexity and potential error propagation
  - *Quick check*: Verify EEND can predict speaker presence without explicit embeddings by examining its output format

- **Windowed processing**: Splitting long audio into overlapping or non-overlapping segments for local processing
  - *Why needed*: EEND's computational complexity scales poorly with audio length, making direct application to long-form audio infeasible
  - *Quick check*: Ensure window size and overlap parameters balance computational efficiency with speaker continuity preservation

- **Affinity matrix construction**: Building a matrix that captures similarity relationships between speaker segments across different windows
  - *Why needed*: Necessary to establish speaker identity consistency across the entire recording duration
  - *Quick check*: Validate that affinity scores properly reflect speaker similarity by examining matrix structure

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Audio -> Window Splitter -> Local EEND -> Speaker Chunks -> Global EEND -> Affinity Matrix -> Clustering -> Diarization Output

**Critical path:** The most compute-intensive operations occur during the local and global EEND applications. Window splitting and clustering operations are relatively lightweight in comparison. The global EEND stage, which processes speaker chunks across windows, represents the primary computational bottleneck and optimization target.

**Design tradeoffs:** The window size selection involves balancing between computational efficiency (smaller windows) and speaker continuity preservation (larger windows). Overlap between windows trades additional computation for improved speaker boundary detection. The global EEND stage trades increased computation for improved speaker identity consistency across the entire recording.

**Failure signatures:** Poor performance typically manifests as speaker identity switches within the same speaker across different windows, indicating insufficient affinity matrix quality. Excessive computational cost suggests suboptimal window sizing or lack of effective RTF reduction strategies. Speaker under-detection may indicate window sizes too small to capture full speaker activity patterns.

**First experiments to run:**
1. Vary window size and overlap parameters systematically to establish the optimal configuration for a given dataset
2. Compare DER performance with and without the global EEND stage to quantify the benefit of the embedding-free clustering approach
3. Profile computational resources (RTF, memory) across different optimization strategies to identify the most effective performance improvements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation is limited to two datasets (Callhome and RT03-CTS), which may not represent the full diversity of real-world acoustic conditions and speaker demographics
- The claim of "embedding-free" processing requires clarification, as internal representations may still function similarly to embeddings
- Computational complexity analysis focuses on RTF reduction without detailed memory usage profiles or scalability estimates for scenarios with many more speakers

## Confidence

**Major claims confidence assessment:**
- Local EEND performance: **High confidence** - validated through direct comparisons with established baselines
- Global EEND clustering effectiveness: **Medium confidence** - demonstrated on limited datasets with promising but not exhaustive results
- RTF reduction strategies: **Medium confidence** - experimental results show consistent improvements but lack ablation studies for individual optimization techniques

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on additional long-form datasets with varying acoustic conditions, including telephone speech, broadcast audio, and multi-channel recordings, to assess robustness across domains
2. Conduct systematic evaluation of window size and overlap parameters to establish optimal configurations for different recording lengths and speaker densities
3. Perform comprehensive computational profiling including memory consumption and GPU utilization to quantify scalability limitations for recordings with hundreds of speakers
