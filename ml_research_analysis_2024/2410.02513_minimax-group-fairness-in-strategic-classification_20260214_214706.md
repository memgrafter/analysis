# Minimax Group Fairness in Strategic Classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.02513
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02513

- This paper addresses the problem of learning classifiers that are both accurate and fair in strategic classification settings where agents may manipulate their features to receive better outcomes.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of learning classifiers that are both accurate and fair in strategic classification settings where agents may manipulate their features to receive better outcomes. The authors formalize a Stackelberg game between a learner and a population of strategic agents partitioned into groups, each with its own cost function for manipulation. The paper introduces minimax group fairness to strategic classification, requiring classifiers to minimize the maximum group error rate across all groups. When agents' cost functions are separable, the authors develop an efficient algorithm that finds an approximately optimal deterministic classifier even when the hypothesis class is the set of all classifiers. For non-separable cost functions, the authors develop oracle-efficient algorithms that find approximately optimal randomized classifiers when the hypothesis class has finite strategic VC dimension.

## Method Summary
The authors formalize strategic classification as a Stackelberg game where a learner chooses a classifier and strategic agents respond by manipulating their features to improve outcomes. They introduce minimax group fairness, which requires minimizing the maximum group error rate across all groups. For separable cost functions, they develop an efficient algorithm using the exponential mechanism from differential privacy to select classifiers with probability proportional to their strategic accuracy. For non-separable costs, they develop oracle-efficient algorithms that work under a "transparent" model where the learner reveals its classifier before agents respond. The algorithms rely on the strategic VC dimension of the hypothesis class and use multiplicative weights updates to find approximately optimal randomized classifiers.

## Key Results
- The deterministic algorithm runs in time exponential in the number of groups but is efficient when the number of groups is small
- Oracle-efficient algorithms find approximately optimal randomized classifiers when the hypothesis class has finite strategic VC dimension
- Experimental results on real datasets show the algorithms outperform non-strategic learners and naive post-processing approaches
- Minimax fair classifiers achieve better fairness metrics while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to baseline methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by transforming the strategic classification problem into a Stackelberg game where the learner commits to a classifier and agents respond strategically. The minimax fairness objective ensures no group suffers disproportionately high error rates. Under separable costs, the learner's objective becomes convex in the classifier parameters, enabling efficient optimization. The exponential mechanism provides a way to sample from the space of classifiers according to their strategic accuracy, while multiplicative weights updates enable efficient learning of randomized classifiers for non-separable costs.

## Foundational Learning

### Stackelberg Games
- Why needed: The strategic nature of agent responses requires modeling the interaction as a leader-follower game
- Quick check: Verify the order of moves (learner commits first, agents respond) matches the problem setting

### Strategic VC Dimension
- Why needed: Bounds the complexity of the hypothesis class under strategic manipulation
- Quick check: Confirm the hypothesis class has finite strategic VC dimension for oracle-efficient algorithms

### Exponential Mechanism
- Why needed: Enables sampling from classifiers proportional to their strategic accuracy under separable costs
- Quick check: Verify the sensitivity of the score function to ensure proper sampling

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Learner -> Hypothesis Class -> Classifier Selection -> Agent Response -> Error Evaluation -> Update

### Critical Path
The critical path is: Learner commits to classifier → Agents manipulate features → Evaluate group error rates → Update classifier distribution. This path must be efficient for the overall algorithm to scale.

### Design Tradeoffs
Deterministic vs. randomized classifiers: Deterministic classifiers are interpretable but may be harder to optimize under minimax fairness. Randomized classifiers provide better optimization properties but sacrifice interpretability. The tradeoff between transparency (revealing classifier) and strategic behavior must also be considered.

### Failure Signatures
- Exponential runtime with many groups indicates the deterministic algorithm is hitting its scalability limit
- Poor convergence of multiplicative weights updates suggests the strategic VC dimension bound may be loose
- High error rates despite optimization indicate model misspecification or inappropriate cost functions

### First Experiments
1. Test the deterministic algorithm on synthetic data with 2-3 groups to verify correctness before scaling
2. Evaluate the oracle-efficient algorithm on a simple hypothesis class with known strategic VC dimension
3. Compare performance against non-strategic baselines on a real dataset with clear group structure

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The deterministic algorithm's exponential dependence on the number of groups limits scalability
- The assumption of separable cost functions is restrictive and may not hold in practice
- The transparent model assumption may not be realistic in many real-world settings
- The heuristic experimental approach may not fully capture the theoretical guarantees

## Confidence

### Theoretical Results
- Deterministic algorithm under separable costs: High
- Oracle-efficient algorithms for non-separable costs: Medium
- Experimental results: Medium

### Empirical Results
- Performance on real datasets: Medium
- Comparison with baseline methods: Medium
- Scalability to many groups: Low

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate the algorithms on datasets with more than three groups to assess scalability and compare performance with the exponential-time baseline.

2. Test the algorithms under different cost function assumptions, including non-separable costs, to validate the robustness of the fairness guarantees.

3. Conduct experiments with different information disclosure models (e.g., where agents must commit to manipulations before seeing the classifier) to assess the impact of the transparency assumption on real-world performance.
