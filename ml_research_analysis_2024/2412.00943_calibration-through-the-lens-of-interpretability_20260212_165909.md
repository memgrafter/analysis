# Calibration through the Lens of Interpretability

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.00943
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00943
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: Decision trees achieve comparable calibration performance to standard methods while being inherently interpretable

## Executive Summary
This paper systematically investigates the interpretability of calibration in machine learning models. The authors catalog desirable properties for calibrated models and introduce novel measures to quantify interpretability, including probabilistic count and probabilistic Kendall's tau. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation across 36 real-world datasets, they demonstrate that simple decision trees perform comparably to other calibration methods while maintaining inherent interpretability, suggesting a worthwhile trade-off between performance and interpretability.

## Method Summary
The paper compares interpretable decision trees against standard calibration methods (Platt Scaling, Isotonic Regression, Probability Calibration Trees) using 10-fold cross-validation on 36 UCI datasets. The evaluation employs multiple metrics including Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Probability Deviation Error (PDE), RMSE for regression function approximation, and monotonicity measures (AUC, AUCV). The methods are applied to both binary and multi-class classification tasks, with hyperparameter tuning for each approach.

## Key Results
- Decision trees achieve comparable calibration performance to standard methods across most metrics
- Cell merging operations improve interpretability metrics while maintaining or improving calibration
- Strict monotonicity implies optimal classification accuracy, while perfect regression approximation requires both calibration and strict monotonicity
- The proposed interpretability measures (Probabilistic Count, probabilistic Kendall's tau) effectively quantify model interpretability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Calibration in itself does not imply classification accuracy, nor human interpretable estimates.
- **Mechanism**: Calibration ensures predicted probability matches empirical frequency, but doesn't guarantee accurate classifications or meaningful probabilities to human users. The sets of instances receiving particular probabilities might be too large or complex to interpret.
- **Core assumption**: Interpretability depends on human ability to understand instance sets corresponding to predicted probabilities.
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract] Calibration doesn't imply accuracy or interpretability; [section] Human users lack notion of instance sets for most complex models.
- **Break condition**: Simple models or low-dimensional feature spaces might enable human understanding of instance sets.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Proposed measures (Probabilistic Count and probabilistic Kendall's tau) quantify size and monotonicity of predictor's effective range.
- **Mechanism**: Probabilistic Count measures effective range size considering data distribution; probabilistic Kendall's tau measures monotonicity relative to regression function.
- **Core assumption**: Size and monotonicity of effective range are important interpretability aspects.
- **Evidence anchors**: [section] Probabilistic Count quantifies predictor range size; [section] Probabilistic Kendall's tau measures monotonicity of random variables.
- **Break condition**: Highly complex data distributions or very simple predictors might render these measures meaningless.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Cell merging with score averaging and average label assignment improve interpretability while maintaining calibration.
- **Mechanism**: Cell merging reduces effective range size by combining cells with weighted average scores; average label assignment replaces scores with cell-wise label averages, improving calibration and monotonicity.
- **Core assumption**: Reducing effective range size and improving monotonicity enhances interpretability.
- **Evidence anchors**: [section] Cell merging decreases effective range size; [section] Score replacement with true label averages analyzed.
- **Break condition**: Already interpretable predictors or significant accuracy loss might negate interpretability improvements.

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: UCI datasets -> Preprocessing -> Calibration methods (Decision Tree, Platt Scaling, Isotonic Regression, Probability Calibration Tree) -> Evaluation metrics (ECE, PDE, RMSE, AUC, AUCV) -> Comparison results

- **Critical path**: Define desiderata → Propose interpretability measures → Analyze operation effects → Compare calibration methods → Evaluate on datasets

- **Design tradeoffs**: Trade-off between interpretability and classification accuracy/approximation of regression function; decision trees as compromise between interpretability and performance

- **Failure signatures**: Proposed measures don't capture true interpretability; operations cause significant accuracy loss; conclusions invalid if measures or operations ineffective

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Evaluate decision trees and other calibration methods on proposed interpretability measures across 36 datasets
  2. Analyze effects of cell merging and average label assignment on interpretability and calibration metrics
  3. Compare methods on standard calibration metrics and other calibration aspects

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: Does the trade-off between calibration and classification accuracy hold across other model families beyond decision trees?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] Demonstrated for decision trees but only speculated about universality
- **Why unresolved**: Experiments only tested decision trees; other model families (neural networks, random forests, SVMs) not evaluated for this specific trade-off
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Systematic experiments comparing calibration and classification performance across multiple model families while varying model complexity

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: How do proposed interpretability measures (PC and KT) relate to actual human comprehension of calibration outputs?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] Introduces measures but doesn't validate against human understanding
- **Why unresolved**: Provides mathematical definitions but no user studies or empirical validation of correlation with human interpretability
- **What evidence would resolve it**: User studies where participants rate interpretability of different calibration models, compared against PC and KT scores

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: Are there specific dataset characteristics that determine when simple interpretable models outperform complex calibration methods?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] Notes performance varies across datasets but doesn't identify driving factors
- **Why unresolved**: Observes dataset-dependent performance but doesn't analyze which dataset features predict simple model success
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Correlation analysis between dataset properties and model performance, or experiments controlling specific dataset characteristics

## Limitations

- Interpretability measures may not fully capture human interpretability, particularly the Probabilistic Count assumption of uniform data distribution
- Empirical evaluation on 36 datasets may not generalize to all domains or larger-scale problems
- Focus on decision trees versus traditional methods may overlook other interpretable model families

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Theoretical relationships between calibration, monotonicity, and classification accuracy are mathematically proven. Strict monotonicity implies optimal classification accuracy.

**Medium Confidence**: Empirical findings regarding decision trees' performance are supported by experimental results, though sample size and methodological choices introduce some uncertainty.

**Medium Confidence**: Asserting interpretability is crucial for meaningful calibration is logically sound but difficult to empirically verify due to subjective human judgment.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-domain validation**: Test interpretability measures and proposed operations on non-UCI datasets from diverse domains (medical, financial, text-based) to assess generalizability.

2. **Human interpretability study**: Conduct user studies with domain experts to validate whether proposed metrics (PC, probabilistic Kendall's tau) correlate with actual human interpretability judgments.

3. **Alternative model comparison**: Evaluate additional interpretable model families (rule-based systems, sparse linear models) against the same metrics to determine if decision trees are truly optimal.
