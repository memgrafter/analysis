# SuperGaussian: Repurposing Video Models for 3D Super Resolution

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.00609
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00609
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Achieves state-of-the-art 3D super-resolution by repurposing video models and consolidating with Gaussian Splatting.

## Executive Summary
SuperGaussian presents a novel approach to 3D super-resolution by repurposing existing video models to enhance the geometric and appearance details of coarse 3D models. The method leverages the observation that any 3D representation can be rendered from multiple viewpoints to form a video, which can then be upsampled using pretrained video models. By combining the upsampled video with 3D consolidation using Gaussian Splatting as the output representation, SuperGaussian produces high-quality, 3D-consistent results. The method is category-agnostic and can handle various input types, including NeRFs, Gaussian Splats, and low-poly meshes. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements in fidelity over existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks like MVImgNet and Blender-synthetic datasets.

## Method Summary
SuperGaussian repurposes video upsampling models to enhance 3D models by rendering 3D scenes into video sequences and applying temporal video upsampling. The method addresses the lack of 3D consistency in video models by combining the upsampled video with 3D consolidation using Gaussian Splatting as the output representation. The process involves rendering a video from a coarse 3D input using sampled view trajectories, upsampling the rendered video using a pretrained video-based upsampler (optionally finetuned for domain-specific artifacts), and performing 3D optimization to fit Gaussians to the upsampled videos. The method is category-agnostic and can handle various input types, such as NeRFs, Gaussian Splats, reconstructions from noisy scans, text-to-3D models, or low-poly meshes.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art results on MVImgNet and Blender-synthetic datasets in terms of perceptual quality metrics like LPIPS, FID, and IS.
- Significantly improves the fidelity of 3D models, with a 30% reduction in LPIPS on the chestnut scene compared to NeRF-based methods.
- Effective at upsampling severely degraded input modalities, such as low-resolution Gaussian Splats or noisy scans.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Video models can be repurposed for 3D super-resolution by rendering 3D scenes into video sequences and applying temporal video upsampling.
- Mechanism: Any 3D representation can be rendered from multiple viewpoints along smooth trajectories to form a video. Pretrained video upsampling models, trained on large video datasets, can then be applied to enhance the spatial resolution and add detail to these rendered frames. After upsampling, Gaussian Splatting reconstruction recovers a 3D-consistent model.
- Core assumption: Video upsamplers, despite not being trained for 3D consistency, can generate temporally smooth but spatially inconsistent outputs that can be consolidated back into a consistent 3D representation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We describe how to repurpose video upsampling models – which are not 3D consistent – and combine them with 3D consolidation to produce 3D-consistent results."
  - [section] "We address this challenge with a simple, modular, and generic approach that can be integrated into existing workflows. First, we render a video of the scene from the coarse 3D input given sampled view trajectories; second, we upsample the rendered video using a pretrained video-based upsampler..."
- Break condition: If the video upsampler introduces view-dependent artifacts that cannot be reconciled by the 3D reconstruction step, or if the camera trajectory sampling fails to cover sufficient surface detail.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Finetuning the video upsampler on low-resolution videos rendered from 3D representations improves handling of domain-specific artifacts.
- Mechanism: The low-resolution video frames rendered from 3D models contain specific degradations (e.g., stripy or blob-like artifacts from Gaussian Splats). Finetuning the video upsampler on paired low- and high-resolution videos generated from such 3D representations adapts the model to these degradations, improving final output quality.
- Core assumption: The degradation patterns in 3D renderings are learnable and consistent enough for the video model to adapt to during finetuning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "To finetune the video upsampler, we need pairs of low and high-resolution videos that depict the specific degradation we would like to model... Hence, to finetune the video upsampler, we use the multi-view dataset MVImgNet... We then fit low-resolution Gaussian Splats to these images... We render the optimized low-res Gaussians... As the target ground truth, we use the original videos from the dataset..."
- Break condition: If the degradation patterns are too diverse or specific to individual scenes, finetuning may not generalize well across different 3D input types.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Gaussian Splatting as the output representation enables efficient reconstruction of high-quality 3D models from upsampled video frames.
- Mechanism: Gaussian Splatting represents scenes as a set of 3D Gaussian primitives optimized via differentiable rendering. It is object-centric, captures local details well, and renders efficiently. After video upsampling, this representation consolidates the temporally smooth but spatially inconsistent frames into a consistent 3D model.
- Core assumption: Gaussian Splatting can effectively encode the high-frequency details introduced by the video upsampler while maintaining 3D consistency.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "As output, we produce high-quality Gaussian Splat models, which are object-centric and effective."
  - [section] "We use the official Gaussian Splatting codebase to perform 3D optimization to fit Gaussians to the upsampled videos... The advantages of adopting 3D Gaussian Splatting lie in its being an object-centric representation and its efficiency in terms of training and rendering."
- Break condition: If the upsampled video frames contain extreme inconsistencies or hallucinations that cannot be reconciled by Gaussian Splatting optimization, the final 3D model may be corrupted.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Video Super-Resolution
  - Why needed here: Understanding how temporal consistency is achieved in video upsampling is critical for adapting these models to 3D tasks.
  - Quick check question: What architectural components in video SR models (e.g., temporal alignment, propagation) are essential for handling smooth camera trajectories?

- Concept: Differentiable Rendering
  - Why needed here: Gaussian Splatting relies on differentiable rendering to optimize 3D Gaussian primitives to match target images.
  - Quick check question: How does the differentiable rendering loss (e.g., L1, SSIM) guide the optimization of Gaussian properties?

- Concept: Camera Trajectory Sampling
  - Why needed here: The quality of the 3D super-resolution result depends on how well the sampled camera trajectory covers the scene from multiple angles.
  - Quick check question: What are the trade-offs between dense vs. sparse trajectory sampling for capturing surface details without excessive redundancy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - 3D Input Renderer -> Video Upsampler (optionally finetuned) -> 3D Reconstruction (Gaussian Splatting)
  - Inputs: Low-res 3D representations (NeRF, Gaussian Splats, meshes, etc.)
  - Outputs: High-res Gaussian Splat models

- Critical path:
  1. Render low-res video from 3D input along sampled trajectory
  2. Apply video upsampler (pre-trained or finetuned)
  3. Optimize Gaussian Splatting to fit upsampled video frames

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Video upsampler choice: Image vs. video models—video models provide temporal consistency but may need finetuning for 3D artifacts.
  - Trajectory sampling: Closer trajectories yield better detail but increase redundancy and computational cost.
  - Output representation: Gaussian Splats are fast and object-centric but may struggle with large scenes or complex topologies.

- Failure signatures:
  - Blurry final 3D models -> Inconsistent video upsampling across frames
  - Artifacts in Gaussian Splats -> Poor coverage by camera trajectory or severe video upsampler hallucinations
  - Slow optimization -> Inefficient Gaussian initialization or rendering settings

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Render a simple low-res NeRF from a circular trajectory, apply a pre-trained video upsampler, and reconstruct with Gaussian Splatting.
  2. Finetune the video upsampler on low-res Gaussian Splat renderings and compare output quality vs. pre-trained only.
  3. Vary trajectory sampling density and distance to target; measure impact on final LPIPS/SSIM metrics.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of SuperGaussian compare to future, more advanced video upsampling models like Sora from OpenAI?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "SuperGaussian can be easily integrated with a stronger video prior, e.g., Upscale-a-video [69] or Sora from OpenAI [1] by finetuning over low-res video as conditions."
- Why unresolved: The paper only uses VideoGigaGAN as the video upsampler and does not evaluate SuperGaussian with Sora or other more advanced models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the performance of SuperGaussian using different video upsampling models, including Sora, on the same datasets and metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can SuperGaussian handle 3D models with missing or occluded parts?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that "We cannot recover from missing/occluded parts in the input or equivalently from insufficient viewpoint coverage" as a limitation.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any experiments or analysis on how SuperGaussian performs on 3D models with missing or occluded parts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments evaluating SuperGaussian on 3D models with varying degrees of missing or occluded parts, and comparing the results to ground truth or alternative methods.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of 3D representation (e.g., Gaussian Splatting vs. Neural Radiance Fields) affect the performance of SuperGaussian?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that "Gaussian Splattings gives 0.1493" LPIPS on the chestnut scene, while "Nerfacto-triplane gives 0.4669, Nerfacto-hashgrid gives 0.3495" in the ablation study on the output 3D representation.
- Why unresolved: The paper only provides a limited comparison of different 3D representations in the ablation study, and does not extensively evaluate the impact of the choice of 3D representation on the overall performance of SuperGaussian.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive experiments comparing the performance of SuperGaussian using different 3D representations (e.g., Gaussian Splatting, Neural Radiance Fields, meshes) on the same datasets and metrics.

## Limitations

- The method cannot recover from missing or occluded parts in the input or insufficient viewpoint coverage.
- The quality of the final 3D reconstruction depends on the consistency and quality of the upsampled video frames, which may be affected by the video upsampler's hallucinations or artifacts.
- The method's performance on diverse 3D inputs beyond the evaluated categories (e.g., text-to-3D models, low-poly meshes) remains to be fully validated.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core mechanism of repurposing video models via rendering-to-video and 3D consolidation is well-supported by the ablation studies and quantitative results.
- **Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of finetuning for domain adaptation is demonstrated but limited to Gaussian Splats; generalization to other 3D inputs (e.g., NeRFs, meshes) remains partially validated.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that SuperGaussian is "category-agnostic" is supported by experiments but primarily evaluated on MVImgNet and Blender-synthetic datasets, which may not fully represent real-world diversity.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Modality Robustness**: Test SuperGaussian on diverse 3D inputs (e.g., low-poly meshes, textured point clouds) to verify category-agnostic performance claims.
2. **Temporal Consistency Analysis**: Quantify the impact of video upsampler hallucinations on final 3D quality using metrics like LPIPS frame-to-frame variance.
3. **Finetuning Generalization**: Evaluate finetuned models on unseen degradation patterns (e.g., noise, compression artifacts) to assess robustness beyond the training domain.
