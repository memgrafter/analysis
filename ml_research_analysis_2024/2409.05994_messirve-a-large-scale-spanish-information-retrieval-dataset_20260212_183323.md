# MessIRve: A Large-Scale Spanish Information Retrieval Dataset

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.05994
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05994
- Reference count: 32
- Primary result: Large-scale Spanish IR dataset with 700K+ queries and Wikipedia documents from diverse Spanish-speaking regions

## Executive Summary
MessIRve addresses the scarcity of large-scale, dialect-aware Spanish information retrieval datasets by collecting nearly 700,000 queries from Google's autocomplete API across 20 Spanish-speaking countries plus the United States. The dataset includes relevant Wikipedia documents sourced from Google's featured snippets and covers diverse topics. Quality assessments show high query clarity and document relevance, while baseline evaluations demonstrate that dense retrieval models fine-tuned on MessIRve significantly outperform traditional lexical methods like BM25 across multiple Spanish IR datasets.

## Method Summary
The dataset was created by extracting queries from Google's autocomplete API using 120 predefined prefixes across 21 Spanish-speaking regions, then sourcing relevant Wikipedia passages from Google's featured snippets. The resulting 697,436 queries were split into training and test sets with no topic overlap. Baseline models including BM25, MIRACL-mdpr-es, E5-large, and OpenAI-large were evaluated, with E5-large fine-tuned on MessIRve achieving the highest nDCG@10 scores. Quality assessments involved manual annotation of 1,050 queries and 2,500 documents for correctness, unambiguity, and relevance.

## Key Results
- Dense retrieval models fine-tuned on MessIRve significantly outperform BM25 on Spanish IR tasks
- E5-large fine-tuned on MessIRve achieves highest nDCG@10 across all test subsets
- Dataset covers diverse Spanish-speaking regions unlike previous English-translated datasets
- Quality assessments show high query clarity and document relevance rates

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Using Google's autocomplete API yields queries that are reflective of real-world information needs and colloquial language usage.
- Mechanism: The autocomplete API generates queries based on actual user search patterns, capturing diverse, natural language queries rather than curated or formal question formats.
- Core assumption: Popular queries from Google autocomplete represent the actual information-seeking behavior of Spanish speakers.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "MessIRve's queries reflect diverse Spanish-speaking regions, unlike other datasets that are translated from English or do not consider dialectal variations."
  - [section]: "Starting with 120 predefined prefixes... we used the Google autocomplete API to obtain popular queries in Spanish starting with these prefixes."
- Break condition: If autocomplete suggestions are overly influenced by trending topics or if API results are not representative of user queries across regions.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Sourcing relevant documents from Google's featured snippets ensures high-quality, relevant passages that are contextually aligned with the queries.
- Mechanism: Featured snippets are curated by Google to directly answer user queries, making them a reliable source of relevant information for IR tasks.
- Core assumption: Google's featured snippets are highly relevant and accurate responses to the user queries.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "To find relevant passages for queries, we obtained Google Search 'featured snippets' sourced from Wikipedia."
  - [section]: "Quality assessments show high query clarity and document relevance."
- Break condition: If Google's snippet selection algorithm changes or if snippets are not always accurate or relevant to the query.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Fine-tuning dense retrieval models on MessIRve improves their performance across Spanish IR tasks.
- Mechanism: By training on a large-scale, dialect-diverse Spanish dataset, models learn better representations for Spanish queries and documents, leading to improved retrieval accuracy.
- Core assumption: Large-scale, diverse training data improves model generalization and performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Baseline evaluations demonstrate that dense retrieval models, particularly those fine-tuned on MessIRve, significantly outperform traditional lexical methods like BM25."
  - [section]: "Fine-tuned E5-large achieves the highest nDCG@10 across all subsets."
- Break condition: If fine-tuning leads to overfitting to the specific dataset characteristics or if the model's performance does not generalize to other Spanish IR datasets.

## Foundational Learning

  - Why needed here: To assess the effectiveness of IR models and understand the impact of fine-tuning on MessIRve.
  - Quick check question: How do Recall@100 and nDCG@10 differ in measuring IR system performance?

- Concept: Knowledge of dense retrieval models and their advantages over lexical methods.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Data collection pipeline: Google autocomplete API -> Wikipedia corpus -> Google Search snippets -> Training sets
  Model training: Dense retrieval models (E5-large) <- Fine-tuning on MessIRve
  Evaluation: IR metrics (nDCG@10, Recall@100) -> Performance assessment

- Critical path:
  1. Data collection from Google autocomplete API and Wikipedia
  2. Fine-tuning dense retrieval models on the collected data
  3. Evaluating model performance on test sets

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Large-scale data collection vs. manual annotation for quality control
  - Dialectal diversity vs. dataset size and consistency
  - Using Google's systems vs. potential biases in query and document selection

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on queries with ambiguous or colloquial language
  - Overfitting to specific dialects or topics in the training data
  - Inability to generalize to queries outside the scope of the dataset

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate baseline performance of BM25 on MessIRve test sets
  2. Fine-tune a dense retrieval model (e.g., E5-large) on MessIRve and assess performance improvement
  3. Compare the performance of the fine-tuned model on MessIRve and other Spanish IR datasets to evaluate generalization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do retrieval models perform when evaluated on a unified Spanish IR benchmark that combines all existing datasets (MessIRve, mMARCO, MIRACL, SQAC, Multi-EuP, PRES) with diverse training strategies?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state "Future work includes fine-tuning on country-specific subsets, and creating a unified Spanish IR benchmark with all datasets."
- Why unresolved: No unified benchmark exists yet, and the paper only provides baseline evaluations on individual datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing retrieval models trained and evaluated on a combined Spanish IR benchmark, including cross-dataset generalization performance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of dialectal diversity on retrieval effectiveness when models are fine-tuned on country-specific subsets of MessIRve?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that "MessIRve's queries reflect diverse Spanish-speaking regions" and suggest future work on "fine-tuning on country-specific subsets."
- Why unresolved: The paper only provides baseline results on country-specific test sets, not fine-tuning experiments on these subsets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative results showing retrieval performance differences between models fine-tuned on country-specific vs. general MessIRve subsets.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How would advanced negative sampling strategies affect the performance of retrieval models trained on MessIRve compared to the BM25-mined hard negatives used in the current experiments?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors mention that "BM25-mined hard negatives improve performance" and that "more advanced sampling strategies could further improve results."
- Why unresolved: The experiments only use BM25-mined negatives, without exploring alternative negative sampling methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental comparison of retrieval performance using different negative sampling strategies (e.g., adversarial sampling, cross-batch negatives) on MessIRve.

## Limitations
- Reliance on Google's autocomplete API and featured snippets may introduce algorithmic biases
- Quality assessments are limited in scope and may not represent all query types
- Manual evaluation covers only a small fraction of the dataset
- Performance metrics focus on nDCG@10 and Recall@100, potentially missing other aspects of user satisfaction

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The dataset's creation methodology using Google's autocomplete API and featured snippets is well-documented and reproducible. The baseline evaluation results showing dense retrieval models outperforming BM25 on Spanish IR tasks are supported by multiple experimental setups.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that MessIRve significantly improves retrieval performance across Spanish IR tasks is supported by experimental results, but the extent of improvement may vary depending on the specific test set and evaluation metric used. The quality assessments showing high query clarity and document relevance are based on manual annotation but may not be representative of all query types.

**Low Confidence**: The assertion that MessIRve addresses the scarcity of large-scale, dialect-aware Spanish IR resources is somewhat subjective and depends on how one defines "large-scale" and "dialect-aware." While MessIRve is larger than some existing Spanish IR datasets, it may not be the largest or most comprehensive in all aspects.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Regional Performance Analysis**: Conduct a detailed analysis of model performance across different Spanish-speaking regions to identify any significant disparities in retrieval effectiveness. This will help validate the dataset's dialectal diversity claims and highlight potential areas for improvement.

2. **User Satisfaction Evaluation**: Design and implement a user study to assess the real-world effectiveness of IR systems trained on MessIRve. This will provide insights into how well the dataset captures actual user information needs and the practical impact of fine-tuning on retrieval performance.

3. **Robustness Testing with Adversarial Queries**: Create a set of adversarial queries designed to test the limits of IR systems trained on MessIRve. This will help identify potential weaknesses in the dataset or model fine-tuning approach and guide future improvements.
