- One-line primary result: An ontological characterization of capability as a disposition whose realizations are associated with some goal or interest of an organism or group of organisms, situated within Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a rigorous ontological account of "capability" by building on Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) as a foundational framework. The authors define capability as a disposition in whose realization some organism or group of organisms has an interest, distinguishing it from functions (which are designed or evolved capabilities) and roles (which are externally grounded). The framework provides a semantic foundation that reduces ambiguity across domains by grounding capabilities in the physical makeup of their bearers while requiring interest in their realization. This characterization serves as a starting point for consistent definitions of capability-related terms across different domains.

## Method Summary
The authors adopt BFO as their starting point, building on existing BFO definitions and relations to characterize capability. They situate capability within BFO's hierarchy as a disposition rather than a role or function, and define the interest relation as a primitive concept. The framework distinguishes capabilities from functions by noting that all functions are capabilities (since functions are dispositions whose bearers have an interest in their realization), but not all capabilities are functions (since capabilities can arise without being designed for a specific purpose). The paper provides a formal characterization of capability within the BFO context and argues for its placement between the BFO classes of disposition and function.

## Key Results
- Capability is formally characterized as a disposition whose realization is associated with an organism's interest
- The framework distinguishes capabilities from functions (designed/evolved capabilities) and roles (externally grounded entities)
- The ontological account provides a unified way to model capabilities across diverse domains (medicine, manufacturing, defense, education)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The ontological characterization of capability as a disposition whose realization is associated with an organism's interest provides a precise semantic foundation that reduces ambiguity across domains.
- Mechanism: By situating capability within BFO's hierarchy as a disposition rather than a role or function, the framework ensures that capabilities are grounded in the physical makeup of their bearers and only become capabilities when there is interest in their realization. This prevents circular definitions and clarifies when a disposition counts as a capability.
- Core assumption: The distinction between internal grounding (dispositions) and external grounding (roles) is both ontologically sound and practically useful for distinguishing capabilities from mere permissions or assignments.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we call the latter capabilities and we attempt to provide an ontological account of what capabilities are"
  - [section] "Does the gain or loss of the realizable entity require some physical change to its bearer? [If] yes, then it is internally grounded and so a disposition."
  - [corpus] Weak - neighbors do not directly address BFO grounding distinctions.
- Break condition: If domains require capabilities that are externally grounded (e.g., temporary authority), the framework must be extended or a new subclass created.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The framework captures both designed and evolved functions as capabilities while excluding general qualities, providing a principled way to model artifact and biological capabilities.
- Mechanism: By defining function as a disposition that exists because of intentional design or evolution, and then asserting that all functions are capabilities (but not vice versa), the ontology distinguishes between capabilities arising from design/evolution versus those discovered or emergent.
- Core assumption: Interest in realization is the key criterion that distinguishes capabilities from mere dispositions, and this interest can be present even without awareness of the capability.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we call the latter capabilities and we attempt to provide an ontological account of what capabilities are"
  - [section] "A function in BFO is borne either: 1. by a biological entity ... whose function is such that the bearer has an interest in its realization ... or 2. by an artifact that is the product of intentional design by one or more organisms who have an interest in the realization of the function"
  - [corpus] Weak - neighbors do not directly address the function-capability relationship.
- Break condition: If capabilities can arise without any form of design, evolution, or interest, the framework needs revision.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The framework provides a unified way to model capabilities across diverse domains (medicine, manufacturing, defense, education) by abstracting away from domain-specific definitions.
- Mechanism: By defining capabilities in terms of BFO's universal classes (disposition, function, role) and the interest relation, the ontology creates a common language that can be specialized for different domains without losing interoperability.
- Core assumption: The BFO hierarchy and its relations (participates in, is located at, is part of) are sufficiently expressive to capture the essential features of capabilities across all domains.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "a robust ontological account of what capabilities are that is of sufficient generality to serve a variety of purposes"
  - [section] "BFO is a top-level ontology ... which is to say, it is a taxonomy of types of entities of a highly general sort ... used in practically all domains of human activity"
  - [corpus] Weak - neighbors do not directly address cross-domain applicability.
- Break condition: If domain-specific nuances cannot be captured through specialization of the general framework, domain-specific extensions may be needed.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) hierarchy
  - Why needed here: The paper builds entirely on BFO's classification of entities into continuants, occurrents, material entities, etc. Understanding this hierarchy is essential to grasp where capability fits.
  - Quick check question: What is the highest division in BFO's class taxonomy, and what are its two main branches?

- Concept: Dispositions vs. Roles
  - Why needed here: The paper distinguishes capabilities as dispositions (internally grounded) rather than roles (externally grounded), which is central to its definition.
  - Quick check question: What is the key litmus test for determining whether a realizable entity is a role or a disposition?

- Concept: Interest relation
  - Why needed here: The paper defines capability in terms of an organism or group having an interest in the realization of a disposition, making this relation fundamental.
  - Quick check question: According to the paper, what are the necessary conditions for an organism to have an interest in the realization of a disposition?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Capability (as disposition with interest) → BFO hierarchy (continuants/occurents) → Interest relation (primitive) → Distinctions from functions and roles
- Critical path: Define capability → situate in BFO hierarchy → specify interest relation → distinguish from functions and roles → apply to domain-specific use cases
- Design tradeoffs: The framework is highly general but may require domain-specific extensions. It prioritizes ontological rigor over ease of immediate implementation.
- Failure signatures: If domain experts cannot map their existing capability concepts to the framework, or if the interest relation proves too vague for practical use.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Map a simple capability domain (e.g., software tool capabilities) to the BFO-based framework and identify any mismatches.
  2. Test the interest relation definition with a concrete example (e.g., a patient's interest in medication effectiveness) to verify it captures the intended meaning.
  3. Implement a small ontology using the framework and attempt to answer competency questions from different domains.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the specific boundary conditions between capabilities and roles in BFO? The paper distinguishes them as internally vs externally grounded but doesn't provide precise formal criteria for classification.
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state "The choice of whether capability best falls under role or disposition turns on whether capabilities are internally or externally grounded" but note this is a "litmus test" rather than a formal criterion.
- Why unresolved: The distinction between internally and externally grounded realizable entities is acknowledged as philosophically complex, and the paper admits this creates ambiguity in edge cases.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal logical definition of the "internally grounded" vs "externally grounded" distinction that can be algorithmically applied to classify any given realizable entity.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How should capabilities be formally represented in existing BFO-based ontologies given that capability is not itself a BFO class?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state "Though we are not suggesting capability be included within the BFO hierarchy, we offer the present characterization of capabilities to the BFO community as a resource for modeling this pervasive phenomenon."
- Why unresolved: The paper provides a characterization but doesn't specify how to actually encode capabilities in BFO-conformant ontologies or what ontological patterns to use.
- What evidence would resolve it: A concrete ontology pattern showing how to represent capabilities using existing BFO classes and relations, including handling of the interest relation.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the ontological status of capabilities that have never been realized and may never be realized (like bodyguard capabilities)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors discuss "bodyguard capabilities – are per accidens never, or only rarely, realized" and note these pose a special case.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges this category but doesn't fully address whether such dispositions should be considered capabilities if they have no history of realization and no organism has an interest in their realization.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal treatment of the temporal aspects of capability existence, distinguishing between dispositions that are capabilities by virtue of potential interest versus those that require actual interest at some point.

## Limitations
- The framework's reliance on the "interest" relation as a primitive concept introduces potential subjectivity in determining when a disposition qualifies as a capability
- The framework may struggle with emergent capabilities that arise without explicit design, evolution, or even implicit interest from any organism
- The paper does not provide clear operational criteria for measuring or detecting interest in capability realization

## Confidence
- High confidence in the ontological positioning of capability as a disposition within BFO's hierarchy
- Medium confidence in the distinction between capabilities and functions based on interest
- Medium confidence in the practical applicability across diverse domains without extensions
- Low confidence in the framework's handling of emergent or unintentional capabilities

## Next Checks
1. Conduct empirical studies across three different domains (e.g., healthcare, manufacturing, and education) to test whether domain experts can consistently map their existing capability concepts to the BFO-based framework.

2. Develop operational criteria for determining when an organism or group has an "interest" in capability realization, and test these criteria with concrete examples from different contexts.

3. Create a formal ontology implementation using the proposed framework and evaluate its ability to answer competency questions that span multiple domains, identifying any structural limitations.
