# Multi-Agent Collaboration in Incident Response with Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.00652
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00652
- Reference count: 35
- Primary result: LLM-based agents successfully simulate incident response teams, with homogeneous centralized and hybrid structures achieving highest success rates

## Executive Summary
This study examines how large language models can simulate multi-agent collaboration in cybersecurity incident response using the Backdoors & Breaches tabletop framework. Six team structures were tested: homogeneous/heterogeneous, centralized/decentralized/hybrid. Results show that homogeneous centralized and hybrid structures achieved the highest success rates at 14 out of 20 simulations, while heterogeneous structures struggled with consensus-building. Case analyses revealed common failure modes including over-reliance on high-modifier procedures, insufficient attention to network-level indicators, and misaligned priorities. The findings demonstrate that LLM-based agents can effectively support incident response, with team composition and leadership style significantly impacting performance.

## Method Summary
The study used the AutoGen framework with GPT-4o to simulate 20 incident response scenarios across six team structures. Each simulation involved an incident captain agent setting up the scenario and managing game mechanics, while defender agents collaborated through group chat to select and execute investigative procedures. The Backdoors & Breaches card system provided attack vectors, procedures, and injects. Success was measured by revealing all four attack cards within 10 turns. Team structures varied by homogeneity (specialized vs. general expertise) and centralization (leadership style).

## Key Results
- Homogeneous centralized and hybrid structures achieved highest success rates (14/20 simulations)
- Heterogeneous structures struggled with consensus-building due to domain experts' differing perspectives
- Common failure modes included over-reliance on high-modifier procedures and insufficient attention to network-level indicators

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Homogeneous centralized and hybrid team structures achieve higher success rates due to clear leadership and streamlined communication.
- Mechanism: Clear leadership in centralized structures allows for decisive decision-making, while hybrid structures combine expert guidance with collaborative input, improving adaptability and reducing delays caused by consensus-building.
- Core assumption: Effective leadership and communication patterns directly influence team performance in incident response scenarios.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "homogeneous centralized and hybrid structures achieved the highest success rates at 14 out of 20 simulations"
  - [section]: "Hybrid structures also fostered collaboration between experts and beginners, accelerating teamwork through mentorship and shared decision-making."
- Break condition: If leadership becomes a bottleneck or communication breaks down, performance may degrade even in centralized or hybrid structures.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Heterogeneous structures struggle with consensus-building due to differing perspectives among domain experts.
- Mechanism: Diverse expertise in heterogeneous teams can lead to disagreements or delays in decision-making, especially in decentralized configurations where no single leader guides the process.
- Core assumption: Diverse perspectives, while valuable, can hinder rapid decision-making in high-pressure scenarios without strong coordination mechanisms.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "heterogeneous structures struggled with consensus-building"
  - [section]: "heterogeneous structures, both decentralized and centralized, faced challenges in reaching consensus due to domain experts' differing perspectives"
- Break condition: If domain experts align their priorities or a strong leader emerges, the consensus-building challenge may be mitigated.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Over-reliance on high-modifier procedures and insufficient attention to network-level indicators are common failure modes.
- Mechanism: Teams often default to established procedures with high modifiers, neglecting less obvious but critical indicators like network-level anomalies or behavior-based analytics.
- Core assumption: Procedure selection significantly impacts the ability to detect and respond to specific attack vectors.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Case analyses revealed common failure modes including over-reliance on high-modifier procedures, insufficient attention to network-level indicators"
  - [section]: "Homogeneous centralized teams often over-relied on standard procedures, failing to adapt to subtle breach indicators"
- Break condition: If teams adopt a more adaptive approach to procedure selection, these failure modes may be reduced.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Incident response stages (initial compromise, pivot and escalate, command and control, persistence)
  - Why needed here: Understanding these stages is critical for selecting appropriate investigative procedures and detecting attack vectors.
  - Quick check question: What are the four stages of a cyberattack, and how do they map to investigative procedures?

- Concept: Procedure card modifiers and cooldown periods
  - Why needed here: Modifiers affect the probability of success in detecting attack cards, and cooldowns enforce strategic resource management.
  - Quick check question: How do established procedures with +3 modifiers differ from other procedures with +0 modifiers, and why is cooldown management important?

- Concept: Team structure dynamics (centralized, decentralized, hybrid)
  - Why needed here: Different structures impact decision-making speed, collaboration quality, and overall team performance in incident response.
  - Quick check question: How do centralized, decentralized, and hybrid team structures influence decision-making and collaboration in incident response scenarios?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Incident captain agent -> Tool executor -> Defender agents (via Group chat manager)
- Critical path: Scenario setup → Team structure selection → Agent role assignment → Turn-by-turn procedure execution → Outcome evaluation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Homogeneous vs. heterogeneous: Simpler coordination vs. richer expertise
  - Centralized vs. decentralized: Faster decisions vs. distributed ownership
  - Fixed roles vs. dynamic roles: Predictability vs. adaptability
- Failure signatures:
  - Over-reliance on high-modifier procedures
  - Misaligned priorities in heterogeneous teams
  - Poor communication leading to missed attack indicators
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test homogeneous centralized vs. homogeneous decentralized to isolate leadership impact
  2. Test heterogeneous centralized with varying expertise mixes to identify consensus-building thresholds
  3. Introduce inject events at different frequencies to measure resilience under stress

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different temperature settings for LLM-based agents affect decision-making quality and team performance in incident response simulations?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper used GPT-4o with a temperature of 1 but did not explore how varying temperature settings might impact agent behavior and team outcomes.
- Why unresolved: The study only tested one temperature setting, leaving the impact of other temperature values on agent creativity, consistency, and decision-making unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments testing multiple temperature settings (e.g., 0.0, 0.5, 1.0) across the same team structures to measure differences in success rates, collaboration patterns, and decision quality.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the inclusion of beginner agents in hybrid team structures affect the overall learning curve and long-term performance of LLM-based incident response teams?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper included homogeneous and heterogeneous hybrid structures with beginners but only evaluated short-term performance within single simulations.
- Why unresolved: The study focused on immediate outcomes rather than tracking how beginner agents develop expertise over multiple simulations or how their presence affects expert agent behavior.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies tracking team performance across multiple simulated incidents, measuring improvements in beginner agent contributions and changes in expert-beginner interaction patterns.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do different agent communication protocols (e.g., structured vs. free-form dialogue) impact the efficiency and effectiveness of multi-agent collaboration in incident response?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The study used a shared group chat approach but did not compare this with alternative communication protocols or examine how different communication styles affect team dynamics.
- Why unresolved: The paper assumed a standard group chat format without investigating whether structured communication protocols might improve information sharing, reduce redundancy, or enhance decision-making speed.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments comparing different communication protocols (structured templates, hierarchical communication, consensus mechanisms) while measuring team performance metrics like time-to-detection and procedural efficiency.

## Limitations

- Simulation-based approach may not capture real-world incident response complexity, particularly regarding time pressure and organizational politics
- Single LLM model (GPT-4o) without comparison to alternative models or fine-tuned versions limits generalizability
- Fixed temperature setting (1) may not represent optimal configuration for all team structures or scenarios

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The observation that homogeneous centralized and hybrid structures achieved the highest success rates (14 out of 20 simulations) is well-supported by the empirical data. The mechanism explaining clear leadership and streamlined communication as key factors is logically consistent with the results.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that heterogeneous structures struggle with consensus-building is supported by the data, but the underlying reasons (differing perspectives among domain experts) could benefit from more detailed qualitative analysis. The failure mode analysis regarding over-reliance on high-modifier procedures is plausible but requires further validation across different attack scenarios.

**Low Confidence**: The assertion that these findings directly translate to real-world incident response effectiveness is not empirically validated. The study's controlled environment and simplified communication patterns may not capture the full complexity of actual cybersecurity operations.

## Next Checks

1. **Model Comparison Validation**: Replicate the study using alternative LLM models (e.g., Claude, Llama) and different temperature settings to determine if results are model-dependent. This would test whether the observed team structure advantages persist across different AI architectures.

2. **Real-World Transfer Validation**: Conduct a pilot study where LLM-based recommendations are presented to actual incident response teams in live scenarios. Measure if teams following LLM-guided strategies based on optimal structures (homogeneous centralized/hybrid) show improved performance compared to those using suboptimal structures.

3. **Failure Mode Stress Testing**: Design targeted experiments focusing specifically on the identified failure modes. For example, create scenarios where network-level indicators are deliberately subtle but critical, then test if teams can overcome their tendency to over-rely on high-modifier procedures through targeted training or procedural adjustments.
