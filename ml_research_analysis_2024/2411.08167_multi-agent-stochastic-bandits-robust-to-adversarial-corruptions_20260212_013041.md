core_contribution: "This paper studies multi-agent multi-armed bandits with adversarial\
  \ corruption in a heterogeneous setting, where agents have access to different subsets\
  \ of arms and share corrupted reward observations. The authors propose a distributed\
  \ algorithm (DRAA) that is robust to adversarial corruptions and achieves a regret\
  \ bound of O((L/Lmin)C) + O(log(T)K/\u2206min), where C is the corruption level,\
  \ L is the number of agents, Lmin is the minimum number of agents with mutual access\
  \ to any arm, and \u2206min is the minimum non-zero reward gap."

# Multi-Agent Stochastic Bandits Robust to Adversarial Corruptions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.08167
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08167
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Novel algorithm DRAA achieves regret bound O((L/L_min)C) + O(log(T)K/∆_min) for multi-agent stochastic bandits under adversarial corruption

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of multi-agent multi-armed bandits in the presence of adversarial corruptions, where agents have heterogeneous access to arms and must share information to mitigate corrupted observations. The authors propose DRAA, a distributed algorithm that improves upon state-of-the-art results by removing multiplicative factors from the corruption term in the regret bound. The algorithm employs a set-splitting technique to classify arms and uses weighted averaging for empirical reward estimation across heterogeneous agents, maintaining logarithmic communication complexity.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces DRAA (Distributed Robust Algorithm for Adversarially corrupted bandits), which tackles the heterogeneous multi-agent stochastic bandit problem under adversarial corruption. The algorithm uses a set-splitting technique to classify arms into active and bad sets, allowing agents to focus exploration on arms with potentially uncorrupted rewards. It employs weighted averaging across agents to estimate empirical rewards, leveraging the partial overlap in arm availability among agents. The algorithm maintains logarithmic communication complexity while achieving improved regret bounds compared to existing approaches, particularly in removing multiplicative factors of K (number of arms) and L (number of agents) from the corruption term.

## Key Results
- Achieves regret bound O((L/L_min)C) + O(log(T)K/∆_min), improving upon state-of-the-art by removing multiplicative K and L factors from corruption term
- Maintains logarithmic communication complexity while handling heterogeneous agent settings
- Matches lower bound O(C) in special cases of single-agent and homogeneous multi-agent scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithm's effectiveness stems from its ability to identify and filter corrupted arms through the set-splitting technique, combined with weighted averaging that leverages the heterogeneous arm access among agents. By classifying arms into active and bad sets, the algorithm can focus exploration on potentially uncorrupted arms while avoiding those likely to be corrupted. The weighted averaging method exploits the partial overlap in arm availability to produce more accurate empirical reward estimates, even when some agents receive corrupted observations.

## Foundational Learning

**Multi-armed bandit theory**: Framework for sequential decision making under uncertainty, where agents must balance exploration and exploitation. Needed to understand the fundamental trade-off in bandit problems and the concept of regret minimization.

**Adversarial corruption models**: Extension of standard bandit models where an adversary can corrupt a bounded number of observations. Quick check: Verify understanding of corruption budget C and its impact on algorithm performance.

**Distributed optimization**: Techniques for solving optimization problems across multiple agents with partial information. Needed to understand how agents can collaboratively solve the bandit problem despite having different subsets of arms. Quick check: Confirm understanding of consensus-based averaging methods.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Agents -> Set-splitting module -> Weighted averaging module -> Arm selection module -> Reward observation

**Critical path**: The algorithm's core workflow involves agents performing local arm pulls, sharing observations through weighted averaging, using set-splitting to classify arms, and updating arm selection probabilities based on the refined estimates.

**Design tradeoffs**: The algorithm trades increased computational complexity (due to set-splitting and weighted averaging) for improved robustness to corruption and better regret bounds. The heterogeneous setting allows for more efficient information sharing but requires careful handling of partial arm overlap.

**Failure signatures**: Poor performance may manifest as failure to correctly classify corrupted arms, leading to continued exploration of bad arms. This can occur when corruption is widespread or when arm overlap among agents is minimal.

**First experiments**: 1) Test algorithm on a small heterogeneous network with known corruption pattern to verify set-splitting accuracy, 2) Compare regret performance against baseline algorithms in various network topologies, 3) Evaluate communication complexity under different levels of arm overlap.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

None

## Limitations

- Theoretical regret bound assumes prior knowledge of corruption budget C, which may not be available in practice
- Set-splitting technique introduces implementation complexity and requires careful parameter tuning
- Limited exploration of extreme cases with minimal arm overlap among agents
- Assumes centralized corruption strategy, not addressing distributed adversarial strategies

## Confidence

**High**: Theoretical regret bound derivation, communication complexity analysis
**Medium**: Empirical performance improvements over existing methods
**Low**: Applicability of centralized corruption assumption to real-world scenarios

## Next Checks

1. Implement adaptive corruption budget estimation to test robustness without prior knowledge of C
2. Conduct extensive simulations across various network topologies with different levels of arm overlap
3. Extend theoretical analysis to distributed corruption strategies where agents face different corruption levels
