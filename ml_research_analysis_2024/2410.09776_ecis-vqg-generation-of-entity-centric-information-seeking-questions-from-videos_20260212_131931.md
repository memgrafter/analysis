# ECIS-VQG: Generation of Entity-centric Information-seeking Questions from Videos

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.09776
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09776
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces ECIS-VQG, a novel approach for generating entity-centric information-seeking questions from videos, achieving BLEU-1: 71.3, ROUGE-L: 78.6, CIDEr: 7.31, and METEOR: 81.9

## Executive Summary
ECIS-VQG introduces a novel approach for generating entity-centric information-seeking questions from videos, addressing the gap in existing video question generation methods that focus on common objects or attributes. The method targets questions about real-world entities like people, places, or organizations by leveraging multimodal video signals including titles, transcripts, frame captions, and visual embeddings. Since no suitable dataset existed, the authors created VIDEO QUESTIONS with 411 YouTube videos and 2,265 manually annotated questions. Their model combines BERT-based classification, fine-tuned BART/T5 architectures, and a hybrid loss function (cross-entropy + contrastive) to produce high-quality entity-centric questions.

## Method Summary
The ECIS-VQG method involves training a BERT-based classifier to filter chapter titles into categories (UL, SCQ, NSCQ, NSCP), then using fine-tuned BART/T5 models with both cross-entropy and contrastive loss functions to generate entity-centric questions. The model incorporates multimodal inputs including video titles, transcripts, frame captions (generated by BLIP/ClipCap), and visual embeddings (from CLIP/ResNeXt). The contrastive loss ensures generated questions are semantically different from non-ECIS questions by maintaining a margin in embedding space. The model uses cross-attention layers to fuse text and video embeddings, allowing it to focus on video aspects relevant to the text input.

## Key Results
- Best model achieves BLEU-1: 71.3, ROUGE-L: 78.6, CIDEr: 7.31, and METEOR: 81.9 on ECIS-VQG dataset
- Outperforms baseline models and zero-shot models like GPT-4o and Qwen-VL
- Combination of contrastive loss and cross-entropy loss produces better ECIS questions than cross-entropy alone
- BART typically leads to better results compared to T5 in the experiments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: The contrastive loss forces the model to generate questions that are semantically different from non-ECIS questions.
- **Mechanism**: For each sample, the model generates a non-ECIS question using a traditional QG model. The contrastive loss then ensures the ECIS generator's output is at least margin m away from this non-ECIS question in the embedding space. This encourages the model to produce questions with entity mentions rather than generic common nouns.
- **Core assumption**: ECIS questions can be reliably distinguished from non-ECIS questions by the presence of entity mentions.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "We further propose a model architecture combining Transformers, rich context signals (titles, transcripts, captions, embeddings), and a combination of cross-entropy and contrastive loss function to encourage entity-centric question generation."
  - [section 4.2] "Contrastive loss is computed as follows. For a sample chapter, we generate non-ECIS question using a model (Romero, 2021) fine-tuned for traditional QG which hopefully generates questions with common objects and attributes. Contrastive loss then tries to ensure that a question generated by our ECIS questions generator is at least margin m away from this non-ECIS question."

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Multimodal fusion through cross-attention layers allows the model to effectively integrate visual and textual information.
- **Mechanism**: The model uses a multi-head cross-attention Transformer layer where video embeddings form the key and value, while text tokens form the query. This allows the model to focus on video aspects related to the text input, amplifying relevant visual cues and downplaying irrelevant parts.
- **Core assumption**: The visual content of the video contains information that can help distinguish entity-centric content from generic content.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section 4.2] "We combine the text input embeddings with the video embedding using a multi-head cross-attention Transformer layer where the transformed video embedding forms the key and value, while text tokens form the query."
  - [abstract] "We further propose a model architecture combining Transformers, rich context signals (titles, transcripts, captions, embeddings), and a combination of cross-entropy and contrastive loss function to encourage entity-centric question generation."

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Using a combination of cross-entropy and contrastive loss produces better ECIS questions than using cross-entropy alone.
- **Mechanism**: The model is trained to minimize both the cross-entropy loss (which encourages generating questions similar to the gold standard) and the contrastive loss (which encourages generating entity-centric questions rather than generic questions). The combination of these two objectives helps the model balance fidelity to the gold standard with the ECIS generation goal.
- **Core assumption**: The gold standard questions are themselves entity-centric and serve as good examples for the model to learn from.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section 4.2] "Our model is fine-tuned to minimize the overall loss given by a combination of the cross-entropy loss LCE and contrastive loss LC: L = LCE + λLC where λ balances the two loss components."
  - [section 5.2] "Comparing blocks C and D indicates that BART typically leads to better results compared to T5. We observe that a combination of contrastive loss and cross-entropy loss is better than using cross-entropy alone."

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Contrastive loss in training objectives**
  - Why needed here: To ensure the model generates entity-centric questions rather than generic questions about common objects.
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of adding contrastive loss in addition to cross-entropy loss in this model?

- **Concept: Multimodal fusion using cross-attention**
  - Why needed here: To effectively integrate visual information from video frames with textual context from transcripts and titles.
  - Quick check question: How does the cross-attention mechanism help the model focus on relevant visual information?

- **Concept: Named Entity Recognition (NER) for filtering**
  - Why needed here: To identify non-ECIS questions that accidentally contain entity names, preventing incorrect contrastive loss computation.
  - Quick check question: Why does the model use NER to filter out certain question candidates before computing contrastive loss?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Chapter Title → Classifier → If NSCQ/NSCP → ECIS Generator (with multimodal inputs) → Question output
- **Critical path**: Chapter title → Classifier → If NSCQ/NSCP → ECIS Generator (with multimodal inputs) → Question output
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Using both contrastive and cross-entropy loss adds complexity but improves ECIS generation quality
  - Multimodal fusion increases model size and inference time but captures richer context
  - Manual annotation of dataset is expensive but necessary for training ECIS-specific models
- **Failure signatures**:
  - Low BERT-Score and high BLEU-1 but low CIDEr suggests model is generating generic questions
  - High Distinct scores with low automatic metrics suggests model is generating diverse but off-topic questions
  - Poor performance on SCQ classification suggests classifier needs retraining
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Test baseline BART model with only chapter title and video title inputs using cross-entropy loss
  2. Add contrastive loss component to the baseline and measure improvement in CIDEr score
  3. Add multimodal inputs (frame captions and video embeddings) with cross-attention fusion and compare against text-only version

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How would the ECIS-VQG model perform on multilingual video datasets beyond English?
- What is the impact of including additional multimodal signals like audio transcripts or speaker identification on ECIS question quality?
- How does the ECIS-VQG system scale with larger, more diverse video datasets in terms of computational efficiency and generation quality?

## Limitations
- The dataset is limited to 411 YouTube videos with manual annotation, which may not fully represent the diversity of real-world video content.
- The model's performance heavily depends on the quality of chapter titles, which may be inconsistent or missing in many videos.
- The contrastive loss mechanism assumes reliable generation of non-ECIS questions, but if the non-ECIS generator produces entity-containing questions, the loss may penalize valid ECIS outputs.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The overall methodology and architecture design, including multimodal fusion and combined loss functions, are well-founded and produce measurable improvements over baselines.
- **Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of the contrastive loss component, while showing improvements, may be sensitive to the quality of non-ECIS question generation.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that ECIS questions differ fundamentally from non-ECIS questions by entity presence may not always hold true in practice.

## Next Checks
1. Test the model's robustness on videos without chapter titles by generating synthetic chapter markers from transcripts.
2. Evaluate the classifier's performance on a held-out test set to ensure it generalizes beyond the training data.
3. Conduct human evaluation studies to validate the automatic metrics and assess the real-world usefulness of generated ECIS questions.
