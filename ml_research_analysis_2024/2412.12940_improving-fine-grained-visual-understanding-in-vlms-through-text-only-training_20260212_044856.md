# Improving Fine-grained Visual Understanding in VLMs through Text-Only Training

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.12940
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12940
- Authors: Dasol Choi; Guijin Son; Soo Yong Kim; Gio Paik; Seunghyeok Hong
- Reference count: 14
- Key outcome: Text-only training achieves comparable performance to image-text training for fine-grained visual understanding while reducing computational costs by 49.1%

## Executive Summary
This paper challenges the conventional approach of training Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using paired image-text data by demonstrating that text-only training can effectively enhance fine-grained visual understanding. The authors propose that detailed textual descriptions can capture visual concepts sufficiently to guide VLM learning, inspired by human cognitive development where rich textual information precedes visual experience. Through experiments on butterfly species classification and cultural visual understanding tasks, the paper shows that text-only training achieves comparable or better performance than traditional image-text approaches while significantly reducing computational requirements.

## Method Summary
The approach involves fine-tuning 7B VLMs (LLaVA-1.6-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B) using only text descriptions, with images removed from training datasets. The method uses AdamW optimizer with learning rate 3e-5, batch size 1 with gradient accumulation of 32 steps, and 5 epochs on NVIDIA A100 80GB GPU. Two datasets were used: BUTTERFLY (100 samples) and K-VISCUIT (237 samples), both with image-text pairs converted to text-only versions. The training focuses on multiple-choice visual question answering tasks, evaluating both Type 1 questions (visual recognition) and Type 2 questions (complex reasoning requiring integration of visual and textual information).

## Key Results
- Text-only training achieves up to 7.61% improvement over original models on fine-grained visual understanding tasks
- Energy consumption reduced by 49.1% compared to image-text training approaches
- On cultural understanding tasks, text-only training slightly outperforms image-text training (71.39% vs 71.08%)
- Text-only training achieves comparable performance to image-text training on butterfly species classification tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper draws inspiration from human cognitive development, where rich textual descriptions can guide visual recognition and understanding before direct visual experience. The mechanism relies on the hypothesis that detailed textual descriptions can capture sufficient visual concepts to enable VLMs to learn fine-grained distinctions without requiring actual image data. This approach leverages the inherent capabilities of VLMs to process and reason about visual concepts through language alone, suggesting that the visual modality may be more redundant for certain types of fine-grained understanding than previously assumed.

## Foundational Learning
**Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**: Multimodal AI systems that process both visual and textual inputs, typically trained on paired image-text data to learn cross-modal representations. Why needed: Understanding the target architecture being improved through text-only training. Quick check: Verify the VLM can process text inputs and generate meaningful responses about visual concepts.

**Fine-grained Visual Understanding**: The ability to distinguish subtle differences between visually similar categories, such as different butterfly species or cultural artifacts. Why needed: The specific capability being enhanced through the proposed approach. Quick check: Test model performance on distinguishing between visually similar categories in held-out test sets.

**Text-only Training**: Training approach that uses only textual descriptions without paired images, contrasting with conventional image-text training methods. Why needed: The core methodology being evaluated and compared against traditional approaches. Quick check: Confirm training pipeline can function without image data while maintaining learning capabilities.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data preparation -> Text generation (GPT-4o) -> Text-only training -> Evaluation (Type 1 & 2 questions)

**Critical Path**: The critical path involves converting image-text datasets to text-only versions, fine-tuning VLMs using these descriptions, and evaluating performance on multiple-choice visual question answering tasks that test both visual recognition and complex reasoning capabilities.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The approach trades direct visual learning for computational efficiency and data efficiency, potentially sacrificing some visual grounding capabilities while gaining significant reductions in energy consumption and training costs. The reliance on automatically generated text descriptions may introduce biases or limitations in how visual concepts are represented.

**Failure Signatures**: Training instability with larger models (13B+ parameters), poor performance on Type 2 questions indicating insufficient capture of complex visual-textual relationships, and potential degradation in visual grounding capabilities when tested on tasks requiring direct visual perception.

**First Experiments**: 1) Reproduce BUTTERFLY classification results comparing text-only vs image-text training on 7B models, 2) Test K-VISCUIT cultural understanding tasks with same comparison, 3) Conduct ablation study varying text description quality and detail levels.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
**Open Question 1**: Does text-only training maintain its effectiveness when scaled to larger VLM architectures (13B+ parameters) and datasets? This remains unresolved due to observed training instability starting at 13B parameters and computational constraints limiting large-scale experiments.

**Open Question 2**: How does the quality and specificity of text descriptions impact the effectiveness of text-only training? The paper doesn't systematically vary description quality, leaving open how different description strategies affect performance.

**Open Question 3**: Can text-only training enable zero-shot or few-shot learning capabilities for new visual concepts? While related work suggests language-only evaluation could predict zero-shot performance, the current experiments only evaluated pre-trained models on held-out test sets.

## Limitations
- Restricted evaluation scope with only two specialized datasets (BUTTERFLY and K-VISCUIT) and small sample sizes (100 and 237 samples) limits generalizability
- Reliance on GPT-4o for text description generation introduces potential dependency on a specific model's capabilities
- Energy consumption comparisons based on theoretical estimates rather than measured hardware performance

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Text-only training can achieve comparable performance to image-text training for fine-grained visual understanding tasks
- **Medium confidence**: Text-only training provides up to 7.61% improvement over original models and slightly outperforms image-text training on cultural understanding tasks
- **Medium confidence**: Text-only training reduces computational costs by 49.1%, though based on theoretical estimates

## Next Checks
1. Conduct large-scale experiments using datasets with thousands of samples across multiple domains to validate scalability and generalizability
2. Perform ablation studies testing different text generation models beyond GPT-4o to assess robustness to different description sources
3. Implement measured hardware benchmarks comparing actual energy consumption and training time between text-only and image-text training paradigms
