# Convergence of Natural Policy Gradient for a Family of Infinite-State Queueing MDPs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.05274
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05274

- Primary result: First convergence proof for Natural Policy Gradient in infinite-state average-reward MDPs, achieving O(1/√T) rate for queueing systems

## Executive Summary
This paper establishes the first convergence result for the Natural Policy Gradient (NPG) algorithm in infinite-state average-reward Markov Decision Processes, focusing specifically on queueing systems modeled as Generalized Switch with Static Environment (GSSE) MDPs. The key technical challenge addressed is bounding the growth rate of the relative value function across iterations, which is essential because standard finite-state assumptions do not apply in infinite-state settings. The authors overcome this by initializing NPG with the MaxWeight policy, leveraging its favorable Lyapunov function properties, and proving state-dependent bounds on relative value function growth.

The primary contribution is an O(1/√T) convergence rate to the optimal policy, achieved through a novel combination of inductive stability proofs, relative value function bounds, and application of the weighted majority algorithm framework. This work bridges a significant gap in reinforcement learning theory by extending policy gradient methods to infinite-state settings, with particular relevance to queueing systems that model many real-world applications including data centers, communication networks, and manufacturing systems.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a convergence proof for Natural Policy Gradient in infinite-state average-reward MDPs by addressing the fundamental challenge of bounding relative value function growth. They initialize the algorithm with the MaxWeight policy and prove that its relative value function grows at most quadratically with respect to reward. Through inductive arguments, they establish that this quadratic growth property is maintained across all iterations of the algorithm. The proof combines stability analysis of the MaxWeight policy with the weighted majority algorithm framework to achieve O(1/√T) convergence. The approach specifically leverages the structure of GSSE queueing MDPs, where state spaces are countably infinite but exhibit favorable properties that enable the convergence analysis.

## Key Results
- First convergence proof for Natural Policy Gradient in infinite-state average-reward MDPs
- Achieves O(1/√T) convergence rate to optimal policy
- Demonstrates that MaxWeight initialization maintains quadratic growth of relative value function across iterations
- Proves stability of the algorithm through inductive arguments and weighted majority framework

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The convergence mechanism relies on three key components: (1) initialization with MaxWeight policy, which provides a stable starting point with favorable Lyapunov properties; (2) bounding the relative value function growth through state-dependent analysis that leverages the specific structure of queueing systems; and (3) maintaining this growth bound inductively across iterations using the weighted majority algorithm framework. The quadratic growth assumption on the initial policy's relative value function is critical for establishing the convergence rate.

## Foundational Learning
- **Relative value functions in infinite-state MDPs**: Why needed - to measure policy quality when standard value functions may be unbounded; Quick check - verify that relative value differences remain finite across state space
- **MaxWeight policy properties**: Why needed - provides stable initialization with provable Lyapunov function bounds; Quick check - confirm quadratic growth assumption holds for test queueing configurations
- **Weighted majority algorithm framework**: Why needed - enables aggregation of policy updates while maintaining convergence guarantees; Quick check - verify that policy weights remain bounded throughout iterations
- **GSSE MDP structure**: Why needed - specific properties enable the relative value function bounds; Quick check - confirm state transitions satisfy required regularity conditions
- **Average-reward optimality criteria**: Why needed - establishes the performance metric for infinite-horizon settings; Quick check - verify that average rewards exist and are finite for test policies
- **Lyapunov function analysis**: Why needed - provides tools for proving stability in queueing systems; Quick check - confirm Lyapunov drift conditions hold for MaxWeight policy

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: MaxWeight initialization -> Relative value function bounds -> Weighted majority aggregation -> Policy update iteration -> Convergence guarantee

**Critical path**: The algorithm's success depends critically on the MaxWeight initialization providing a relative value function with at most quadratic growth. Without this property, the inductive argument for maintaining growth bounds across iterations fails, breaking the convergence proof.

**Design tradeoffs**: The choice of MaxWeight initialization trades off potential suboptimality in the starting policy against the provable stability and growth bounds it provides. Alternative initial policies might achieve better starting performance but could violate the quadratic growth assumption, preventing convergence proof.

**Failure signatures**: Convergence failure would manifest as unbounded growth in relative value function estimates across iterations, indicating that the quadratic growth assumption is violated. This could occur if the initial policy's relative value grows faster than quadratic or if the state space structure does not satisfy required regularity conditions.

**3 first experiments**:
1. Verify quadratic growth of MaxWeight policy's relative value function across diverse GSSE queueing configurations
2. Test algorithm convergence with alternative initial policies to assess sensitivity to MaxWeight assumption
3. Measure relative value function growth across iterations to confirm boundedness is maintained

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- The quadratic growth assumption for MaxWeight policy's relative value function is stated but not fully verified for all GSSE queueing systems
- The proof technique relies heavily on specific properties of queueing systems and may not extend to other infinite-state MDP classes
- The O(1/√T) rate assumes specific structural properties that may not hold in more general settings

## Confidence
- Convergence rate claim (O(1/√T)): High confidence
- Initial policy assumption validity: Medium confidence
- Extension to non-queueing infinite-state MDPs: Low confidence

## Next Checks
1. Verify the quadratic growth assumption empirically across diverse GSSE queueing system configurations
2. Test algorithm performance with alternative initial policies to assess sensitivity to the MaxWeight initialization
3. Attempt to extend the proof technique to other infinite-state MDP classes (e.g., inventory systems, routing problems) to evaluate generalizability
