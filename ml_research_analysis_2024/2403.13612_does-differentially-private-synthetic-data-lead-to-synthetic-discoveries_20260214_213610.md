# Does Differentially Private Synthetic Data Lead to Synthetic Discoveries?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.13612
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13612
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Most DP-synthetic data generation methods show inflated Type I error (false discoveries) at low privacy budgets (ε ≤ 1), potentially invalidating statistical hypothesis tests.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether differentially private (DP) synthetic data preserves the validity of statistical hypothesis tests, specifically the Mann-Whitney U test. The authors evaluate five DP-synthetic data generation methods on real-world medical datasets and simulated Gaussian data, measuring Type I and Type II errors to assess test validity and power. Results show that most DP methods exhibit inflated Type I errors, especially at privacy budgets ε ≤ 1, indicating a high risk of false discoveries. Only the DP Smoothed Histogram method maintained valid Type I error across all privacy levels but required large original datasets and modest privacy budgets (ε ≥ 5) to achieve reasonable power. The findings highlight the need for caution when using DP-synthetic data for statistical analysis, as low p-values may result from noise added for privacy protection rather than genuine effects.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates five DP-synthetic data generation methods (DP Perturbed Histogram, DP Smoothed Histogram, MWEM, Private-PGM, and DP GAN) using real-world medical datasets (prostate cancer and cardiovascular) and simulated Gaussian data. For each method and privacy budget level (ε = 0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, 10), synthetic data is generated and statistical hypothesis tests (Mann-Whitney U test) are performed. Type I error (false discovery rate) and Type II error (power) are measured at significance level α=0.05, with results averaged over 1000 repetitions. The evaluation framework compares error rates between original and synthetic data to assess the validity and power of statistical inference on DP-synthetic data.

## Key Results
- Most DP-synthetic data generation methods showed inflated Type I error, especially at privacy budget levels of ε ≤ 1
- DP Smoothed Histogram method produced valid Type I error for all privacy levels tested but required larger original datasets and ε ≥ 5 for reasonable power
- DP GAN algorithms showed very high Type I error that increased as privacy level decreased, contrasting with other methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: DP-synthetic data generation introduces noise that can inflate Type I error in statistical hypothesis tests.
- Mechanism: When differential privacy mechanisms add calibrated noise to histogram bin counts or gradient updates, the added noise can create spurious statistical differences between groups in synthetic data, leading to false rejections of the null hypothesis.
- Core assumption: The noise distribution added for privacy is symmetric but can create systematic artifacts in specific test statistics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Most of the tested DP-synthetic data generation methods showed inflated Type I error, especially at privacy budget levels of ϵ ≤ 1"
  - [section] "most DP methods exhibit inflated Type I errors (especially at privacy budgets ε ≤ 1), indicating a high risk of false discoveries"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus focuses on text generation rather than statistical inference validity
- Break condition: If privacy budget is sufficiently large (ϵ ≥ 5) and dataset size is large enough, noise effects may be diluted and Type I error returns to acceptable levels.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: DP Smoothed Histogram method preserves Type I error validity by using additive smoothing proportional to dataset size and privacy budget.
- Mechanism: By adding Laplace noise scaled by 2m/ϵ (where m is synthetic dataset size) to histogram counts before sampling, the method ensures that the resulting synthetic data maintains proper statistical properties under the null hypothesis.
- Core assumption: The additive smoothing approach properly calibrates noise magnitude relative to both privacy requirements and synthetic data generation needs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "A DP smoothed histogram-based synthetic data generation method was shown to produce valid Type I error for all privacy levels tested"
  - [section] "Drawing m synthetic data instead of only one datum requires m times larger privacy budget. Consequently, drawing m according to the probabilities proportional to ci + 2m/ϵ is ϵ differentially private."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus focuses on text generation rather than histogram-based methods
- Break condition: If original dataset size is too small, the smoothing cannot provide adequate noise calibration, leading to either invalid Type I error or excessive Type II error.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: DP GAN methods show increasing Type I error as privacy level decreases due to gradient perturbation effects.
- Mechanism: Differentially private GANs use gradient clipping and noise addition during training, which can create artifacts in the learned data distribution that manifest as spurious statistical differences between groups.
- Core assumption: The gradient perturbation procedure in DP GANs introduces structured noise that affects the synthetic data's statistical properties in ways that standard hypothesis tests cannot account for.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "DP GAN algorithms" showing "inflated Type I errors (especially at privacy budgets ε ≤ 1)"
  - [section] "DP GAN shows very high Type I error that as an interesting contrast to the other methods grows as privacy level is reduced"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus focuses on text generation rather than GAN-based synthetic data
- Break condition: If privacy budget is increased sufficiently, the gradient perturbation effects may be reduced enough to allow valid statistical inference.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Differential Privacy and its mathematical guarantees
  - Why needed here: Understanding how DP mechanisms add noise and their effect on statistical validity is crucial for interpreting the study's results
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between privacy budget ϵ and the amount of noise added in DP mechanisms?

- Concept: Type I and Type II error in hypothesis testing
  - Why needed here: The study evaluates DP-synthetic data specifically in terms of these error types to assess validity and power of statistical tests
  - Quick check question: How does an inflated Type I error rate affect the reliability of scientific discoveries?

- Concept: Mann-Whitney U test and its assumptions
  - Why needed here: This is the primary statistical test used in the study to evaluate DP-synthetic data quality
  - Quick check question: Under what conditions is the Mann-Whitney U test considered valid for comparing two distributions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Original sensitive datasets → DP-synthetic data generation methods → statistical hypothesis testing → evaluation of Type I/II errors
- Critical path: Original dataset → DP-synthetic generation → Mann-Whitney U test → Type I/II error calculation → comparison to expected error rates
- Design tradeoffs: Privacy vs utility tradeoff is central - higher privacy (lower ϵ) provides better privacy guarantees but degrades statistical validity. Dataset size also matters significantly, with larger datasets generally providing better utility at given privacy levels.
- Failure signatures: High Type I error rates indicate spurious statistical differences introduced by noise; high Type II error rates indicate loss of true signal; the combination of both indicates poor synthetic data quality.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run Mann-Whitney U test on DP Perturbed Histogram synthetic data with ϵ = 0.01 and original dataset size = 500 to observe inflated Type I error
  2. Test DP Smoothed Histogram method with ϵ = 5 and large original dataset (n=20,000) to verify valid Type I error
  3. Compare Type II error between DP GAN and Private-PGM methods at ϵ = 1 with signal data to understand power differences

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal balance between privacy budget (ε) and synthetic data utility for statistical hypothesis testing across different methods?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses how different DP methods perform at various ε levels, with most showing inflated Type I errors at ε ≤ 1, while the DP Smoothed Histogram method requires ε ≥ 5 for reasonable power
- Why unresolved: The paper shows varying results across different methods and dataset sizes, but doesn't establish universal guidelines for optimal ε selection based on dataset characteristics or intended use cases
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic studies comparing different DP methods across various dataset sizes, dimensionalities, and statistical tests, establishing quantitative relationships between ε, dataset properties, and test validity

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do higher-dimensional datasets affect the validity and power of statistical tests on DP-synthetic data?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper acknowledges this as a limitation, noting that "Increasing the dimensionality of the dataset will increase the complexity of the generation process, which may result in a higher risk of false inference"
- Why unresolved: The study only used two-variable datasets, and the authors explicitly note that results may not generalize to higher dimensions
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental evaluation of DP-synthetic data generation methods on datasets with varying numbers of dimensions, measuring Type I and Type II errors across different statistical tests

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal discretization strategy for continuous variables in DP-synthetic data generation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that "discretization must be performed in a private manner or based on literature to avoid leaking private information" and that "the number of bins used to discretize the data has a significant impact on the quality of the resulting data"
- Why unresolved: The paper used different numbers of bins for different datasets without establishing optimal strategies, and acknowledges that this choice is "problem- and data-dependent"
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic comparison of different discretization approaches (varying number of bins, bin boundaries, and private vs. public selection) across multiple datasets and DP methods, measuring impact on statistical test validity

## Limitations
- Results may not generalize to other statistical tests beyond the Mann-Whitney U test
- Only two-variable datasets were evaluated, limiting conclusions about higher-dimensional data
- Specific implementation details of DP methods may affect results and are not fully specified

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Most DP methods show inflated Type I error at low privacy budgets (ε ≤ 1) across multiple datasets and methods
- **Medium confidence**: DP Smoothed Histogram maintains valid Type I error but requires larger datasets and higher privacy budgets (ε ≥ 5) for reasonable power
- **Low confidence**: DP GAN methods uniquely show increasing Type I error as privacy level decreases may be method-specific

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-test validation**: Evaluate the same DP methods using additional statistical tests (t-test, KS test) to verify if inflated Type I error is specific to Mann-Whitney U or a general phenomenon.

2. **Method parameter sensitivity**: Systematically vary key parameters (bin sizes, smoothing factors, GAN architecture) to determine which aspects of DP-synthetic generation most strongly affect Type I error inflation.

3. **Real-world impact assessment**: Apply the validated DP Smoothed Histogram method to a real-world case study where differential privacy is legally or ethically required, measuring both statistical validity and privacy compliance.
