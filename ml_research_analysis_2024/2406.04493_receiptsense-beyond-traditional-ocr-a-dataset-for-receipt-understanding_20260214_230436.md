# ReceiptSense: Beyond Traditional OCR -- A Dataset for Receipt Understanding

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.04493
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04493
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: CORU dataset addresses multilingual OCR and information extraction from receipts, particularly for complex scripts like Arabic

## Executive Summary
The CORU dataset represents a significant advancement in multilingual receipt understanding, providing 20,000 annotated receipts with complex layouts and mixed-language content. It addresses the critical challenge of processing receipts containing both Arabic and English text, offering comprehensive annotations for object detection, OCR, and information extraction tasks. The dataset includes detailed item-level annotations and a new Receipt QA subset, enabling fine-grained analysis of receipt items for applications like itemized billing and inventory management.

## Method Summary
The CORU dataset was developed through rigorous data collection from diverse retail environments, followed by comprehensive annotation processes. The methodology integrates human annotation for object detection, OCR, and item-specific details across 20,000 receipts. Baseline evaluations were conducted using both traditional methods (Tesseract OCR) and advanced neural networks including YOLOv7, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and DETR-DINO models. The dataset is publicly available on GitHub and includes standardized evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, mean Average Precision (mAP), Character Error Rate (CER), and Word Error Rate (WER).

## Key Results
- CORU dataset provides 20,000 annotated receipts, 30,000 OCR-annotated images, and 10,000 item-level annotations
- Baseline performance shows effectiveness for processing complex, noisy real-world receipt layouts
- Dataset captures essential details including merchant names, item descriptions, prices, receipt numbers, and dates

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The CORU dataset enables better multilingual OCR and information extraction by providing real-world, noisy receipt images with complex layouts and mixed-language content.
- Mechanism: The dataset captures essential details like merchant names, item descriptions, prices, receipt numbers, and dates, structured to support object detection, OCR, and information extraction tasks. The inclusion of 20,000 annotated receipts, 30,000 OCR-annotated images, and 10,000 item-level annotations creates a comprehensive training environment that reflects the challenges of real-world receipt processing.
- Core assumption: Models trained on this dataset will generalize better to real-world scenarios due to exposure to diverse layouts, degraded text quality, and multilingual content.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The CORU dataset advances automated multilingual document processing research"
  - [section 3] "Our methodology integrates rigorous data collection, annotation, and quality control processes, ensuring that CORU is both diverse and reflective of real-world scenarios."
  - [corpus] Weak - The corpus shows related papers on OCR and document processing but doesn't specifically validate the effectiveness of the CORU dataset.
- Break condition: If the dataset's diversity and quality control measures are not sufficient to represent the full range of real-world receipt variations, model performance may not generalize well.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The combination of traditional OCR methods (Tesseract) and advanced neural networks in baseline evaluations demonstrates the dataset's effectiveness for processing complex, noisy real-world receipt layouts.
- Mechanism: By establishing baseline performance using both traditional and advanced methods, the dataset provides a benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of different approaches to OCR and information extraction from receipts. This allows researchers to identify areas for improvement and develop more robust models.
- Core assumption: The performance gap between traditional and advanced methods will highlight the specific challenges of receipt processing and guide the development of more effective solutions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Baseline performance using traditional methods (Tesseract OCR) and advanced neural networks demonstrates the dataset's effectiveness"
  - [section 6] "Our evaluation spans a variety of model types, from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers to cutting-edge language models, providing insights into their performance across different computational tasks and conditions outlined in the CORU dataset."
  - [corpus] Weak - The corpus includes papers on OCR and document processing but doesn't specifically address the effectiveness of using CORU for benchmarking.
- Break condition: If the baseline evaluations do not accurately reflect the challenges of real-world receipt processing, the dataset may not effectively guide the development of more robust models.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The detailed item-specific annotations in the dataset enable fine-grained analysis and classification of receipt items, supporting applications like itemized billing and inventory management.
- Mechanism: By providing detailed annotations for 10,000 items, including item names, classifications, quantities, unit sizes, prices, packaging, and brands, the dataset enables the development of models that can extract and classify item-specific information with high accuracy. This supports applications that require detailed analysis of receipt items.
- Core assumption: Models trained on this detailed item-level data will be able to accurately extract and classify item-specific information in real-world scenarios.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3] "Detailed annotations were applied to each receipt element such as item names, classifications, quantities, unit sizes, prices, packaging, and brands."
  - [section 4] "This focus is instrumental for applications requiring fine-grained analysis like itemized billing and inventory management."
  - [corpus] Weak - The corpus includes papers on document processing and information extraction but doesn't specifically validate the effectiveness of item-level annotations for receipt understanding.
- Break condition: If the item-level annotations are not comprehensive or accurate enough, models may not be able to effectively extract and classify item-specific information in real-world scenarios.

## Foundational Learning

  - Why needed here: Understanding the basics of OCR is crucial for developing models that can accurately extract text from receipt images.
  - Quick check question: What are the main challenges in OCR for receipts compared to other documents?

- Concept: Object Detection
  - Why needed here: Object detection is essential for identifying and localizing key elements on receipts, such as merchant names, dates, and item descriptions.
  - Quick check question: How do different object detection models handle the complex layouts and diverse text sizes found in receipts?

- Concept: Information Extraction

  - Quick check question: What are the main challenges in extracting structured information from noisy, multilingual receipt text?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data Collection -> Annotation -> Models -> Baseline Performance
- Critical path: Data collection → Annotation → Model evaluation → Performance analysis
- Design tradeoffs: Balancing dataset size and diversity with annotation quality and consistency. Choosing between traditional and advanced models based on performance and computational efficiency.
- Failure signatures: Poor model performance on unseen receipt layouts or languages, high error rates in OCR or information extraction tasks.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the performance of different object detection models (e.g., YOLO, DETR) on the CORU dataset.
  2. Compare the accuracy of traditional OCR methods (e.g., Tesseract) with advanced neural network-based OCR models.
  3. Assess the effectiveness of different information extraction models in extracting structured data from receipts in the CORU dataset.
