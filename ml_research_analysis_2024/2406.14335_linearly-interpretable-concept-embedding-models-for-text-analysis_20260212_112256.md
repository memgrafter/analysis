# Linearly-Interpretable Concept Embedding Models for Text Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.14335
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14335
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces LICEM, a linearly interpretable concept embedding model for text analysis that achieves high accuracy while providing transparent, causally consistent explanations.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LICEM, a linearly interpretable concept embedding model for text analysis that achieves high accuracy while providing transparent, causally consistent explanations. Unlike prior concept-based models that use non-linear task predictors or lack interpretability, LICEM generates interpretable linear equations over concept predictions, allowing users to understand and intervene in the model's reasoning. A self-generative variant (Self-LICEM) leverages a large language model to automatically predict concepts without human supervision, achieving strong performance even without concept labels. Experiments on multiple text datasets show LICEM matches or surpasses black-box models in accuracy while significantly improving interpretability and responsiveness to interventions.

## Method Summary
LICEM uses a two-module architecture with neural modules ρ and β to predict weights and bias terms of a linear equation for each class. These weights are applied to concept predictions (ˆcj) to produce the final classification. The model combines the expressiveness of concept embeddings with the interpretability of linear functions. A self-generative variant eliminates the need for concept annotations by using the same LLM for both encoding and concept prediction. The approach is evaluated across multiple text datasets including sentiment analysis, emotion detection, and intent classification tasks.

## Key Results
- LICEM classification accuracy matches or exceeds black-box models while providing interpretable linear explanations
- Self-LICEM achieves strong concept accuracy without human supervision, outperforming generative baselines
- LICEM demonstrates superior intervention effectiveness, with area under accuracy gain curve exceeding 0.95 across all tasks
- User studies confirm LICEM explanations are more understandable and actionable than black-box alternatives

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LICEM generates interpretable linear equations over concept predictions, allowing users to understand and intervene in the model's reasoning.
- Mechanism: The model uses two neural modules, ρ and β, to predict the weights and bias terms of a linear equation for each class. These weights are applied to the concept predictions (ˆcj) to produce the final classification. This creates a transparent mapping from concepts to predictions.
- Core assumption: Concept embeddings can be linearly combined to produce interpretable and accurate task predictions without sacrificing performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "LICEM generates interpretable linear equations over concept predictions, allowing users to understand and intervene in the model's reasoning."
  - [section]: "To create an interpretable model, it is essential to utilize both an interpretable data representation and an interpretable function...we propose to neurally generate a linear equation that can be symbolically executed over the concept predictions."
- Break condition: If the concept embedding dimensions are not linearly separable for the task, or if the linear combination fails to capture non-linear interactions between concepts.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The self-generative approach allows LICEM to achieve high concept accuracy without human supervision by using the same LLM for both encoding and concept prediction.
- Mechanism: The LLM is prompted to generate both the text representation (e) and the concept predictions (c') in a single forward pass. This eliminates the need for separate concept annotation and training of a concept encoder.
- Core assumption: The LLM has sufficient knowledge of the concepts to accurately predict their presence in the text without explicit training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Self-LICEM) leverages a large language model to automatically predict concepts without human supervision, achieving strong performance even without concept labels."
  - [section]: "we propose using the same LLM to directly make the concept predictions...This eliminates the need for concept annotations, but also reduces the number of parameters to train and improves concept performance if compared to the generative method."
- Break condition: If the LLM lacks sufficient knowledge of the domain concepts, or if the prompt engineering fails to elicit accurate concept predictions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: LICEM achieves better accuracy-interpretability trade-off than existing interpretable models by combining the expressiveness of concept embeddings with the interpretability of linear functions.
- Mechanism: By using concept embeddings as input to the linear equation, LICEM captures richer representations than CBMs while maintaining interpretability. The linear form ensures that the contribution of each concept to the prediction is transparent.
- Core assumption: Concept embeddings provide a sufficiently rich representation of the concepts while still being linearly combinable for accurate task prediction.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "LICEM classification accuracy is better than existing interpretable models and matches black-box ones."
  - [section]: "Ideally, we want a task predictor that combines the expressiveness of CEM with the interpretability of logistic regression applied directly to concept predictions."
- Break condition: If the concept embeddings are too high-dimensional or complex for the linear combination to capture the necessary information, or if the linear form is too restrictive for the task.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
  - Why needed here: Understanding CBMs is crucial because LICEM builds upon their architecture while addressing their limitations. CBMs provide a transparent intermediate representation but are limited by their bottleneck architecture.
  - Quick check question: What are the two main limitations of CBMs that LICEM aims to address?

- Concept: Concept Embeddings
  - Why needed here: Concept embeddings are the key innovation that allows LICEM to achieve higher expressiveness than CBMs. Understanding how they work and their interpretability trade-offs is essential.
  - Quick check question: How do concept embeddings differ from single-neuron concept representations in CBMs?

- Concept: Linear Interpretability
  - Why needed here: The core innovation of LICEM is its use of linear equations for task prediction. Understanding what makes a model "linearly interpretable" and why this is beneficial is crucial.
  - Quick check question: Why is a linear function over concept predictions more interpretable than a non-linear function?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - LLM Encoder (h) -> Text embedding (e)
  - Text embedding -> Concept Embedding Layer (q) -> Concept embeddings (c)
  - Concept embeddings -> Concept Prediction Module (s) -> Concept predictions (ˆcj)
  - Concept embeddings -> Weight Prediction Module (ρ) -> Weights (ˆwij)
  - Concept embeddings -> Bias Prediction Module (β) -> Biases (ˆbi)
  - Linear equation: Σ(ˆwijˆcj) + ˆbi -> Class prediction

- Critical path:
  1. Text input -> LLM Encoder -> Text embedding (e)
  2. Text embedding -> Concept Embedding Layer -> Concept embeddings (c)
  3. Concept embeddings -> Concept Prediction Module -> Concept predictions (ˆcj)
  4. Concept embeddings -> Weight Prediction Module -> Weights (ˆwij)
  5. Concept embeddings -> Bias Prediction Module -> Biases (ˆbi)
  6. Linear equation: Σ(ˆwijˆcj) + ˆbi -> Class prediction

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Expressiveness vs. Interpretability: Using concept embeddings provides more expressive power than single-neuron concepts but requires a linear combination to maintain interpretability.
  - Supervision vs. Self-generation: The self-generative approach eliminates the need for concept annotations but relies on the LLM's knowledge of the concepts.
  - Model Complexity: Adding weight and bias prediction modules increases model complexity but enables more accurate and interpretable predictions.

- Failure signatures:
  - Low concept accuracy: Indicates issues with the concept prediction module or the LLM's ability to identify concepts.
  - Poor task accuracy: Suggests that the linear combination of concept embeddings is not sufficient to capture the task-relevant information.
  - Uninterpretable explanations: May indicate that the weights are not sparse or meaningful, or that the concept embeddings are not semantically aligned with the concepts.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify concept prediction accuracy on a small dataset with known concept labels.
  2. Test the interpretability of the generated linear equations by examining the weights and comparing them to human intuition.
  3. Compare the task accuracy of LICEM to a baseline CBM and a black-box model on a standard text classification dataset.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the self-generative approach maintain its performance advantage over generative methods when applied to longer texts (e.g., full articles or books)?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions that "In future work, we will extend our analysis to other NLP tasks and to longer texts, to ensure the scalability of this approach." This suggests that the current evaluation is limited to shorter texts like reviews and questions.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests on datasets with relatively short texts (reviews, questions, social media comments). The performance of self-LICEM on longer, more complex texts is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing self-LICEM performance on datasets with longer documents (e.g., news articles, academic papers, novels) against both generative methods and black-box models.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does LICEM's interpretability and performance degrade under significant domain shift or distribution drift?
- Basis in paper: The paper states "Finally, even with regularization, model predictions can be biased in inputs lacking clear concept signals, especially under ambiguity or domain drift." This explicitly acknowledges this limitation but doesn't quantify it.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't test LICEM on out-of-distribution data or simulate domain shift scenarios. The robustness of the model's explanations and accuracy in such situations is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing LICEM on data from different domains than training data, or gradually introducing noise/distortions to test stability of both accuracy and interpretability.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the computational overhead of LICEM compared to black-box models, and how does this scale with the number of concepts and classes?
- Basis in paper: The paper notes "LICEM's advantage over DCR is due to its simpler and more direct classification mechanism... making both training and inference more efficient." However, no quantitative comparison of computational costs is provided.
- Why unresolved: While LICEM is described as more interpretable and having similar accuracy to black-box models, the paper doesn't provide runtime benchmarks or analyze how computational requirements scale with model complexity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmark comparisons showing training/inference times for LICEM versus black-box models (E2E, BERT) across different dataset sizes, number of concepts, and class counts.

## Limitations
- The self-generative approach's performance depends heavily on the LLM's knowledge of domain concepts, which may not generalize well across all domains
- Interpretability claims are primarily validated through quantitative metrics and a small user study (16 participants), lacking extensive human-centered evaluation
- The model requires concept annotations for the supervised version, limiting applicability in domains where such annotations are expensive or unavailable

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The architectural design and training methodology are clearly specified and reproducible. The linear interpretability claim is well-supported by the model's structure - the use of neural modules to predict weights and biases for a linear equation over concept predictions is explicitly described and verifiable.
- **Medium Confidence**: The performance claims relative to baseline models are supported by experimental results, but the paper doesn't provide extensive ablation studies showing the individual contributions of each component (concept embeddings vs. linear prediction vs. LLM encoding).
- **Low Confidence**: The self-generative approach's robustness across different domains and concept types is not thoroughly evaluated. The paper shows promising results but doesn't explore failure modes or limitations of using the same LLM for both encoding and concept prediction.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-LLM Validation**: Implement LICEM using multiple LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities (e.g., Mistral-7B, Llama-2-70B) to test the robustness of concept extraction and overall model performance. Compare concept F1 scores and task accuracy across different LLM backbones.

2. **Concept Quality Analysis**: Conduct a detailed analysis of the concept embeddings learned by LICEM, examining whether the dimensions correspond to semantically meaningful concepts and whether the linear weights learned by ρ module align with human intuition about concept importance for each class.

3. **Intervention Robustness Testing**: Design experiments that systematically manipulate concept predictions and measure the model's response across different classes and datasets. Test whether interventions on high-weight concepts consistently produce expected changes in predictions, and identify any concepts that have unexpectedly large or small effects.
