# Eyeballing Combinatorial Problems: A Case Study of Using Multimodal Large Language Models to Solve Traveling Salesman Problems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.06865
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06865
- Reference count: 14
- Primary result: MLLMs can effectively solve TSP problems through visual analysis of point distributions

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to solve Traveling Salesman Problems (TSP) by visually analyzing point distributions. The study tests multiple prompting strategies including zero-shot, few-shot, self-ensemble, and self-refinement methods. Results demonstrate that MLLMs can effectively "eyeball" viable TSP routes, with zero-shot prompting showing more stable performance than few-shot approaches. The research establishes that visualizing input points is more effective than textual descriptions for this combinatorial problem-solving task.

## Method Summary
The study employs a comprehensive experimental framework testing MLLMs across four prompting strategies: zero-shot prompting where models solve TSP problems without examples, few-shot prompting with provided examples, self-ensemble methods that combine multiple model outputs, and self-refinement techniques using iterative visual feedback. The researchers use synthetic TSP instances and evaluate solution quality through standard metrics. The methodology systematically compares visual versus textual input representations and examines the effectiveness of different prompting approaches for visual reasoning in combinatorial optimization problems.

## Key Results
- Zero-shot prompting demonstrates more stable performance compared to few-shot approaches
- Self-ensemble methods significantly enhance solution quality through combination strategies
- Self-refinement improves route optimization through iterative visual feedback loops
- Visual input representation proves more effective than textual descriptions for TSP problem-solving

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism leverages MLLMs' inherent visual processing capabilities to interpret spatial relationships and geometric patterns in TSP point distributions. By providing visual rather than textual representations, the models can directly perceive distance relationships and potential route structures. The self-ensemble approach works by aggregating diverse solution perspectives from multiple model instances, while self-refinement enables iterative improvement through visual feedback, allowing the model to recognize and correct suboptimal route segments based on spatial reasoning.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)**: AI models capable of processing both visual and textual inputs simultaneously - needed for visual-TSP reasoning, quick check: verify model can describe images accurately
2. **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**: Combinatorial optimization problem finding shortest route visiting all points exactly once - needed as test domain, quick check: confirm problem definition matches standard TSP formulation
3. **Zero-shot vs Few-shot prompting**: Different prompting strategies for model guidance - needed to compare learning approaches, quick check: verify examples provided in few-shot conditions
4. **Self-ensemble methods**: Combining multiple model outputs for improved results - needed for quality enhancement, quick check: confirm ensemble aggregation method
5. **Visual feedback loops**: Iterative refinement using visual input - needed for self-refinement capability, quick check: verify feedback mechanism implementation
6. **Route optimization metrics**: Quantitative measures for solution quality - needed for performance evaluation, quick check: confirm metric calculation methods

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Visual Input -> MLLM Processing -> Route Generation -> Quality Assessment -> (Self-ensemble/Refinement) -> Final Solution

**Critical Path**: Visual Input → MLLM Processing → Route Generation → Quality Assessment

**Design Tradeoffs**: Visual input provides richer spatial information but requires more computational resources compared to text; zero-shot prompting reduces preparation time but may sacrifice some optimization compared to few-shot; self-ensemble improves quality but increases computation time; self-refinement enables iterative improvement but adds complexity

**Failure Signatures**: Poor route quality indicates insufficient visual processing capability; inconsistent results across runs suggest instability in prompting strategy; degraded performance with complex point distributions indicates limited scalability; preference for textual over visual input suggests model training bias

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Test basic TSP problem solving with visual input only
2. Compare zero-shot versus few-shot prompting performance
3. Evaluate self-ensemble effectiveness by varying ensemble size

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation framework relies on specific MLLM architectures without systematic testing across diverse models
- Study uses synthetic TSP instances that may not capture real-world routing complexity
- Performance metrics focus narrowly on route quality without examining computational efficiency or scalability

## Confidence
High: Comparative advantage of zero-shot over few-shot prompting and effectiveness of self-ensemble methods are supported by experimental design and results; superiority of visual input over textual descriptions appears robust

Medium: Claims about MLLMs' "potential" for visual reasoning in combinatorial problems extend beyond the specific TSP domain tested; assertion that results "pave the way for further research" is speculative given narrow problem scope

Low: Paper does not adequately address potential confounding factors such as MLLM training data overlap with TSP problems or role of implicit heuristics versus genuine reasoning

## Next Checks
1. Test the approach across multiple MLLM architectures (e.g., GPT-4V, Gemini, Claude) to assess model dependency
2. Evaluate performance on real-world TSP instances with non-uniform distributions and obstacles
3. Conduct ablation studies to isolate contribution of visual features versus textual reasoning in the solutions
