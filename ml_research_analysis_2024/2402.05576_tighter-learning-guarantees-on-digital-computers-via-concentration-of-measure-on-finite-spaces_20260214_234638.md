# Tighter Learning Guarantees on Digital Computers via Concentration of Measure on Finite Spaces

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.05576
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05576
- Authors: Anastasis Kratsios; A. Martina Neuman; Gudmund Pammer

- Primary result: Derives adaptive generalization bounds {c_m/N^(1/(2∨m))}_{m=1}^∞ for ML models on digital computers by exploiting finite grid constraints

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel framework for analyzing machine learning models implemented on digital computers, which operate on finite grids due to hardware limitations. The authors derive a family of generalization bounds that adapt to both the sample size N and the geometric representation dimension m of the discrete learning problem. By exploiting the discrete structures imposed by digital computing, the curse of dimensionality is systematically broken, yielding significantly tighter generalization bounds for practical sample sizes while maintaining the optimal dimension-free worst-case rate of O(1/N^1/2) for massive N.

## Method Summary
The paper leverages a new non-asymptotic concentration of measure result for finite metric spaces, established via metric embedding arguments. The key insight is that digital computers impose discrete structures on learning problems by limiting inputs to finite grids due to finite precision and memory constraints. This discretization enables the derivation of concentration bounds that depend on both sample size N and the geometric representation dimension m, rather than just N and ambient dimension d. The method combines metric embedding theory with optimal transport to establish these concentration results, which are then used to derive adaptive generalization bounds for various learning models.

## Key Results
- Derives a family of generalization bounds {c_m/N^(1/(2∨m))}_{m=1}^∞ that adapt to both sample size N and geometric representation dimension m
- Breaks the curse of dimensionality systematically when models are implemented on real computers
- Maintains optimal dimension-free worst-case rate of O(1/N^1/2) for massive N while providing tighter bounds for practical sample sizes
- Applies to ReLU MLPs and kernel ridge regressors implemented on real-world machines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Digital computing constraints enable breaking the curse of dimensionality by forcing discrete representations of continuous spaces.
- Mechanism: Finite precision arithmetic limits inputs to discrete grids (Rd_p,M), reducing the effective dimensionality and enabling tighter concentration bounds.
- Core assumption: Digital computers operate on finite grids due to hardware limitations like finite machine precision and limited RAM.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions "constraints imposed on machine learning models by standard digital computers"; section notes "stylized mathematical assumptions fail to capture the constraints imposed on machine learning models by standard digital computers."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Adaptive generalization bounds can be derived by exploiting the geometric representation dimension m of the discrete learning problem.
- Mechanism: The paper introduces a family of generalization bounds {c_m/N^(1/(2∨m))}_{m=1}^∞ that adapt to both the sample size N and the geometric representation dimension m, allowing for tighter bounds for practical sample sizes.
- Core assumption: The geometry of the discrete learning problem can be embedded into Euclidean spaces of varying dimensions.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states "curse of dimensionality in statistical learning is systematically broken when models are implemented on real computers"; section describes deriving bounds that "adapt to both the sample size N and the so-called geometric representation dimension m."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: A new non-asymptotic concentration of measure result for finite metric spaces enables tighter generalization bounds.
- Mechanism: The paper establishes a new concentration of measure result between a probability measure over any finite metric space and its empirical version associated with N i.i.d. samples when measured in the 1-Wasserstein distance.
- Core assumption: Concentration of measure results can be extended to finite metric spaces with adaptive rates.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions "our new non-asymptotic result for concentration of measure in finite metric spaces, established via leveraging metric embedding arguments"; section notes "Our results are built on new techniques combining metric embedding theory with optimal transport."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Metric embedding theory
  - Why needed here: To represent finite metric spaces as subsets of Euclidean spaces of varying dimensions, enabling the derivation of concentration bounds.
  - Quick check question: What is the distortion τ(φ) of a bi-Lipschitz embedding φ, and how does it relate to the representation dimension m?

- Concept: Optimal transport and Wasserstein distance
  - Why needed here: To measure the distance between probability measures on finite metric spaces, which is crucial for deriving concentration bounds.
  - Quick check question: How does the 1-Wasserstein distance between a probability measure P and its empirical version P_N depend on the sample size N and the geometry of the underlying space?

- Concept: Generalization bounds in statistical learning theory
  - Why needed here: To quantify the performance of machine learning models on unseen data, which is the ultimate goal of the paper.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between the generalization gap |R(ˆf) - ˆR(ˆf)| and the estimation gap |R⋆(ˆf) - ˆR(ˆf)|, and how do they relate to the sample size N and the complexity of the hypothesis class F?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Metric embedding theory → Optimal transport and Wasserstein distance → Concentration of measure results → Generalization bounds
- Critical path: Metric embedding → Concentration bounds → Generalization bounds
- Design tradeoffs: Balancing the representation dimension m to optimize the tradeoff between the constant c_m and the convergence rate 1/N^(1/(2∨m)).
- Failure signatures: If the discrete learning problem cannot be effectively embedded into Euclidean spaces of varying dimensions, or if the concentration of measure result cannot be effectively applied to finite metric spaces.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify the concentration of measure result for simple finite metric spaces (e.g., discrete grids) with varying sample sizes N.
  2. Apply the adaptive generalization bounds to standard machine learning models (e.g., ReLU MLPs, kernel ridge regressors) on discretized Euclidean domains.
  3. Compare the generalization bounds derived using the adaptive approach with those obtained using classical methods (e.g., Rademacher complexity, VC theory) for various sample sizes N and dimensions d.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the concentration of measure phenomenon change for other distance metrics besides the 1-Wasserstein distance, such as the 2-Wasserstein distance or other optimal transport distances?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper focuses on the 1-Wasserstein distance, but mentions that other statistical "distances" like f-divergence do not reflect the geometry of the input and output spaces.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the behavior of concentration of measure for other distance metrics, and the authors do not provide any theoretical results or empirical evidence for such extensions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical proofs or empirical studies showing the concentration of measure rates for other distance metrics on finite metric spaces, and comparing them to the 1-Wasserstein distance results.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do the generalization bounds derived in this paper extend to other learning models beyond ReLU MLPs and kernel ridge regressors, such as transformers, graph neural networks, or other deep learning architectures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that their results can be applied to various contemporary machine learning models, including graph neural networks and generative models, but do not provide specific examples or proofs for these models.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on ReLU MLPs and kernel ridge regressors as case studies, and does not explore the generalization bounds for other learning models in detail.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical proofs or empirical studies deriving generalization bounds for other learning models using the framework presented in this paper, and comparing them to the results for ReLU MLPs and kernel ridge regressors.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do the generalization bounds change when considering different noise models beyond the bounded noise assumption (12) used in this paper, such as Gaussian noise or other distributions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper assumes a bounded noise level ∆ in equation (12), but does not explore the behavior of the generalization bounds under different noise models.
- Why unresolved: The authors do not provide any theoretical results or empirical evidence for the generalization bounds under different noise models, and the impact of the noise model on the bounds is not discussed.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical proofs or empirical studies deriving generalization bounds under different noise models, and comparing them to the results obtained under the bounded noise assumption.

## Limitations

- The practical significance depends on whether the "geometric representation dimension" m is actually small enough in real-world applications to justify the improved bounds.
- The concentration of measure results for finite metric spaces may have conservative constants that limit their practical utility.
- The adaptive bounds' improvement over classical approaches for typical sample sizes and dimensions used in practice remains to be thoroughly demonstrated.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The mathematical derivations of concentration bounds for finite metric spaces and the embedding-based approach are rigorously established.
- **Medium confidence**: The adaptive generalization bounds' practical improvement over classical bounds for real-world sample sizes and dimensions, though theoretically justified, requires more extensive empirical validation.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that digital computing constraints contribute to real-world ML success is plausible but not definitively proven; the paper provides theoretical justification but limited empirical evidence.

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical validation across diverse models**: Apply the adaptive generalization bounds to a wider range of ML models (beyond ReLU MLPs and kernel ridge regressors) and datasets, comparing the derived bounds with classical approaches (e.g., Rademacher complexity) for various sample sizes N and dimensions d.

2. **Practical significance of m**: Analyze the geometric representation dimension m for real-world ML problems and datasets to determine if it's small enough to justify the improved convergence rates. This includes investigating the relationship between m, sample size N, and model complexity.

3. **Verification of concentration bounds**: Implement the concentration of measure results for finite metric spaces with varying sample sizes N and embedding dimensions m, comparing the theoretical bounds with empirical measurements of Wasserstein distances between population and empirical measures.
