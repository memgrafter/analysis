# Interpretable Multivariate Time Series Forecasting Using Neural Fourier Transform

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.13812
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13812
- Reference count: 33
- Primary result: State-of-the-art MSE reductions on 14 diverse datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Neural Fourier Transform (NFT), a novel approach for interpretable multivariate time series forecasting that combines multi-dimensional Fourier transforms with Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN). The method captures seasonal patterns and inter-variable dependencies by decomposing time series data into frequency components and learning Fourier coefficients. NFT achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant MSE improvements across multiple datasets including Electricity, ILI, Traffic, Exchange Rate, ETT, ECG, EEG, Air Quality, Chorales, and Weather records.

## Method Summary
NFT operates by first decomposing multivariate time series data into frequency components across both variables and timeline using multi-dimensional Fourier transforms. The resulting frequency domain representation is then processed by Temporal Convolutional Network layers that learn to predict Fourier coefficients. This approach allows the model to capture complex seasonal patterns and dependencies between variables while maintaining interpretability through the decomposition into seasonal and trend components. The architecture is designed to be computationally efficient while achieving superior forecasting accuracy compared to existing methods.

## Key Results
- NFT achieves state-of-the-art performance with 82.69% MSE reduction on Exchange Rate dataset
- Significant improvements on multiple datasets: 71.01% on ILI, 46.04% on Air Quality
- Demonstrates faster training times compared to TimesNet, PatchTST, Autoformer, and N-BEATS

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
NFT leverages the inherent periodic structure in many time series datasets by transforming them into the frequency domain where seasonal patterns become more apparent and easier to model. The combination of Fourier transforms with TCN layers allows the model to capture both global seasonal patterns and local temporal dependencies simultaneously. By learning Fourier coefficients rather than raw time series values, NFT can more effectively model complex multi-scale patterns that are difficult to capture in the time domain alone.

## Foundational Learning
- **Multi-dimensional Fourier Transform**: Decomposes multivariate time series into frequency components across variables and time - needed to separate seasonal patterns from trends
- **Temporal Convolutional Networks**: Learn local temporal dependencies in frequency domain - needed to capture short-term variations and transitions
- **Fourier Coefficient Learning**: Predict future frequency components rather than raw values - needed for better handling of periodic patterns
- **Frequency Domain Interpretation**: Enables decomposition into interpretable seasonal and trend components - needed for model explainability

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Input Time Series -> Multi-dimensional Fourier Transform -> TCN Layers -> Fourier Coefficients -> Inverse Transform -> Forecast

Critical Path:
1. Time series decomposition into frequency components
2. TCN-based learning of Fourier coefficients
3. Inverse transformation to obtain final forecast

Design Tradeoffs:
- Frequency domain vs. time domain representation
- Complexity of multi-dimensional transforms vs. interpretability
- TCN depth vs. training efficiency

Failure Signatures:
- Poor performance on non-periodic time series
- Degradation with irregularly sampled data
- Overfitting on datasets with weak seasonal patterns

Three First Experiments:
1. Test on synthetic periodic vs. non-periodic datasets
2. Vary TCN depth and compare performance
3. Test with single-dimensional vs. multi-dimensional Fourier transforms

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Generalizability across non-periodic or irregularly sampled time series remains uncertain
- Interpretability claims lack rigorous validation through user studies or established metrics
- Efficiency comparisons limited to specific models and may not reflect broader state-of-the-art landscape

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in MSE improvement results for tested datasets
- **Medium confidence** in interpretability claims due to lack of empirical validation
- **Medium confidence** in efficiency claims due to limited comparison scope

## Next Checks
1. Test NFT on irregularly sampled or non-periodic time series datasets to evaluate limitations
2. Conduct user studies or implement quantitative interpretability metrics to validate claims
3. Expand efficiency comparisons to include broader range of state-of-the-art methods and hardware configurations
