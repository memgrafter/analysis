# Uncertainty Quantification on Graph Learning: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2404.14642
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14642
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Comprehensive survey of uncertainty quantification techniques for graph learning, covering Bayesian methods, conformal prediction, and calibration approaches.

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a systematic examination of uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques for graphical models, with particular focus on graph neural networks (GNNs) and probabilistic graphical models (PGMs). The work organizes various uncertainty representation and handling methods into three main categories: Bayesian approaches, conformal prediction, and calibration techniques. The survey aims to bridge the gap between graphical models and uncertainty quantification, highlighting both established methods and emerging research directions.

The paper covers comprehensive evaluation metrics for UQ in graph learning, including expected calibration error, Brier score, and conditional coverage metrics. It addresses key challenges specific to graph data, such as node heterogeneity and varying graph sizes, while providing insights into the practical implementation and limitations of different UQ approaches.

## Method Summary
The survey systematically organizes uncertainty quantification methods into three main categories. Bayesian approaches include both direct inference methods and Bayesian representation learning, with emphasis on variational autoencoders and Bayesian neural networks. Conformal prediction methods are explored for both exchangeable and non-exchangeable graph data settings, including neighborhood-based adaptive prediction sets. Calibration techniques cover traditional methods like temperature scaling as well as graph-specific approaches such as topology-aware calibration. The survey also provides comprehensive evaluation metrics and discusses cross-disciplinary challenges in applying UQ to graph learning.

## Key Results
- Comprehensive coverage of Bayesian inference methods for GNNs, including variational inference and direct Bayesian representation learning
- Systematic analysis of conformal prediction approaches for graph data, distinguishing between exchangeable and non-exchangeable settings
- Detailed examination of calibration techniques, including graph-specific methods like topology-aware calibration
- Thorough presentation of evaluation metrics for UQ in graph learning, including expected calibration error and conditional coverage metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey's systematic organization of uncertainty quantification methods across multiple categories enables comprehensive coverage of the field. By separating methods into Bayesian, conformal prediction, and calibration approaches, the survey provides clear pathways for understanding and implementing UQ in graph learning. The inclusion of both theoretical foundations and practical considerations helps bridge the gap between academic research and real-world applications.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Bayesian Inference for GNNs** - Understanding posterior inference over graph neural network parameters; needed for quantifying uncertainty in model predictions; quick check: implement variational inference on a small graph dataset.

2. **Conformal Prediction Theory** - Framework for constructing prediction sets with guaranteed coverage; needed for reliable uncertainty estimation in graph settings; quick check: apply conformal prediction to node classification task.

3. **Graph Calibration Methods** - Techniques for adjusting model confidence to match true accuracy; needed for reliable uncertainty quantification in GNNs; quick check: implement temperature scaling on graph neural network outputs.

4. **Evaluation Metrics for UQ** - Metrics like expected calibration error and conditional coverage; needed for assessing quality of uncertainty estimates; quick check: compute multiple UQ metrics on benchmark graph dataset.

5. **Exchangeable vs Non-exchangeable Data** - Understanding assumptions about data ordering in conformal prediction; needed for proper application of UQ methods to graph data; quick check: identify which UQ methods require exchangeability.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input Graph Data -> GNN Model -> Uncertainty Quantification Module -> Output Predictions + Uncertainty Estimates

**Critical Path:** The most critical path is: Input Graph Data → GNN Model → Uncertainty Quantification Module, where the uncertainty module must handle both node-level and graph-level predictions effectively.

**Design Tradeoffs:** Bayesian methods offer principled uncertainty quantification but suffer from computational complexity, while conformal prediction provides guaranteed coverage but may be less flexible. Calibration methods are computationally efficient but may not capture all types of uncertainty.

**Failure Signatures:** Common failure modes include overconfidence in predictions for nodes with limited neighborhood information, poor calibration for heterogeneous graph structures, and computational intractability for large-scale graphs with Bayesian methods.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Implement variational inference for a simple GNN on Cora dataset and compare with deterministic baseline
2. Apply conformal prediction to node classification task on CiteSeer dataset
3. Evaluate temperature scaling calibration on graph neural network predictions
