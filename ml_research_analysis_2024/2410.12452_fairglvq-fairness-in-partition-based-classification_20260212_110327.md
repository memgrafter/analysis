- Primary result: Novel framework for incorporating fairness into partition-based classification models using pseudo-classes and opposing gradients

## Executive Summary
FairGLVQ introduces a novel framework for incorporating fairness into partition-based classification models, specifically Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ). The method addresses group fairness by penalizing models that classify well based on protected attributes while maintaining classification performance. By adding pseudo-classes for each prototype that represent the majority protected attribute and using opposing gradients during training, FairGLVQ achieves competitive fairness-accuracy trade-offs compared to state-of-the-art methods like iterative null-space projection.

## Method Summary
FairGLVQ extends GLVQ by adding a pseudo-class for each prototype that represents the majority protected attribute. During training, an opposing gradient updates this pseudo-class, discouraging prototypes from aligning with protected attributes. The framework combines classification loss with fairness penalty through a cost function, allowing for local and non-linear fairness adaptation. Experiments demonstrate that FairGLVQ achieves competitive fairness-accuracy trade-offs on synthetic and real-world datasets (COMPAS and Adult Income) while outperforming linear decomposition methods on datasets where protected attributes and targets are non-linearly entangled.

## Key Results
- FairGLVQ achieves competitive fairness-accuracy trade-offs on synthetic and real-world datasets
- Outperforms linear methods like iterative null-space projection on datasets where linear decomposition fails
- Maintains interpretability while incorporating fairness, making it suitable for high-stakes domains

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
FairGLVQ reduces bias by penalizing prototypes that become predictive of protected attributes while maintaining target accuracy. A pseudo-class representing the majority protected attribute is assigned to each prototype, and during training, an opposing gradient updates this pseudo-class, discouraging prototypes from aligning with protected attributes. This is implemented through the cost function combining classification loss and fairness penalty.

### Mechanism 2
FairGLVQ outperforms linear fairness methods on datasets where linear decomposition fails by using local, non-linear fairness adaptation through prototype-level penalties. The local partitioning structure of LVQ allows for non-linear fairness adjustments that linear methods cannot achieve when protected attributes and targets are non-linearly entangled.

### Mechanism 3
FairGLVQ maintains interpretability while incorporating fairness, making it suitable for high-stakes domains. As a partition-based model, it provides local decision boundaries through prototypes, preserving the interpretability of traditional LVQ while adding fairness constraints through the pseudo-class mechanism.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Group fairness vs individual fairness**
  - Why needed here: The paper focuses on group fairness metrics like Statistical Parity and Equal Opportunity
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between group fairness and individual fairness in ML?

- **Concept: Margin maximization in GLVQ**
  - Why needed here: FairGLVQ extends GLVQ's margin maximization approach
  - Quick check question: How does GLVQ determine the winner-takes-all classification compared to standard LVQ?

- **Concept: Hebbian learning principles**
  - Why needed here: The fairness mechanism is explained through a Hebbian lens
  - Quick check question: What is the fundamental principle behind Hebbian learning that FairGLVQ adapts for fairness?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data → FairGLVQ model (prototypes + pseudo-classes) → Classification + Fairness penalties → Updated prototypes → Repeat
- **Critical path**: Prototype initialization → Mini-batch training with gradient updates for both class and pseudo-class → Majority vote update for pseudo-classes → Convergence check
- **Design tradeoffs**: Local fairness adaptation (advantage: handles non-linear cases) vs computational overhead of maintaining pseudo-classes
- **Failure signatures**: 
  - Fairness metrics plateau without improvement despite high regularization
  - Accuracy drops significantly with fairness regularization
  - Pseudo-classes become unstable or oscillate during training
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Run FairGLVQ on XOR dataset with C=0 (no fairness) to verify it matches GLVQ performance
  2. Run FairGLVQ on XOR dataset with C=1.5 to observe fairness-accuracy tradeoff
  3. Compare FairGLVQ vs INP on Adult dataset with varying regularization strengths to identify break points where INP fails but FairGLVQ succeeds

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does FairGLVQ perform on multi-class and multi-protected attribute problems compared to single-class/single-protected attribute settings?
- What is the impact of different initialization strategies for prototypes in FairGLVQ on fairness and accuracy outcomes?
- How does FairGLVQ handle individual fairness compared to group fairness metrics?
- What is the computational complexity of FairGLVQ compared to other fairness methods, and how does it scale with dataset size?

## Limitations
- Reliance on specific parameter settings raises questions about generalizability across different data distributions
- Experimental validation is limited to GLVQ specifically, with only brief mentions of applicability to other models
- Synthetic dataset experiments may not fully capture the complexity of real-world bias patterns

## Confidence
**High Confidence:**
- FairGLVQ successfully implements the pseudo-class mechanism for fairness in LVQ models
- The method achieves competitive fairness-accuracy trade-offs on tested datasets
- FairGLVQ outperforms linear methods on datasets where linear decomposition fails

**Medium Confidence:**
- The framework is truly general and can be applied to other partition-based models beyond GLVQ
- The interpretability claims hold when scaling to larger numbers of prototypes
- The fairness-accuracy tradeoffs observed will generalize to other datasets with different characteristics

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Dataset Validation**: Test FairGLVQ on a diverse set of datasets (e.g., German Credit, Bank Marketing) with varying levels of feature correlation between protected attributes and targets to assess robustness across different bias structures

2. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary key parameters (number of prototypes, learning rate, regularization strength C) across a wider range to identify the stability boundaries of the fairness mechanism and understand its sensitivity to initialization

3. **Interpretability Assessment**: Conduct a user study with domain experts to evaluate whether the partition-based decision boundaries remain interpretable when fairness constraints are applied, particularly as the number of prototypes increases beyond the tested range
