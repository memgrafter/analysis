# Layer-Wise Analysis of Self-Supervised Acoustic Word Embeddings: A Study on Speech Emotion Recognition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.02617
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02617
- Reference count: 0
- Acoustic Word Embeddings (AWEs) from HuBERT outperform raw HuBERT representations and Mel spectrograms in Speech Emotion Recognition, achieving 93.20% weighted accuracy on the ESD corpus.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates Acoustic Word Embeddings (AWEs) derived from HuBERT for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER). AWEs provide fixed-length representations that capture acoustic discriminability, addressing the challenge of variable-length speech inputs in SER. The study compares AWEs to raw HuBERT representations and Mel spectrograms, evaluating their performance individually and in combination with BERT embeddings through concatenation and cross-attention. A key finding is that AWEs convey a distinct "acoustic context" compared to lexical word embeddings, with their representations more aligned with word embeddings through cross-attention. Layer-wise analysis reveals that AWEs from early layers (around layer 3) are particularly effective for SER, especially when lexical content is less informative. The results highlight the potential of AWEs as a powerful feature for SER and suggest optimal strategies for leveraging self-supervised speech representations in downstream tasks.

## Method Summary
The study extracts AWEs by mean-pooling HuBERT representations over word segments, creating fixed-length embeddings that emphasize acoustic-phonetic patterns. A simple neural network classifier with two dense hidden layers (128 and 16 units) is trained for SER using Mel spectrograms, raw HuBERT representations, and AWEs, with and without BERT embeddings (concatenation and cross-attention). Local Neighborhood Similarity (LNS) is computed to compare AWEs with BERT embeddings. The experiments are conducted on two corpora: IEMOCAP (5,500 utterances, 4 emotion classes) and ESD (17,500 utterances, 5 emotion classes).

## Key Results
- AWEs outperform both HuBERT and Mel spectrograms, achieving 93.20% weighted accuracy on the ESD corpus
- Cross-attention fusion works better with AWEs than raw HuBERT representations, with only 0.04 WA gap between AWEs and raw HuBERT when fused with BERT
- Early HuBERT layers (around layer 3) are optimal for AWE-based SER, especially when lexical content is less informative

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: AWEs capture "acoustic context" that differs from lexical word embeddings
- Mechanism: Mean-pooling HuBERT frame-level representations over word boundaries creates fixed-length embeddings that emphasize acoustic-phonetic patterns rather than semantic meaning
- Core assumption: The same word pronounced with different emotions or speakers will still have similar AWEs based on acoustic discriminability
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The study compares AWEs to raw HuBERT representations and Mel spectrograms, evaluating their performance individually and in combination with BERT embeddings through concatenation and cross-attention. A key finding is that AWEs convey a distinct 'acoustic context' compared to lexical word embeddings"
  - [section 4.1] "While there is one word in common between the two sets of neighbors, acoustic neighbors often share a common vowel sound with the target word, while lexical neighbors tend to be more syntactically related"
  - [corpus] Evidence is based on IEMOCAP and ESD datasets; corpus-specific validation would strengthen this claim
- Break condition: If AWEs are constructed from non-acoustic features (e.g., lexical transcriptions) or if mean-pooling fails to capture consistent acoustic patterns across speakers

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Cross-attention fusion works better with AWEs than raw HuBERT representations
- Mechanism: Discretized AWEs align more naturally with BERT embeddings in cross-attention because both operate in a fixed-dimensional space with discrete-like properties
- Core assumption: Cross-attention can effectively model relatedness between acoustic and lexical features when the acoustic features have discrete-like characteristics
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The results highlight the potential of AWEs as a powerful feature for SER and suggest optimal strategies for leveraging self-supervised speech representations in downstream tasks"
  - [section 4.2.2] "the gap between them diminishes (only 0.04). This phenomenon can be attributed to discretized acoustic features (i.e., AWEs) being more easily aligned with word embeddings compared to continuous ones through cross-attention"
  - [corpus] Results shown on IEMOCAP and ESD; generalizability to other SER datasets not explicitly tested
- Break condition: If the cross-attention mechanism is poorly implemented or if the AWEs lose too much acoustic information during mean-pooling

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Early HuBERT layers (around layer 3) are optimal for AWE-based SER
- Mechanism: Early layers capture more fine-grained acoustic information while later layers encode more semantic content, making early-layer AWEs better suited for emotion discrimination
- Core assumption: Emotion recognition relies more on acoustic patterns than lexical semantics, especially when lexical content varies across samples
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Layer-wise analysis reveals that AWEs from early layers (around layer 3) are particularly effective for SER, especially when lexical content is less informative"
  - [section 4.2.3] "On the shallow layers, AWEs have significant advantages over raw HuBERT, and the optimal layer for using AWEs is around layer 3 instead of the middle layer"
  - [corpus] Analysis performed on IEMOCAP and ESD; assumption about lexical informativeness may not hold for all corpora
- Break condition: If emotion discrimination in a given corpus relies heavily on lexical content or if the acoustic patterns are too variable to be captured by early layers

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Self-supervised speech representation learning
  - Why needed here: Understanding how HuBERT and similar models learn from raw audio without labels is crucial for interpreting AWE behavior
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between HuBERT's masked prediction objective and Wav2Vec 2.0's contrastive loss?

- Concept: Acoustic Word Embeddings construction
  - Why needed here: The mean-pooling method for creating AWEs from variable-length speech segments is central to the paper's approach
  - Quick check question: How does mean-pooling preserve acoustic discriminability while losing sequential information?

- Concept: Cross-attention mechanisms
  - Why needed here: The paper uses cross-attention to fuse AWEs with BERT embeddings, requiring understanding of how attention between modalities works
  - Quick check question: In cross-attention, what determines whether the audio or text features serve as the query versus the key/value?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: HuBERT CNN encoder → HuBERT Transformer layers → Mean-pooling over word segments → AWEs → SER classifier (dense layers) → Optional BERT cross-attention fusion
- Critical path: Audio input → HuBERT representation → AWE construction → SER prediction
- Design tradeoffs: AWEs vs raw HuBERT (fixed vs variable length, acoustic vs semantic focus), mean-pooling vs learned pooling (simplicity vs potential information loss)
- Failure signatures: Poor SER performance on emotion-rich but semantically variable corpora, large performance gap between AWEs and raw HuBERT, instability in layer-wise accuracy analysis
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare SER performance using AWEs from different HuBERT layers (L0-L12) to verify layer 3 optimality
  2. Test cross-attention fusion with AWEs vs raw HuBERT on a new SER corpus to validate generalizability
  3. Evaluate learned pooling methods (e.g., attention-based) against mean-pooling for AWE construction to assess information retention

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do the performance characteristics of AWEs from different self-supervised models (e.g., HuBERT, wav2vec 2.0, XLSR-53) compare when applied to Speech Emotion Recognition?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper references Sanabria et al. [6] which compared AWEs from wav2vec 2.0, XLSR-53, and HuBERT, noting that HuBERT AWEs by mean-pooling rival the SOTA on English AWEs.
- Why unresolved: The paper only uses HuBERT for its experiments, so direct comparisons with other self-supervised models in the context of SER are not provided.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments using AWEs from different self-supervised models (e.g., wav2vec 2.0, XLSR-53) on the same SER task and datasets (IEMOCAP and ESD) to measure and compare their performance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the "acoustic context" captured by AWEs be further leveraged or enhanced to improve SER performance, especially in scenarios where lexical content is less informative?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies that AWEs convey a distinct "acoustic context" compared to lexical word embeddings and notes that on ESD, where sentences remain consistent for every emotion, AWEs significantly outperform raw HuBERT representations.
- Why unresolved: While the paper suggests the potential of AWEs' acoustic context, it does not explore methods to explicitly leverage or enhance this context for SER.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of techniques specifically designed to capture and utilize the acoustic context of AWEs in SER, particularly in datasets where lexical content is consistent across emotions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the optimal layer for AWE extraction vary across different speech tasks beyond SER, and what factors influence this variation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper conducts a layer-wise analysis of AWEs for SER and finds that AWEs from early layers (around layer 3) are particularly effective, which differs from the typical optimal layer for raw HuBERT representations.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses solely on SER, leaving the question of how AWE layer optimization might differ for other speech tasks unanswered.
- What evidence would resolve it: Layer-wise analysis of AWEs from HuBERT and other self-supervised models across a variety of speech tasks (e.g., speaker identification, ASR, keyword spotting) to determine if there is a consistent pattern in optimal layer selection or if it varies by task.

## Limitations
- Layer-wise optimality claim for AWEs (layer 3) may not generalize across different SER datasets or emotion labeling schemes
- Cross-attention fusion mechanism lacks detailed architectural specifications that could impact reproducibility
- Study focuses on HuBERT specifically, leaving open questions about whether findings extend to other self-supervised speech models

## Confidence
- High confidence: AWEs outperform raw HuBERT representations and Mel spectrograms on the tested corpora
- Medium confidence: Early HuBERT layers are optimal for AWE-based SER, particularly when lexical content is less informative
- Medium confidence: Cross-attention fusion works better with AWEs than with raw HuBERT representations

## Next Checks
1. Test the layer-wise optimality of AWEs (around layer 3) on an additional SER corpus with different emotion categories and recording conditions to assess generalizability
2. Compare the mean-pooling approach for AWE construction with attention-based pooling methods to evaluate potential information retention benefits
3. Validate the cross-attention fusion mechanism on a corpus where lexical content is deliberately minimized (e.g., using only non-speech vocalizations) to test the acoustic vs. lexical contribution separation
