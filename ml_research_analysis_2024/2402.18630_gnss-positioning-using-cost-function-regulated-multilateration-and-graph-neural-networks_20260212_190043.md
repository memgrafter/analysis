# GNSS Positioning using Cost Function Regulated Multilateration and Graph Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.18630
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18630
- Reference count: 6
- Key outcome: 40%-80% improvement in horizontal localization error using GNN-based error estimation and cost function regulation

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of GNSS positioning in urban environments where tall buildings cause non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signal errors. The authors propose a novel approach that replaces heuristic error estimation methods with a Graph Neural Network (GNN) that processes satellite measurements as a graph. They introduce a method to regulate the multilateration cost function using estimated errors, ensuring convergence to the true receiver location as error estimation accuracy improves. The approach also includes a measurement selection algorithm to filter unreliable signals. Evaluated on over 100k real-world GNSS epochs from multiple cities, their method achieves significant improvements over classical and deep learning baselines.

## Method Summary
The proposed method combines a Graph Neural Network for error estimation with cost function regulation for multilateration. The GNN processes raw GNSS measurements as a graph where edges connect satellites based on angular proximity, learning to estimate pseudo-range measurement errors. These error estimates are then used to regulate the weighted least squares cost function through null space computation of the geometry matrix. The method includes an adaptive measurement selection algorithm that filters out measurements with large predicted errors. The final localization is computed using weighted least squares optimization on the regulated measurements. The approach is designed to guarantee convergence to the true receiver location as error estimation accuracy increases.

## Key Results
- 40%-80% improvement in horizontal localization error compared to classical and deep learning baselines
- The method guarantees convergence to true receiver location as error estimation accuracy increases
- Measurement selection algorithm further improves localization in cases of suboptimal error estimation
- Performance validated on over 100k real-world GNSS epochs from multiple cities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The cost function regulation guarantees that the ground truth location becomes a local minimum when measurement error estimates are perfect. By deriving constraints that measurement errors and weights must satisfy (HTW e = 0), the method forces the true location to have zero residuals in the weighted cost function. This ensures optimization algorithms converge to the correct location if error estimates are accurate.

### Mechanism 2
The Graph Neural Network learns to propagate measurement information across spatially adjacent satellites, improving error estimation accuracy. By defining edges based on angular proximity between satellites, the GNN aggregates features from nearby satellites, allowing it to detect inconsistencies in pseudo-range measurements from the same sky region.

### Mechanism 3
The adaptive measurement selection algorithm improves localization by filtering out unreliable measurements with large predicted errors. The algorithm dynamically adjusts error bounds to ensure a minimum number of reliable measurements are selected, reducing the impact of outliers on the final localization.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Graph Neural Networks and their message-passing mechanism
  - **Why needed here**: The GNN processes spatial relationships between satellite measurements, which is central to the error estimation approach.
  - **Quick check question**: What is the difference between a GNN and a traditional MLP when processing sets of measurements?

- **Concept**: Weighted Least Squares (WLS) optimization and the geometry matrix
  - **Why needed here**: Understanding how the geometry matrix relates satellite positions to the cost function is essential for implementing cost function regulation.
  - **Quick check question**: How does the rank of the geometry matrix affect the solvability of the WLS problem?

- **Concept**: Null space computation and its role in optimization
  - **Why needed here**: The weight regulation variant relies on finding points in the null space of HTW to satisfy convergence constraints.
  - **Quick check question**: What does it mean geometrically when a vector is in the null space of a matrix?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Raw measurements -> Error Estimator (GNN) -> Measurement Selector -> Cost Function Regulator -> WLS Optimizer -> Location estimate

- **Critical path**: Raw measurements → Error Estimator → Measurement Selector → Cost Function Regulator → WLS Optimizer → Location estimate

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - GNN aggregation method: Simpler methods (GraphSAGE) work better than more complex ones (GAT, MP-NN) on small graphs
  - Cost function regulation variant: Weight regulation is more sensitive to error estimation inaccuracies than measurement regulation
  - Measurement selection threshold: Must balance between filtering unreliable measurements and maintaining sufficient redundancy

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Large localization errors with many LOS satellites: Likely indicates GNN error estimation problems
  - Degraded performance in open sky: May indicate over-reliance on measurement selection
  - Unstable results across seeds: Could indicate insufficient regularization or data augmentation

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Replace the GNN with a simple MLP and measure impact on error estimation accuracy
  2. Disable the measurement selection algorithm and evaluate performance degradation
  3. Compare weight regulation vs measurement regulation variants on a controlled dataset with known measurement errors

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How would the proposed method perform in real-time GNSS positioning scenarios where the "first fix" assumption may not hold?
The paper focuses on the "first fix" scenario and mentions evaluating performance on real-world data collected at 1-second resolution. It does not discuss or evaluate the method's performance in scenarios with temporal correlation between epochs or when previous measurements are available.

### Open Question 2
What is the impact of incorporating additional sensor data (e.g., IMU measurements) on the accuracy of the proposed GNSS positioning method?
The paper mentions that the error estimation accuracy could be improved by fusion of temporal information or additional sensory data such as acceleration from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), but does not include experiments or results demonstrating this effect.

### Open Question 3
How does the proposed method perform in scenarios with extreme NLOS conditions or when the number of available GNSS measurements is severely limited?
The paper mentions that the measurement selection algorithm is designed to adapt to epoch size, but does not discuss the method's performance in extreme scenarios with very few measurements or severe NLOS conditions.

## Limitations

- The convergence guarantees rely on the assumption that the null space of HTW exists and can be computed effectively, which may not hold when the geometry matrix is rank-deficient.
- The spatial correlation assumption underlying the GNN approach may not be validated on real data, potentially leading to overfitting to synthetic patterns.
- The measurement selection algorithm introduces additional hyperparameters whose sensitivity to performance is not extensively validated.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core mathematical framework for cost function regulation is well-established and the synthetic experiments demonstrating convergence are convincing.
- **Medium Confidence**: The GNN architecture and training procedure are clearly described, and the reported improvements on real data are substantial, though exact hyperparameter choices are not fully specified.
- **Low Confidence**: The generalization guarantees across different urban environments and robustness to varying satellite geometries are not thoroughly validated.

## Next Checks

1. **Geometry Matrix Analysis**: Analyze the rank distribution of the geometry matrix H across the real dataset and quantify how often it's close to rank-deficient. Measure the impact on localization accuracy when the null space computation fails.

2. **Error Correlation Validation**: Compute empirical correlations between pseudo-range errors of satellites that are close in the sky versus those that are far apart. This will validate whether the spatial aggregation assumption underlying the GNN approach is justified by the data.

3. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: Perform an ablation study on the measurement selection thresholds and GNN hyperparameters. Report localization accuracy across a range of parameter values to establish the method's robustness to hyperparameter choices.
