# Data Generation via Latent Factor Simulation for Fairness-aware Re-ranking

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.14078
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14078
- Reference count: 25
- Primary result: Introduces LAtent Factor Simulation (LAFS) for generating synthetic recommendation data to study fairness-aware re-ranking algorithms

## Executive Summary
This paper presents LAtent Factor Simulation (LAFS), a method for generating synthetic recommendation lists specifically designed for evaluating fairness-aware re-ranking algorithms. LAFS creates synthetic user-item interaction data by simulating latent factor matrices, allowing researchers to study fairness properties without relying on sensitive real-world data. The method generates user and item latent factors through a two-step process involving propensity distributions, then produces ratings and recommendation lists while incorporating controllable bias against protected groups.

## Method Summary
LAFS is a two-step synthetic data generation method that simulates latent factor matrices for recommendation systems. First, it generates propensity matrices from experimenter-specified distributions for users and items. Second, it generates latent factor values from normal distributions centered on these propensities. The method then computes ratings using standard matrix factorization techniques, applies bias penalties to items with protected features, and generates sorted recommendation lists. The approach allows controllable bias parameters and protected feature distributions, enabling researchers to test fairness algorithms under diverse conditions.

## Key Results
- LAFS generates synthetic recommendation lists with controllable bias against protected groups
- The method enables evaluation of fairness-aware re-ranking algorithms without sensitive real-world data
- LAFS provides a controlled environment for studying fairness properties across various protected feature distributions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LAFS enables fairness evaluation without sensitive data by generating synthetic latent factor matrices
- Mechanism: The method simulates user and item latent factors through propensity distributions, then generates ratings and recommendation lists while incorporating controllable bias against protected groups
- Core assumption: Latent factor matrices can be accurately simulated to produce realistic recommendation behaviors
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "creates synthetic user-item interaction data by simulating latent factor matrices"
  - [section] "we create synthetic data via first simulating the latent factor matrices that a matrix factorization model could produce"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no corpus papers directly address latent factor simulation for fairness
- Break condition: If the simulated latent factors fail to capture real-world user-item interaction patterns, the generated recommendations will not reflect authentic fairness concerns

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The two-step process creates realistic variance in latent factors
- Mechanism: First generates propensity values from experimenter-specified distributions, then generates latent factor values from normal distributions centered on these propensities
- Core assumption: Latent factors are independent and can be generated without full covariance matrix specification
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "First, we generate two matrices of propensities... Then, from the propensities we generate a latent factor value"
  - [section] "we do not assume binary associations between users and latent factors" for user factors
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus lacks papers on synthetic latent factor generation methodology
- Break condition: If real-world latent factors exhibit significant correlations not captured by the independence assumption, the synthetic data will misrepresent recommendation behaviors

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Controllable bias parameters allow testing fairness algorithms under diverse conditions
- Mechanism: Experimenters specify bias distributions that are applied as penalties to ratings for items with sensitive features
- Core assumption: Bias can be accurately modeled as additive penalties to latent factor-based ratings
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "To simulate bias against protected group items, we apply a randomly generated bias penalty... to the computed rating"
  - [abstract] "incorporating controllable bias against protected groups"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus papers focus on fairness in recommendations but not on bias simulation methodology
- Break condition: If real-world bias operates through mechanisms other than additive penalties to ratings, the simulation will not accurately reflect fairness challenges

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Matrix factorization in recommender systems
  - Why needed here: LAFS generates synthetic data by simulating the latent factor matrices that matrix factorization models would produce
  - Quick check question: What are the typical dimensions (number of latent factors) used in matrix factorization for recommender systems?

- Concept: Fairness-aware re-ranking algorithms
  - Why needed here: The synthetic data is specifically designed to evaluate post-processing fairness algorithms that re-rank recommendations
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between model-based fairness approaches and post-processing re-ranking approaches?

- Concept: Protected group identification and bias measurement
  - Why needed here: LAFS allows experimenters to control the distribution of protected features and apply bias penalties to study fairness impacts
  - Quick check question: How does LAFS distinguish between sensitive and non-sensitive latent factors in the simulation process?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Propensity generation system -> Latent factor generation -> Rating computation -> Bias application -> Sorting and normalization
- Critical path: Propensity generation → Latent factor generation → Rating computation → Bias application → Sorting and normalization
- Design tradeoffs: Independence assumption simplifies implementation but may miss real-world correlations; binary propensities for items simplify protected group identification but may oversimplify item characteristics
- Failure signatures: Generated recommendations show unrealistic sparsity patterns; synthetic data fails to reveal meaningful fairness differences between re-ranking algorithms; latent factors show no meaningful structure
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Generate recommendations with no bias (all bias penalties = 0) and verify that protected and non-protected items receive similar treatment
  2. Apply strong bias against protected items and verify that re-ranking algorithms can successfully restore fairness
  3. Test with varying proportions of protected items to assess how algorithm performance changes with protected group size

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How well does the synthetic data generated by LAFS predict real-world recommender system performance compared to actual user-item interaction data?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that there is a lack of established methodology for evaluating data set simulation in recommender systems and that it is difficult to assess whether findings relative to a synthetic data set will be predictive of performance on a real-world one.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the need for additional research to compare LAFS's simulated output with recommendations from real algorithms and to compare the synthetic latent factors with those derived from real-world data sets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies using LAFS-generated data against real-world datasets across various recommender system tasks and performance metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the correlation between sensitive features affect fairness outcomes in the generated data, and should the LAFS method account for these correlations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that in some data sets, there is correlation (and anti-correlation) between sensitive features, and it may be useful to allow experimenters to specify the co-variance matrix for these features in future releases.
- Why unresolved: The current LAFS implementation assumes independence between sensitive features, which may not reflect real-world scenarios where such correlations exist.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing how different correlation structures between sensitive features impact fairness metrics in the generated data.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the sparsity level of the generated data impact the effectiveness of fairness-aware re-ranking algorithms?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that industrial-grade datasets have sparsity orders of magnitude less than some existing synthetic data generation methods, suggesting that sparsity is an important factor in realistic data generation.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explicitly discuss how the sparsity of the generated data affects the performance of fairness-aware re-ranking algorithms.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies using LAFS-generated data with varying levels of sparsity to evaluate the performance of fairness-aware re-ranking algorithms.

## Limitations

- The independence assumption for latent factors may oversimplify real-world recommendation patterns
- The bias simulation mechanism may not capture all forms of real-world bias in recommendation systems
- The method requires careful parameter tuning to produce realistic and meaningful synthetic data

## Next Checks

1. **Realism Validation**: Compare statistical properties (rating distributions, user-item interaction patterns) of LAFS-generated data against real-world recommendation datasets to assess ecological validity.

2. **Bias Sensitivity Test**: Systematically vary the bias parameters and protected group distributions to confirm that LAFS produces expected changes in recommendation fairness metrics.

3. **Cross-Algorithm Comparison**: Use LAFS to generate datasets with varying fairness properties and evaluate whether different fairness-aware re-ranking algorithms show appropriate performance differences under different bias conditions.
