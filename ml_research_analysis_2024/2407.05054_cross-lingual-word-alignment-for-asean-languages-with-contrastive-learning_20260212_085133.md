# Cross-Lingual Word Alignment for ASEAN Languages with Contrastive Learning

## Quick Facts

- The authors present a cross-lingual word alignment approach for low-resource ASEAN languages (Lao, Vietnamese, Thai, and Indonesian) that incorporates contrastive learning into a BiLSTM-based encoder-decoder framework

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a cross-lingual word alignment method for low-resource ASEAN languages that integrates contrastive learning into a BiLSTM-based encoder-decoder framework. The approach addresses limitations of previous methods that only consider similarity between word embeddings without explicitly modeling differences. By using a multi-view negative sampling strategy and contrastive loss, the model learns more discriminative cross-lingual representations. Experiments on five bilingual alignment datasets show consistent improvements over the base model, achieving state-of-the-art results with an average gain of 0.75 P@1.

## Method Summary
The approach builds upon a BiLSTM-based encoder-decoder model with attention mechanisms, where a shared bidirectional LSTM encoder generates contextual word embeddings, and language-specific attention mechanisms and decoders handle word order differences. The key innovation is the incorporation of a contrastive learning objective that explicitly models relationships between word pairs in the cross-lingual embedding space. The model uses both inter-view (translations from different language pairs) and intra-view (non-corresponding translations in the same batch) negative sampling strategies to create diverse negative examples. Training uses Adam optimizer with learning rate 2e-5, batch size 16, and temperature hyperparameter τ=0.5, with subword segmentation via SentencePiece (except Chinese, which uses character-level).

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art word alignment accuracy on all five tested datasets
- Average improvement of 0.75 P@1 over the base BiLSTM model
- Inter+intra-view negative sampling strategy proves more effective than inter-view alone
- Contrastive learning provides greater improvements in truly low-resource settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Contrastive learning improves word alignment by explicitly modeling the differences between word embeddings in a shared cross-lingual space.
- Mechanism: The model treats translation pairs as positive examples and non-translation pairs as negative examples. By optimizing a contrastive loss (InfoNCE), it pulls positive pairs closer together and pushes negative pairs apart in the embedding space, creating more discriminative representations.
- Core assumption: Low-resource language pairs benefit more from explicit modeling of word differences because they lack large parallel corpora that would otherwise implicitly capture these distinctions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "their model only considers the similarity of word embedding spaces and does not explicitly model the differences between word embeddings"
  - [section] "we introduce a contrastive loss that explicitly models the relationships between word pairs in the cross-lingual embedding space"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The multi-view negative sampling strategy provides more diverse negative examples, improving contrastive learning effectiveness.
- Mechanism: The approach uses both intra-view (non-corresponding translations in the same batch) and inter-view (translations from different language pairs) negative sampling. This creates a richer set of negative examples that helps the model learn finer-grained distinctions between word meanings.
- Core assumption: Greater diversity in negative samples leads to better discrimination between similar and dissimilar word pairs, especially for low-resource languages.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Negative Sampling for Translation and Reconstruction: Please note that, negative sampling strategy for translation differs from that used for reconstruction... Inter-view + Intra-view"
  - [section] "inter+intra-view strategy proves to be more effective, which is likely because the greater diversity of negative samples enables the model to better capture fine-grained differences"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The BiLSTM encoder-decoder architecture with attention provides a strong foundation for cross-lingual word alignment in low-resource settings.
- Mechanism: The shared bidirectional LSTM encoder generates contextual word embeddings, while language-specific attention mechanisms and decoders handle word order differences. This architecture effectively leverages parallel sentences and subword information without requiring large-scale pretraining.
- Core assumption: Traditional encoder-decoder architectures can outperform pre-trained language models in low-resource scenarios where pretraining data is unavailable.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Recent study proposes a BiLSTM-based encoder-decoder model that outperforms pre-trained language models in low-resource settings"
  - [section] "Building upon the success of Wada et al. [14] and inspired by the potential of contrastive learning, we propose incorporating a contrastive learning objective into the BiLSTM-based encoder-decoder model"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cross-lingual word embeddings
  - Why needed here: The entire approach relies on mapping words from different languages into a shared semantic space where translations are close together
  - Quick check question: How does the model ensure that semantically similar words across languages end up near each other in the embedding space?

- Concept: Contrastive learning and InfoNCE loss
  - Why needed here: This is the core mechanism that explicitly models differences between word embeddings by contrasting positive and negative pairs
  - Quick check question: What role does the temperature hyperparameter τ play in the contrastive loss function?

- Concept: Negative sampling strategies
  - Why needed here: The effectiveness of contrastive learning depends heavily on the quality and diversity of negative examples
  - Quick check question: Why might using both intra-view and inter-view negative samples be more effective than using only one type?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Shared bidirectional LSTM encoder -> Language-specific attention mechanisms -> Language-specific unidirectional LSTM decoders -> Contrastive loss layer with multi-view negative sampling -> Subword embedding integration

- Critical path: Encoder → Attention → Decoder → Contrastive Loss
  - The encoder generates contextual embeddings, attention focuses on relevant source words, decoders predict target words, and contrastive loss refines the embeddings

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using separate decoders for each language/direction handles word order differences but increases model complexity
  - Average pooling vs max pooling for aggregation: average pooling slightly outperforms max pooling but may lose some discriminative information
  - Inter-view vs intra-view negative sampling: inter-view provides more diverse negatives but may introduce noise

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor alignment accuracy on specific language pairs may indicate insufficient negative sample diversity
  - High variance in results across runs suggests sensitivity to random initialization or batch composition
  - Degraded performance on languages with larger datasets suggests the contrastive learning benefit is most pronounced in truly low-resource settings

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline test: Run the original BiLSTM encoder-decoder model without contrastive learning on one language pair to establish performance baseline
  2. Contrastive learning ablation: Add contrastive learning with only intra-view negative sampling to measure impact of negative sampling strategy
  3. Pooling comparison: Test average pooling vs max pooling for aggregation to determine optimal configuration for your specific dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the contrastive learning approach scale to larger low-resource datasets compared to smaller ones, and what are the diminishing returns?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that contrastive learning provides greater improvements in low-resource settings and shows varying performance gains across datasets of different sizes (e.g., Th-Zh has a larger dataset but shows less improvement).
- Why unresolved: The paper does not conduct experiments with varying dataset sizes or analyze the relationship between dataset size and contrastive learning benefits.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing the model on datasets with different sizes for the same language pair, or analyzing the point at which additional contrastive learning provides minimal gains.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do different negative sampling strategies (inter-view vs. inter+intra-view) affect model performance when varying the batch size or training data diversity?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares inter-view and inter+intra-view negative sampling strategies and finds inter+intra-view more effective, but does not explore how batch size or data diversity affects this outcome.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not vary batch sizes or examine datasets with different levels of diversity to understand how negative sampling effectiveness changes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments varying batch sizes and data diversity while measuring the impact on different negative sampling strategies.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of different temperature values (τ) in the contrastive loss function on alignment accuracy for different language pairs?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses a fixed temperature value of 0.5 but does not explore how different values affect performance across language pairs.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not conduct sensitivity analysis on the temperature hyperparameter across different language pairs or data conditions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing multiple temperature values for each language pair and analyzing the relationship between optimal temperature and language characteristics.

## Limitations

- Limited evaluation to only five ASEAN language pairs with relatively small parallel corpora
- Model assumes similar grammatical structures across language pairs, which may not hold for all ASEAN language combinations
- Performance improvements from contrastive learning may not generalize to all low-resource scenarios or larger datasets

## Confidence

- High confidence: The overall framework combining BiLSTM encoder-decoder with contrastive learning is sound and follows established NLP practices
- Medium confidence: The specific improvements from contrastive learning (0.75 P@1 average gain) are well-documented but may not generalize to all low-resource scenarios
- Low confidence: Claims about superiority over pre-trained language models in low-resource settings require validation on more diverse language pairs and dataset sizes

## Next Checks

1. Test the model on a held-out validation set from a different domain than the training data to assess generalization capabilities
2. Perform statistical significance testing (e.g., paired t-tests) on the P@1 improvements across multiple random seeds to verify reported gains are not due to chance
3. Evaluate the model on language pairs with more divergent grammatical structures to test the attention mechanism's robustness to structural differences
