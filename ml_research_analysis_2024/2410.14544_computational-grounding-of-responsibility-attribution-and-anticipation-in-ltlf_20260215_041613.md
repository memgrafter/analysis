# Computational Grounding of Responsibility Attribution and Anticipation in LTLf

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2410.14544
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14544
- **Reference count**: 17
- **Primary result**: Computational framework for analyzing strategic responsibility in reactive synthesis using LTLf, establishing connections with game-theoretic notions and providing complexity characterizations.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a computational framework for analyzing strategic responsibility in reactive synthesis using Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces (LTLf). The authors establish connections between different variants of responsibility attribution and anticipation with classical notions from game theory, such as winning, dominant, and best-effort strategies. They provide complexity characterizations and sound, complete, and optimal algorithms for attributing and anticipating responsibility, including passive, inexcusable passive, and active responsibility. The framework distinguishes between responsibility attribution against environment strategies and on histories, addressing the challenge of counterfactual reasoning when the environment's strategy is not fully observable.

## Method Summary
The paper develops a computational framework for responsibility attribution and anticipation in LTLf reactive synthesis by reducing responsibility questions to strategy checking problems. The method establishes that passive responsibility corresponds to non-dominance of the avoidance strategy, inexcusable passive responsibility corresponds to non-best-effort of the avoidance strategy, and active responsibility corresponds to winning the goal while having a weak strategy for its negation. The framework provides algorithms for checking these properties against environment strategies or histories, where histories are converted to environment specifications that constrain consistent strategies.

## Key Results
- Responsibility attribution and anticipation problems can be reduced to strategy checking problems in LTLf synthesis
- The framework distinguishes between responsibility attribution against environment strategies versus on histories, with different computational complexities
- Inexcusable passive responsibility is the most useful notion for strategy evaluation because best-effort strategies always exist and prevent this form of responsibility
- Complexity characterizations are provided for all responsibility notions, showing that some are PSPACE-complete while others are in P

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Responsibility attribution and anticipation can be reduced to strategy checking problems in LTLf synthesis.
- Mechanism: The paper establishes that passive responsibility corresponds to non-dominance of the avoidance strategy, inexcusable passive responsibility corresponds to non-best-effort of the avoidance strategy, and active responsibility corresponds to winning the goal while having a weak strategy for its negation.
- Core assumption: LTLf strategy synthesis problems (winning, dominant, best-effort) are decidable and have well-characterized complexity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We show a connection with notions in reactive synthesis, including synthesis of winning, dominant, and best-effort strategies."
  - [section]: "By Theorem 1 and the relation between best-effort, dominant, and winning strategies, an agent using a best-effort strategy σag for some goal or value ω will not anticipate inexcusable passive responsibility for ¬ω."
- Break condition: If the reduction from responsibility to strategy checking introduces computational overhead that exceeds the complexity of the original strategy problems, or if the strategy problems become undecidable in extended settings.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The distinction between responsibility attribution against environment strategies versus on histories is computationally meaningful.
- Mechanism: When the environment strategy is known, responsibility can be checked directly against that strategy. When only a history is known, the paper constructs an LTLf environment specification Eh that captures all strategies consistent with that history, enabling the same checking algorithms to be applied.
- Core assumption: Environment strategies can be captured by LTLf environment specifications, and the product construction preserves the computational complexity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "We denote by Eh the set of environment strategies that enforce E such that h is consistent with σag and σenv."
  - [section]: "It is easy to see that h is consistent with σenv iff σenv ∈ ΣEh."
- Break condition: If the environment specification Eh becomes exponentially larger than the history h, or if multiple histories lead to incomparable specifications that cannot be efficiently combined.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Inexcusable passive responsibility is the most useful notion for strategy evaluation because best-effort strategies always exist and prevent this form of responsibility.
- Mechanism: Since best-effort strategies always exist and an agent using a best-effort strategy for goal ω will not anticipate inexcusable passive responsibility for ¬ω, this provides a practical criterion for strategy selection that balances ambition with responsibility.
- Core assumption: Best-effort synthesis is computationally feasible and provides meaningful guarantees about responsibility.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Unlike winning and dominant strategies, best-effort strategies always exist (Aminof, De Giacomo, and Rubin 2021)."
  - [section]: "For this reason, and because best-effort strategies always exist, we argue that inexcusable passive responsibility is the most useful notion of causal responsibility."
- Break condition: If best-effort synthesis becomes computationally intractable for realistic specifications, or if the notion of "best-effort" does not align with practical notions of reasonable behavior.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces (LTLf)
  - Why needed here: The entire framework for responsibility attribution and anticipation is built on LTLf specifications, which allow expressing temporal properties over finite execution traces.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between LTLf and standard LTL in terms of trace interpretation?

- Concept: Reactive synthesis under environment specifications
  - Why needed here: Responsibility notions are defined relative to whether an agent can achieve goals despite environmental choices, which is exactly what reactive synthesis solves.
  - Quick check question: How does an environment specification constrain the set of valid environment strategies?

- Concept: Strategy dominance and best-effort concepts
  - Why needed here: These game-theoretic notions provide the computational grounding for inexcusable passive responsibility and passive responsibility respectively.
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between winning, dominant, and best-effort strategies?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - LTLf formula parser and translator to automata (NFA/DFA)
  - DFA game solver for computing winning and weakly winning regions
  - Strategy representation as terminating transducers
  - Responsibility checking algorithms that reduce to strategy properties
  - Environment specification constructor for history-based constraints

- Critical path:
  1. Parse LTLf formulas ω and E
  2. Convert to automata (NFA for formulas, DFA for specifications)
  3. For responsibility checking, construct product automata with strategy DFA
  4. Apply game-solving or language emptiness checks
  5. Return responsibility status based on algorithm results

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using DFA games enables polynomial-time solving but requires doubly-exponential translation from LTLf
  - Product construction enables modular checking but can lead to state explosion
  - History-based specifications Eh are polynomial in history length but may lose information about environmental rationality

- Failure signatures:
  - Non-emptiness results from product automata indicate responsibility attribution
  - Empty language results indicate absence of responsibility
  - Unexpected complexity in Eh construction may indicate pathological histories
  - Game-solving failures may indicate incorrect specification encoding

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify that CHECK WIN correctly identifies winning strategies by testing against known winning and non-winning cases
  2. Test CHECK DOM on simple dominance scenarios with two strategies and known environment strategies
  3. Validate CHECK BE on examples where best-effort strategies are known to exist or not exist
  4. Test responsibility attribution on histories by constructing Eh and verifying against known consistent strategies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the precise complexity of passive responsibility attribution against environment strategies when environment strategies are represented as finite-state transducers?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper states "If environment strategies can be represented as finite-state transducers, we can adopt the tree-automata techniques... to computationally characterize these notions. These techniques establish decidability of responsibility attribution against environment strategies, but not tight complexity bounds."
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies that finite-state transducers can represent environment strategies for this analysis, but does not provide complexity bounds for this representation.
- What evidence would resolve it: A complete complexity analysis showing whether this problem is in P, NP, PSPACE, or another complexity class.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the computational complexity of responsibility anticipation change when moving from a single-agent to a multi-agent setting where each agent's environment includes other agents?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "If we want to extend it to a multi-agent setting, each agent will have a different environment formed by the environment itself and the agent's peers acting in it. We plan to study this in the future."
- Why unresolved: The paper explicitly states this as future work and does not provide complexity analysis for the multi-agent case.
- What evidence would resolve it: A complexity analysis showing how responsibility anticipation scales with the number of agents and their interdependencies.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the framework be extended to handle probabilistic environment strategies while maintaining tractable complexity?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The current framework assumes deterministic environment strategies, but does not explore probabilistic extensions which are common in real-world applications.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on deterministic strategies and does not address probabilistic environments, which would require different synthesis techniques.
- What evidence would resolve it: An extension of the algorithms to handle probabilistic strategies with demonstrated complexity bounds and correctness proofs.

## Limitations

- The framework assumes environment strategies can be accurately captured by LTLf specifications, but real-world environments may exhibit more complex behaviors
- The doubly-exponential translation from LTLf to DFAs for game-solving may become prohibitive for specifications with many temporal operators
- The construction of environment specifications from histories (Eh) may lose information about environmental rationality, potentially leading to conservative responsibility assessments

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The reduction from responsibility notions to strategy checking problems is well-founded and the complexity characterizations appear sound based on the established connections with LTLf synthesis
- **Medium confidence**: The practical utility of inexcusable passive responsibility as the primary evaluation criterion, while theoretically justified, requires empirical validation in real-world domains
- **Medium confidence**: The history-based responsibility attribution mechanism works correctly for simple cases, but may exhibit unexpected behavior with complex or pathological histories

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical scalability test**: Evaluate the framework on progressively larger LTLf specifications to empirically verify the claimed complexity bounds and identify practical limits
2. **Cross-notation comparison**: Implement the same responsibility framework using PPLTL+ or another extended temporal logic to test whether the core insights generalize beyond LTLf
3. **History sensitivity analysis**: Systematically test the Eh construction with various history patterns to identify cases where information loss leads to incorrect responsibility assessments
