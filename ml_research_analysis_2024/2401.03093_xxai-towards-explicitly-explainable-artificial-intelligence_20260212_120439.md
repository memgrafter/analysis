# XXAI: Towards eXplicitly eXplainable Artificial Intelligence

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.03093
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03093
- Reference count: 8
- Authors: V. L. Kalmykov; L. V. Kalmykov
- Primary result: Proposes using deterministic logical cellular automata derived from domain general theories to create transparent "white box" AI

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical "black box" problem in modern AI by proposing a novel approach called eXplicitly eXplainable AI (XXAI). The authors argue that current AI systems, particularly those based on sub-symbolic neural networks, lack transparency in their decision-making processes, which is unacceptable for sensitive industries like medicine, law, and transportation. Their solution involves using deterministic logical cellular automata whose rules are derived from the first principles of general theories in relevant domains, creating a fully transparent "white box" AI system that can ensure the trustworthiness of automated decisions.

The proposed XXAI framework aims to overcome four major barriers to widespread use of symbolic AI: operational opacity of mathematical models, semantic opacity of natural language terms, lack of unified ontology, and combinatorial explosion in search capabilities. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through verification of several ecological hypotheses and suggest that XXAI can automatically verify the reliability, security, and ethics of sub-symbolic neural network solutions in both final and training phases.

## Method Summary
The XXAI method involves developing general theories for relevant domains that serve as knowledge bases, then creating deterministic logical cellular automata based on the axioms of these general theories. The cellular automata implement parallel multi-level logical inference at all levels of organization, from local interactions to the system as a whole. This approach fuses local causal inferences into a single global decision through direct cause-and-effect aggregation, eliminating the need for indirect interpretations and overcoming combinatorial explosion problems.

## Key Results
- Proposes XXAI as a solution to the "black box" problem in modern AI
- Demonstrates effectiveness through verification of ecological hypotheses
- Claims ability to automatically verify reliability, security, and ethics of sub-symbolic neural network solutions
- Overcomes four barriers to symbolic AI: operational opacity, semantic opacity, lack of unified ontology, and combinatorial explosion

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: XXAI achieves operational transparency by fusing local causal inferences into a single global decision through deterministic logical cellular automata.
- Mechanism: Cellular automata implement parallel multi-level logical inference at all levels of organization, from local interactions of the element base to the system as a whole. This direct aggregation of local decisions into a global decision eliminates the need for indirect interpretations.
- Core assumption: Local rules derived from first principles of the general theory of the relevant domain can be directly combined into a coherent global decision without loss of transparency.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "A cellular automaton implements parallel multi-level logical inference at all levels of organization - from local interactions of the element base to the system as a whole."
  - [section 3.1] "The transparency of such models is ensured by the ability to control the states and relationships of basic elements within the modeled system through a local cellular automaton neighborhood."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct corpus evidence for this specific mechanism.
- Break condition: If local rules derived from domain theory cannot be properly combined into a coherent global decision, or if the cellular automaton neighborhood cannot adequately represent all relevant local interactions.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: XXAI overcomes semantic opacity by using explicit concepts at all levels of organization through axioms of the general theory of the relevant domain.
- Mechanism: The general theory of the domain plays the role of a knowledge base for deriving the inferences of the cellular automata, ensuring that terms have strictly defined meanings consistent with each other at all levels of the model.
- Core assumption: A well-defined general theory of the domain can provide explicit concepts that are consistent across all levels of organization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "In this case, the general theory of the domain plays the role of a knowledge base for deriving the inferences of the cellular automata."
  - [section 3.2] "The semantic explicitness of terms can be achieved only within the framework of the general theory of the relevant subject area."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct corpus evidence for this specific mechanism.
- Break condition: If the general theory of the domain cannot provide sufficiently explicit and consistent concepts, or if the axioms cannot be properly translated into cellular automaton rules.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: XXAI eliminates the combinatorial explosion problem through direct cause-and-effect cellular automata aggregation of local solutions into a single global solution.
- Mechanism: Local cellular automaton rules based on first principles of the general theory of the subject area directly aggregate local solutions into a global solution, avoiding the need for complete enumeration of possible options.
- Core assumption: Direct cause-and-effect rules can be derived from the general theory that allow local solutions to be aggregated without requiring exhaustive search.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The insurmountable combinatorial explosion in the search for options is eliminated by direct cause-and-effect cellular automata aggregation of local solutions into a single global solution."
  - [section 3.4] "To overcome the problems of complete enumeration of the space of possible solutions, we use the direct derivation of the optimal solution, starting from the local rules for the optimal behavior of micro-objects of the simulated system."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct corpus evidence for this specific mechanism.
- Break condition: If the direct aggregation of local solutions cannot find optimal global solutions, or if the local rules cannot be properly derived from the general theory.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cellular Automata
  - Why needed here: XXAI is fundamentally based on deterministic logical cellular automata whose rules are derived from first principles of the general theory of the relevant domain.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how a cellular automaton differs from a traditional mathematical model in terms of transparency and local-global relationships?

- Concept: General Theory of the Domain
  - Why needed here: The general theory of the domain provides the knowledge base for deriving the inferences of the cellular automata, ensuring semantic transparency and consistency.
  - Quick check question: What are the key characteristics that a general theory must have to serve as an effective knowledge base for XXAI?

- Concept: First Principles Derivation
  - Why needed here: XXAI rules are derived from the first principles of the general theory, which is crucial for ensuring that the cellular automaton implements correct and transparent inferences.
  - Quick check question: How would you approach deriving local cellular automaton rules from the axioms of a general theory?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: General Theory of Domain -> First Principles Extraction Engine -> Cellular Automaton Rule Generator -> Cellular Automaton Execution Engine -> Global Decision Aggregator -> Transparency Verification Module

- Critical path: General Theory → First Principles → Cellular Automaton Rules → Local Execution → Global Aggregation → Transparent Decision

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Expressiveness vs. Efficiency: More complex general theories may provide better transparency but require more computational resources.
  - Granularity vs. Performance: Finer-grained cellular automaton rules may provide better transparency but increase computational overhead.
  - Domain Specificity vs. Generality: More domain-specific theories may provide better performance but reduce the applicability of XXAI.

- Failure signatures:
  - Local rules cannot be properly combined into global decisions (combinatorial explosion returns)
  - Semantic inconsistencies appear across different levels of organization
  - General theory axioms cannot be translated into executable cellular automaton rules
  - Cellular automaton neighborhood cannot adequately represent relevant local interactions

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple cellular automaton based on a basic general theory (e.g., predator-prey ecosystem) and verify transparency of local-global decision making
  2. Test semantic consistency by implementing the same domain theory at multiple organizational levels and checking for contradictions
  3. Benchmark performance against traditional black-box approaches on a well-defined problem domain to measure transparency gains vs. efficiency costs

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the computational limitations of the XXAI framework, and how can they be addressed to enable its application to large-scale, complex systems?
