# Anonymising Elderly and Pathological Speech: Voice Conversion Using DDSP and Query-by-Example

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.15500
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15500
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: DDSP-QbE outperforms state-of-the-art voice conversion methods in preserving prosody and domain characteristics of elderly and pathological speech while maintaining speaker anonymity.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of speech anonymisation for elderly and pathological speech while preserving clinically relevant prosody and domain characteristics crucial for remote health monitoring. The proposed DDSP-QbE method combines differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP) with query-by-example (QbE) to disentangle linguistic, prosodic, and domain representations. Novel loss functions based on jitter and shimmer metrics are introduced to preserve domain-specific voice qualities. The method demonstrates superior performance in intelligibility, prosody preservation, and domain retention compared to existing approaches, validated through both objective metrics and expert subjective evaluation on twelve clinically pertinent domain attributes.

## Method Summary
The DDSP-QbE method uses WavLM representations to extract phonetic features from source speech, which are then mapped to target speaker representations using a query-by-example matching scheme. A fusion network combines these mapped features with prosodic information to generate DDSP synthesis parameters. The system is trained with novel losses including jitter and shimmer for domain preservation, prosody leakage loss using emotional utterances, and multi-resolution spectral losses. The approach avoids parallel data requirements while maintaining the ability to preserve clinically relevant speech characteristics through explicit acoustic property monitoring.

## Key Results
- DDSP-QbE outperforms existing voice conversion methods in intelligibility, prosody preservation, and domain retention across elderly and pathological speech datasets
- Expert analysis validates preservation of twelve clinically relevant domain attributes in converted speech
- The method maintains speaker anonymity while preserving unique speech patterns essential for remote health monitoring
- Objective evaluations show significant improvements in jitter, shimmer, and pitch correlation coefficient compared to baseline approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The Phone Mapper using WavLM representations preserves linguistic content while sounding like the target speaker
- Mechanism: QbE scheme matches source-phone representations to target-phone representations in WavLM-Large's latent space
- Core assumption: WavLM's 6th layer representations maintain phonetic distinctiveness while being speaker-agnostic
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions disentangling linguistic representations; similar-sounding phones are closer in latent phone space
- Break condition: If latent space geometry changes with different WavLM versions or phone discrimination degrades

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Prosody-aware loss using emotional utterances forces phonetic encoder to disentangle prosodic and linguistic features
- Mechanism: Encoder must produce similar representations for same linguistic content with different emotions
- Core assumption: Emotional utterances with identical linguistic content will have different prosodic features
- Evidence anchors: Section describes requiring comparable representations for same content with different emotions
- Break condition: If emotional speech dataset lacks prosodic diversity or encoder becomes too sensitive to emotion-specific features

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Domain-aware losses (jitter and shimmer) preserve clinically relevant voice disorder characteristics
- Mechanism: Explicitly minimizing jitter and shimmer differences between source and converted speech
- Core assumption: Jitter and shimmer are sufficient metrics for capturing domain-specific voice characteristics
- Evidence anchors: Section mentions jitter and shimmer as clinically acclaimed indicators for voice disorders
- Break condition: If jitter/shimmer fail to capture important domain characteristics like breathiness

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Differentiable Digital Signal Processing (DDSP)
  - Why needed here: Allows incorporation of domain knowledge about speech production while maintaining differentiability for end-to-end training
  - Quick check question: How does the subtractive harmonic oscillator model decompose speech into harmonic and noise components?

- Concept: Self-supervised speech representations
  - Why needed here: WavLM representations provide phonetic features without requiring parallel corpora or explicit phonetic labels
  - Quick check question: What properties of WavLM's latent space make it suitable for phone discrimination tasks?

- Concept: Query-by-Example matching
  - Why needed here: Enables phonetic conversion without parallel data by matching source representations to target speaker representations
  - Quick check question: How does the weighted average of top-M candidates reduce the impact of outliers in the matching process?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Source speech → WavLM features → Phone Mapper → QbE matching → Fusion network → DDSP parameters → Converted speech
- Critical path: Source speech → WavLM features → Phone Mapper → QbE matching → Fusion network → DDSP parameters → Converted speech
- Design tradeoffs:
  - QbE vs learned phonetic conversion: QbE avoids training complexity but requires target speaker data for feature pool creation
  - DDSP vs direct waveform generation: DDSP provides better interpretability and inductive bias but may limit expressiveness
  - Hand-crafted vs learned prosody features: Hand-crafted features provide interpretability but may miss nuanced prosodic patterns
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor domain preservation: Check jitter/shimmer loss values and acoustic analysis
  - Quality degradation: Examine spectral loss and HiFiGAN vocoder performance
  - Speaker identity leakage: Analyze speaker verification EER scores
  - Prosody loss: Check PCC scores and emotional speech loss values
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation study removing the prosody leakage loss to quantify its impact on prosody preservation
  2. Test with different values of M in the QbE matching to find optimal trade-off between accuracy and computational cost
  3. Evaluate performance with different WavLM layers (6th vs 12th) for phonetic feature extraction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the DDSP-QbE method perform on speech anonymisation for other types of pathological speech not included in the current evaluation, such as dysarthria or spasmodic dysphonia?
- Basis in paper: The paper focuses on elderly and stuttering speech but mentions the goal to adapt the approach to additional speech disorders
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates on elderly (including dementia) and stuttering speech datasets, leaving performance on other pathologies unexplored
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing DDSP-QbE on dysarthric and spasmodic dysphonia datasets with objective and subjective evaluations similar to those conducted for elderly and stuttering speech

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of using different numbers of candidates (M) in the query-by-example phonetic mapping on the quality and domain preservation of the converted speech?
- Basis in paper: The paper states "DDSP-QbE generate conversions faster than real-time, considering M=4 candidates" but does not explore the effect of varying M
- Why unresolved: The paper fixes M=4 for efficiency but does not analyze how different values of M affect performance metrics or subjective evaluations
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with different values of M (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 6) and comparing objective metrics and subjective assessments across these configurations

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the proposed jitter and shimmer loss functions be further optimized or replaced with more advanced acoustic metrics to improve domain preservation for breathiness and block characteristics in pathological speech?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions difficulties in preserving breathiness and block characteristics and suggests incorporating metrics like CPP and ABI
- Why unresolved: While the paper introduces jitter and shimmer losses, it acknowledges limitations in preserving certain domain characteristics
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing and evaluating alternative or additional loss functions based on CPP, ABI, or other clinically relevant acoustic measures

## Limitations
- The effectiveness of jitter and shimmer as sole domain preservation metrics may not capture the full complexity of pathological speech characteristics
- The assumption that emotional utterances provide sufficient prosodic variation for effective prosody disentanglement needs further empirical support
- Reliance on WavLM's 6th layer representations for phonetic discrimination lacks direct validation in the literature

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Overall methodology of combining DDSP with QbE for voice conversion; use of WavLM for self-supervised speech representation
- **Medium Confidence**: Novel loss functions for domain preservation (jitter/shimmer) and prosody disentanglement show promise but require more extensive validation
- **Low Confidence**: Assumption that emotional utterances provide sufficient prosodic variation for effective prosody disentanglement

## Next Checks

1. **Layer Sensitivity Analysis**: Evaluate DDSP-QbE performance using different WavLM layers (6th, 12th, 24th) to quantify the impact of latent space selection on phonetic matching accuracy and downstream conversion quality

2. **Domain Metric Expansion**: Supplement jitter and shimmer losses with additional clinically relevant metrics (e.g., HNR, CPP, harmonic-to-noise ratio) to assess whether current losses capture the full spectrum of domain characteristics

3. **Cross-Population Generalization**: Test the model on speech samples from populations not represented in the training data (e.g., different age groups, speech disorders) to evaluate robustness and identify potential domain shift issues
