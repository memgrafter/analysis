# NativQA: Multilingual Culturally-Aligned Natural Query for LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.09823
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09823
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Introduces NativQA, a semi-automatic framework to create culturally aligned multilingual QA datasets, showing improved LLM performance after fine-tuning, especially for low-resource languages.

## Executive Summary
NativQA is a scalable, language-independent framework designed to create culturally and regionally aligned question-answering datasets for evaluating and fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). The framework addresses the lack of region-specific, native-language QA datasets by using a semi-automatic, human-machine collaborative approach to collect and validate QA pairs from native speakers across nine regions in seven languages, ranging from high to extremely low resource. The resulting MultiNativQA dataset contains approximately 64k manually annotated QA pairs across 18 topics, demonstrating improved LLM performance, especially for low-resource and dialect-rich languages, after fine-tuning.

## Method Summary
The NativQA framework collects and validates QA pairs through a semi-automatic, human-machine collaborative approach. It starts with seed queries from native speakers, expands them using LLM synthesis, and iteratively refines them via search engine "People also ask" features to capture natural, region-specific queries. QA pairs are then filtered by domain reliability and manually validated for accuracy and cultural relevance. The final dataset, MultiNativQA, is used to fine-tune open-source LLMs like Llama-3.1, improving performance on culturally aligned tasks, especially for low-resource and dialect-rich languages.

## Key Results
- MultiNativQA dataset contains ~64k manually annotated QA pairs across 18 topics in 7 languages.
- Closed models (GPT-4o, Gemini) outperform open models (Llama-3.1) on culturally aligned tasks.
- Fine-tuning Llama-3.1 with MultiNativQA significantly improves performance for low-resource and dialect-rich languages.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Semi-automatic QA collection with search engine integration captures real user queries.
- Mechanism: Seed queries are expanded via LLM synthesis and iteratively refined using "People also ask" features from search engines, enriching the dataset with natural, location-specific queries.
- Core assumption: Search engines reflect authentic, region-based information needs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "NativQA uses a semi-automatic, human-machine collaborative approach to collect and validate QA pairs from native speakers across nine regions in seven languages"
  - [section 3.2] "Leveraging a search engine, we automatically collect QA pairs that potentially cover queries ϱ0... capitalizes on 'People also ask' feature"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus only provides related work but no direct validation of search engine-based collection fidelity.
- Break condition: If search engine query suggestions no longer yield novel or relevant QA pairs after a few iterations.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Domain reliability filtering improves dataset trustworthiness.
- Mechanism: Domains are manually classified for credibility, and only QA pairs from "very reliable" domains are retained, reducing noise from unreliable sources.
- Core assumption: Domain credibility correlates with QA pair accuracy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2.1] "Annotators were tasked to review each web domain to determine its credibility and assign one of the following four reliability labels"
  - [section 3.3] "We filtered out the QA pairs to retain answers only from annotated reliable sources"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus mentions related QA datasets but not reliability-focused curation.
- Break condition: If reliable domains become too sparse, limiting dataset size disproportionately.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Fine-tuning with culturally aligned data improves performance for low-resource and dialect-rich languages.
- Mechanism: MultiNativQA train split is used to fine-tune Llama-3.1, resulting in improved BLEU and F1 scores, especially for Assamese, Nepali, and Arabic.
- Core assumption: Training on native, culturally relevant data enhances model generalization to under-represented languages.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Fine-tuning Llama-3.1 with MultiNativQA improves results, especially for low-resource and dialect-rich languages"
  - [section 6] "Fine-tuning (i) improves performance for extremely low resource languages such as Assamese and Nepali, (ii) for medium resource languages, it helps dialect-rich languages like Arabic"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus shows related datasets but no fine-tuning results on culturally aligned data.
- Break condition: If fine-tuning does not improve validation metrics or causes catastrophic forgetting on high-resource languages.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Inter-annotator agreement metrics (e.g., Fleiss' Kappa)
  - Why needed here: To assess consistency of domain reliability and QA annotations across annotators.
  - Quick check question: What Kappa value range indicates "substantial agreement" according to Landis and Koch (1977)?

- Concept: Language detection and filtering
  - Why needed here: To ensure QA pairs match the target language and exclude non-native language responses.
  - Quick check question: How does the system identify and remove QA pairs that are not in the target language?

- Concept: BERTScore and BLEU for multilingual evaluation
  - Why needed here: To measure semantic and lexical similarity between model-generated and reference answers across different languages.
  - Quick check question: Which language-specific models are used for embedding extraction in BERTScore evaluation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Query Collection (QC) → Query Expansion → QA Collection (QAC) → Domain Reliability Check → QA Validation (QAA)
  - Open-source LLMs (Llama-3.1, Mistral) for fine-tuning; Closed-source (GPT-4o, Gemini) for benchmarking
  - Annotation pipeline with manual validation and editing

- Critical path:
  1. Seed query generation by native speakers
  2. LLM-based query expansion and deduplication
  3. Iterative QA pair collection via search engine
  4. Domain reliability filtering
  5. Manual QA validation and answer editing

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Human-in-the-loop ensures high quality but limits scalability
  - Semi-supervised domain filtering reduces manual effort but may miss subtle inaccuracies
  - Using both lexical (BLEU) and semantic (BERTScore) metrics provides balanced evaluation but increases complexity

- Failure signatures:
  - High domain rejection rate → unreliable sources dominate
  - Low inter-annotator agreement → unclear annotation guidelines
  - Minimal improvement after fine-tuning → training data mismatch or insufficient diversity

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run QC on a single language with 5 seed queries; measure query expansion yield and deduplication rate.
  2. Execute QAC for one region with 3 iterations; inspect QA pair diversity and coverage.
  3. Fine-tune Llama-3.1 on a small subset of MultiNativQA; evaluate BLEU/F1 improvement over base model.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the specific limitations of the domain reliability check (DRC) module when applied to languages with limited web presence, and how could these limitations be addressed in future work?
- Basis in paper: Explicit
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions that the DRC module relies on manual classification of domain reliability, which may not scale well for languages with fewer reliable sources. However, the specific limitations of this approach for low-resource languages are not explored in detail.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study of DRC performance across high and low-resource languages, along with proposed improvements for low-resource scenarios.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of fine-tuned models vary across different fine-tuning strategies (e.g., instruction tuning vs. continued pre-training) and what is the optimal approach for low-resource languages?
- Basis in paper: Inferred
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates that fine-tuning with MultiNativQA improves performance, especially for low-resource languages, but does not explore different fine-tuning strategies or their relative effectiveness.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing different fine-tuning approaches across languages with varying resource levels.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the specific cultural and regional knowledge gaps that remain in LLMs even after fine-tuning with MultiNativQA, and how can these gaps be systematically identified and addressed?
- Basis in paper: Inferred
- Why unresolved: While the paper shows improvements in cultural and regional knowledge after fine-tuning, it does not provide a systematic analysis of remaining knowledge gaps or methods to identify them.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis of model errors post-fine-tuning, categorized by cultural and regional knowledge types, along with proposed methods for gap identification.

## Limitations
- The reliance on search engine "People also ask" features may introduce regional bias if query suggestions are dominated by global rather than local information needs.
- Domain reliability filtering depends on subjective manual annotation, which may not scale and could miss nuanced inaccuracies.
- The paper does not specify exact LLM prompts or fine-tuning hyperparameters, making exact replication challenging.

## Confidence
- **High**: The overall framework design (semi-automatic QA collection, domain filtering, fine-tuning) and its positive impact on low-resource languages.
- **Medium**: The effectiveness of search engine-based query expansion and domain reliability filtering in capturing authentic, region-specific queries.
- **Low**: The generalizability of results to languages or regions not covered in the dataset, and the scalability of manual annotation processes.

## Next Checks
1. Test QC with a single language using 5 seed queries; measure query expansion yield and deduplication rate.
2. Execute QAC for one region with 3 iterations; inspect QA pair diversity and coverage.
3. Fine-tune Llama-3.1 on a small subset of MultiNativQA; evaluate BLEU/F1 improvement over base model.
