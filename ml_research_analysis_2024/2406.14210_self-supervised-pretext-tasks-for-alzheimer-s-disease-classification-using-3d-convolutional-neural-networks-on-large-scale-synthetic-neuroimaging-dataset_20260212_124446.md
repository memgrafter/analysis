# Self-Supervised Pretext Tasks for Alzheimer's Disease Classification using 3D Convolutional Neural Networks on Large-Scale Synthetic Neuroimaging Dataset

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.14210
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14210
- Authors: Chen Zheng
- Reference count: 38
- Primary result: Self-supervised learning on synthetic MRI data achieved comparable AD classification performance to models trained on real data

## Executive Summary
This study explores self-supervised learning for Alzheimer's Disease classification using synthetic MRI data. The research evaluates three pretext tasks—brain age prediction, rotation classification, and image reconstruction—trained on a large synthetic neuroimaging dataset (LDM100K), with the resulting feature extractors applied to classify real-world AD vs. cognitively normal subjects. The lightweight 3D CNN models trained on synthetic data achieved performance comparable to those trained on real data, supporting the feasibility of using large-scale synthetic data for pretext task training. Random cropping consistently improved results across all experiments.

## Method Summary
The study uses 3D T1-weighted MRI data from the synthetic LDM100K dataset (CN subjects) to train lightweight 3D CNN-based models on four pretext tasks: brain age prediction, brain image rotation classification (32 classes), brain image reconstruction (AutoEncoder), and a multi-head task combining all three. The models consist of 7 3D convolution blocks with 3 million parameters. After pretext task training, output layers are removed and the encoder serves as a feature extractor for downstream classification using SVM or Random Forest classifiers on real-world OASIS-3 and ADNI datasets (AD and CN subjects). Data preprocessing includes resizing to 192×192×192, max-min intensity normalization, and contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization, with random cropping as data augmentation.

## Key Results
- Classification accuracy of 73.9% using brain age prediction pretext task with random cropping on OASIS-3 dataset
- Random cropping consistently improved classification performance across all pretext tasks
- Synthetic data pretraining achieved similar performance to real data pretraining for AD classification
- Sensitivity remained a challenge (62.9%) due to class imbalance in training data (90% CN)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Pretext task training on synthetic data yields feature extractors that transfer to real AD vs. CN classification.
- Mechanism: Self-supervised learning on synthetic MRI data enables the CNN to learn general brain anatomy representations without requiring labeled AD data.
- Core assumption: The synthetic LDM100K dataset preserves structural brain features sufficiently to enable transfer to real-world classification tasks.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Feature extractors trained on the LDM100K synthetic dataset achieved similar performance compared to the same model using real-world data."
- Break condition: If synthetic data distribution diverges significantly from real data, or if the pretext tasks do not capture AD-relevant features, transfer performance will degrade.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Random cropping consistently improves AD classification accuracy across all pretext tasks.
- Mechanism: Data augmentation through random cropping increases model robustness by exposing it to varied spatial contexts of brain regions during training.
- Core assumption: Random cropping does not remove critical AD-discriminative regions but instead enhances generalization.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Alongside the simple preprocessing steps, the random cropping data augmentation technique shows consistent improvement across all experiments."
- Break condition: If cropping consistently removes diagnostically relevant brain regions, or if the model becomes overly reliant on cropped patterns that don't generalize.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Lightweight 3D CNN architecture with 3 million parameters is sufficient for capturing AD-relevant features.
- Mechanism: The hierarchical convolutional structure learns multi-scale brain representations that distinguish AD from CN patterns.
- Core assumption: The architectural depth and filter configurations capture relevant spatial patterns without overfitting on limited data.
- Evidence anchors: [section] "This model only consists of 3 million learnable parameters, which is more compatible with small dataset sizes and 3D volume data."
- Break condition: If the model capacity is insufficient to capture complex AD patterns, or if deeper architectures would significantly improve performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Self-supervised learning and pretext tasks
  - Why needed here: Labeled AD data is limited and expensive to obtain, making unsupervised pretraining essential for feature extraction.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between supervised and self-supervised learning in the context of medical imaging?

- Concept: 3D convolutional neural networks
  - Why needed here: MRI data is inherently volumetric, requiring 3D convolutions to capture spatial relationships across all dimensions.
  - Quick check question: How do 3D convolutions differ from 2D convolutions in handling MRI data?

- Concept: Data leakage prevention in medical ML
  - Why needed here: Improper data splitting can lead to inflated performance metrics and unreliable clinical deployment.
  - Quick check question: What are the three main types of data leakage identified in AD classification studies?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: 192×192×192 MRI scans -> 7-layer 3D CNN (3M parameters) -> Pretext heads (Age regression, Rotation classification, Image reconstruction) -> Feature extractor -> SVM/Random Forest classifier
- Critical path: Synthetic data -> Pretext task training -> Feature extraction -> Downstream classification
- Design tradeoffs: Model complexity vs. training data availability, Augmentation intensity vs. preservation of AD-discriminative features, Synthetic data fidelity vs. computational efficiency
- Failure signatures: Low sensitivity despite reasonable accuracy (class imbalance), Poor transfer from synthetic to real data, Overfitting on pretext tasks without generalization
- First 3 experiments: 1) Train age prediction pretext on LDM100K, evaluate on OASIS-3 with SVC, 2) Apply random cropping augmentation during pretext training, compare performance, 3) Test multi-head pretext task vs. individual tasks on ADNI dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of self-supervised pretext tasks trained on synthetic data compare to those trained on real-world neuroimaging data for Alzheimer's Disease classification?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The study found that feature extractors trained on the LDM100K synthetic dataset achieved similar performance compared to the same model using real-world data, supporting the feasibility of utilizing large-scale synthetic data for pretext task training.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a direct comparison of classification accuracy between models trained on synthetic data versus those trained on real-world data. It only states that the performance was "similar."
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed comparison of classification metrics (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, AUC) between models trained on synthetic data and those trained on real-world data, using the same evaluation protocols.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of data imbalance on the performance of self-supervised learning models for Alzheimer's Disease classification?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the CN class is the majority (up to 90%) in the training set, which may bias the model towards the majority class during prediction, leading to low sensitivity.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore methods to address the class imbalance issue, such as upsampling the minority class, downsampling the majority class, adjusting class weights, or generating synthetic data for the AD class.
- What evidence would resolve it: An investigation of different techniques to mitigate class imbalance and their effects on classification performance, particularly sensitivity.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the architecture of the 3D CNN base model be optimized for better performance in self-supervised learning tasks for Alzheimer's Disease classification?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses a lightweight 3D CNN model with 3 million parameters, but mentions that the application of more complex models like Residual Networks or Vision Transformers is limited by computational hardware availability.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the use of more advanced or optimized CNN architectures that could potentially improve performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: An evaluation of different CNN architectures (e.g., Residual Networks, Vision Transformers) for the pretext tasks and their impact on the downstream Alzheimer's Disease classification performance.

## Limitations

- Reliance on synthetic LDM100K data raises questions about realism and AD-relevant feature preservation
- 73.9% accuracy shows sensitivity challenges (62.9%) that could limit clinical utility
- Lightweight 3D CNN architecture (3M parameters) may constrain performance potential

## Confidence

- Transfer learning from synthetic to real data: **Medium** - Supported by direct comparisons but dependent on synthetic data quality assumptions
- Random cropping augmentation effectiveness: **Medium** - Consistent improvements observed but no ablation against other augmentations
- Lightweight 3D CNN sufficiency: **Medium** - Architecture validated but no comparison to larger models

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate pretext task performance using real AD vs. CN data (if available) to isolate synthetic-to-real transfer effects
2. Test sensitivity-specific metrics (F1, balanced accuracy) across different class imbalance ratios to assess robustness
3. Conduct ablation study comparing single pretext tasks against multi-head training to quantify task complementarity
