core_contribution: The paper explores pluractionality in Kaqchikel, Karuk, and Yurok,
  showing that event-internal pluractionality (IP) is marked via reduplication, while
  event-external pluractionality (EP) is marked via non-reduplicative affixation.
  Unlike in Balinese, this choice cannot be explained by whether or not the meaning
  involves repetition.

# Using Model-Theoretic Approaches to Uncover Linguistic Organization

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2405.07597
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07597
- **Reference count**: 3
- **Primary result**: Pluractionality in Kaqchikel, Karuk, and Yurok shows iconicity along the dimension of complexity: IP is marked via reduplication and EP via affixation, with reduplication and IP derivation being more complex

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates pluractionality in Kaqchikel, Karuk, and Yurok, demonstrating that event-internal pluractionality (IP) is marked through reduplication while event-external pluractionality (EP) is marked through non-reduplicative affixation. Unlike Balinese, this pattern cannot be explained by repetition semantics but instead reflects iconicity along the dimension of complexity. The authors formalize verb forms and meanings as sets and define algorithms to derive pluractional forms, then use computational complexity analysis to show that reduplication is more complex than affixation and IP derivation is more complex than EP derivation. This provides evidence for the iconicity of the marking pattern.

## Method Summary
The authors model verb forms and meanings as sets, with forms represented as labeled trees and meanings as sets of ordered tuples. They define algorithms for reduplication, affixation, and derivation of IP and EP meanings, then analyze the computational complexity of each algorithm using Big-O notation. The methodology involves building set-theoretic models of input verbs, running the four core algorithms to generate pluractional forms and meanings, calculating the complexity of each algorithm, and comparing these measures to assess iconicity.

## Key Results
- In Kaqchikel, Karuk, and Yurok, IP is marked via reduplication while EP is marked via non-reduplicative affixation
- Reduplication has complexity O(V³) while affixation has complexity O(1)
- IP derivation has complexity O(2^A × 2^E × 2^V) while EP derivation has complexity O(2^A)
- The pattern reflects iconicity along the dimension of complexity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Pluractionality patterns in Kaqchikel, Karuk, and Yurok can be understood through iconicity along the dimension of complexity
- Mechanism: The more complex marking strategy (reduplication) is paired with the more complex meaning (IP), while the less complex strategy (affixation) is paired with the less complex meaning (EP)
- Core assumption: Computational complexity of form-meaning derivation algorithms correlates with cognitive or linguistic complexity
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "reduplication is more complex than affixation, and deriving IP meanings is more complex than deriving EP meanings"
  - [section IV.B] "Theorem7: calculatingthemeaningof IPsrequiresanalgorithmof ahigher order of complexitythanthealgorithmrequiredfor calculatingthemeaningof EPs"
  - [corpus] "weak" - corpus shows related linguistic pattern papers but not computational complexity work
- Break condition: If complexity measures don't align with cognitive processing difficulty, or if languages mark these differently

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Set-theoretic models can represent both forms and meanings of verbs in a way that enables computational complexity analysis
- Mechanism: Forms are modeled as labeled trees (sets of vertices, edges, and dominance relations), while meanings are modeled as sets of ordered tuples representing event-argument relationships
- Core assumption: Set-theoretic representations preserve enough linguistic information to support algorithmic derivation while being formal enough for complexity analysis
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section III.A] "the formof averbcanbetranslatedintoset theoreticnotation"
  - [section III.B] "the same three pieces of information can be represented using a set of ordered sets"
  - [corpus] "weak" - corpus has semantic representation papers but not set-theoretic verb modeling
- Break condition: If set representations lose critical linguistic distinctions or algorithms cannot be properly defined

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Algorithms for deriving pluractional forms and meanings can be analyzed for computational complexity using standard methods
- Mechanism: Each derivation process (reduplication, affixation, IP derivation, EP derivation) is formalized as an algorithm whose complexity is calculated based on input size and operations performed
- Core assumption: Standard computational complexity analysis (Big-O notation) applies to linguistic algorithms
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section IV.B] "Theorem1: Partial reduplicationhascomplexityO(V3)" and "Theorem4: thecomplexityof calculatingthemeaningof anEPisO(2A)"
  - [section IV.B] "We have modeled the forms and meanings of verbs as sets, andhavedefinedalgorithmsthat performthefollowingfour processes"
  - [corpus] "weak" - corpus shows linguistic algorithms but not formal complexity analysis
- Break condition: If algorithms are too complex for practical analysis or complexity doesn't correlate with linguistic reality

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Computational complexity analysis (Big-O notation)
  - Why needed here: To compare the relative complexity of different marking strategies and meaning derivation processes
  - Quick check question: If an algorithm has complexity O(n²) and another has O(2ⁿ), which grows faster as input size increases?

- Concept: Set-theoretic representations of linguistic structures
  - Why needed here: To create formal models that can serve as inputs to algorithms and enable complexity analysis
  - Quick check question: How would you represent a phonological word with three segments as a set containing information about segments and their ordering?

- Concept: Pluractionality distinctions (event-internal vs event-external)
  - Why needed here: The paper's core argument depends on correctly identifying which type of pluractionality is marked by which strategy
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between event-internal pluractionality (IP) and event-external pluractionality (EP) in terms of how events are organized?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input models -> Algorithm engine -> Complexity analyzer -> Output generator
- Critical path: 1. Build set-theoretic models for input verbs 2. Run algorithms to generate pluractional forms/meanings 3. Calculate complexity of each algorithm 4. Compare complexity measures to determine iconicity
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Set representation vs tree structure: Sets are simpler for complexity analysis but may lose some linguistic nuance
  - Black-box functions vs detailed implementations: Using black-box functions simplifies analysis but makes it harder to verify correctness
  - General algorithms vs language-specific rules: General algorithms enable broader application but may miss language-specific patterns
- Failure signatures:
  - Incorrect complexity measures (e.g., O(1) for complex operations)
  - Algorithms that don't terminate or produce incorrect outputs
  - Set representations that lose critical linguistic information
  - Complexity comparisons that don't align with linguistic intuition
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement set-theoretic model for a simple CVC verb and verify algorithm outputs match expected reduplicated/affixed forms
  2. Calculate complexity for reduplication vs affixation on a small set of verbs and verify O(V³) vs O(1) relationship
  3. Implement IP and EP derivation algorithms and verify that IP derivation is more complex than EP derivation on sample verbs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the choice between event-external pluractionality (EP) and event-internal pluractionality (IP) interact with other dimensions of iconicity (e.g., identity, magnitude, discreteness) in languages like Kaqchikel, Karuk, and Yurok?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the five dimensions of iconicity identified by Lǐ and Ponsford (2018) but does not explore how these dimensions interact with the dimension of complexity in the context of EP and IP marking
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses primarily on the dimension of complexity and does not investigate the interplay between complexity and other dimensions of iconicity
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies examining the interaction between complexity and other dimensions of iconicity in languages with EP and IP marking, potentially through comparative analysis or experimental methods

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the cognitive basis for the iconicity observed in the marking of EP and IP in Kaqchikel, Karuk, and Yurok? Is the complexity-based iconicity related to processing costs or other cognitive factors?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges that the measure of computational complexity used may not align with cognitive complexity and leaves the task of determining how best to capture and formalize cognitive complexity to future work
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate the cognitive underpinnings of the observed iconicity
- What evidence would resolve it: Cognitive studies examining processing costs, reaction times, or other measures of cognitive effort associated with processing EP and IP forms in these languages

### Open Question 3
- Question: Are there other languages that exhibit a similar pattern of marking EP with non-reduplicative affixation and IP with reduplication, and if so, what are the underlying principles governing this pattern?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper focuses on Kaqchikel, Karuk, and Yurok as case studies but does not explore whether similar patterns exist in other languages
- Why unresolved: The paper does not conduct a cross-linguistic survey to identify other languages with similar patterns
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive cross-linguistic study of pluractional marking systems, potentially using typological databases or fieldwork data

## Limitations

- The computational complexity analysis may not directly correspond to actual processing difficulty in language use
- Set-theoretic representations may abstract away from certain linguistic nuances that could affect real-world processing
- The analysis focuses on only three languages, limiting generalizability of the findings

## Confidence

- High confidence: The basic pattern of IP being marked by reduplication and EP by affixation in the three languages studied
- Medium confidence: The claim that reduplication is computationally more complex than affixation
- Medium confidence: The claim that IP derivation is computationally more complex than EP derivation
- Low confidence: The direct correlation between computational complexity and cognitive processing difficulty

## Next Checks

1. Conduct psycholinguistic experiments to measure actual processing times for IP vs EP forms and reduplicated vs affixed forms in native speakers of these languages

2. Examine additional languages with similar pluractional marking patterns to determine if the complexity-based iconicity generalizes beyond the three languages studied

3. Implement the algorithms in a working computational system and test them on a larger corpus of verbs to verify the complexity relationships hold across diverse morphological patterns
