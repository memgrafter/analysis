# InsightBench: Evaluating Business Analytics Agents Through Multi-Step Insight Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.06423
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06423
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: InsightBench evaluates LLM agents on multi-step business analytics tasks, showing AgentPoirot outperforms baselines with careful goal specification and LLaMA-3-70b performs competitively with GPT models.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces InsightBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based agents on comprehensive, multi-step data analytics tasks using synthetic business datasets. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on single-query tasks, InsightBench tests agents on generating questions, interpreting answers, and summarizing insights across descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analytics. The authors propose AgentPoirot, a baseline agent using structured prompts, and evaluate it against baselines like Pandas Agent using LLaMA-3-Eval. Results show that open-source models like LLaMA-3-70b perform competitively with closed-source models, and that goal specification and question diversity are critical for effective data analysis.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes InsightBench to evaluate LLM agents on multi-step data analytics using 100 synthetic business datasets from ServiceNow themes (Incident, User, Finance, Inventory, Goal Management). Each dataset contains 500 entries with ground-truth insights covering four types: descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive. AgentPoirot uses structured prompts to generate insights iteratively, while evaluation uses LLaMA-3-Eval (an open-source G-Eval variant) to compare agent outputs against ground-truth. The baseline Pandas Agent and AgentPoirot are tested with both generic and carefully designed SMART goals to assess the impact of goal specification on performance.

## Key Results
- AgentPoirot outperforms baseline Pandas Agent on both insight-level and summary-level scores when using carefully designed SMART goals
- LLaMA-3-70b performs competitively with GPT models (gpt-4o, gpt-4-turbo, gpt-3.5-turbo) on InsightBench tasks
- Agents fail to discover insights when trends are too subtle (slope < 0.1), highlighting detection reliability limits
- Performance significantly drops when using generic goals versus carefully designed SMART goals

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
InsightBench works by creating a controlled environment with synthetic datasets that have known ground-truth insights across four analytics types. AgentPoirot's structured prompting approach systematically explores data through question generation, code execution, and iterative insight extraction. The LLaMA-3-Eval scoring system provides an objective measure of insight quality by comparing agent outputs to ground-truth. The benchmark's multi-step nature tests not just code generation but also question formulation and insight synthesis, which are critical for real-world business analytics.

## Foundational Learning

**Synthetic dataset generation** - Creating controlled datasets with known insights and trends; needed to establish ground truth for evaluation; quick check: verify dataset schema matches expected patterns.

**Multi-step analytics evaluation** - Assessing agents on question generation, code execution, and insight synthesis; needed because real analytics requires multiple reasoning steps; quick check: ensure all four insight types are represented in evaluation.

**Structured prompting** - Using templates to guide agents through analytics workflows; needed to maintain consistency and coverage across insight types; quick check: verify prompt templates cover all required insight categories.

**LLaMA-3-Eval scoring** - Open-source evaluation framework for comparing agent outputs to ground truth; needed for reproducible, objective assessment; quick check: confirm scoring thresholds match paper specifications.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Synthetic datasets -> AgentPoirot/Pandas Agent -> Insight generation -> LLaMA-3-Eval scoring -> Performance metrics

**Critical path**: Dataset schema → Agent question generation → Code execution → Insight extraction → Evaluation scoring → Performance aggregation

**Design tradeoffs**: The paper chose synthetic datasets over real data to ensure ground truth and controlled complexity, trading ecological validity for reproducibility and fairness in evaluation.

**Failure signatures**: 
- Agents miss subtle trends (slope < 0.1) in synthetic data
- Performance degrades significantly with generic vs. SMART goals
- Many-to-many matching mismatches in evaluation when insight descriptions overlap

**First experiments**: 
1. Test AgentPoirot on a single synthetic dataset to verify insight generation across all four types
2. Run LLaMA-3-Eval on sample agent outputs to confirm scoring aligns with ground truth
3. Compare performance of generic vs. SMART goals on a small dataset subset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: How does LLaMA-3 performance compare to GPT models across the four analytics task types? The paper shows LLaMA-3-70b performs competitively overall but doesn't provide detailed breakdowns by task type (descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive).

**Open Question 2**: What is the impact of trend intensity on insight detection reliability? While the paper identifies failure at slopes < 0.1, it doesn't comprehensively map the relationship between trend characteristics and detection reliability across different trend types.

**Open Question 3**: How do different levels of goal specificity affect insight quality? The paper shows significant performance drop with generic goals but doesn't explore intermediate goal specifications between SMART goals and generic goals.

## Limitations

- Exact schema and column choices for ServiceNow datasets are not fully specified, requiring reverse-engineering
- Specific prompts and code templates used by AgentPoirot may differ slightly from implementations without access to exact templates
- Performance evaluation may be affected by many-to-many vs one-to-many matching logic in LLaMA-3-Eval

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Core methodology, benchmark design, agent architecture, and evaluation approach are clearly specified and reproducible

**Medium confidence**: Exact prompt templates and implementation details may vary slightly from paper specifications

**Low confidence**: Precise dataset schema specifications require reverse-engineering from examples

## Next Checks

1. Verify synthetic dataset generation by creating a sample dataset and confirming it produces expected ground-truth insights across all four types

2. Test LLaMA-3-Eval scoring system on agent outputs to ensure insight-level and summary-level scores align with paper-reported thresholds

3. Experiment with sampling temperature parameter to confirm its impact on insight discovery, particularly for subtle trends
