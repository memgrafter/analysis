# Can We Remove the Ground? Obstacle-aware Point Cloud Compression for Remote Object Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.00582
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00582
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: PGR achieves bitrate savings of 9-13% with negligible mAP loss (<0.2%) compared to compressing all points

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes removing non-critical ground points from LiDAR point clouds before compression to improve compression efficiency without hurting 3D object detection performance. The authors show that removing all ground points degrades detection, but retaining ground points near objects preserves accuracy while reducing bitrate. They propose a lightweight Pillar-based Ground Removal (PGR) algorithm that removes ground pillars not near objects and restores some near objects. Experiments on KITTI and Waymo datasets show PGR achieves bitrate savings of 9-13% with negligible mAP loss (<0.2%) compared to compressing all points, and runs at 86 FPS.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a Pillar-based Ground Removal (PGR) algorithm that operates in two phases: pillar removal and pillar restoration. The algorithm first discretizes the point cloud into vertical pillars and removes ground pillars based on height variance (δminmax) and local ground baseline proximity (δenv). It then restores some removed pillars if they're close to retained pillars (within Chessboard distance δres). This selective ground point removal shifts the rate-performance curve leftward, enabling identical detection accuracy at lower bitrate by eliminating redundant spatial context while preserving critical ground points near objects.

## Key Results
- PGR achieves bitrate savings of 9-13% compared to compressing all points
- mAP loss is negligible (<0.2%) across KITTI and Waymo datasets
- PGR runs at 86 FPS, demonstrating real-time capability
- PGR outperforms other ground removal methods for object detection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Ground points outside object bounding boxes provide redundant spatial context that state-of-the-art object detectors can infer from retained points near objects. By removing ground pillars whose height variance is below δminmax and whose lowest point is within δenv of a local ground baseline, PGR eliminates points that are spatially predictable given the retained nearby context. Object detectors rely on ground points mainly for vertical extent and surface continuity cues, which are preserved when nearby ground pillars are retained.

### Mechanism 2
Pillar restoration recovers ground points adjacent to retained pillars, ensuring local continuity for object detectors without reintroducing redundant context. The restoration step flags a removed pillar for restoration if any retained pillar lies within Chessboard distance δres, thereby reintroducing ground points that bridge spatial gaps around objects. Object detectors benefit from ground points immediately adjacent to retained pillars because these points help maintain surface continuity cues.

### Mechanism 3
Ground point removal shifts the rate-performance curve leftward, enabling identical detection accuracy at lower bitrate. By removing ~20-30% of points before G-PCC compression, the bitstream contains fewer bits while the retained points preserve sufficient context for object detectors, thus reducing bpp without mAP loss. G-PCC compression efficiency benefits from fewer points because the geometry encoding overhead scales with point count.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Pillar-based spatial discretization of point clouds
  - Why needed here: PGR operates on pillars (vertical columns) to efficiently identify and remove ground points based on local height statistics
  - Quick check question: How does pillar resolution (e.g., 40cm) affect the trade-off between removal granularity and computational cost?

- Concept: Ground point segmentation using height variance and local baseline comparison
  - Why needed here: The removal criterion combines height variance (δminmax) and local ground baseline proximity (δenv) to distinguish true ground from flat surfaces like car roofs
  - Quick check question: Why is a 40cm δminmax threshold chosen to avoid removing small pedestrians while still capturing sidewalk curbs?

- Concept: Object detection performance metrics (mAP) in 3D point cloud context
  - Why needed here: PGR's effectiveness is evaluated by measuring mAP changes when ground points are selectively removed before compression
  - Quick check question: How does mAP degradation correlate with the fraction of ground points removed in different distance ranges?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input -> PGR preprocessor -> G-PCC encoder/decoder -> Object detector -> mAP evaluation
- Critical path: Input → PGR → G-PCC → Object detector → mAP evaluation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Pillar resolution vs. removal precision: finer pillars increase accuracy but cost more computation
  - δminmax vs. false removal: larger thresholds risk removing non-ground flat objects
  - δres vs. restoration overhead: larger restoration radius preserves more context but reduces bit savings
- Failure signatures:
  - mAP drops >0.5% → likely over-removal of context-rich ground points
  - Runtime <70 FPS → pillar grid or restoration logic too fine-grained
  - Bitrate savings <5% → removal criteria too conservative
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline: Compress raw point cloud without PGR, measure bpp and mAP
  2. Ablation: Run PGR with restoration disabled, compare bpp vs. mAP trade-off
  3. Parameter sweep: Vary δminmax and δenv to find optimal removal precision vs. context preservation balance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How robust is PGR to varying terrain conditions like hills, slopes, or uneven surfaces? The authors mention future work will focus on enhancing the algorithm's robustness to uneven surfaces, indicating this is an open issue. The paper does not evaluate PGR on datasets with significant terrain variations, only on relatively flat urban driving scenes from KITTI and Waymo.

### Open Question 2
What is the optimal parameter tuning strategy for PGR across different datasets and sensor configurations? While the paper provides initial parameter values based on physical reasoning, it doesn't establish a systematic method for determining optimal parameters for different scenarios. Developing and validating a parameter optimization framework using techniques like Bayesian optimization or evolutionary algorithms across diverse datasets would help resolve this.

### Open Question 3
How does PGR perform on point clouds with varying point densities, especially for distant objects? The paper doesn't provide detailed analysis of how detection performance varies with object distance or point density, only mentioning that they adapt the restoration threshold for different ranges. Systematic evaluation of detection performance across different distance ranges and point densities would be needed.

## Limitations
- The paper lacks ablation studies on how PGR performs across different object classes beyond car, cyclist, and pedestrian results
- No analysis is provided on how PGR performs in challenging scenarios such as dense urban environments, adverse weather conditions, or with different LiDAR sensor configurations
- The restoration radius parameters appear to be tuned for specific datasets without exploring sensitivity to dataset characteristics

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The core claim that selective ground point removal can reduce bitrate while maintaining detection accuracy
- **Medium Confidence**: The mechanism that ground points near objects are critical for detection while distant ground points are redundant
- **Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of the pillar restoration step in preserving detection accuracy

## Next Checks
1. Apply PGR to point clouds containing heavy truck and bus classes to validate whether the ground dependency mechanism holds for larger objects with different vertical extents
2. Test PGR performance using point clouds from different LiDAR configurations (e.g., 16-beam vs. 64-beam) to verify the algorithm's effectiveness across varying point densities and spatial distributions
3. Evaluate PGR on point clouds captured in adverse weather (rain, snow) or low-light conditions to assess whether the ground removal criteria remain effective when ground appearance varies significantly from nominal conditions
