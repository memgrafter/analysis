- This paper presents a comprehensive literature review and taxonomy of methods interpreting random forest (RF) models

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical need for interpreting Random Forest models, which are widely used but often considered "black boxes" despite their interpretable building process. The authors conducted a systematic literature review of 59 papers from 2001-2021, classifying interpretation methods across seven dimensions to create a practical taxonomy and visual classification tool. The survey reveals that most methods are post-hoc (97%), model-specific (87%), and increasingly implemented in Python (48%), with rule extraction being the dominant methodology. The work provides both researchers and practitioners with a framework for selecting appropriate interpretability methods based on their specific needs and problem characteristics.

## Method Summary
The authors performed a systematic literature review using keyword searches across five academic databases, supplemented with snowballing from reference and citation lists. From an initial pool of 974 papers, they selected 59 for detailed analysis through title/abstract screening and full-text review against inclusion/exclusion criteria. These papers were then classified based on seven axes: stage (post-hoc vs. ante-hoc), interpretability objective (global, local, pattern discovery, hybrid), methodology (rule extraction, feature-oriented, etc.), problem type (classification vs. regression), input/output formats, and programming language. The analysis included bibliographic examination, distribution statistics, and development of a visual classification tool to aid method selection.

## Key Results
- Most RF interpretation methods are post-hoc (97%) rather than ante-hoc (3%)
- Rule extraction is the dominant methodology (40%) followed by feature-oriented approaches (30%)
- 87% of methods are model-specific, leveraging RF's architecture rather than being model-agnostic
- 90% of methods can handle mixed data types, enhancing practical applicability
- Python has become the preferred implementation language (48%) over R (39%)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The systematic keyword search in five academic databases + snowballing yields a high recall coverage of RF interpretability methods.
- Mechanism: Multi-database keyword matching (interpret* + random forest) + snowballing extends coverage beyond initial search, capturing both broad and niche methods.
- Core assumption: Keyword search captures most relevant literature, and snowballing compensates for keyword limitations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We conducted a thorough literature review by examining journal papers from five academic databases... plus well-cited preprints published on the arXiv database."
  - [section] "At first, a total of 974 papers were selected... A list of 43 selected papers was then completed with 16 additional papers based on exploring the reference and citation lists."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors don't discuss methodology for paper selection.
- Break Condition: Keywords miss methods using alternative terminology (e.g., "explainable AI" without "random forest"), or snowballing fails to capture newer, less-cited papers.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The classification taxonomy based on seven axes provides a comprehensive framework for selecting appropriate RF interpretability methods.
- Mechanism: The seven classification criteria (stage, objective, methodology, issue type, input/output, implementation) cover all critical decision points when choosing an interpretability method.
- Core assumption: The seven chosen criteria comprehensively cover all dimensions relevant to method selection without significant overlap or gaps.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We have analyzed these methods and classified them based on different axes."
  - [section] "We classified these methods according to seven axes (stage, objective, methodology, issue type, input, output, and code language)..."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus doesn't validate classification framework comprehensiveness.
- Break Condition: New interpretability methods emerge that don't fit existing categories, or classification becomes too granular making selection impractical.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The visual classification tool effectively helps users identify appropriate interpretability methods for their specific needs.
- Mechanism: The distribution analysis and visual taxonomy map the relationship between method characteristics and interpretability objectives, enabling users to match their requirements to available methods.
- Core assumption: Visual representation of method distribution makes the selection process more intuitive than textual descriptions alone.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "It should also be valuable for researchers who aim to focus their work on the interpretability of RF or ML black boxes in general."
  - [section] "This figure offers to users a visual tool for the identification/selection of the appropriate interpretative methods given the interpretability objective, the methodology used, and the nature of the problem under consideration."
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus doesn't evaluate usability of visual classification tool.
- Break Condition: Visual tool becomes too complex with too many methods, or users lack understanding of the classification criteria.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Random Forest Algorithm
  - Why needed here: Understanding RF's architecture is essential for comprehending why interpretability methods work and what they're interpreting.
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of a Random Forest model and how do they contribute to its "black box" nature?

- Concept: Interpretability vs Explainability
  - Why needed here: The paper uses these terms interchangeably but understanding the distinction helps contextualize different approaches.
  - Quick check question: How do post-hoc and ante-hoc methods differ in their approach to making RF models interpretable?

- Concept: Taxonomy and Classification Systems
  - Why needed here: The paper's contribution relies on creating a useful classification system for interpretability methods.
  - Quick check question: What are the key criteria for creating an effective taxonomy for comparing different interpretability approaches?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Literature collection via multi-database search + snowballing -> Paper screening and selection -> Bibliographic analysis -> Taxonomy development across 7 axes -> Distribution analysis and visualization -> Usability study review -> GitHub repository for detailed classification
- Critical path: Database search → Paper screening → Bibliographic analysis → Taxonomy development → Distribution analysis → Visual classification tool → Usability considerations → GitHub repository
- Design tradeoffs: Breadth vs. depth in paper selection (974 papers → 59 selected), Exhaustiveness vs. practicality in taxonomy (7 axes may miss some nuances), Technical vs. non-technical audience focus (usability studies mostly with ML background participants)
- Failure signatures: Poor keyword selection leading to incomplete coverage, Classification axes that don't capture important distinctions, Visual tools that are too complex or not user-friendly
- First 3 experiments: 1) Replicate the literature search with alternative keywords to test coverage completeness, 2) Apply the taxonomy to a new set of RF interpretability papers to validate classification framework, 3) Conduct usability testing with both technical and non-technical users on the visual classification tool

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we effectively validate the usability of RF interpretation methods for end-users without ML backgrounds in real-world applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the importance of usability studies and notes that only around 13% of surveyed methods presented usability studies, suggesting the field is far from required scientific rigor. It also references several works on designing user studies and metrics for evaluating human feedback on explanations.
- Why unresolved: There is no consensus on how to effectively assess the usability of explanations, especially for end-users without ML backgrounds. The paper highlights the need for more rigorous usability studies and user-friendly solutions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Concrete protocols and tools for conducting usability experiments with diverse user groups, along with validated metrics for measuring the understandability and utility of explanations in real-world contexts.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the key characteristics that determine the optimal trade-off between the complexity and predictive performance of rule ensembles in RF interpretation methods?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the challenge of finding the best trade-off between the complexity and predictive performance of rule ensembles in rule extraction methods. It mentions that this trade-off is tackled differently among papers and is sometimes not aligned with user needs.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies this as a challenge but does not provide a definitive solution or framework for determining the optimal balance. Different methods approach this trade-off in various ways, and there is no consensus on the best approach.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive analysis of existing rule extraction methods, identifying the main characteristics that influence the complexity-performance trade-off, and proposing solutions to address the shortcomings.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we design a practical protocol and toolbox for conducting usability experiments to guide the choice of the most effective RF interpretation methods for specific problems and user needs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions plans for future work to deeply analyze the literature on usability studies and design a practical protocol and toolbox for usability experiments. It also references several works that could serve as starting points for designing user-friendly solutions.
- Why unresolved: While the paper outlines future intentions, it does not provide a concrete protocol or toolbox. The effectiveness of such tools would need to be validated through experimentation and real-world application.
- What evidence would resolve it: A developed and validated protocol and toolbox that includes diverse explanatory forms, user-friendly interfaces, and metrics for evaluating the effectiveness of RF interpretation methods across different user groups and application contexts.

## Limitations

- The keyword-based search methodology may miss emerging interpretability approaches using alternative terminology
- The taxonomy relies on seven classification axes that may not capture all relevant distinctions in evolving RF interpretation methods
- The survey focuses exclusively on post-hoc methods (97%), potentially underrepresenting ante-hoc approaches

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The systematic review methodology and classification framework are well-documented and reproducible. The distribution statistics (97% post-hoc, 87% model-specific, etc.) are directly derived from the 59-paper corpus.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that the visual classification tool effectively aids method selection lacks empirical validation through user studies with diverse technical backgrounds.
- **Low Confidence**: The assertion that this survey comprehensively covers all RF interpretability methods is difficult to verify given the keyword search limitations and rapid evolution of the field.

## Next Checks

1. **Coverage Validation**: Replicate the literature search using alternative terminology (e.g., "explainable AI," "model-agnostic") to assess whether significant methods were missed by the original keyword strategy.

2. **Classification Framework Validation**: Apply the seven-axis taxonomy to a new set of RF interpretability papers published after the survey cutoff to test framework robustness and identify any necessary refinements.

3. **Usability Testing**: Conduct empirical evaluation of the visual classification tool with both ML experts and domain practitioners to measure its effectiveness in guiding method selection across different user backgrounds.
