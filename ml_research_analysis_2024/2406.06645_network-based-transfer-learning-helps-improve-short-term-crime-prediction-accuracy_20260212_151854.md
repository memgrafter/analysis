# Network-Based Transfer Learning Helps Improve Short-Term Crime Prediction Accuracy

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06645

- Transfer learning improves short-term crime prediction accuracy in data-scarce regions

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a transfer learning framework to enhance short-term crime prediction accuracy in regions with limited mobility data. The approach transfers weights from deep learning crime prediction models trained in data-rich source regions to fine-tune models in target regions with scarce mobility data. Using crime and mobility data from four US cities, the study demonstrates that transfer learning significantly improves F1 scores for target cities, particularly when mobility data is limited to two months or less. The framework shows consistent improvements across both property and violent crimes, with the most substantial gains observed for violent crime prediction.

## Method Summary
The framework employs transfer learning by first training deep learning models on crime and mobility data from source cities with abundant data. These pre-trained models are then fine-tuned using limited data from target cities. The approach leverages the spatial and temporal patterns learned from source cities to improve prediction accuracy in target cities. The study evaluates the effectiveness of transfer learning from single source cities as well as multiple source cities using majority voting. The deep learning models incorporate network-based features to capture spatial relationships between crime incidents and mobility patterns.

## Key Results
- Transfer learning significantly improves F1 scores for target cities, especially with ≤ 2 months of mobility data
- Improvements observed across both property and violent crimes, with larger gains for violent crime prediction
- Majority voting from multiple source cities yields the best performance, while single source transfer can decrease accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Transfer learning works by leveraging the spatial and temporal patterns learned from data-rich source cities to improve prediction accuracy in data-scarce target cities. The deep learning models capture complex relationships between crime incidents and mobility patterns that are transferable across urban contexts. By fine-tuning pre-trained models with limited target city data, the framework can overcome the challenge of insufficient training examples in regions with sparse mobility data. The network-based features enable the models to understand spatial dependencies and patterns that are consistent across different cities, facilitating effective knowledge transfer.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Data Preprocessing -> Model Training (Source) -> Weight Transfer -> Fine-tuning (Target) -> Prediction

Critical path: The most critical sequence is Data Preprocessing -> Model Training (Source) -> Weight Transfer -> Fine-tuning (Target), as errors in any of these steps will propagate and affect prediction accuracy. The quality of source city training directly impacts the effectiveness of knowledge transfer.

Design tradeoffs: The framework balances between model complexity and data availability. Using deep learning models provides high predictive power but requires substantial data for training. Transfer learning mitigates this by leveraging pre-trained models, reducing the data requirements for target cities. The choice between single source and multiple source transfer involves a tradeoff between model simplicity and prediction accuracy.

Failure signatures: Performance degradation occurs when source cities have significantly different crime patterns or mobility characteristics compared to target cities. Overfitting can happen during fine-tuning if the target city data is too limited. Poor data quality or insufficient preprocessing can lead to inaccurate feature representations, affecting both source and target model performance.

Three first experiments:
1. Validate weight transfer by comparing pre-trained and fine-tuned model performance on a small subset of target city data
2. Test the impact of varying the amount of target city data on transfer learning effectiveness
3. Compare single source vs. multiple source transfer learning performance using different source city combinations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalizability across diverse urban contexts is uncertain due to focus on four US cities
- Potential biases in mobility data affecting model fairness across demographic groups are not addressed
- Optimal number and selection of source cities for transfer learning remains unclear

## Confidence

High confidence:
- Transfer learning improves short-term crime prediction accuracy in data-scarce regions
- Majority voting from multiple source cities yields optimal performance

Medium confidence:
- Transfer learning is particularly effective when target regions have limited mobility data (≤ 2 months)

Low confidence:
- The specific performance gains for violent crime prediction will extend uniformly to other crime types

## Next Checks
1. Test the transfer learning framework across a broader range of US cities with varying population densities and crime patterns to assess generalizability
2. Conduct fairness audits to evaluate potential demographic biases introduced by mobility-based transfer learning
3. Experiment with different source city selection strategies beyond majority voting to identify optimal knowledge transfer configurations
