# Unveiling Narrative Reasoning Limits of Large Language Models with Trope in Movie Synopses

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.14324
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14324
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: GPT-4 with chain-of-thought prompting achieved only 15.33 F1 score on trope detection task, while trope-wise querying improved performance by 11.8 F1 points

## Executive Summary
This study examines narrative reasoning abilities of large language models using tropes in movie synopses. The task requires understanding abstract concepts not physically present in text and making connections between seemingly unrelated ideas. While LLMs excel at factual reasoning, they struggle with narrative reasoning - GPT-4 with chain-of-thought prompting achieved only 15.33 F1 score on this task. The researchers introduced a trope-wise querying approach that improves performance by 11.8 F1 points by focusing on one trope at a time. They also discovered that chain-of-thought prompting can cause hallucinations in narrative content and increases susceptibility to adversarial attacks. The study reveals that despite their dominance in many benchmarks, current LLMs lack sophisticated narrative reasoning capabilities needed for understanding tropes.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates large language models on the TiMoS task, which involves detecting 95 tropes across movie synopses. The researchers employed two prompting strategies (Base Prompting and Chain-of-Thought) and two querying approaches (Multi-label and Trope-wise). They tested various models including GPT-4, ChatGPT, and LLaMa-2 with temperature set to 0 for deterministic outputs. Performance was evaluated using F1 score, precision, and recall metrics, with comparisons to supervised baselines and human performance.

## Key Results
- GPT-4 with chain-of-thought prompting achieved only 15.33 F1 score on trope detection task
- Trope-wise querying approach improved performance by 11.8 F1 points
- Chain-of-thought prompting can cause hallucinations in narrative content and increases susceptibility to adversarial attacks
- Human performance significantly outperformed all LLM approaches (61.56 F1 vs 15.33 F1)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Chain-of-thought prompting increases susceptibility to adversarial attacks by encouraging over-interpretation of narrative elements.
- Mechanism: CoT encourages models to generate step-by-step reasoning that can extract and elaborate on partial narrative elements, making them more likely to hallucinate connections between unrelated concepts.
- Core assumption: The stepwise reasoning process in CoT creates opportunities for models to latch onto keywords and patterns rather than understanding holistic context.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "CoT can cause hallucinations in narrative content, reducing GPT-4's performance"
  - [section] "Adversarial Injection significantly misleads LLMs through keyword and pattern recognition, especially when CoT is equipped"
  - [corpus] Weak - the paper doesn't cite other work showing this specific mechanism, only demonstrates it empirically
- Break condition: If the model learns to evaluate narrative coherence at each reasoning step rather than just identifying pattern matches.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Trope-wise querying improves performance by reducing cognitive load from multi-concept processing.
- Mechanism: By isolating each trope and focusing on one concept at a time, the model can allocate attention resources more effectively to relevant narrative elements rather than attempting to process multiple abstract concepts simultaneously.
- Core assumption: LLMs have limited capacity for parallel abstract reasoning across different narrative concepts within a single prompt.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We introduce a trope-wise querying approach to address these challenges and boost the F1 score by 11.8 points"
  - [section] "trope-wise querying, where each LLM query inputs a single trope, significantly enhancing LLM performance"
  - [corpus] Moderate - aligns with concurrent work (Sprenkamp et al., 2023) on fine-tuning for multi-label classification limitations
- Break condition: If the model develops better multi-concept integration capabilities through training or architectural improvements.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Narrative reasoning requires understanding abstract concepts not physically present in text, unlike factual reasoning.
- Mechanism: Tropes involve thematic interpretation and symbolic analysis that requires connecting seemingly unrelated ideas, which current LLMs struggle with due to their focus on surface-level pattern matching.
- Core assumption: LLMs excel at factual reasoning tasks but lack the deeper cognitive skills needed for thematic interpretation and narrative analysis.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Unlike factual reasoning, which is based on logical deductions and objective data, narrative reasoning presents distinct challenges by requiring a deep understanding of event sequences and extensive world knowledge"
  - [section] "trope understanding requires LLMs to understand concepts that are not physically present or directly observable"
  - [corpus] Moderate - connects to broader literature on narrative understanding challenges (Piper et al., 2021)
- Break condition: If models develop better abstraction capabilities through larger scale training or architectural innovations.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Chain-of-thought prompting
  - Why needed here: Understanding why CoT both helps and hurts in this context is central to the paper's findings
  - Quick check question: Why might CoT that helps in math reasoning hurt in narrative reasoning?

- Concept: Multi-label classification
  - Why needed here: The task involves identifying multiple tropes per movie synopsis, and the paper explores different querying strategies
  - Quick check question: How does multi-label classification differ from binary classification in terms of model architecture?

- Concept: Adversarial attacks in NLP
  - Why needed here: The paper introduces an adversarial injection method to test model robustness
  - Quick check question: What makes adversarial attacks particularly challenging for narrative reasoning tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Movie synopsis + Trope(s) → Model processing → JSON output with reasoning → Evaluation metrics
- Critical path: Movie synopsis and trope(s) → Model processing → JSON output with reasoning → Evaluation metrics
- Design tradeoffs: Base prompting (faster, less prone to hallucination) vs CoT (slower, more interpretable but prone to hallucination) vs fine-tuning (requires data but potentially more robust)
- Failure signatures: High recall with low precision (hallucination), consistent underperformance on certain trope categories, sensitivity to adversarial injections
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare base prompting vs CoT on a small subset to confirm the performance degradation
  2. Test trope-wise querying on the same subset to verify the 11.8 F1 point improvement
  3. Apply adversarial injection to both base and CoT versions to measure vulnerability differences

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific narrative reasoning capabilities are missing in current LLMs that prevent them from understanding tropes effectively?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that current LLMs struggle with narrative reasoning tasks like understanding tropes, achieving only random guessing performance on the TiMoS dataset, and that trope understanding requires abstraction beyond physical presentation and making connections between seemingly unrelated ideas.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the problem but doesn't specify which exact cognitive capabilities or reasoning patterns LLMs lack for narrative comprehension.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of human vs LLM reasoning patterns when processing tropes, identification of specific cognitive operations humans perform that LLMs cannot replicate.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can CoT prompting be modified to reduce hallucination while maintaining or improving narrative reasoning performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows that CoT prompting can cause hallucinations in narrative content, reduces GPT-4's performance, and increases susceptibility to adversarial attacks.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates CoT's negative effects but doesn't propose specific modifications to mitigate these issues while preserving benefits.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic testing of modified CoT approaches with controlled hallucination rates and narrative reasoning accuracy metrics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What architectural changes or training approaches could enable LLMs to better handle multi-concept reasoning tasks like trope detection?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The trope-wise querying approach significantly improved performance by focusing on single concepts, suggesting LLMs struggle with multi-concept reasoning, but the paper doesn't explore architectural solutions.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of decomposition strategies but doesn't investigate how to build models that can handle multiple concepts simultaneously.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of new model architectures or training paradigms that demonstrate improved multi-concept reasoning without requiring decomposition.

## Limitations

- The performance improvements from trope-wise querying were demonstrated only on the TiMoS movie synopsis dataset, limiting generalizability to other narrative domains
- The adversarial injection experiments tested only one specific attack method, leaving uncertainty about robustness against broader classes of narrative-based attacks
- The study did not explore alternative fine-tuning approaches beyond the LLaMa-2-7B model, limiting conclusions about scalability to larger or differently architected LLMs

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The core finding that current LLMs struggle with narrative reasoning tasks is well-supported. The empirical results showing GPT-4 achieving only 15.33 F1 score (compared to 61.56 for human performance) are robust and align with broader literature on LLM limitations in abstract reasoning tasks.

**Medium Confidence:** The mechanism explaining why chain-of-thought prompting increases hallucination vulnerability is plausible but requires additional validation. While the empirical evidence shows performance degradation with CoT, the theoretical explanation about stepwise reasoning creating opportunities for pattern matching could benefit from more rigorous testing across different task types.

**Low Confidence:** The generalizability of trope-wise querying improvements across different model architectures and narrative domains remains uncertain. The 11.8 F1 point improvement was demonstrated on a specific model (GPT-4) and dataset (movie synopses), and may not translate directly to other contexts.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-domain validation**: Test trope-wise querying and CoT vulnerability on narrative datasets from different domains (e.g., literature summaries, news articles) to assess generalizability of the findings.

2. **Alternative attack methods**: Implement and evaluate additional adversarial attack strategies beyond the single method used in the study to better understand the scope of CoT vulnerability to narrative-based attacks.

3. **Fine-tuning comparison**: Compare the performance of different fine-tuning approaches (beyond LLaMa-2-7B with LoRA) on the TiMoS task to determine if the proposed solutions scale across various model architectures and sizes.
