# Examining Language Modeling Assumptions Using an Annotated Literary Dialect Corpus

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2410.02674
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02674
- **Reference count**: 8
- **Primary result**: Character-level models better capture literary orthographic variation through character-edit information than token-level models

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how intentional orthographic variation in 19th century American literature conveys dialect effects using both token-level (BERT) and character-level (CANINE) language models. The authors analyze 4,032 orthovariant tokens paired with standard forms and context, finding that literary orthographic variation communicates dialect through multiple channels: word-level semantics, context-level semantics, and character edits. Character-level models like CANINE distinguish between intentional literary variants and constructed unintentional variants more effectively than token-level models, particularly relying on character-edit information. The study reveals that authors used specific character-level edits to signal dialect, with models successfully clustering tokens from different dialect groups when they share similar orthographic transformations.

## Method Summary
The authors use a dataset of 19th century American literary orthovariant tokens with human-annotated dialect group tags to investigate how orthographic variation conveys dialect effects. They employ both token-level (BERT) and character-level (CANINE) language models to analyze observed variants, their standard forms, and context. The methodology involves generating embeddings for observed, standard, and synthetic variants (reversed, OCR errors, swaps, random mutations), then performing k-means clustering on both absolute and relative embeddings. The study evaluates clustering quality using multiple metrics including purity, accuracy, semantic coherence, and phonetic similarity, testing how well models can distinguish between different types of orthographic variation and capture dialect-specific patterns.

## Key Results
- Character-level models distinguish between intentional literary variants and constructed unintentional variants more effectively than token-level models
- Literary orthographic variation communicates dialect effects through multiple information channels: word-level semantics, context-level semantics, and character edits
- Choice of tokenization scheme meaningfully impacts what orthographic information a model can surface

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Character-level models capture orthographic variation better than token-level models because they preserve character-edit information
- Mechanism: Character-level models process individual characters, allowing them to detect and learn from the specific character-level transformations authors use to signal dialect
- Core assumption: Dialect effects in literary texts are primarily encoded through character-level orthographic edits rather than word-level semantic relationships
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Character-level models like CANINE distinguish between intentional literary variants and constructed unintentional variants more effectively than token-level models, particularly relying on character-edit information"
  - [section] "BERT-forced performs better on higher LD transformations, with average correct and error set average LD of 2.2 and 1.9 respectively, implying that BERT-forced preserves difference information beyond character edits"
- Break condition: If dialect effects rely more heavily on word-level semantics or contextual information rather than character edits, token-level models would outperform character-level models

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multiple linguistic channels (word semantics, context semantics, character edits) are used in literary dialect construction
- Mechanism: Authors signal dialect through combinations of semantic shifts at word level, contextual cues, and specific character-level transformations
- Core assumption: Dialect effects are not reducible to a single information channel but require multiple simultaneous signals
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "literary orthographic variation communicates dialect effects through multiple information channels: word-level semantics, context-level semantics, and character edits"
  - [section] "Clusters 3 and 7 of the CANINE-s relative set contain high proportions of both AA (African-American) and WS (White Southern) labeled tokens" with "edits shared by WS and AA in these clusters largely impact 'r'-related graphemes"
- Break condition: If dialect effects could be effectively captured through a single channel, the multiple-channel approach would be unnecessary complexity

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Tokenization scheme choice impacts what orthographic information a model can surface
- Mechanism: Different tokenization approaches (word-piece vs character-level) determine which aspects of orthographic variation are preserved and accessible to the model
- Core assumption: The granularity of tokenization directly affects the model's ability to detect and learn from orthographic variation patterns
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "choice of tokenization scheme meaningfully impacts what orthographic information a model is able to surface"
  - [section] "BERT-forced, CANINE-s and CANINE-c best separate observed-standard pairings from other tokens in their datapoints" while "BERT-base performs best on SO accuracy" but "ultimately only reach purity scores of ~.5"
- Break condition: If all tokenization schemes preserved equivalent information about orthographic variation, choice of scheme would not impact model performance

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Tokenization and subword segmentation
  - Why needed here: The paper compares token-level (BERT) and character-level (CANINE) models, requiring understanding of how different tokenization schemes affect model behavior
  - Quick check question: How does WordPiece tokenization differ from character-level tokenization in terms of what information is preserved?

- Concept: Contextual language models and embedding extraction
  - Why needed here: The experiments involve generating embeddings from both token and character-level contextual models and analyzing these representations
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between using the last four hidden layers versus the final hidden layer when extracting embeddings?

- Concept: Clustering evaluation metrics (purity, accuracy, semantic coherence)
  - Why needed here: The paper uses multiple evaluation metrics to assess clustering quality, requiring understanding of what each metric measures
  - Quick check question: How does purity differ from overall accuracy in evaluating clustering performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing -> Model inference -> Feature engineering -> Clustering -> Evaluation
- Critical path: 1. Generate embeddings for observed and synthetic variants 2. Create absolute and relative embedding sets 3. Perform clustering across multiple k values 4. Evaluate clustering using multiple metrics 5. Analyze cluster compositions and patterns
- Design tradeoffs: Character-level models preserve character-edit information but may lose word-level semantic relationships; token-level models capture semantic relationships but may miss character-level orthographic patterns
- Failure signatures: Low purity across all k values indicates models cannot distinguish between different types of variants; high semantic coherence with low Dtag clustering accuracy suggests models rely too heavily on word semantics
- First 3 experiments: 1. Compare BERT-base and CANINE-s performance on clustering observed tokens by Dtag at k=17 2. Evaluate relative embedding sets for all models to assess character-edit information preservation 3. Test BERT-forced on high Levenshtein Distance transformations to understand character-edit boundaries

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do character-level models like CANINE distinguish between intentional literary variants and constructed unintentional variants compared to token-level models like BERT?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "character-level models distinguish between intentional literary variants and constructed unintentional variants more effectively than token-level models, particularly relying on character-edit information."
- Why unresolved: The paper provides evidence of this distinction but does not fully explain the mechanisms by which character-level models achieve this distinction.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis of the internal workings of character-level models to identify specific features or patterns that enable them to differentiate between intentional and unintentional variants.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the implications of using different tokenization schemes on the ability of language models to surface orthographic information?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper concludes that "choice of tokenization scheme meaningfully impacts the type of orthographic information a model is able to surface."
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides evidence of the impact, it does not explore the full range of implications or potential strategies for optimizing tokenization schemes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of various tokenization schemes across different language models and their effects on orthographic information processing.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do the semantic coherence scores of clusters relate to the effectiveness of language models in capturing dialect effects?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the use of semantic coherence scores to evaluate cluster quality, noting that "BERT-large relative contains multiple clusters with semantic coherency > .5, while CANINE-s relative has only one cluster with a score > .4."
- Why unresolved: The paper does not establish a clear relationship between semantic coherence and the ability to capture dialect effects.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies correlating semantic coherence scores with the accuracy of dialect effect detection across different language models.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What are the limitations of the current dataset in capturing the full range of dialect effects in 19th-century American literature?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges that "the coherence of a given observed token and its assigned Dtag is also limited by the inventory of tags chosen."
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the full extent of these limitations or propose solutions for expanding the dataset.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of the dataset's coverage and suggestions for expanding the tag inventory to better capture dialect effects.

### Open Question 5
- Question: How do context semantics influence the clustering of literary variants in language models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "context semantics in part determines accurate literary variant clustering" and provides examples of clusters influenced by contextual similarities.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not fully explore the mechanisms by which context semantics influence clustering or how this can be optimized.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis of the role of context in clustering algorithms and experiments to optimize context-aware clustering in language models.

## Limitations

- The findings are based on a curated dataset of 4,032 orthovariant tokens from 19th century American literature, which may not generalize to other time periods, genres, or languages
- The synthetic variant generation approach may not fully capture the natural distribution of orthographic variation found in authentic literary dialect
- The reliance on human-annotated dialect tags introduces potential subjectivity, though the study mitigates this through expert annotation

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The finding that character-level models better capture orthographic variation through character-edit information is well-supported by consistent performance differences across multiple experiments and evaluation metrics.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that multiple linguistic channels are simultaneously used in literary dialect construction is supported but could benefit from more direct experimental evidence.

**Medium Confidence**: The conclusion about tokenization scheme choice impacting what information models can surface is reasonable but the practical implications for real-world applications remain somewhat unclear.

## Next Checks

1. **Synthetic Variant Realism Test**: Generate a smaller validation set of synthetic variants using the learned character-edit patterns from the CANINE model, then have expert annotators evaluate whether these variants appear plausible as authentic literary dialect.

2. **Cross-Genre Generalization**: Apply the same analysis pipeline to a dataset of 20th or 21st century literary dialect to test whether the observed patterns hold across different time periods and writing styles.

3. **Controlled Channel Removal Experiment**: Train modified versions of BERT and CANINE that explicitly mask either character-edit information or semantic context, then compare their performance on the dialect clustering task.
