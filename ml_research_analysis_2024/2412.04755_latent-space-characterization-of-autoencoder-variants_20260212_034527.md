# Latent Space Characterization of Autoencoder Variants

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.04755
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04755
- Authors: Anika Shrivastava; Renu Rameshan; Samar Agnihotri
- Reference count: 29
- Primary result: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have smoother latent spaces than Convolutional Autoencoders (CAEs) and Denoising Autoencoders (DAEs), as evidenced by consistent ranks in symmetric positive semidefinite matrices, stable Hilbert space subspaces, and tightly clustered t-SNE visualizations.

## Executive Summary
This paper characterizes the latent spaces of three autoencoder variants—Convolutional Autoencoders (CAEs), Denoising Autoencoders (DAEs), and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)—to understand their smoothness properties. The study explores latent spaces in two domains: the manifold space and the Hilbert space. In the manifold space, the authors observe that CAEs and DAEs have latent tensors that lie on stratified manifolds due to variability in ranks of symmetric positive semidefinite (SPSD) matrices, while VAEs have consistent ranks forming a smooth product manifold. In the Hilbert space, CAEs and DAEs exhibit varying dimensions and increasing principal angles between clean and noisy subspaces, while VAEs maintain consistent subspace dimensions with zero principal angles. The results are corroborated by t-SNE plots, which show significant divergence between clean and noisy points in CAEs and DAEs, while VAEs show tightly clustered points.

## Method Summary
The study compares three autoencoder variants (CAE, DAE, VAE) trained on MNIST with identical latent tensor shapes (7x7x128). The characterization involves three parallel analyses: (1) manifold analysis where latent tensors are unfolded into vectors and covariance matrices are computed to analyze rank consistency across SPSD matrices; (2) Hilbert space analysis where a distance-preserving kernel maps product manifold points to Hilbert space, followed by virtual feature computation and dimensionality reduction to analyze subspace properties; and (3) t-SNE visualization of flattened latent tensors to observe clustering patterns. The analyses are performed on test images at varying noise levels (0 to 0.05 variance) to assess robustness.

## Key Results
- VAEs maintain consistent ranks across all symmetric positive semidefinite matrices regardless of input noise level, forming a smooth product manifold, while CAEs and DAEs show rank variability creating stratified manifolds.
- In Hilbert space analysis, VAEs maintain consistent subspace dimensions with zero principal angles between clean and noisy subspaces, while CAEs and DAEs show decreasing dimensions and increasing principal angles.
- t-SNE visualizations confirm the theoretical findings: VAEs show tightly clustered clean and noisy points, while CAEs and DAEs show increasing divergence between clean and noisy clusters with higher noise levels.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The smoothness of the latent space in VAEs arises because their latent representations consistently lie on the same product manifold, whereas CAEs and DAEs produce tensors distributed across multiple strata of varying ranks.
- Mechanism: By modeling the encoded latent tensors as points on a product manifold of symmetric positive semi-definite (SPSD) matrices, the study observes that VAEs maintain fixed ranks across all SPSD matrices regardless of input noise level. This rank consistency ensures that all latent tensors lie on a single smooth product manifold. In contrast, CAEs and DAEs exhibit rank variability across SPSD matrices, causing their latent tensors to span multiple strata. Movement within a single stratum is smooth, but transitions between strata are not, leading to a non-smooth overall structure.
- Core assumption: The latent tensor's rank configuration directly determines whether it lies on a smooth or stratified product manifold.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the manifold of VAE is a smooth product manifold of two symmetric positive definite matrices and a symmetric positive semi-definite matrix."
  - [section V.A] "The variability in these ranks indicate whether the underlying manifold is smooth or stratified."
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct mention of manifold rank consistency in neighbor papers, but several discuss manifold geometry of latent spaces.
- Break condition: If the rank analysis is flawed or the assumption that rank consistency guarantees smoothness is incorrect, the mechanism fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The dimensionality of subspaces in Hilbert space changes with noise for CAEs and DAEs but remains constant for VAEs, reflecting their underlying manifold smoothness.
- Mechanism: After mapping product manifold points to Hilbert space using a distance-preserving kernel, the study calculates virtual features and reduces dimensionality. For CAEs and DAEs, increasing noise causes the subspace dimension to decrease, indicating that noisy data points occupy lower-dimensional subspaces that rotate away from clean data subspaces (as measured by increasing principal angles). VAEs maintain the same subspace dimension and zero principal angles regardless of noise, indicating stable, smooth structure.
- Core assumption: Subspace dimensionality in Hilbert space is a valid proxy for manifold smoothness and noise robustness.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section V.B] "For the CAE and DAE, the dimensionality of subspaces decreases as the input transitions from clean to noisy"
  - [section V.B] "In contrast, the VAE points lie in the same subspace regardless of the noise level."
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct mention of Hilbert space dimensionality analysis in neighbor papers.
- Break condition: If the Hilbert space transformation does not preserve the geometric properties needed for this analysis, the mechanism breaks.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The divergence between clean and noisy latent representations in t-SNE plots directly visualizes the smoothness differences between autoencoder variants.
- Mechanism: t-SNE reduces high-dimensional latent tensors to 2D for visualization. For CAEs and DAEs, clean and noisy points diverge increasingly with noise level, forming elongated clusters. For VAEs, both clean and noisy points remain tightly clustered around the origin, showing minimal divergence. This visual pattern confirms the manifold and Hilbert space analyses, showing that VAEs maintain smooth, coherent latent spaces while CAEs and DAEs do not.
- Core assumption: t-SNE visualization accurately reflects the underlying manifold structure and smoothness properties.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section V.C] "For CAE and DAE, clean and noisy points diverge increasingly with noise level, forming elongated clusters. For VAEs, both clean and noisy points remain tightly clustered around the origin"
  - [section V.C] "These observations reinforce the behaviour that we observe in both the manifold and Hilbert space analyses."
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct mention of t-SNE visualization in neighbor papers, though several discuss latent space visualization.
- Break condition: If t-SNE introduces distortions that misrepresent the true manifold structure, the mechanism fails.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Product manifolds and stratified manifolds
  - Why needed here: The entire characterization framework relies on understanding how latent tensors can be modeled as points on product manifolds of SPSD matrices, and how rank variability creates stratification.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a smooth product manifold and a stratified manifold in terms of rank consistency of constituent matrices?

- Concept: Hilbert space embeddings and positive-definite kernels
  - Why needed here: The study uses distance-preserving kernels to map manifold points to Hilbert space for alternative analysis through subspace dimensions and principal angles.
  - Quick check question: How does a positive-definite kernel ensure that distances between points are preserved when mapping from a product manifold to Hilbert space?

- Concept: Principal angles between subspaces
  - Why needed here: The analysis uses principal angles to quantify how much noisy subspaces rotate away from clean subspaces in Hilbert space, which indicates smoothness.
  - Quick check question: What does it mean when principal angles between two subspaces increase with noise level?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Data preprocessing -> Autoencoder training -> Latent tensor extraction -> Manifold analysis -> Hilbert space transformation -> t-SNE visualization

- Critical path:
  1. Train autoencoders on appropriate datasets
  2. Extract latent tensors from test images at varying noise levels
  3. Perform tensor unfolding and covariance matrix computation
  4. Analyze rank consistency across SPSD matrices
  5. Apply Hilbert space transformation and analyze subspace properties
  6. Generate t-SNE visualizations for confirmation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using latent tensors vs. latent vectors: The paper chooses tensors for consistency across models, though vectors yield similar reconstruction performance
  - Regularization parameter for Hilbert space: Small epsilon added to zero eigenvalues to push all points to a single manifold, potentially simplifying analysis but possibly losing some structure
  - Noise levels: Incremental variance increases (0.01) provide fine-grained analysis but require many test samples

- Failure signatures:
  - Inconsistent rank analysis across different runs
  - Hilbert space dimensionality not correlating with expected smoothness properties
  - t-SNE plots showing unexpected patterns or high variance
  - Reconstruction performance degrading significantly with noise

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify rank consistency analysis by manually checking covariance matrix ranks for a small subset of test samples across noise levels
  2. Confirm Hilbert space transformation preserves distances by comparing pairwise distances before and after transformation
  3. Test t-SNE visualization stability by running multiple times with different random seeds and checking for consistent clustering patterns

## Limitations
- The rank consistency analysis could be sensitive to specific tensor unfolding methods and noise level thresholds chosen.
- The Hilbert space analysis depends on kernel choice and regularization parameters, which could influence subspace dimensionality calculations.
- t-SNE visualizations, while intuitive, are subject to stochastic variations and parameter sensitivity.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The fundamental observation that VAEs show more rank consistency than CAEs/DAEs is robust and well-supported by multiple analyses.
- **Medium Confidence**: The link between rank consistency and manifold smoothness is plausible but could benefit from additional theoretical justification.
- **Medium Confidence**: The Hilbert space analysis provides useful complementary evidence but relies on specific methodological choices that could influence results.

## Next Checks
1. Test the rank consistency analysis across different tensor unfolding methods and noise level increments to verify robustness of the manifold characterization.
2. Systematically vary the regularization parameter and kernel bandwidth in the Hilbert space transformation to assess their impact on subspace dimensionality and principal angle measurements.
3. Apply multiple dimensionality reduction techniques (UMAP, Isomap, etc.) alongside t-SNE to verify that the observed clustering patterns are consistent across methods and not artifacts of t-SNE's specific algorithm.
