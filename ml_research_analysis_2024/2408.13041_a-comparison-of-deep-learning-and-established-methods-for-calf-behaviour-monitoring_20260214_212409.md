# A Comparison of Deep Learning and Established Methods for Calf Behaviour Monitoring

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.13041
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13041
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: Rocket outperformed all 11 tested deep learning methods for calf behavior classification, achieving a macro-recall of 0.77.

## Executive Summary
This study compares deep learning methods with established machine learning techniques for classifying calf behaviors using accelerometer data. The research evaluates 11 deep learning models against Rocket, a traditional machine learning method, using a dataset of over 27 hours of labeled time-series data from 30 calves. The findings reveal that Rocket significantly outperforms all tested deep learning approaches, achieving a macro-recall of 0.77 compared to lower scores from DL models. This unexpected result challenges the assumption that deep learning methods are inherently superior for time-series classification tasks.

## Method Summary
The study uses the ActBeCalf dataset containing accelerometer data from 30 calves, sampled at 25 Hz. The classification task involves six behavior classes using 3-second windows (75 data points) with 8 time series per sample. Rocket (MiniRocket + RidgeClassifierCV) serves as the baseline method, while 11 deep learning architectures are implemented including MLP, FCN, ResNet, Encoder, MCNN, t-LeNet, MCDCNN, Time-CNN, TWIESN, Inception, and ConvTran. Data is split at the calf level (30 calves: 9 for test, 6 for validation, 15 for training) to ensure proper generalization. Models are evaluated using macro-averaged precision, recall, and F1 scores, along with class-level metrics and confusion matrices.

## Key Results
- Rocket achieved a macro-recall of 0.77, significantly higher than any deep learning method tested
- Deep learning models underperformed Rocket despite their complexity and data encoding capabilities
- The data separation mechanism at calf level ensured better generalization by preventing data leakage

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Rocket achieves superior performance by extracting high-dimensional features using random convolutional kernels, which are then efficiently classified with linear methods. Rocket applies thousands of random convolutional kernels to the time series data, generating a high-dimensional feature space. This feature space is then fed into a simple linear classifier (RidgeClassifier), which benefits from the rich representation without needing complex model architectures. The core assumption is that the high-dimensional feature space generated by random convolutions captures enough discriminative patterns for effective classification, even without deep learning model complexity.

### Mechanism 2
Deep learning models underperform due to insufficient data volume and complexity for the given task, leading to overfitting and poor generalization. Deep learning models require large amounts of data to effectively learn complex patterns and generalize well. The calf behavior dataset, while substantial, may not be large enough to support the complexity of DL models, resulting in overfitting and poor performance on unseen data. The core assumption is that the complexity of the calf behavior classification task is not sufficient to justify the use of deep learning models, which are better suited for tasks with larger, more complex datasets.

### Mechanism 3
The data separation mechanism at the calf level ensures better generalization by preventing data leakage between training and testing sets. By separating the data at the calf level, the model is trained and tested on data from different individual calves, preventing the model from learning calf-specific patterns and ensuring better generalization to new, unseen calves. The core assumption is that calf-specific patterns exist in the data, and preventing the model from learning these patterns during training improves its ability to generalize to new calves.

## Foundational Learning

- **Time series classification and its challenges**
  - Why needed here: Understanding the specific challenges of classifying temporal data is crucial for appreciating why certain methods like Rocket are effective and why others might struggle.
  - Quick check question: What are the main differences between time series classification and standard classification tasks?

- **Feature extraction and its role in machine learning**
  - Why needed here: Grasping how feature extraction transforms raw data into a form suitable for classification helps explain Rocket's effectiveness and the potential limitations of deep learning approaches.
  - Quick check question: How does feature extraction in Rocket differ from feature learning in deep neural networks?

- **Model generalization and overfitting**
  - Why needed here: Recognizing the importance of generalization and the risks of overfitting is essential for understanding why data separation at the calf level is crucial and why deep learning models might underperform.
  - Quick check question: What are the primary causes of overfitting in machine learning models, and how can they be mitigated?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data preprocessing -> MiniRocket feature extraction -> RidgeClassifierCV classification -> Macro-averaged metric evaluation -> Calf-level data separation
- **Critical path**: 1. Preprocess raw accelerometer data (standardization, uniform sizing) 2. Extract features using MiniRocket 3. Optimize RidgeClassifier hyperparameters via grid search 4. Evaluate model performance using macro-averaged metrics 5. Ensure data separation at the calf level for generalization
- **Design tradeoffs**: Simplicity vs. complexity: Rocket's simplicity vs. deep learning's potential for capturing complex patterns; Computational efficiency vs. model expressiveness: Rocket's speed vs. deep learning's ability to learn hierarchical representations; Generalization vs. overfitting: Calf-level data separation vs. potential loss of information
- **Failure signatures**: Poor performance on individual classes: Indicates class imbalance or insufficient feature discrimination; High variance in cross-validation: Suggests overfitting or insufficient data; Low macro-recall but high macro-precision: Implies the model is conservative in its predictions, missing many true positives
- **First 3 experiments**: 1. Compare Rocket's performance with and without calf-level data separation to quantify the impact on generalization 2. Test Rocket's performance on a larger, more complex dataset to determine if deep learning methods become more competitive 3. Implement a hybrid approach combining Rocket feature extraction with a simple deep learning classifier to assess potential performance gains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What specific architectural modifications to deep learning models could potentially bridge the performance gap with ROCKET in calf behavior classification? The authors suggest that future research should focus on enhancing deep learning models to potentially close the performance gap with ROCKET. This question remains unresolved because the study demonstrates ROCKET's superior performance but does not explore or test specific architectural changes to deep learning models that might improve their performance.

### Open Question 2
How does the performance of deep learning models vary with longer duration segments of time-series data in calf behavior classification? The authors mention that the transformer-based ConvTran model's performance might be hindered by the relatively short and fragmented nature of the time-series data used in the study. This question remains unresolved because the study uses 3-second segments, and while the authors suggest that longer segments might affect performance, they do not test this hypothesis.

### Open Question 3
How effective are hybrid models combining ROCKET's feature extraction with deep learning classifiers for calf behavior classification? The authors suggest that using ROCKET for initial feature extraction followed by deep learning for classification might yield better results. This question remains unresolved because the study does not implement or test such hybrid models, leaving their potential effectiveness unexplored.

## Limitations

- The study's conclusions are based on a single dataset with a specific sampling rate (25 Hz) and window size (3 seconds), which may limit generalizability to other accelerometer configurations or animal species
- The deep learning models tested represent only a subset of available architectures, potentially missing methods better suited to this specific task
- Hardware constraints prevented testing more complex models, which could have altered the comparative results

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The superiority of Rocket over tested deep learning methods on this specific dataset and task. The experimental methodology is clearly described, and the performance gap is substantial (Rocket macro-recall of 0.77 vs. DL models' lower scores).

**Medium confidence**: The generalizability of these findings to other datasets, animal species, or accelerometer configurations. While the methodology is sound, the results may be dataset-specific.

**Low confidence**: The assertion that Rocket will consistently outperform deep learning methods for all time series classification tasks. The paper's scope is limited to calf behavior classification, and results may differ for more complex or larger-scale problems.

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset Generalization Test**: Replicate the study using a different accelerometer dataset (e.g., human activity recognition) with varying sampling rates and window sizes to assess whether Rocket maintains its advantage across different data characteristics.

2. **Architecture Expansion**: Implement and test additional deep learning architectures (e.g., Vision Transformers, Long Short-Term Memory networks) that were not included in the original comparison to determine if the performance gap persists with a broader range of models.

3. **Hybrid Approach Evaluation**: Develop a hybrid model combining Rocket feature extraction with a simple deep neural network classifier to determine if this approach can capture the benefits of both methods and potentially outperform either individually.
