# Knowledge Distillation in Federated Learning: a Survey on Long Lasting Challenges and New Solutions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.10861
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10861
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Analyzes how knowledge distillation can address privacy, heterogeneity, communication, and personalization challenges in federated learning

## Executive Summary
This survey examines how knowledge distillation (KD) techniques can address fundamental challenges in federated learning (FL), including privacy preservation, data heterogeneity, communication bottlenecks, and personalization requirements. The paper categorizes KD-based FL into three types: feature-based, parameter-based, and data-based federated distillation. By leveraging KD properties such as model agnosticism, compression, and enhancement, the survey demonstrates how these approaches can significantly reduce privacy risks by minimizing sensitive data exposure, mitigate non-IID data issues through regularization constraints, and enhance communication efficiency by reducing transmitted data volume.

## Method Summary
The survey analyzes KD-based FL through a comprehensive literature review, categorizing existing approaches into three main types based on what is exchanged between clients and servers: feature-based (logits), parameter-based (model parameters), and data-based (synthetic data) federated distillation. The paper examines how KD properties—model agnosticism, compression, and enhancement—can be leveraged to address FL challenges. It provides an overview of the mechanisms through which KD improves privacy by replacing parameter sharing with logits, mitigates non-IID data issues through regularization, and enhances communication efficiency through data reduction. The survey also identifies future research directions and open questions in the field.

## Key Results
- KD-based FL significantly reduces privacy risks by exchanging logits instead of model parameters
- Non-IID data challenges can be mitigated through knowledge transfer acting as regularization constraints
- Communication efficiency is enhanced through reduced data transmission via logits-only communication
- Three distinct categories of KD-based FL approaches identified with different trade-offs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: KD-based FL improves privacy by replacing model parameter sharing with logits, which contain less sensitive information.
- Mechanism: Clients upload only model logits (probabilistic outputs) rather than model parameters, reducing the risk of reconstructing private data.
- Core assumption: Logits are abstract enough to be useful for training while containing minimal sensitive information compared to model parameters.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "KD-based FL algorithms only require clients to exchange the logits of their local models... thus significantly reducing potential privacy risks and communication costs."
  - [section]: "In contrast to the rich and redundant information represented by model parameters, KD represents simplicity and efficiency. KD uses a method of sharing the logits of the model to transfer knowledge among clients."
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence found. This is a key claim that needs further validation.
- Break condition: If attackers can reconstruct sensitive data from logits or if the abstraction level of logits becomes insufficient for effective training.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: KD-based FL mitigates non-IID data challenges by using knowledge transfer as regularization, preventing model drift.
- Mechanism: Clients learn from each other's logits, which act as regularization constraints, preventing local models from deviating too far from the global objective.
- Core assumption: The knowledge captured in logits is compatible across heterogeneous client models and can serve as effective regularization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The core concept of KD involves facilitating knowledge transfer between models by exchanging logits at intermediate or output layers... KD an excellent solution for the long-lasting challenges in FL."
  - [section]: "This regularization constraint is more flexible than parameter aggregation, permitting clients to balance localized and global knowledge."
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence found. This is a key claim that needs further validation.
- Break condition: If the regularization constraint is too weak to prevent model drift or too strong, causing loss of local model performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: KD-based FL enhances communication efficiency by reducing the amount of data transmitted in each round.
- Mechanism: Instead of transmitting full model parameters, clients only share logits, which are much smaller and faster to transmit.
- Core assumption: Logits are sufficiently small and informative to enable effective model training without full parameter sharing.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "These properties make KD an excellent solution for the long-lasting challenges in FL."
  - [section]: "The model’s output logits are small, and the communication overheads... are minimal compared with conventional FL algorithms."
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence found. This is a key claim that needs further validation.
- Break condition: If the size reduction of logits is offset by the need for additional data or computational overhead, or if the reduced information leads to poor model performance.

  - Why needed here: KD is the core mechanism that enables the proposed benefits of KD-based FL.
  - Quick check question: What is the main difference between KD and traditional model training?
- Concept: Federated Learning (FL)
  - Why needed here: Understanding FL is crucial to grasp the context and challenges that KD-based FL aims to address.
  - Quick check question: What are the main challenges of traditional FL?
- Concept: Non-IID Data
  - Why needed here: Non-IID data is a major challenge in FL that KD-based FL aims to mitigate.
  - Quick check question: How does non-IID data affect model training in FL?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Clients -> Server -> Knowledge Distillation -> Global Model
- Critical path:
  1. Clients train local models on private data.
  2. Clients generate logits on a public dataset.
  3. Clients upload logits to server.
  4. Server aggregates logits to generate global logits.
  5. Server sends global logits to clients.
  6. Clients update local models using global logits.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Privacy vs. Model Performance: More privacy protection may lead to reduced model performance.
  - Communication Efficiency vs. Model Accuracy: More efficient communication may lead to less accurate models.
  - Personalization vs. Homogeneity: More personalized models may lead to less homogeneous knowledge transfer.
- Failure signatures:
  - Privacy leaks: Attackers can reconstruct sensitive data from logits.
  - Model drift: Local models deviate too far from the global objective.
  - Communication bottlenecks: The amount of data transmitted is still too large.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the privacy protection of KD-based FL by attempting to reconstruct private data from logits.
  2. Evaluate the effectiveness of KD-based FL in mitigating non-IID data challenges by comparing model performance on non-IID data with and without KD.
  3. Measure the communication efficiency of KD-based FL by comparing the amount of data transmitted with traditional FL.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the theoretical upper bound of knowledge compatibility between different client models in federated learning, and how does non-IID data affect this compatibility?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "it lacks rigorous theoretical analysis to prove the compatibility of knowledge between different client models and determine the upper bound of this compatibility."
- Why unresolved: Current research assumes knowledge compatibility but lacks mathematical proofs, especially in non-IID scenarios where model differences are significant.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical proofs showing bounds on knowledge compatibility, empirical studies demonstrating these bounds across different non-IID data distributions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we design a mechanism to identify and control teacher model misguidance in real-time during federated knowledge distillation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions "the teacher model may mislead the student model" and suggests evaluating teacher credibility but notes limitations with unlabeled public datasets.
- Why unresolved: Current approaches rely on labeled auxiliary datasets or assume teacher model quality improves over time, but real-time detection and mitigation of misguidance remains challenging.
- What evidence would resolve it: Algorithms that can detect teacher misguidance without labeled data, validation of these algorithms across different federated learning scenarios.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal balance between dataset size and communication efficiency in federated distillation, and can dataset distillation provide a solution?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "KD relies on the dataset... within a certain range, the more data, the better the distillation effect" but also notes "adding more data will lead to larger communication costs."
- Why unresolved: Current research shows larger datasets improve distillation but increase communication costs, and dataset distillation is proposed as a potential solution without comprehensive evaluation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing distillation performance with different dataset sizes, validation of dataset distillation effectiveness in reducing communication while maintaining model performance.

## Limitations
- Privacy enhancement claims lack direct empirical validation
- Non-IID mitigation effectiveness not demonstrated through comprehensive experiments
- Communication efficiency gains not quantified with concrete metrics
- Limited discussion of potential failure modes in real-world deployment scenarios

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The categorization of KD-based FL into feature-based, parameter-based, and data-based federated distillation is well-supported by existing literature and provides a clear framework for understanding the field.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claims regarding communication efficiency gains are plausible based on the reduced data transmission, but lack quantitative evidence to support the extent of these gains.
- **Low Confidence**: The privacy enhancement claims are based on theoretical assumptions rather than empirical validation, and the effectiveness of knowledge transfer as regularization for non-IID data is not demonstrated.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct an empirical study to test the privacy protection of KD-based FL by attempting to reconstruct sensitive data from logits.
2. Evaluate the effectiveness of KD-based FL in mitigating non-IID data challenges by comparing model performance on non-IID data with and without KD.
3. Measure the communication efficiency of KD-based FL by comparing the amount of data transmitted with traditional FL, and assess the impact on model accuracy.
