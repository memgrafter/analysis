# A Survey of Multimodal Sarcasm Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.18882
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18882
- Reference count: 8
- Primary result: First comprehensive survey of multimodal sarcasm detection (MSD), categorizing MSD into visuo-textual and audio-visual with textual types, and reviewing over 60 papers.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the first comprehensive survey on multimodal sarcasm detection (MSD), reviewing over 60 papers published between 2018-2023. It addresses the challenge that sarcasm often requires additional modalities beyond text—such as images, audio, and video—to be accurately identified. The survey categorizes MSD into two main types: visuo-textual (text with images) and audio-visual with textual (video, audio, and captions). It details the datasets and deep learning approaches developed for each, including traditional multi-modal fusion methods, multimodal transformers, and recent LLM-based approaches. Key results show that advanced models like ViFi-CLIP and multimodal transformers achieve high accuracy on benchmark datasets, while traditional methods lag behind. The paper highlights future directions, such as multilingual MSD, perspectivism in annotations, inter-task dependencies, and leveraging large multimodal language models.

## Method Summary
The survey systematically reviews over 60 papers on multimodal sarcasm detection published between 2018-2023. It categorizes MSD into visuo-textual and audio-visual with textual types, analyzes the datasets and deep learning approaches for each category, and identifies key research trends. The survey covers traditional multi-modal fusion methods, multimodal transformers, and recent LLM-based approaches. It provides detailed analysis of benchmark datasets including MMSD, MMSD2.0, Silver-Standard, and MUStARD, and evaluates the performance of various model architectures.

## Key Results
- Multimodal transformers like ViFi-CLIP and multimodal BERT achieve higher accuracy than traditional CNN+LSTM fusion methods on visuo-textual sarcasm detection datasets
- Speaker sentiment and emotion labels improve multimodal sarcasm detection performance through multi-task learning
- Advanced models show significant performance gaps compared to traditional methods, particularly on complex incongruities requiring cross-modal understanding

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Sarcasm often requires additional modalities beyond text—such as images, audio, and video—to be accurately identified.
- Mechanism: The survey shows that sarcasm detection relies on incongruities that are sometimes only apparent when combining text with visual or auditory cues. For example, a sarcastic text paired with a contradictory image creates incongruity that neither modality alone reveals.
- Core assumption: The incongruity necessary to express sarcasm can be distributed across multiple modalities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "sarcasm detection often requires additional information present in tonality, facial expression, and contextual images."
  - [section] "sarcasm detection often requires additional information present in tonality, facial expression, and contextual images."
  - [corpus] Weak: no direct experimental support in neighbor papers for modality incongruence; mostly methodological mentions.
- Break condition: If the multimodal incongruity is not present or is too subtle, text-only models may perform equally well.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multimodal transformers achieve higher accuracy on benchmark datasets compared to traditional methods.
- Mechanism: The survey reports that advanced models like ViFi-CLIP and multimodal transformers (e.g., VisualBERT, ViLBERT) outperform traditional CNN + LSTM fusion approaches on visuo-textual sarcasm detection datasets (MMSD, MMSD2.0).
- Core assumption: Multimodal transformers can learn richer cross-modal interactions through pretraining on large vision-language datasets.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Key results show that advanced models like ViFi-CLIP and multimodal transformers achieve high accuracy on benchmark datasets, while traditional methods lag behind."
  - [section] "More recent studies have moved towards an approach of tuning multimodal encoders such as CLIP, VilBERT, and VisualBERT for this specific task."
  - [corpus] No direct performance data in neighbor papers; mostly conceptual overlap.
- Break condition: If pretraining data does not capture the specific incongruities relevant to sarcasm, multimodal transformers may not outperform specialized fusion methods.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Speaker sentiment and emotion labels improve multimodal sarcasm detection performance.
- Mechanism: Studies on audio-visual and textual datasets (MUStARD, MUStARD++) show that auxiliary tasks like sentiment and emotion classification help the model capture speaker intent and context, boosting sarcasm detection accuracy.
- Core assumption: Emotional and sentiment cues provide disambiguating context that reduces false positives in sarcasm classification.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "These studies demonstrate that auxiliary information pertaining to the speaker emotion and sentiment help in detecting irony and sarcasm."
  - [section] "Chauhan et al. [2020] explored the role of speaker sentiment in sarcasm identification... using attention for aggregating the features and trained their model in a multi-task learning approach where sentiment classification is the auxiliary task."
  - [corpus] No direct mention in neighbor papers; assumption based on cited survey.
- Break condition: If emotion/sentiment labels are noisy or irrelevant to the sarcastic context, multi-tasking may degrade performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Text-only sarcasm detection and its limitations
  - Why needed here: Provides baseline understanding of why multimodal approaches are necessary; explains challenges like incongruity and context dependence.
  - Quick check question: What makes sarcasm difficult to detect from text alone, and how do multimodal cues help resolve these ambiguities?

- Concept: Multimodal fusion strategies (early, late, hybrid)
  - Why needed here: Survey describes various fusion techniques (concatenation, attention-based, graph-based) used in MSD; understanding these is critical to designing new models.
  - Quick check question: How do early fusion, late fusion, and hybrid fusion differ in combining text and image features for sarcasm detection?

- Concept: Large multimodal language models (LMMs) and prompt engineering
  - Why needed here: Recent works benchmark GPT-4, InstructBLIP, and CLIP-based models; understanding their capabilities and limitations informs future research directions.
  - Quick check question: What are the strengths and weaknesses of using prompt-tuned LMMs for multimodal sarcasm detection compared to task-specific models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Text encoder (e.g., BERT) -> Image encoder (e.g., ResNet, CLIP) -> Fusion module (attention-based, graph-based, or transformer-based) -> Sarcasm classification head (binary or multi-label) -> Optional auxiliary heads (sentiment, emotion classification)

- Critical path:
  Text/image/audio → Encoding → Fusion → Classification
  The fusion step is most critical; poor fusion leads to degraded performance.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Early fusion vs. late fusion: Early fusion allows cross-modal interaction earlier but may lose modality-specific nuance; late fusion preserves modality details but may miss subtle interactions.
  - Pretrained multimodal transformers vs. task-specific encoders: Transformers offer richer cross-modal understanding but require more data/compute; task-specific models are lighter but may underperform on complex incongruities.

- Failure signatures:
  - High accuracy on training set but poor generalization → overfitting to spurious cues (e.g., hashtags in MMSD)
  - Misclassification when text and image are semantically unrelated → fusion module failing to identify incongruity
  - Performance drop with out-of-domain data → lack of robust cross-modal generalization

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline: Text-only sarcasm detection using BERT on MMSD dataset; measure performance gap vs. multimodal models.
  2. Fusion comparison: Implement early, late, and hybrid fusion strategies on visuo-textual data; evaluate which best captures incongruity.
  3. Multimodal transformer fine-tuning: Fine-tune CLIP or VisualBERT on MMSD2.0; compare against traditional CNN + LSTM fusion baseline.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can multimodal sarcasm detection models effectively handle sarcasm that relies on cultural context and perspective differences among annotators?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights that sarcasm detection is subjective and annotators' judgments are affected by cultural upbringing, suggesting perspectivism in annotations as a future direction.
- Why unresolved: Current models typically rely on aggregated annotations without accounting for individual annotator perspectives, missing the nuanced cultural and personal interpretations that influence sarcasm understanding.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of models that incorporate multiple annotator perspectives, possibly through multi-perspective learning frameworks or explicit modeling of cultural context in training data.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal approach for leveraging large multimodal language models (LMMs) like GPT-4 and LLaVA for sarcasm detection, and how can their performance be improved beyond zero-shot capabilities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The survey notes that while LMMs have shown promise, they were only evaluated in zero-shot scenarios, and prompt engineering for these models remains unexplored for sarcasm detection.
- Why unresolved: Current research has not systematically investigated prompt tuning, few-shot learning, or task-specific fine-tuning of LMMs for multimodal sarcasm detection.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies evaluating different prompting strategies, fine-tuning approaches, and task-specific adaptations of LMMs against traditional multimodal models on benchmark sarcasm datasets.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can multimodal sarcasm detection benefit from joint modeling with related tasks like humor detection and offensive language identification, and what are the optimal architectures for multi-task learning in this domain?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies inter-task dependencies between sarcasm and humor/offensive language, suggesting multi-task learning as a future direction.
- Why unresolved: While the relationships between these tasks are acknowledged, there is limited research on how to effectively model these dependencies and whether shared representations or task-specific modules work best.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical comparisons of multi-task learning architectures, analysis of shared vs. task-specific representations, and evaluation of performance gains when jointly modeling sarcasm with humor and offensive language tasks.

## Limitations
- Limited exploration of cross-lingual or cultural variations in sarcasm expression, with most studies focusing on English-language datasets
- Reliance on relatively small benchmark datasets (e.g., MMSD with ~10K instances) raises questions about scalability and generalization
- Subjectivity of sarcasm detection remains a challenge, with inter-annotator agreement often below ideal levels, particularly in multimodal contexts

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The categorization of MSD into visuo-textual and audio-visual with textual types is well-supported by the literature surveyed.
- Medium Confidence: Claims about multimodal transformers outperforming traditional methods are based on reported results but lack direct experimental validation in the survey itself.
- Low Confidence: The effectiveness of LLM-based approaches for MSD is noted but not thoroughly benchmarked, leaving performance claims speculative.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct cross-dataset evaluation to test model generalization beyond English and social media contexts.
2. Replicate key experiments comparing multimodal transformers vs. traditional fusion methods on MMSD2.0 to verify performance gaps.
3. Test the impact of speaker sentiment and emotion labels on sarcasm detection accuracy using MUStARD dataset to validate multi-task learning benefits.
