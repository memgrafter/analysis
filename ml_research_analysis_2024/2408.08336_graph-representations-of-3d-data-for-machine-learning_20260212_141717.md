# Graph representations of 3D data for machine learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.08336
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08336
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: Graph-based approaches achieve 100% accuracy on mitochondrial network classification while being more computationally efficient than 3D CNNs

## Executive Summary
This paper explores graph-based representations as an alternative to voxel-based processing for 3D data in machine learning. The authors propose a two-step approach: converting 3D data to graphs through skeletonization, then applying graph neural networks (GNNs). Two case studies demonstrate the effectiveness: classifying mitochondrial networks in muscle cells (achieving 100% binary classification accuracy) and predicting contact areas in 3D CAD designs. The approach shows advantages in computational efficiency, ease of feature engineering, and scalability compared to traditional 3D CNNs.

## Method Summary
The methodology follows a two-step process: first converting 3D data to graphs using skeletonization algorithms (SN-graph for mitochondrial networks, mesh-to-graph conversion for CAD data), then applying Graph Attention Networks with geometric features as vertex and edge attributes. For mitochondrial networks, 2D confocal microscopy images are skeletonized into graphs with geometric features and intensity values. For CAD data, triangular meshes are converted to graphs by preserving vertices and edges while adding proximity-based edges between parts. The GNNs consist of multiple attention or message-passing layers with geometric and intensity-based features serving as input attributes.

## Key Results
- Achieved 100% accuracy on binary classification of mitochondrial networks as healthy/unhealthy at volume level
- GNN achieved 0.86 accuracy at patch level for mitochondrial classification vs 0.95 with CNN baseline
- Successfully predicted contact areas between parts in 3D CAD designs through semantic segmentation of graph vertices
- Demonstrated computational efficiency gains over 3D CNNs through reduced processing of graph representations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Graph-based representations reduce computational complexity compared to voxel-based 3D data processing by converting volumetric data to graphs through skeletonization, decreasing elements from millions of voxels to hundreds of vertices while preserving topological and geometric relationships. Core assumption: skeletonization preserves essential structural information needed for downstream tasks. Evidence: 256×256 pixel patches constrained to 300 vertices with ~600 edges. Break condition: If skeletonization loses critical geometric features necessary for accurate classification.

### Mechanism 2
Graph neural networks can learn geometric and topological features more effectively than 3D CNNs by operating directly on graph structure through message passing between vertices, capturing spatial relationships and topological patterns. Core assumption: graph representation captures relevant geometric and topological features for the specific task. Evidence: Standard geometric features (edge lengths, slopes, vertex degrees) included as vertex/edge attributes. Break condition: If tasks require fine-grained voxel-level detail lost in graph abstraction.

### Mechanism 3
Graph representations enable easier feature engineering and domain knowledge incorporation by allowing vertices and edges to be annotated with domain-specific features that serve as input for GNNs. Core assumption: domain knowledge can be effectively encoded as graph attributes. Evidence: Geometric features, intensity values, and proximity metrics used as vertex/edge attributes. Break condition: If graph representation becomes too sparse or manually engineered features are not representative.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph neural networks and message passing

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: 3D data → Skeletonization → Graph construction → Feature engineering → GNN training → Prediction
- Critical path: Skeletonization algorithm selection → Graph attribute definition → GNN architecture design → Model training → Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Graph size vs. information retention; manual feature engineering vs. learned features; skeletonization method selection
- Failure signatures: Overfitting on small graph representations; loss of critical geometric information; inefficient graph construction
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare classification accuracy of GNN on skeletonized graph vs. 3D CNN on voxel data for same 3D shape dataset
  2. Test different skeletonization algorithms (medial axis, thinning, SN-graph) on mitochondrial network data and measure classification performance
  3. Experiment with different graph feature sets (geometric only, intensity-based, combined) to determine which features contribute most to classification accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the computational complexity trade-off between skeletonization algorithms and 3D CNNs for different 3D data volumes and sparsity levels?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions GNNs are faster than 3D CNNs for 3D graph data but lacks quantitative benchmarks comparing processing times and accuracy across different data volumes, sparsity, and complexity scenarios
- Why unresolved: Qualitative comparisons without systematic benchmarking across diverse datasets
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic benchmarking experiments comparing skeletonization+GNN approaches against 3D CNNs across diverse datasets with varying volumes, sparsity, and complexity, measuring both accuracy and computational resources

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do different skeletonization algorithms affect the performance of downstream GNN models for various 3D data types?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions investigating skeletonization methods including signed distance function thinning, Medial Axis Transform, and machine learning approaches like SN-graph, but only briefly describes their characteristics without comparative analysis
- Why unresolved: Acknowledges multiple methods exist but doesn't provide empirical comparisons of their effectiveness for different 3D data types
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic evaluation of multiple skeletonization algorithms across different 3D data types with consistent GNN architectures, measuring task-specific performance metrics

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal strategy for augmenting graph representations of 3D data to improve GNN model generalization?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions that graphs allow "easy augmentation" through adding edges and vertices, providing examples for CAD data, but doesn't systematically explore augmentation strategies
- Why unresolved: Identifies augmentation as a key advantage but only presents a few ad-hoc examples without exploring the full space of possible augmentations
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic ablation studies testing different graph augmentation strategies across multiple 3D datasets and tasks, measuring generalization performance on held-out data

## Limitations

- Limited runtime comparisons between GNN and 3D CNN approaches across different 3D data sizes and complexities
- Binary classification of mitochondrial networks achieving 100% accuracy may be influenced by dataset-specific characteristics
- Skeletonization process introduces additional preprocessing step that could become bottleneck for real-time applications
- Study focuses on two specific use cases without testing broader applicability across diverse 3D data types

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Graph representations reduce computational complexity by decreasing elements from voxels to vertices - well-supported by evidence showing 300 vertices vs 256×256 pixel patches
- **Medium Confidence**: GNNs can learn geometric and topological features more effectively than 3D CNNs - supported by experimental results but lacks comprehensive ablation studies
- **Medium Confidence**: Graph representations enable easier feature engineering - demonstrated through case studies but relies heavily on domain-specific knowledge

## Next Checks

1. Conduct comprehensive runtime comparisons between GNN and 3D CNN approaches across varying 3D data sizes (small, medium, large) and complexities to verify claimed computational efficiency gains
2. Apply the graph-based approach to at least two additional 3D data types (e.g., medical imaging data, molecular structures) to test generalizability beyond mitochondrial networks and CAD use cases
3. Perform systematic ablation studies removing different types of graph features (geometric, intensity-based, proximity metrics) to quantify their individual contributions to classification performance
