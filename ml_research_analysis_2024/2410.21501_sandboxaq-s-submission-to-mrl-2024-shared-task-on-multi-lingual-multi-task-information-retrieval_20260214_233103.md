# SandboxAQ's submission to MRL 2024 Shared Task on Multi-lingual Multi-task Information Retrieval

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.21501
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21501
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: Comprehensive evaluation of five LLMs across five languages for QA and NER tasks using zero-shot, CoT, and translation prompting strategies

## Executive Summary
This paper presents SandboxAQ's submission to the MRL 2024 shared task on multilingual multi-task information retrieval. The study evaluates five large language models (LLMs) across five diverse languages (English, German, Spanish, Chinese, and Persian) using various prompting strategies for two key tasks: Question Answering (QA) and Named Entity Recognition (NER). The authors employ zero-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, and translation techniques to assess model performance and identify patterns in language difficulty across tasks.

The evaluation reveals significant variability in model effectiveness across different languages and tasks, with some models consistently outperforming others while showing task-specific strengths. Advanced prompting techniques generally improved QA performance but had mixed results for NER. The study found that language difficulty patterns differed between tasks, suggesting that current LLMs may develop different linguistic competencies for different information retrieval tasks. These findings highlight the need for task-specific approaches in multilingual natural language processing and demonstrate the potential of zero-shot methods for achieving high accuracy in multilingual information retrieval.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates five large language models across five languages using three prompting strategies: zero-shot, chain-of-thought reasoning, and translation techniques. The evaluation focuses on two core information retrieval tasks: Question Answering and Named Entity Recognition. The authors systematically test different model-prompting combinations to identify performance patterns and language-specific challenges. The multilingual setup includes languages from different families (Indo-European and Sino-Tibetan) to ensure diversity in linguistic features and complexity.

## Key Results
- Model effectiveness varies significantly across tasks and languages, with no single model dominating all scenarios
- Advanced prompting techniques generally improve QA performance but show mixed results for NER tasks
- Language difficulty patterns differ between tasks, suggesting LLMs develop task-specific linguistic competencies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study's effectiveness stems from its systematic evaluation of multiple LLMs across diverse linguistic contexts using varied prompting strategies. By testing zero-shot, CoT, and translation approaches, the authors can isolate the impact of different prompting techniques on model performance. The multilingual setup across five languages from different families allows for identification of cross-linguistic patterns and task-specific challenges that would not be apparent in monolingual evaluations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Zero-shot prompting**: Why needed - provides baseline performance without task-specific adaptation; Quick check - compare against few-shot results
- **Chain-of-thought reasoning**: Why needed - enables step-by-step problem solving for complex queries; Quick check - measure improvement over direct prompting
- **Translation techniques**: Why needed - bridges language gaps when models perform better in certain languages; Quick check - verify accuracy of translation outputs
- **Multilingual evaluation**: Why needed - identifies cross-linguistic patterns and task-specific challenges; Quick check - analyze performance consistency across language families
- **Task-specific prompting**: Why needed - different tasks may require different prompting approaches; Quick check - compare prompting strategies across QA and NER
- **Model diversity**: Why needed - different architectures may excel at different linguistic features; Quick check - identify consistent performance patterns across models

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Data preparation -> Model selection -> Prompt engineering -> Evaluation metrics -> Result analysis

Critical path: Prompt selection → Model inference → Answer extraction → Accuracy calculation → Performance comparison

Design tradeoffs: Zero-shot approaches offer simplicity but may underperform compared to fine-tuning; CoT adds reasoning steps but increases computational cost; translation adds accuracy but introduces potential translation errors

Failure signatures: Inconsistent performance across languages suggests model-specific linguistic limitations; task-specific failures indicate need for specialized prompting strategies; translation errors compound when used as intermediate step

First experiments:
1. Test baseline zero-shot performance across all language-task combinations
2. Implement CoT prompting for QA tasks to measure reasoning improvement
3. Evaluate translation-based approaches for low-resource language pairs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to five languages, restricting generalizability to other language families
- Focus on zero-shot and few-shot approaches without exploring fine-tuning alternatives
- Analysis of language difficulty patterns remains correlational without deeper linguistic investigation

## Confidence
- High confidence: Model effectiveness varies significantly across tasks and languages (systematic evaluation supports this)
- Medium confidence: Specific model performance rankings (likely to shift with different evaluation conditions)
- Medium confidence: Advanced prompting generally improves QA but has mixed effects on NER (observed consistently with notable exceptions)

## Next Checks
1. Replicate evaluation across broader language set including low-resource languages and different families
2. Compare zero-shot/few-shot approaches with fine-tuned models on identical tasks
3. Conduct error analysis to identify whether failures are task-specific, language-specific, or linguistic-feature driven
