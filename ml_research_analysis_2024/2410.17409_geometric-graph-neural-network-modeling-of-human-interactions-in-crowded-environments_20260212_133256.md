# Geometric Graph Neural Network Modeling of Human Interactions in Crowded Environments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.17409
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17409
- Reference count: 1
- Average ADE of 0.43 and FDE of 0.73 across all datasets using field of view-based neighborhood and inverse of norm kernel function

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a geometric graph neural network architecture for predicting pedestrian trajectories in crowded environments by incorporating domain knowledge from psychological studies. The method constructs graph representations using field of view, motion direction, and distance-based kernel functions to define interaction neighborhoods. By integrating these psychological constraints with data-driven approaches, the model achieves improved prediction accuracy compared to previous methods, demonstrating that combining domain knowledge with machine learning enhances modeling of human interactions in crowds.

## Method Summary
The method constructs graph representations of pedestrian interactions using four neighborhood definitions and two kernel functions across multiple pedestrian datasets. The approach uses Graph Neural Networks with spatio-temporal convolutions to model pedestrian trajectories, incorporating field of view constraints and distance-based weighting to capture human interaction dynamics. The model is trained using leave-one-out methodology on ETH and UCY datasets with negative log-likelihood loss, predicting future trajectories from observed sequences.

## Key Results
- Best performance achieved using field of view-based neighborhood definition and inverse of norm kernel function
- Average ADE of 0.43 and FDE of 0.73 across all datasets
- Improved prediction accuracy compared to previous approaches through domain knowledge integration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Field of view (FOV) constraint improves prediction accuracy by reducing irrelevant neighbor influence.
- Mechanism: The model assigns zero weight to pedestrians outside the pedestrian's FOV, creating a directional attention mechanism that mirrors human perceptual constraints. This is implemented through Graph 1 and Graph 2 neighborhood definitions using the condition `∆pi t · ∆pj t > 0`, which only connects pedestrians within ±90 degrees of the walking direction.
- Core assumption: Human pedestrian interactions are predominantly influenced by agents within their perceptual field of view, and this constraint is more important than pure proximity.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] states "we define interaction neighborhoods using pedestrians' field of view, motion direction, and distance-based kernel functions"
  - [section 3.2] explicitly states "people have a 180◦ horizontal field of view and face toward their walking direction" and describes the FOV-based weighting
  - [corpus] shows related work on trajectory prediction using scene features and scene information integration
- Break condition: The FOV constraint would break down in environments with significant visual obstructions, blind spots, or when pedestrians are moving without visual attention to their direction of travel.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Distance-based kernel functions with exponential decay better capture the diminishing influence of distant pedestrians.
- Mechanism: The exponential decay kernel function `exp(-∥pi t − pj t ∥)` assigns higher weights to closer pedestrians while smoothly reducing influence with distance, as opposed to the inverse norm kernel which can create numerical instability when distances approach zero.
- Core assumption: The strength of pedestrian influence follows an exponential decay pattern rather than a simple inverse relationship, and this better reflects real-world interaction dynamics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] mentions "distance-based kernel functions" as part of the methodology
  - [section 3.2] describes two kernel functions and references Rio et al. (2018) showing "the impact of neighbors diminishes exponentially to zero at a distance of 4–5 m"
  - [corpus] shows related work on geometric trajectory simulation and motion modeling
- Break condition: The exponential decay assumption would fail in environments where long-range interactions are significant (e.g., emergency situations) or where distance is not the primary factor in determining interaction strength.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Combining field of view with approach dynamics creates more context-aware interaction neighborhoods.
- Mechanism: Graph 4 (`wij view,appr,t`) combines both the FOV constraint and the approach condition (`dij t+1 > dij t`), ensuring that only pedestrians who
