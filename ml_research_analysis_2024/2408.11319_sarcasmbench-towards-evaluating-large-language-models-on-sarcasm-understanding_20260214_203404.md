# SarcasmBench: Towards Evaluating Large Language Models on Sarcasm Understanding

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2408.11319
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11319
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: LLMs underperform supervised PLMs on sarcasm detection, with GPT-4 outperforming other models by an average of 14.0%

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of large language models (LLMs) on sarcasm understanding, a task considered more complex than sentiment analysis. The authors test eleven state-of-the-art LLMs and eight pre-trained language models (PLMs) on six sarcasm detection benchmark datasets using three prompting approaches: zero-shot input/output, few-shot input/output, and chain-of-thought prompting. The study reveals that current LLMs underperform supervised PLM baselines across all datasets, with GPT-4 consistently showing the best performance. Few-shot input/output prompting proves most effective for sarcasm detection, outperforming both zero-shot and chain-of-thought approaches.

## Method Summary
The study reformulates sarcasm detection as a conditional generative task where models output binary labels ("sarcastic" or "non-sarcastic") based on text input with task instructions. Six benchmark datasets are used: IAC-V1, IAC-V2, Ghosh, iSarcasmEval, Riloff, and SemEval 2018 Task 3. Three prompting approaches are evaluated: zero-shot IO (no examples), few-shot IO (k examples via KNN sampling), and few-shot chain-of-thought (intermediate reasoning steps). Eleven SOTA LLMs (including GPT-4, Claude 3, Mistral) and eight SOTA PLMs (BERT, RoBERTa, DeBERTa, XLNet, etc.) are tested using their official implementations. Performance is measured using precision, recall, accuracy, and macro F1 score, averaged over five random seeds.

## Key Results
- Current LLMs underperform supervised PLMs on sarcasm detection across all six benchmarks
- GPT-4 consistently outperforms other LLMs by an average of 14.0% across prompting methods
- Few-shot input/output prompting outperforms chain-of-thought prompting for sarcasm detection
- Larger parameter models generally show better performance on sarcasm understanding tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: LLMs underperform supervised PLMs due to insufficient fine-tuning on nuanced language patterns
- **Mechanism**: PLMs trained on sarcasm-specific datasets learn domain-adapted representations that capture subtle cues better than general-purpose LLMs
- **Core assumption**: Sarcasm understanding relies on learned domain-specific features rather than broad general reasoning
- **Evidence**: Current LLMs underperform supervised PLMs across six sarcasm benchmarks; PLMs outperform traditional methods by approximately 7.8% due to extensive pretraining on large-scale data

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: GPT-4's superior performance stems from larger parameter count and stronger generalization
- **Mechanism**: More parameters allow richer internal representations and better transfer from pretraining to downstream sarcasm tasks
- **Core assumption**: Parameter scale directly correlates with task-specific performance in NLP
- **Evidence**: GPT-4 consistently and significantly outperforms other LLMs with an average improvement of 14.0%; larger parameter size enhances language comprehension and reasoning capabilities

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Few-shot IO prompting works better than CoT for sarcasm because detection is a holistic, intuitive process
- **Mechanism**: Providing examples directly maps to pattern recognition needed for sarcasm, while CoT forces artificial reasoning steps that don't align with how humans detect sarcasm
- **Core assumption**: Sarcasm detection is fundamentally different from logical/mathematical reasoning tasks
- **Evidence**: Few-shot IO prompting method outperforms zero-shot IO and few-shot CoT; sarcasm detection being a holistic, intuitive, and non-rational cognitive process doesn't adhere to step-by-step logical reasoning

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Sarcasm detection fundamentals
  - **Why needed**: Understanding what makes sarcasm challenging (incongruity, context dependence, cultural references) is essential for interpreting why LLMs struggle
  - **Quick check**: What are the key linguistic features that distinguish sarcastic from literal text?

- **Concept**: Prompt engineering techniques
  - **Why needed**: Different prompting approaches have dramatically different effects on LLM performance for sarcasm tasks
  - **Quick check**: How does providing demonstrations in few-shot prompting help LLMs detect sarcasm?

- **Concept**: Model evaluation metrics
  - **Why needed**: Understanding precision, recall, and F1 scores is crucial for interpreting performance differences between LLMs and PLMs
  - **Quick check**: Why might high precision but low recall indicate specific model weaknesses in sarcasm detection?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Text preprocessing → Prompt construction → LLM inference → Output parsing → Evaluation
- **Critical path**: Prompt construction → LLM inference → Output parsing → Evaluation
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Few-shot vs zero-shot: More examples improve performance but increase latency and cost
  - Model size vs efficiency: Larger models perform better but require more resources
  - CoT vs IO: CoT may help reasoning tasks but harms sarcasm detection
- **Failure signatures**:
  - High false negative rate: Model misses sarcastic instances (may indicate insufficient pattern recognition)
  - High false positive rate: Model incorrectly flags non-sarcastic text (may indicate over-reliance on common sarcastic patterns)
  - Inconsistent performance across datasets: Model may not generalize well to different sarcasm types
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Compare zero-shot vs few-shot performance on a single dataset with varying numbers of demonstrations
  2. Test CoT prompting on a logical reasoning task vs sarcasm detection to validate mechanism 3
  3. Fine-tune a smaller LLM on sarcasm data and compare against GPT-4 to test mechanism 1

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question**: How would more refined prompting methods (e.g., tree-based or graphical approaches) compare to standard prompting methods and chain-of-thought techniques for sarcasm detection?
- **Basis**: The authors explicitly state they only employed standard prompting methods and plan to investigate more refined approaches like tree-based or graphical methods in future work

- **Question**: How does the performance of LLMs on sarcasm detection vary across different contexts or domains?
- **Basis**: The authors mention the study did not consider variation in model performance on sarcasm across different contexts, suggesting future work could explore context processing mechanisms

- **Question**: What is the optimal number of demonstrations for few-shot learning in sarcasm detection tasks?
- **Basis**: The authors investigated the impact of demonstration numbers (k-shot) for GPT-4 and found optimal performance with 2-4 samples, but this was not systematically tested across all LLMs

## Limitations

- The study only evaluated three prompting approaches without exploring more sophisticated methods like tree-based or graphical prompting
- Limited analysis of how different types of sarcasm (verbal, situational, etc.) affect model performance across datasets
- No ablation studies to isolate the effect of parameter count from other factors contributing to GPT-4's superiority

## Confidence

- **High**: LLMs underperform supervised PLMs on sarcasm detection benchmarks; GPT-4 consistently outperforms other models
- **Medium**: Few-shot IO prompting is more effective than CoT for sarcasm detection
- **Low**: Mechanistic explanations for prompting method effectiveness and reasons for LLM underperformance

## Next Checks

1. Conduct controlled experiments varying only model size while keeping architecture constant to isolate the effect of parameter count on sarcasm detection performance
2. Test CoT prompting on both sarcasm detection and logical reasoning tasks to empirically validate whether the claimed difference in cognitive processes is reflected in actual performance
3. Fine-tune smaller LLMs on sarcasm-specific datasets and compare their performance to both GPT-4 and PLMs to determine if domain adaptation can close the performance gap
