# A Note on Bias to Complete

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.11710
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11710
- Authors: Jia Xu; Mona Diab
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Proposes a framework to define, quantify, and mitigate bias in LLMs by considering bias relative to dynamic contexts such as culture, time, and personal background.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for addressing bias in large language models by moving beyond static definitions to consider bias as relative to dynamic contexts. The authors propose eight bias hypotheses and five methodological approaches to tackle bias definition, quantification, data augmentation, mitigation, and mis(dis)information influence. By categorizing bias into eight types and emphasizing the importance of cultural, temporal, and personal contexts, the framework aims to create more equitable and fair language models that embrace a broader spectrum of perspectives.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a conceptual framework for defining, quantifying, and mitigating bias in LLMs through five key methods: bias definition using context tensors, bias quantification via social norms and connotations, data augmentation through machine translation, bias mitigation using instructive reinforcement learning, and analysis of mis(dis)information influence. The framework models bias as a function of dynamic contexts and proposes tensor factorization to capture the complex interplay between cultural, temporal, and personal factors. While the framework provides a comprehensive approach to understanding bias, it remains largely unimplemented with several critical gaps that limit its practical utility.

## Key Results
- Framework introduces eight bias hypotheses and five methods for addressing bias in LLMs
- Proposes bias definition relative to dynamic contexts (culture, time, personal background)
- Categorizes bias into eight types: context, language, connotation, position, data, algorithmic, topic, and blind spot
- Conceptual approach emphasizes relative bias over absolute bias definitions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Bias in LLMs can be mitigated by defining it relative to dynamic contexts rather than static definitions.
- Mechanism: The framework models bias as a function of cultural, temporal, and regional contexts, allowing for a more nuanced and adaptable understanding of bias.
- Core assumption: Bias is not absolute but depends on the context in which it is perceived.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We revisit the definition of bias by discovering new bias types (e.g., societal status) in dynamic environments and describe them relative to context, such as culture, region, time, and personal background."
  - [section] "We veer away from the assumption that bias is absolute, instead developing a notion of relative bias against sets of norms of cultural standards and time."
- Break condition: If the context tensor fails to capture the full range of relevant factors, the relative bias definition may not be accurate.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Bias quantification can be improved by considering social norms and connotations.
- Mechanism: The framework uses multilingual consensus, implication understanding, and geometric analysis on semantic and sentiment social norms to quantify bias.
- Core assumption: Bias can be measured more accurately by considering the social norm of the dynamic context and the connotations of language.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Measuring bias is challenging: first, quantifying bias lacks considering the social norm of the dynamic context; second, bias expressions can sometimes go through implicit language such as connotation."
  - [section] "First, we will quantify the bias using multilingual consensus, implication understanding, geometric analysis on semantic and sentiment social norms."
- Break condition: If the connotation understanding fails to capture the full range of implied meanings, the bias quantification may be incomplete.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Data augmentation can be used to create labeled bias datasets for LLM training.
- Mechanism: The framework uses machine translation to create synthetic bias data by viewing debiasing as a multilingual machine translation task.
- Core assumption: The correspondence between the intersectionality of contexts and language representation can be used to generate bias data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "While biased datasets are in high demand, obtaining labeled bias datasets can be complex due to privacy, cost, or legal considerations."
  - [section] "We will provide a novel approach to create labeled synthetic bias data by viewing debiasing as a multilingual machine translation task."
- Break condition: If the machine translation fails to accurately capture the nuances of bias across different languages, the generated data may not be effective.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Dynamic contexts
  - Why needed here: Understanding that bias is relative to context is crucial for developing a more accurate and adaptable bias framework.
  - Quick check question: Can you provide an example of how bias might be perceived differently in two different cultural contexts?

- Concept: Connotation understanding
  - Why needed here: Considering the connotations of language is essential for accurately quantifying bias, as bias can be expressed implicitly through connotations.
  - Quick check question: How might the connotation of a word differ between two different cultural contexts?

- Concept: Data augmentation
  - Why needed here: Creating labeled bias datasets is challenging, so data augmentation techniques can be used to generate synthetic data for LLM training.
  - Quick check question: What are some potential challenges in using machine translation for data augmentation in bias mitigation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Context Tensor Definition -> Bias Quantification -> Data Augmentation -> Bias Mitigation -> Mis(dis)information Analysis
- Critical path: Define bias relative to dynamic contexts → Quantify using social norms and connotations → Augment data using machine translation → Mitigate using instructive reinforcement learning → Analyze mis(dis)information influence
- Design tradeoffs: Complexity of modeling dynamic contexts vs. accuracy of bias quantification
- Failure signatures: Context tensor fails to capture relevant factors OR connotation understanding misses implied meanings OR machine translation doesn't capture cross-lingual bias nuances
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test framework's ability to accurately quantify bias in controlled environment with known biases
  2. Evaluate effectiveness of data augmentation technique in creating labeled bias datasets
  3. Assess framework's ability to mitigate bias in LLM using instructive reinforcement learning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the proposed framework effectively address all eight bias types (context, language, connotation, position, data, algorithmic, topic, and blind spot) simultaneously, or will there be trade-offs between different types of bias?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper proposes a framework with eight hypotheses and five methods to address bias in LLMs, but acknowledges that the realization of the framework is yet to be completed.
- Why unresolved: The framework is conceptual and has not been implemented or tested. It is unclear how the different methods for addressing various bias types will interact and whether they can be effectively combined without introducing new biases or trade-offs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing the framework and conducting experiments to measure its effectiveness in addressing all eight bias types simultaneously, while also evaluating any potential trade-offs or unintended consequences.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the proposed tensor factorization model for contextualized bias definition effectively capture and represent the complex interplay between multiple dynamic contexts (e.g., culture, region, time, personal background) and their impact on bias?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper proposes using tensor factorization to model the multi-faceted dynamic environment with relevant contexts as a means for grounding contrastive perspectives with a contextual backdrop.
- Why unresolved: The effectiveness of the tensor factorization model in capturing the nuanced and dynamic nature of contextual bias is yet to be demonstrated. It is unclear how well the model can handle the complexity and potential interactions between different contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments to evaluate the performance of the tensor factorization model in accurately capturing and representing contextual bias, using diverse datasets and contexts.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the proposed machine translation approach for data generation effectively create labeled synthetic bias data that is representative of real-world bias and generalizable across different languages and contexts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper proposes using machine translation to create labeled synthetic bias data by viewing debiasing as a multilingual machine translation task, considering the correspondence between the intersection of contexts and language representation as the source while implications and connotations rendered explicit are the target.
- Why unresolved: The effectiveness of the machine translation approach in generating realistic and representative synthetic bias data is yet to be validated. It is unclear whether the generated data will be generalizable across different languages and contexts, and whether it will capture the subtle nuances and implications of bias.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments to evaluate the quality and representativeness of the generated synthetic bias data, comparing it to real-world bias data and assessing its generalizability across different languages and contexts.

## Limitations

- Framework remains largely conceptual without implementation or validation
- Context tensor construction feasibility and effectiveness unproven
- Machine translation approach assumes perfect cross-lingual bias correspondence

## Confidence

High confidence: The identification of eight bias types and five methodological areas provides a useful taxonomy for thinking about bias in LLMs. The observation that bias is context-dependent and that current quantification methods have limitations is well-supported by existing literature.

Medium confidence: The conceptualization of relative bias and the proposed methods for quantification and mitigation represent reasonable extensions of current approaches, though they remain theoretical. The framework's components are logically coherent even if unproven.

Low confidence: The practical implementation of the framework, particularly the context tensor construction, machine translation-based data augmentation, and instructive reinforcement learning for mitigation, lacks sufficient detail or validation to support claims of effectiveness.

## Next Checks

1. Construct a minimal working prototype of the context tensor for a specific domain (e.g., gender bias in job descriptions) and validate whether it captures meaningful variations across different cultural contexts using human evaluation.

2. Conduct a controlled experiment testing whether machine translation can successfully transfer bias annotations across languages while preserving semantic meaning, using a small set of manually annotated examples.

3. Implement a simplified version of the bias quantification method using existing datasets and compare its performance against established bias metrics to assess whether considering social norms and connotations provides measurable improvement.
