# Sentiment analysis in non-fixed length audios using a Fully Convolutional Neural Network

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.02184
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02184
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Fully convolutional neural network (FCN) achieves 75.28%, 92.71%, and 99.03% accuracy on RAVDESS, EMODB, and TESS datasets respectively for emotion recognition in variable-length audio.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) for emotion recognition in variable-length audio, eliminating the need for fixed-length preprocessing. The model uses Mel spectrogram and MFCC features, with MFCC yielding superior results. Validated on three widely-used datasets (RAVDESS, EMODB, TESS), the FCN demonstrates state-of-the-art performance while supporting near real-time sentiment tracking and speaker-independent emotion detection. The variable-input capability makes it suitable for applications such as call centers, medical consultations, and financial brokers.

## Method Summary
The proposed FCN architecture processes variable-length audio by using convolutional layers with global average pooling to produce fixed-size outputs regardless of input duration. Audio features are extracted as Mel spectrograms and MFCC (first 100 coefficients). The model consists of three convolutional layers (64 filters with kernels 7×11, 11×7, and 1×1), dropout for regularization, and softmax output for classification. Training uses Adam optimizer, categorical crossentropy loss, 10k epochs with early stopping, and Monte Carlo cross-validation (5 folds, 80/20 split).

## Key Results
- FCN achieves 75.28% mean accuracy on RAVDESS dataset (8 emotions, English)
- FCN achieves 92.71% mean accuracy on EMODB dataset (7 emotions, German)
- FCN achieves 99.03% mean accuracy on TESS dataset (7 emotions, English)
- MFCC features outperform Mel spectrograms across all datasets
- Model demonstrates near real-time capability through variable-length processing

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: FCN accepts variable-length audio without resizing or zero-padding
- Mechanism: Convolutional layers process fixed-size kernels independently of input length, producing feature maps whose size scales with input. Global pooling then reduces each feature map to a single scalar, producing fixed-size output regardless of input duration.
- Core assumption: No fully connected layers; global pooling summarizes variable-length feature maps into fixed-size vector.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The FCN accepts audio of any size, avoiding the need for fixed-length preprocessing."
  - [section]: "With this layer, we can determine the output size of our neural network to match it with the number of classes to train a classification problem regardless of the input size."
  - [corpus]: Weak correlation with audio classification papers; corpus mostly contains spectral/rhythm feature papers, not variable-length architectures.
- Break condition: Adding fully connected layers re-introduces fixed-size requirement.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: MFCC features outperform Mel spectrograms for emotion recognition in this FCN
- Mechanism: MFCC coefficients capture perceptually relevant spectral envelope information with fewer coefficients, reducing noise and redundancy, which aligns better with the FCN's capacity to learn discriminative patterns from compact feature maps.
- Core assumption: Perceptual relevance of MFCC coefficients outweighs raw spectral detail captured by Mel spectrograms in this classification task.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Mel spectrogram and MFCC are used to represent audio, with MFCC yielding the best results."
  - [section]: "MFCC features are also used in [14]... The calculation of the MFCC includes the following steps: segment the audio file into small sections, apply the discrete Fourier transform... and finally the first N coefficients are selected."
  - [corpus]: No strong evidence; corpus papers focus on spectral features but not MFCC vs Mel spectrogram comparison in FCN context.
- Break condition: Task requires fine-grained spectral detail where Mel spectrograms preserve more information.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Monte Carlo cross-validation ensures generalization across datasets
- Mechanism: Repeated random train/test splits (80/20) over 5 iterations reduce variance in performance estimates, accounting for dataset imbalance and speaker variability.
- Core assumption: Random splits adequately sample the distribution of classes and speakers; no systematic bias in sampling.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "A Monte Carlo cross validation has been carried out in order to ensure generalization. We have split the dataset into 5 different subsets with an 80 – 20 distribution for training and testing."
  - [abstract]: "The results have been validated using three well known datasets: EMODB, RAVDESS, and TESS."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; corpus contains audio classification papers but no explicit mention of Monte Carlo validation.
- Break condition: Very small datasets where 80/20 splits produce unrepresentative training sets.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC)
  - Why needed here: MFCC provides compact, perceptually relevant audio features that the FCN can efficiently process.
  - Quick check question: What are the main steps to compute MFCC from an audio signal?

- Concept: Fully convolutional neural networks (FCN)
  - Why needed here: FCN architecture enables processing of variable-length inputs without resizing, critical for real-time sentiment analysis.
  - Quick check question: How does global pooling in an FCN allow variable-length input to produce fixed-size output?

- Concept: Global average pooling vs. global max pooling
  - Why needed here: Global average pooling summarizes each feature map by its mean, producing stable, size-invariant outputs; max pooling might be too sensitive to outliers in audio classification.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between global average pooling and global max pooling in terms of output behavior?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input (variable-length audio features) -> Conv2D (64 filters, 7×11 kernel) -> Conv2D (64 filters, 11×7 kernel) -> Conv2D (num_classes filters, 1×1 kernel) -> Dropout -> GlobalAveragePooling2D -> Softmax

- Critical path:
  1. Feature extraction (MFCC/Mel spectrogram) → variable-size tensor
  2. Conv layers → variable-size feature maps
  3. Global pooling → fixed-size vector
  4. Softmax → class probabilities

- Design tradeoffs:
  - FCN vs. CNN+FC: FCN supports variable-length input but may require more careful regularization.
  - MFCC vs. Mel spectrogram: MFCC more compact but may lose spectral detail; Mel spectrogram preserves more detail but larger input.
  - Dropout placement: After conv layers to prevent overfitting without disrupting global pooling.

- Failure signatures:
  - Vanishing gradients if kernel sizes too large relative to feature map size.
  - Overfitting if dropout rate too low or dataset too small.
  - Poor generalization if train/test splits not representative (Monte Carlo helps detect this).

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train FCN with MFCC features on RAVDESS, evaluate accuracy and confusion matrix.
  2. Replace MFCC with Mel spectrogram, compare accuracy and confusion patterns.
  3. Implement real-time split evaluation: divide neutral class audio into 3 and 6 segments, observe prediction stability.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the FCN's variable-input capability impact its performance compared to fixed-size models in real-time sentiment tracking scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights that the FCN can accept audio of any length, enabling near real-time sentiment tracking and speaker-independent emotion detection.
- Why unresolved: While the paper mentions the advantage of variable input size, it does not provide a detailed comparison of the FCN's performance in real-time tracking versus fixed-size models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing the FCN's real-time tracking performance with fixed-size models on datasets with varying audio lengths.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of using different feature extraction methods (e.g., Mel spectrogram vs. MFCC) on the FCN's performance across diverse emotional datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares the performance of Mel spectrogram and MFCC on three datasets (RAVDESS, EMODB, TESS), showing MFCC generally outperforms Mel spectrogram.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore how these feature extraction methods might affect the FCN's performance on other emotional datasets or in different languages.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies using the FCN with different feature extraction methods on a broader range of emotional datasets, including multilingual datasets.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the FCN architecture handle overlapping emotions in audio, and what is its accuracy in distinguishing between closely related emotional states?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions the FCN's ability to identify secondary emotions in near real-time evaluation, suggesting some capability to handle overlapping emotions.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the FCN's performance in distinguishing between closely related emotional states, such as neutral vs. sad or happy vs. angry.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed confusion matrix analysis and accuracy metrics for closely related emotional states across different datasets.

## Limitations
- Architectural specifics like dropout rate and early stopping patience threshold are not fully detailed, affecting reproducibility
- Comparison between MFCC and Mel spectrogram lacks ablation studies to confirm FCN's variable-length processing is the key differentiator
- Monte Carlo validation approach doesn't explicitly address potential class imbalance issues across datasets

## Confidence

- FCN variable-length processing mechanism: High - Well-supported by architectural description and consistent with CNN theory
- MFCC outperforming Mel spectrogram in this FCN: Medium - Results show superiority, but lack comparative ablation studies with other architectures
- Near real-time sentiment tracking capability: Medium - Supported by architecture, but real-time performance metrics not explicitly provided

## Next Checks

1. Implement ablation study comparing FCN with global pooling versus FCN with fully connected layers to quantify variable-length input benefits
2. Conduct cross-dataset validation where models trained on one dataset are tested on another to assess generalization across languages and recording conditions
3. Measure inference latency on CPU and GPU for different audio segment lengths to empirically validate near real-time processing claims
