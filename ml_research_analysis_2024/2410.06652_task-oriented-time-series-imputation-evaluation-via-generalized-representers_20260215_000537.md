# Task-oriented Time Series Imputation Evaluation via Generalized Representers

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2410.06652
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06652
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Introduces task-oriented time series imputation evaluation that estimates imputation impact on downstream forecasting without retraining models

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of evaluating time series imputation methods for downstream forecasting tasks without the computational burden of retraining models. The proposed approach estimates the impact of different imputation strategies on forecasting performance using first-order Taylor expansion approximations. By focusing on how imputed labels affect forecasting performance at each time step, the method provides an efficient way to evaluate and combine imputation methods. The approach includes an accelerated calculation method to reduce computational cost while maintaining performance.

## Method Summary
The method combines time series imputation with neural network models to estimate the gain of different imputation strategies without retraining. It uses first-order Taylor expansion to approximate how imputed values affect downstream predictions, computing gradients of loss with respect to predictions and predictions with respect to labels. The approach can combine multiple imputation strategies by selecting the best imputed value at each time step based on estimated gains. An accelerated computation method assumes smooth output variability across time steps and compresses the output space using basis functions to reduce computational cost.

## Key Results
- The proposed method can improve forecasting performance by selectively combining imputation strategies based on their estimated impact
- Experiments on six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the task-oriented evaluation approach
- The accelerated calculation method achieves a good balance between performance and efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: The method estimates imputation impact on forecasting without retraining using first-order Taylor expansion.
- **Mechanism**: Computes gradients of loss with respect to predictions and predictions with respect to labels, then multiplies by differences between imputation strategies.
- **Core assumption**: Imputed values are close enough for first-order approximation to be valid.
- **Evidence anchors**: Abstract mentions combining imputation with neural networks; Section 2.2 describes retrain-free method.
- **Break condition**: First-order approximation fails when imputed values from different methods are too far apart.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: The method can combine different imputation strategies to create better overall imputation.
- **Mechanism**: Estimates gain for each imputation at each time step, then selects the value with positive gain at each step.
- **Core assumption**: Estimated gains accurately reflect true impact on downstream performance.
- **Evidence anchors**: Abstract mentions efficient way to combine imputation methods; Section 2.5 describes combining imputations.
- **Break condition**: Inaccurate estimated gains or missing temporal interactions between time steps.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Accelerated calculation reduces computational cost while maintaining performance.
- **Mechanism**: Assumes smooth model outputs across time steps that can be approximated by low-dimensional basis functions.
- **Core assumption**: Time series forecasting outputs are smooth and well-approximated by small number of basis functions.
- **Evidence anchors**: Section 2.3 describes output variability observation; Section 3.3.1 mentions block diagonal matrix simplification.
- **Break condition**: Time series outputs are not smooth or cannot be well-approximated by chosen basis functions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: First-order Taylor expansion
  - **Why needed here**: Used to approximate effect of label perturbations on model predictions without retraining.
  - **Quick check question**: What is the first-order Taylor expansion of a function f(x) around a point x₀?

- **Concept**: Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)
  - **Why needed here**: Used to compute similarity between model outputs for different inputs.
  - **Quick check question**: What is the Neural Tangent Kernel and how is it computed?

- **Concept**: Gradient-based attribution methods
  - **Why needed here**: The method uses gradients to estimate impact of each imputed value on downstream performance.
  - **Quick check question**: How do gradient-based attribution methods work and what are their limitations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Imputation methods -> Gain estimation (Taylor expansion + NTK) -> Ensemble selection -> Accelerated computation
- **Critical path**: Gain estimation component, as it drives the entire evaluation and combination process
- **Design tradeoffs**: Accuracy vs. computational efficiency through first-order approximation and basis function compression
- **Failure signatures**: Poor correlation between estimated and actual gains; minimal improvement after combining strategies
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Verify first-order approximation on simple dataset with known ground truth
  2. Test accelerated calculation on dataset with smooth outputs
  3. Evaluate ensemble method on dataset with multiple imputation strategies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How can the proposed method be extended to handle other downstream tasks beyond forecasting, such as anomaly detection or classification?
- **Basis in paper**: Paper mentions focusing on forecasting tasks and suggests exploring other downstream tasks in the future.
- **Why unresolved**: Paper does not provide experimental results or theoretical analysis for other downstream tasks.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Conducting experiments on other downstream tasks like anomaly detection or classification and comparing results with the proposed method.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: How does the choice of kernel function in the generalized representer theorem affect the performance of the proposed method?
- **Basis in paper**: Paper mentions using Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) but does not explore impact of different kernel choices.
- **Why unresolved**: Paper does not provide comparative analysis of different kernel functions or their effects on method's performance.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Conducting experiments with different kernel functions and comparing their performance in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: How does the proposed method handle time series with non-stationary characteristics, such as trends or seasonality?
- **Basis in paper**: Paper does not discuss handling of non-stationary time series or provide experimental results on such data.
- **Why unresolved**: Paper focuses on stationary time series and does not address challenges posed by non-stationary data.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Conducting experiments on time series with trends or seasonality and analyzing performance of proposed method in such scenarios.

## Limitations

- The method's accuracy depends on the validity of first-order Taylor expansion approximations, which may break down when imputed values diverge significantly
- The assumption of smooth output variability across time steps may not hold for all time series domains and downstream models
- The ensemble approach that selects best-imputed values independently at each time step may miss important temporal dependencies

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The overall framework combining task-oriented evaluation with imputation strategy selection is methodologically sound and addresses a genuine gap in time series imputation research
- **Medium Confidence**: The first-order approximation mechanism is theoretically valid but may have limited accuracy in practice depending on divergence between imputation strategies
- **Low Confidence**: The computational acceleration method's effectiveness depends heavily on smoothness of forecasting outputs, which varies across datasets and may not generalize well

## Next Checks

1. **Approximation Validity Test**: Systematically vary the degree of missingness and measure how correlation between estimated and actual gains degrades as imputed values from different strategies become more divergent
2. **Smoothness Verification**: Quantify smoothness of forecasting outputs across different datasets and downstream models to validate basis function compression assumption
3. **Temporal Dependency Analysis**: Evaluate whether ensemble method that selects best-imputed values independently at each time step performs worse than methods accounting for temporal dependencies in imputation process
