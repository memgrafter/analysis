# It's Not You, It's Me: The Impact of Choice Models and Ranking Strategies on Gender Imbalance in Music Recommendation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.03781
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03781
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Algorithmic re-ranking strategies have a greater impact on improving gender fairness in music recommendations than user choice models.

## Executive Summary
This study examines how different re-ranking strategies and user choice models affect gender fairness in music recommendations over repeated retraining cycles. Using a simulation with the LFM-2b dataset, researchers tested three re-ranking methods (MoveUp, λ5/λ7, and FAIR) and four user choice models (Deterministic, Random, InspectionAbandon, and Biased) across two base recommendation models (IALS and BPR). The results show that re-ranking strategies have a significantly greater impact on improving gender fairness than user choice models, with λ7 being the most effective. The base recommendation model also matters, with IALS providing more stable and equitable results compared to BPR. The findings indicate that algorithmic interventions, rather than user behavior, are key to breaking feedback loops that perpetuate gender imbalance in music recommendations.

## Method Summary
The researchers conducted a simulation study using the LFM-2b dataset (2013-2020) with artist gender information from MusicBrainz.org. They filtered to solo artists with known gender (female, male, nonbinary) and split into 90% training and 10% test sets. The study employed two base recommendation models (IALS and BPR), three re-ranking strategies (MoveUp, λ5/λ7, FAIR), and four user choice models (Deterministic, Random, InspectionAbandon, and Biased). The simulation ran for 5 retraining iterations on augmented data, measuring First-Position Exposure (P_F_A), Overall Exposure Fairness (AWRF), and diversity (Gini coefficient @10).

## Key Results
- Re-ranking strategies have a significantly greater impact on improving gender fairness than user choice models
- λ7 re-ranking strategy is the most effective in improving gender fairness metrics
- IALS base recommendation model provides more stable and equitable results compared to BPR

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Algorithmic re-ranking strategies have a greater impact on improving gender fairness in music recommendations than user choice models.
- Mechanism: Re-ranking strategies directly manipulate the recommendation list order, overriding the inherent biases in the base recommendation model. This post-processing step ensures that items by underrepresented groups (female artists) are promoted to higher positions, thereby increasing their exposure and likelihood of being selected by users.
- Core assumption: The position of items in the recommendation list significantly influences user selection behavior, and users are more likely to choose items from higher positions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We find re-ranking strategies have a greater effect than user choice models on recommendation fairness over time."
  - [section] "Fig. 1 clearly indicates that the re-ranking strategy determines the position of the first female artist, whereas the user choice model does not impact the ranking position of the first female artist."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence: No directly related studies found in corpus search.
- Break condition: If users consistently ignore the promoted items and select items based on their inherent preferences rather than position, the effectiveness of re-ranking strategies would diminish.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The base recommendation model (IALS vs. BPR) influences the stability and effectiveness of fairness interventions.
- Mechanism: Different recommendation algorithms generate rankings with varying levels of inherent bias. IALS provides more stable and equitable results compared to BPR, likely due to its implicit feedback approach and alternating least squares optimization, which may be less susceptible to popularity bias.
- Core assumption: The choice of recommendation algorithm impacts the initial ranking's bias, which in turn affects the effectiveness of subsequent re-ranking strategies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "IALS-based recommendations had more stable gender exposure balance."
  - [section] "IALS is more stable than BPR, showing almost no variation across iterations or choice models."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence: No directly related studies found in corpus search.
- Break condition: If the inherent bias in the base model is too strong, even effective re-ranking strategies may not be able to overcome it, leading to persistent unfairness.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The feedback loop between user interactions and model retraining perpetuates and can amplify existing biases in music recommendations.
- Mechanism: As the recommendation model is retrained on user interaction data, it learns and reinforces the patterns present in that data. If the initial recommendations are biased, the subsequent user interactions will also be biased, leading to a feedback loop that amplifies the existing bias over time.
- Core assumption: The data used to retrain the model accurately reflects user preferences, and these preferences are influenced by the recommendations they receive.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "As recommender systems are prone to various biases, mitigation approaches are needed to ensure that recommendations are fair to various stakeholders."
  - [section] "Real recommender systems, however, are iterative systems with a feedback loop between the system and its users."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence: No directly related studies found in corpus search.
- Break condition: If the feedback loop is broken by introducing external interventions (e.g., re-ranking strategies) or if users' preferences evolve independently of the recommendations, the bias amplification effect would be mitigated.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Collaborative filtering algorithms (e.g., IALS, BPR)
  - Why needed here: Understanding how these algorithms generate recommendations is crucial for analyzing their inherent biases and the effectiveness of re-ranking strategies.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between implicit and explicit feedback in collaborative filtering, and how does it affect the choice of algorithm?

- Concept: Re-ranking strategies for fairness (e.g., MoveUp, λ5/λ7, FAIR)
  - Why needed here: These strategies are the primary intervention used to improve gender fairness in the recommendations, and understanding their mechanisms is essential for evaluating their effectiveness.
  - Quick check question: How does the FAIR algorithm ensure statistical significance in the representation of protected groups, and what are its limitations?

- Concept: User choice models (e.g., Deterministic, Random, InspectionAbandon, Biased)
  - Why needed here: These models simulate how users interact with the recommendations, and understanding their behavior is crucial for analyzing the feedback loop and the overall effectiveness of fairness interventions.
  - Quick check question: How does the InspectionAbandon model capture the position bias in user behavior, and what are its implications for recommendation fairness?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Base models (IALS, BPR) -> Re-ranking strategies (MoveUp, λ5/λ7, FAIR) -> User choice models (Deterministic, Random, InspectionAbandon, Biased) -> Simulation environment (LensKit, PyTorch) -> Evaluation metrics (P_F_A, AWRF, Gini coefficients)
- Critical path: 1. Generate initial recommendations using base models. 2. Apply re-ranking strategies to improve fairness. 3. Simulate user interactions using choice models. 4. Retrain models on augmented data. 5. Repeat steps 1-4 for multiple iterations. 6. Evaluate fairness metrics over time.
- Design tradeoffs: Computational cost vs. simulation fidelity: More iterations and users increase realism but also increase runtime. Simplicity vs. realism of choice models: Complex models better capture user behavior but may be harder to interpret and debug. Metric selection: Choosing metrics that accurately reflect fairness while being computationally efficient.
- Failure signatures: Persistent bias despite re-ranking: Indicates that the re-ranking strategies are not strong enough or the base model is too biased. Increased bias over iterations: Suggests that the feedback loop is amplifying existing biases, and more aggressive interventions are needed. Inconsistent results across runs: May indicate sensitivity to randomness in training or insufficient data.
- First 3 experiments: 1. Compare the effectiveness of different re-ranking strategies (MoveUp, λ5/λ7, FAIR) on P_F_A and AWRF metrics. 2. Analyze the impact of user choice models (Deterministic, Random, InspectionAbandon, Biased) on the stability of fairness interventions over multiple iterations. 3. Evaluate the influence of base recommendation models (IALS, BPR) on the overall fairness and diversity of recommendations, both with and without re-ranking strategies.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do intersectional effects manifest when artists belong to multiple marginalized groups, and how can these effects be quantified in music recommendation fairness studies?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly mentions that examining intersectional impacts on artists belonging to multiple marginalized groups is an important future research direction.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on gender as the primary dimension of fairness and does not include intersectional analysis due to data limitations and methodological complexity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Studies incorporating additional dimensions such as race, ethnicity, or genre alongside gender, with sufficient sample sizes to enable intersectional analysis.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent does the volatility observed in BPR-based recommendation models result from sensitivity to training data versus inherent algorithmic instability?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that it is unclear whether BPR's volatility is a response to user data or noise and sensitivity to randomness in training, and calls this an important future research direction.
- Why unresolved: The study only ran each simulation once, making it impossible to distinguish between data-driven changes and random variation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Repeated simulation runs with different random seeds and systematic analysis of variance sources to isolate algorithmic sensitivity from data effects.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can sample-efficient methods be developed to identify sources of noise and variance in recommender system simulation studies?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies the need for developing sample-efficient ways of identifying sources of noise in recommender system simulation as an important future research direction.
- Why unresolved: Current simulation approaches are computationally expensive, requiring multiple full runs to distinguish between algorithmic behavior and random variation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of statistical methods that can reliably estimate variance sources from fewer simulation runs, potentially using techniques from experimental design or active learning.

## Limitations

- The study relies on a single dataset (LFM-2b) and controlled simulation environment, limiting generalizability to real-world scenarios.
- The assumption that position-based user choice models accurately reflect real user behavior introduces uncertainty in the interpretation of results.
- The study does not account for intersectional factors beyond gender or examine long-term effects beyond five retraining iterations.

## Confidence

- Algorithmic interventions vs user behavior: High
- Effectiveness of λ7 re-ranking strategy: High
- Generalizability to real-world scenarios: Medium
- Accuracy of user choice model assumptions: Medium

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the study using multiple music streaming datasets to verify the robustness of findings across different user populations and listening patterns.
2. Implement an A/B test in a live music recommendation system to validate simulation results in real-world conditions with actual user behavior.
3. Extend the simulation to include intersectional fairness metrics (e.g., combining gender with age, location, or genre preferences) to assess whether current re-ranking strategies maintain fairness across multiple dimensions.
