# Aligning Knowledge Graphs Provided by Humans and Generated from Neural Networks in Specific Tasks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.16884
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16884
- Authors: Tangrui Li; Jun Zhou
- Reference count: 32
- Key outcome: Novel method aligns human-provided and network-generated knowledge graphs using VSA and bipartite matching, achieving 97.2% MNIST classification accuracy while discovering new concepts.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach to bridge the gap between symbolic knowledge provided by humans and the distributed representations learned by neural networks. The method leverages a variation of autoencoder architecture combined with Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) to extract concept-level knowledge from neural network vectors. By aligning these concepts with human knowledge through bipartite matching, the approach enables the integration of symbolic AI and logical knowledge bases with neural network training and interpretability.

The experimental results on MNIST demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, achieving high classification accuracy while consistently capturing network-generated concepts that closely align with human knowledge. Moreover, the approach uncovers new, useful concepts not previously identified by humans, enhancing the transparency and reasoning capabilities of neural networks. This work represents a significant step towards more interpretable and explainable AI systems that can leverage both human expertise and neural network learning.

## Method Summary
The proposed method introduces a novel approach to generate and utilize knowledge graphs from neural networks, addressing the challenge of aligning network-generated knowledge with human-provided knowledge. The method employs a variation of the autoencoder architecture and Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) to convert neural network vectors into concept-level knowledge. By aligning these concepts with human knowledge through a bipartite matching algorithm, the approach enables the direct application of symbolic AI and logical knowledge bases to enhance neural network training and interpretability. Experiments on MNIST demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, achieving a 97.2% classification accuracy and consistently capturing network-generated concepts that closely align with human knowledge. The approach also uncovers new, useful concepts not previously identified by humans, enhancing the transparency and reasoning capabilities of neural networks.

## Key Results
- Achieved 97.2% classification accuracy on MNIST dataset
- Successfully captured network-generated concepts that closely align with human knowledge
- Uncovered new, useful concepts not previously identified by humans, enhancing neural network transparency and reasoning capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging the representational power of neural networks and the interpretability of symbolic knowledge. The autoencoder architecture with VSA enables the extraction of high-level concepts from distributed neural representations. These concepts are then aligned with human-provided knowledge through bipartite matching, creating a bridge between the two knowledge sources. This alignment allows for the integration of symbolic reasoning and logical inference with neural network predictions, enhancing both interpretability and performance.

## Foundational Learning
1. Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) - Needed for representing and manipulating symbolic concepts in a vector space, enabling the extraction of high-level concepts from neural network representations. Quick check: Verify that VSA can effectively capture semantic relationships between concepts in the neural network's feature space.

2. Autoencoder Architecture - Required to learn a compressed representation of neural network activations and reconstruct them from VSA-encoded concepts. Quick check: Ensure the autoencoder can accurately reconstruct neural network outputs from the VSA-encoded concepts.

3. Bipartite Matching Algorithm - Essential for aligning the extracted network concepts with human-provided knowledge, establishing correspondences between the two knowledge sources. Quick check: Validate that the matching algorithm can consistently identify correct alignments between network-generated and human concepts.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component Map: Neural Network -> Autoencoder -> VSA Encoder -> Concept Extraction -> Bipartite Matching -> Aligned Knowledge Graph

Critical Path: Neural Network outputs -> Autoencoder bottleneck -> VSA encoding -> Concept extraction -> Bipartite matching with human knowledge -> Aligned knowledge graph

Design Tradeoffs:
- Accuracy vs. Interpretability: The method aims to balance the high performance of neural networks with the interpretability of symbolic knowledge.
- Complexity vs. Scalability: The approach introduces additional computational overhead but enables the integration of symbolic reasoning.
- Abstraction Level: Choosing the appropriate level of concept abstraction for effective alignment between network and human knowledge.

Failure Signatures:
- Poor concept extraction leading to misaligned knowledge graphs
- Inability to discover meaningful new concepts beyond human-provided knowledge
- Scalability issues when dealing with larger, more complex datasets

First Experiments:
1. Evaluate concept extraction quality on a simple dataset (e.g., MNIST) to establish baseline performance and alignment accuracy.
2. Test the approach on a more complex dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10) to assess scalability and robustness across different domains.
3. Implement the method in a real-world application scenario (e.g., medical diagnosis) to evaluate practical utility and identify potential limitations.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The approach relies heavily on VSA representation and assumes reliable concept extraction from neural network intermediate layers, which may not hold for complex datasets.
- The method's dependence on specific autoencoder architecture variations could limit generalizability across different neural network types and tasks.
- The bipartite matching algorithm for concept alignment may face scalability challenges with larger knowledge graphs or ambiguous concept mappings.

## Confidence
- Concept extraction from neural networks: Medium
- Alignment accuracy with human knowledge: Medium
- Discovery of novel concepts: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the approach on more complex datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, ImageNet) to assess scalability and robustness across different domains and task complexities.

2. Conduct ablation studies to determine the impact of different VSA hyperparameters and autoencoder architectures on concept extraction quality and alignment accuracy.

3. Implement the method in a real-world application scenario, such as medical diagnosis or autonomous driving, to test its practical utility and identify potential limitations in complex, safety-critical environments.
