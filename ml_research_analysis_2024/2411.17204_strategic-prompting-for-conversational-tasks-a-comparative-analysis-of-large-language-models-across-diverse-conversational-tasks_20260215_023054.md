# Strategic Prompting for Conversational Tasks: A Comparative Analysis of Large Language Models Across Diverse Conversational Tasks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.17204
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17204
- Reference count: 12
- No single model emerges as universally optimal for all conversational tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of five large language models (LLMs) - Llama, OPT, Falcon, Alpaca, and MPT - across five conversational tasks: reservation, empathetic response generation, mental health and legal counseling, persuasion, and negotiation. The study employs both automatic and human evaluation metrics to assess model performance. Results show that no single model is universally optimal across all tasks, with task-specific performance varying significantly. The evaluation reveals that while some models demonstrate strong performance in specific tasks, they may struggle with others, emphasizing the importance of considering task-specific requirements when selecting an LLM for conversational applications.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates five LLMs across five conversational tasks using zero-shot, one-shot, and two-shot prompting strategies. Models are assessed using both automatic metrics (BLEU, METEOR, BERTScore, etc.) and task-specific metrics (INFORM, SUCCESS, NegStr, BarStr, Con, Pol, Emp, PerStr, EmoPr). Human evaluation is conducted using Likert scales for fluency, context relevance, non-repetitiveness, counseling strategy correctness, politeness, and empathy. The experimental pipeline involves data preparation, prompt generation, model execution across different prompting strategies, automatic metric computation, human evaluation, and results aggregation.

## Key Results
- No single model emerges as universally optimal across all five conversational tasks
- Task-specific performance varies significantly, with Llama2 excelling in MultiWOZ while Falcon performs best on Craigslist Bargain
- Few-shot prompting significantly improves model performance across all tasks and models, with one-shot often providing the largest boost

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Different LLMs perform optimally on different conversational tasks, with no single model excelling across all domains.
- Mechanism: Task-specific requirements interact uniquely with each model's architecture and training data, creating performance trade-offs that favor different models for different tasks.
- Core assumption: The performance differences observed are due to genuine task-model interactions rather than random variation or implementation artifacts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] states "no single model emerges as universally optimal for all tasks" and "their performance varies significantly depending on the specific requirements of each task"
  - [section 5.3] provides detailed performance breakdowns showing Llama2 excelling in MultiWOZ while Falcon performs best on Craigslist Bargain
- Break condition: If performance differences disappear when controlling for prompt quality, few-shot examples, or other implementation factors.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Few-shot prompting significantly improves model performance across all tasks and models, with one-shot often providing the largest boost.
- Mechanism: Providing examples helps LLMs understand task expectations and format, bridging the gap between general language understanding and task-specific execution.
- Core assumption: The performance gains from few-shot examples reflect genuine learning of task patterns rather than just template matching.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.2] notes "Most of the models performed quite great in terms of fluency but were unable to retain the contextual consistency similarly" when comparing zero-shot to few-shot performance
  - [section 4.2.2] describes the prompting structure including few-shot examples for each task
- Break condition: If performance gains are primarily due to longer prompts rather than the specific examples provided.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Task-specific metrics are more meaningful than generic automatic metrics for evaluating conversational agent performance.
- Mechanism: Generic metrics like BLEU and BERTScore measure surface-level similarity, while task-specific metrics capture domain-relevant capabilities like counseling strategy, negotiation success, or empathy generation.
- Core assumption: The gold responses used for generic metric comparison represent the only valid responses, which may not hold for open-ended conversational tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.2] states "we give much higher importance to the task-specific metrics and the human evaluation metrics over the Generic Automatic evaluation metrics"
  - [section 4.1.2] details various task-specific metrics like INFORM, SUCCESS, NegStr, and EmoPr
- Break condition: If task-specific metrics show the same ranking as generic metrics across all models and tasks.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Prompt engineering and few-shot learning
  - Why needed here: The study relies heavily on different prompting strategies (zero-shot, one-shot, two-shot) to elicit model performance, making understanding prompt design crucial for replicating or extending the work
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a system prompt and few-shot examples in the context of this evaluation framework?

- Concept: Task-specific evaluation metrics
  - Why needed here: The evaluation uses specialized metrics like INFORM, SUCCESS, NegStr, and EmoPr that require understanding of both the task domain and how to measure success in that domain
  - Quick check question: How does the SUCCESS metric for MultiWOZ differ from a simple entity matching approach?

- Concept: Human evaluation methodology for conversational AI
  - Why needed here: The study employs human evaluators with specific Likert scales and criteria, requiring understanding of how to design and conduct reliable human evaluations of AI-generated responses
  - Quick check question: What are the three generic human evaluation metrics used, and what does each measure?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preparation and prompt generation -> Model execution across different prompting strategies -> Automatic metric computation using both generic and task-specific metrics -> Human evaluation pipeline with structured scoring -> Results aggregation and analysis framework

- Critical path: The most time-consuming path is human evaluation, which requires manual scoring of generated responses. This should be parallelized where possible and scheduled early in the evaluation cycle.

- Design tradeoffs: The choice to use zero-shot, one-shot, and two-shot prompting creates a combinatorial explosion of experiments but provides richer insights into model behavior. An alternative would be focusing on just one or two prompting strategies.

- Failure signatures: Poor performance on generic metrics but good performance on task-specific metrics suggests the model understands the task but generates responses that differ from gold responses in surface form. Conversely, good generic metrics but poor task-specific performance indicates the model is generating fluent but task-incorrect responses.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run a single model (e.g., Llama2) on one task (e.g., Empathetic Dialogues) with all three prompting strategies to verify the experimental pipeline works end-to-end
  2. Compare model outputs from two different LLMs on the same task and prompt to verify the evaluation framework can detect performance differences
  3. Run the human evaluation pipeline on a small subset of responses to verify the annotation guidelines and scoring process are clear and consistent

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific task characteristics determine which LLM will perform best across different conversational domains?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "no single model emerges as universally optimal for all tasks" and "performance varies significantly depending on the specific requirements of each task"
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies task-specific performance differences but doesn't provide a framework for predicting which model will excel in which task based on task characteristics.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic analysis mapping task features (e.g., required empathy level, negotiation complexity, factual accuracy demands) to model performance patterns across all evaluated tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the size and domain-specificity of training data affect LLM performance on specialized conversational tasks like mental health counseling?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates general-purpose LLMs on specialized tasks but doesn't explore how their training data composition impacts performance in these domains.
- Why unresolved: The study uses off-the-shelf models without analyzing their training data characteristics or comparing them to models fine-tuned on domain-specific data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative evaluation of base models versus models fine-tuned on task-specific data, showing performance differences correlated with training data domain coverage.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal balance between zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting for different types of conversational tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "no single model emerges as universally optimal for all tasks" and the study tests all three prompting approaches
- Why unresolved: While the paper evaluates all prompting strategies, it doesn't provide guidance on which strategy works best for which task types or why certain models benefit more from additional shots.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis showing task characteristics that predict optimal prompting strategy (e.g., task complexity, required creativity vs. factual accuracy) and model-specific responses to prompting approaches.

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses on five specific conversational tasks, which may not represent the full diversity of real-world applications
- Relies heavily on human judgment for several metrics, introducing potential subjectivity and inter-rater variability
- Few-shot examples used for prompting are not fully specified, making exact reproduction challenging

## Confidence
- Medium confidence in main claims due to the detailed performance breakdowns supporting the finding that no single model excels across all tasks
- The claim about few-shot prompting benefits is plausible but not definitively proven
- The assertion that task-specific metrics are more meaningful than generic ones is reasonable but lacks direct comparative evidence

## Next Checks
1. Conduct inter-rater reliability analysis on the human evaluation scores to quantify the consistency and potential bias in the manual assessments, particularly for subjective metrics like empathy and counseling strategy.

2. Systematically vary the few-shot examples and prompt structure to determine whether performance differences between models are consistent across different prompt formulations, addressing potential prompt sensitivity issues.

3. Evaluate the same models on an additional, held-out conversational task not included in the original study to assess whether the observed task-specific performance patterns generalize beyond the five tested domains.
