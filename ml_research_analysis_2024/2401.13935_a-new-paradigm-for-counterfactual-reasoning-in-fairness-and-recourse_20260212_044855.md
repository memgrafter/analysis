# A New Paradigm for Counterfactual Reasoning in Fairness and Recourse

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.13935
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13935
- Reference count: 6
- The paper introduces a new paradigm for counterfactual reasoning in fairness that examines alternate initial conditions while holding protected characteristics fixed, avoiding problematic interventions on demographic variables.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses fundamental limitations in existing counterfactual fairness approaches that require interventions on protected characteristics like race, which may be conceptually problematic or impractical. The authors introduce a new paradigm based on backtracking counterfactuals that examines alternate initial conditions while holding protected characteristics fixed. They define new technical notions of counterfactual opportunity and effort at both individual and group levels, and introduce corresponding discrimination criteria that do not rely on demographic interventions. The approach is demonstrated on synthetic hiring datasets and the law school dataset, showing that even random predictors can be "unfair" under their criteria when underlying opportunity distributions are imbalanced.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a framework for backtracking counterfactual reasoning that avoids interventions on protected characteristics by instead examining alternate initial conditions. They define individual and group-level notions of counterfactual opportunity and effort, and introduce discrimination criteria based on these concepts. A simple algorithm is developed for sampling backtracking counterfactuals, which is evaluated on synthetic hiring datasets and the law school dataset. The framework provides a new perspective on fairness that focuses on opportunity distributions and the effort required to achieve outcomes, rather than on interventions that may be conceptually problematic or impractical.

## Key Results
- Introduces backtracking counterfactuals that examine alternate initial conditions while holding protected characteristics fixed
- Defines new technical notions of counterfactual opportunity and effort at individual and group levels
- Demonstrates that random predictors can be "unfair" under their criteria when underlying opportunity distributions are imbalanced
- Shows that the approach can identify fairness concerns without requiring interventions on protected characteristics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by shifting the counterfactual analysis from interventions on protected characteristics to examining alternate initial conditions. This approach captures the structural barriers and opportunity gaps that exist in society without requiring hypothetical interventions on demographic variables that may be conceptually problematic. By focusing on opportunity distributions and effort requirements, the method can identify fairness concerns that traditional approaches might miss, particularly in contexts where demographic interventions are not meaningful or actionable.

## Foundational Learning
- Counterfactual reasoning fundamentals: Understanding how to reason about alternate outcomes by intervening on variables in a causal model. Why needed: Forms the basis for all subsequent fairness analysis.
- Protected characteristics and fairness: Understanding the challenges of intervening on demographic variables. Quick check: Can identify scenarios where demographic interventions are problematic or impractical.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Protected Characteristics -> Initial Conditions -> Outcome Model -> Counterfactual Generation -> Fairness Criteria
Critical path: The key computation path involves generating backtracking counterfactuals by examining alternate initial conditions, then computing opportunity and effort metrics to evaluate fairness.
Design tradeoffs: The approach trades the ability to directly intervene on protected characteristics for conceptual validity and practical applicability in contexts where such interventions are problematic.
Failure signatures: The framework may fail to capture fairness concerns that specifically arise from discrimination based on protected characteristics, as it avoids interventions on these variables.
First experiments:
1. Generate backtracking counterfactuals for a simple synthetic dataset with known opportunity disparities
2. Compare opportunity distributions across groups in the law school dataset
3. Evaluate the computational efficiency of the counterfactual sampling algorithm on datasets of varying sizes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but several remain implicit in the work. The connection between the abstract notions of opportunity and effort-based fairness and actionable policy recommendations is not fully established. Additionally, the relationship between the proposed fairness criteria and existing legal frameworks for discrimination remains unclear.

## Limitations
- The framework may not capture fairness concerns that specifically arise from discrimination based on protected characteristics
- The connection between opportunity/effort metrics and actionable policy interventions is not fully established
- The current evaluation focuses on relatively small datasets, and scalability to industrial-scale problems remains unverified

## Confidence
High: Technical implementation of backtracking counterfactual sampling algorithm
Medium: Interpretation that random predictors can be "unfair" under opportunity-based criteria
Medium: Scalability and computational efficiency for large-scale deployment

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the backtracking counterfactual framework on real-world datasets with documented fairness concerns, comparing results against established fairness metrics and stakeholder-defined fairness criteria
2. Conduct user studies with domain experts and affected communities to assess whether the opportunity and effort-based fairness definitions align with practical notions of fairness and actionable intervention strategies
3. Benchmark the computational efficiency and scalability of the backtracking counterfactual sampling algorithm against existing counterfactual generation methods using datasets with 100K+ instances and high-dimensional feature spaces
