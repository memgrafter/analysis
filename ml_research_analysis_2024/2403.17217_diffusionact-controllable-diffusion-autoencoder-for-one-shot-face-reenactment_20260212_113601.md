# DiffusionAct: Controllable Diffusion Autoencoder for One-shot Face Reenactment

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17217

- One-line result: DiffusionAct achieves state-of-the-art face reenactment performance using a diffusion autoencoder approach without subject-specific fine-tuning

## Executive Summary
DiffusionAct introduces a novel diffusion autoencoder-based approach for one-shot face reenactment that addresses the limitations of existing GAN-based methods. The method leverages a pre-trained Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) and Diffusion Autoencoder (DiffAE) to enable controllable face reenactment by conditioning on target facial landmarks. This allows the model to preserve source identity while transferring target facial pose and expressions without requiring subject-specific fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on VoxCeleb1 and VoxCeleb2 datasets demonstrate that DiffusionAct outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher PSNR, SSIM, and better facial pose transfer metrics while producing artifact-free images.

## Method Summary
DiffusionAct uses a pre-trained DiffAE model consisting of a semantic encoder and DDIM decoder to perform one-shot face reenactment. The method introduces a reenactment encoder that conditions on target facial landmarks through zero convolution to predict a semantic code, which is then decoded by DDIM to generate the reenacted image. Training occurs in two stages: first pre-training the reenactment encoder using self-reenactment with ℓ1 loss between predicted and target semantic codes, then fine-tuning with reconstruction and pose transfer losses using a mixed batch of self-reenactment and image reconstruction tasks. The approach allows one-shot, self, and cross-subject reenactment without subject-specific fine-tuning while preserving identity and transferring target facial pose.

## Key Results
- Achieves PSNR of 19.7 and SSIM of 0.83 in self-reenactment, outperforming state-of-the-art methods (18.9 and 0.80 respectively)
- Better facial pose transfer metrics: APD of 7.2 vs 8.3 and AED of 43.7 vs 23.0 compared to best baseline
- Produces artifact-free images while faithfully reconstructing identity and appearance details
- Demonstrates effectiveness on VoxCeleb1, VoxCeleb2, HDTF, and VFHQ datasets without subject-specific fine-tuning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: DiffusionAct enables one-shot face reenactment without subject-specific fine-tuning by leveraging a pre-trained diffusion autoencoder.
- Mechanism: The method uses a reenactment encoder that conditions on target facial landmarks to predict a semantic code, which is then decoded by DDIM to generate the reenacted image. This allows the source identity to be preserved while transferring the target facial pose.
- Core assumption: A pre-trained diffusion autoencoder can be effectively controlled through conditioning on facial landmarks without extensive retraining.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "DiffusionAct introduces a diffusion autoencoder-based approach for one-shot face reenactment...without requiring subject-specific fine-tuning."
  - [section]: "Our method employs a pre-trained DiffAE [46], which consists of a semantic encoder and a DDIM sampler. The semantic encoder of DiffAE is able to encode an input image into a semantically meaningful code which can be used for image editing."
  - [corpus]: Found 25 related papers, suggesting the method is part of an active research area, though specific diffusion autoencoder methods for one-shot reenactment are not directly referenced.
- Break condition: If the semantic code predicted by the reenactment encoder does not accurately encode both the source identity and target facial pose, the generated images will not preserve identity or transfer pose correctly.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: DiffusionAct produces artifact-free images and faithfully reconstructs identity and appearance details compared to GAN-based methods.
- Mechanism: By using a diffusion autoencoder, DiffusionAct achieves near-perfect reconstruction of source images, avoiding the visual artifacts common in GAN-based methods. The conditioning on facial landmarks allows precise control over the generated facial pose.
- Core assumption: Diffusion models inherently produce higher quality, artifact-free images compared to GANs when conditioned appropriately.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "DiffusionAct outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher PSNR (19.7 vs. 18.9), SSIM (0.83 vs. 0.80)...DiffusionAct produces artifact-free images and faithfully reconstructs identity and appearance details."
  - [section]: "Our method allows one-shot, self, and cross-subject reenactment, without requiring subject-specific fine-tuning. We compare against state-of-the-art GAN-, StyleGAN2-, and diffusion-based methods, showing better or on-par reenactment performance."
  - [corpus]: The corpus includes papers on GAN-based methods and diffusion models, but does not provide specific evidence comparing artifact-free quality between these approaches in the context of face reenactment.
- Break condition: If the diffusion model fails to generalize well to diverse facial appearances or lighting conditions, the generated images may still contain artifacts or fail to faithfully reconstruct details.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: DiffusionAct achieves effective face reenactment by combining a pre-training stage with a main training stage that incorporates both self reenactment and image reconstruction tasks.
- Mechanism: The pre-training stage warms up the reenactment encoder to predict semantic codes under self-reenactment conditions. The main training stage then fine-tunes this encoder with reconstruction and pose transfer losses, using a mixed batch of self reenactment and image reconstruction pairs.
- Core assumption: A two-stage training process, with pre-training on self reenactment followed by fine-tuning with mixed tasks, improves the model's ability to preserve identity and transfer pose.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We report extensive quantitative and qualitative results...showing better or on-par reenactment performance."
  - [section]: "We propose a training protocol that involves both self reenactment and image reconstruction tasks...we show that this strategy further improves the reenactment performance."
  - [corpus]: The corpus does not provide direct evidence on the effectiveness of mixed-task training protocols for face reenactment, but it suggests this is an area of active research.
- Break condition: If the pre-training stage does not adequately prepare the reenactment encoder for the main training tasks, or if the mixed-task training protocol is not properly balanced, the model may not achieve optimal performance in preserving identity and transferring pose.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) and their application in image generation.
  - Why needed here: Understanding how DPMs work is crucial for grasping how DiffusionAct leverages these models for face reenactment.
  - Quick check question: How do DPMs iteratively transform noisy samples into target distributions, and why is this property useful for face reenactment?

- Concept: Diffusion Autoencoders (DiffAE) and their semantic encoding capabilities.
  - Why needed here: The DiffAE is a key component of DiffusionAct, providing the semantic encoder that maps images into meaningful codes for image editing.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the semantic encoder in DiffAE, and how does it enable image editing through the DDIM decoder?

- Concept: Conditioning mechanisms in generative models, specifically the use of facial landmarks for controlling generated images.
  - Why needed here: DiffusionAct conditions the reenactment encoder on target facial landmarks to control the generated facial pose, a critical aspect of its approach.
  - Quick check question: How does conditioning on facial landmarks influence the generation process in DiffusionAct, and what advantages does this offer over unconditional generation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input -> Facial landmark extraction (EMOCA + gaze network) -> Reenactment encoder (zero convolution conditioning) -> Semantic code -> DDIM decoder -> Output image

- Critical path:
  1. Extract facial landmarks and gaze direction from target image
  2. Condition reenactment encoder on target facial landmarks
  3. Predict reenacted semantic code encoding source identity and target facial pose
  4. Decode semantic code using DDIM to generate reenacted image

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using a pre-trained DiffAE allows leveraging existing models but may limit flexibility in adapting to specific datasets or tasks.
  - Conditioning on facial landmarks provides precise control over generated pose but requires accurate landmark extraction and may not capture all aspects of facial expression.

- Failure signatures:
  - Identity leakage from target to source in cross-subject reenactment
  - Visual artifacts or deformations in generated images
  - Poor transfer of target facial pose or expressions
  - Failure to reconstruct important appearance details (e.g., glasses, hair styles)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the reenactment encoder's ability to predict semantic codes under self-reenactment conditions using only the pre-training stage.
  2. Evaluate the main training stage's effectiveness by comparing reenactment performance with and without the mixed-task training protocol.
  3. Assess the impact of fine-tuning the DDIM decoder by comparing reenactment results with and without this step.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does DiffusionAct's performance scale with the number of diffusion steps used for image generation and encoding?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses ablation studies on diffusion steps (TxT for encoding and T for generation) and reports that TxT = 50 and T = 20 achieve optimal results, but further investigation into scalability and performance trade-offs is needed.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides results for specific step configurations but does not explore the full range of step values or their impact on computational efficiency and quality.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing performance metrics (PSNR, SSIM, etc.) and inference times across a wider range of diffusion steps, along with analysis of the trade-off between quality and speed.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can DiffusionAct generalize to other domains beyond face reenactment, such as full-body animation or non-human subjects?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on face reenactment using facial landmarks and poses, but the underlying diffusion autoencoder framework could potentially be adapted to other domains with appropriate conditioning mechanisms.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the applicability of DiffusionAct to other domains, leaving its generalization potential untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying DiffusionAct to other domains (e.g., full-body animation, animal faces) with suitable modifications to the conditioning mechanism and evaluation metrics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does DiffusionAct handle occlusions or extreme head poses that are not well-represented in the training data?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates DiffusionAct's effectiveness on challenging conditions like large head pose movements, but it does not explicitly address occlusions or extreme poses not seen during training.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide evidence or analysis of DiffusionAct's robustness to occlusions or extreme poses beyond the scope of the training data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing DiffusionAct on datasets with occlusions or extreme head poses, along with qualitative and quantitative analysis of its performance under these conditions.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What are the limitations of using facial landmarks as the primary conditioning mechanism, and can other modalities (e.g., audio) improve performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the use of facial landmarks and gaze direction as conditioning mechanisms, but acknowledges that other modalities like audio are not explored.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate the potential benefits or limitations of incorporating additional modalities beyond facial landmarks and gaze direction.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments incorporating other modalities (e.g., audio) into the conditioning mechanism and comparing performance metrics to the landmark-based approach.

## Limitations
- The paper relies heavily on comparison with GAN-based methods, with limited benchmarking against other diffusion-based approaches
- Specific implementation details of the zero-convolution conditioning mechanism and training hyperparameters are not fully specified
- The method's effectiveness on datasets with significant variations in image quality and lighting conditions remains untested

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The core mechanism of using a diffusion autoencoder for face reenactment is well-supported by the experimental results, particularly the superior PSNR (19.7 vs 18.9) and SSIM (0.83 vs 0.80) scores compared to baselines.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim of producing "artifact-free" images is supported by visual comparisons but relies on subjective assessment and may vary across different facial appearances and lighting conditions.
- **Low Confidence**: The effectiveness of the two-stage training protocol (pre-training plus main training with mixed tasks) is demonstrated through ablation studies, but the paper doesn't explore alternative training strategies that might achieve similar results.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-dataset Generalization Test**: Evaluate DiffusionAct on diverse datasets beyond VoxCeleb (e.g., Internet-level facial images with varying quality) to verify the claim of artifact-free generation across different domains and image qualities.

2. **Identity Preservation Under Extreme Conditions**: Test the model's ability to preserve source identity during cross-subject reenactment with large pose variations (head rotation >90 degrees) and challenging expressions (wide mouth opening, raised eyebrows) that weren't emphasized in the current evaluation.

3. **Real-time Performance Analysis**: Measure the inference speed of DiffusionAct for practical applications, particularly comparing the computational requirements of the diffusion-based approach against faster GAN-based alternatives for interactive use cases.
