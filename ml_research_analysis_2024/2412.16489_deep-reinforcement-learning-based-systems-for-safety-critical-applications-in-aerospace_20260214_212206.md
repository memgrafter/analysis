# Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Systems for Safety Critical Applications in Aerospace

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.16489
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16489
- Authors: Abedin Sherifi
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: A framework enabling DRL deployment in aerospace through runtime assurance mechanisms and a W-Model certification approach

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of certifying deep reinforcement learning (DRL) systems for safety-critical aerospace applications, where traditional standards like ARP-4754, DO-178C, and DO-254 are inadequate for AI-based systems. The proposed solution uses Overarching Properties (intent, correctness, and innocuity) combined with runtime assurance mechanisms to ensure safety during operation. The framework introduces a W-Model that integrates traditional aerospace certification standards with AI-specific verification processes, enabling the deployment of DRL systems while maintaining traceability, robustness, and safety through layered assurance mechanisms.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a comprehensive framework for qualifying and certifying DRL-based systems in aerospace safety-critical applications. The approach centers on three core components: Overarching Properties (OPs) that provide a structured argumentation framework for safety claims, runtime assurance mechanisms that monitor system behavior and switch to backup controls when unsafe conditions are detected, and a W-Model certification framework that combines traditional aerospace standards with AI-specific verification processes. The method emphasizes traceability between model architecture, datasets, and trained weights while implementing confidence assessments and contingency managers to ensure operational safety.

## Key Results
- Runtime assurance mechanisms enable safe DRL deployment by detecting unsafe behaviors in real-time and switching to backup procedures
- The W-Model provides a structured framework for certifying DRL systems by combining traditional standards with AI-specific verification processes
- Overarching Properties (intent, correctness, innocuity) create a logical chain of evidence for demonstrating DRL system safety and suitability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Runtime assurance mechanisms enable safe deployment of DRL systems by detecting and mitigating unsafe behaviors in real-time.
- Mechanism: Continuous monitoring of inputs, outputs, and internal states allows the system to switch to backup procedures when unsafe behavior is detected.
- Core assumption: The runtime monitors can reliably detect unsafe conditions faster than the DRL system can cause harm.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "runtime assurance mechanisms, such as system safety monitors and confidence assessments, to detect and mitigate unsafe behaviors during operation"
  - [section] "runtime assurance switches play a crucial role in detecting and mitigating unsafe or unexpected behaviors during operation"
- Break condition: If the runtime monitors fail to detect unsafe behavior quickly enough, or if the switch to backup systems causes unacceptable performance degradation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The W-Model provides a structured framework for certifying DRL systems by combining traditional software/hardware standards with AI-specific verification processes.
- Mechanism: Iterative requirements, training, and implementation phases ensure comprehensive coverage of AI-specific challenges while maintaining traceability to established aerospace standards.
- Core assumption: The iterative nature of the W-Model can capture the dynamic and complex behavior of DRL systems while maintaining the rigor of traditional aerospace certification.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The primary result is a framework that enables the deployment of DRL systems in aerospace by ensuring traceability, robustness, and safety through layered assurance mechanisms and backup procedures"
  - [section] "Figure 3 below presents the amended V-Model for safety-critical systems with AI, based on EASA's AI Roadmap research"
- Break condition: If the AI-specific verification processes cannot be effectively mapped to traditional standards, or if the iterative approach becomes too complex to manage.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Overarching Properties (OPs) provide a structured argumentation framework for demonstrating the safety and suitability of DRL systems.
- Mechanism: The three OPs (intent, correctness, innocuity) create a logical chain of evidence that each aspect of the DRL system meets safety requirements.
- Core assumption: The OPs can be effectively applied to the probabilistic and adaptive nature of DRL systems, and that sufficient evidence can be gathered for each property.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "using Overarching Properties (OPs)—intent, correctness, and innocuity—to argue for the safety and suitability of DRL systems"
  - [section] "The report referenced in [12] covers in detail the use of OPs to provide sufficient suitability of a product for installation on an aircraft"
- Break condition: If the OPs cannot adequately capture the unique challenges of DRL systems, or if the evidence gathering process becomes too burdensome.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Markov Decision Process (MDP)
  - Why needed here: MDP provides the mathematical foundation for understanding how DRL agents learn through interaction with their environment
  - Quick check question: What are the five key components of an MDP, and how do they relate to the DRL control loop?

- Concept: Bellman Equation
  - Why needed here: The Bellman equation is the core mathematical principle underlying value-based RL algorithms and explains how optimal policies are derived
  - Quick check question: How does the discount factor in the Bellman equation affect the agent's preference for immediate versus future rewards?

- Concept: Runtime Assurance
  - Why needed here: Understanding runtime assurance is crucial for implementing the safety mechanisms that make DRL deployment possible in safety-critical applications
  - Quick check question: What are the three main components of runtime assurance in the context of DRL systems, and how do they work together?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Learning agent -> Environment interface -> Runtime monitors (system safety, confidence assessment, monitor selector, contingency manager) -> Backup classical control systems
- Critical path: State observation → DRL policy action → Environment response → Reward calculation → Policy update → Runtime monitor assessment → Safe/unsafe decision → (if unsafe) switch to backup control
- Design tradeoffs: Online vs. offline training (safety vs. adaptability), complexity of runtime monitors vs. detection speed, depth of neural networks vs. computational requirements, strictness of safety thresholds vs. system performance
- Failure signatures: Unexpected policy behavior in known states, runtime monitor false positives/negatives, backup system activation during normal operation, degradation in learning performance over time, certification evidence gaps
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple DRL agent in a simulated aerospace control task with basic runtime monitors and measure detection latency and false positive rates
  2. Apply the W-Model structure to a small DRL project and identify gaps in the current certification process
  3. Test the Overarching Properties framework on a non-critical DRL application to validate the argumentation structure and evidence requirements
