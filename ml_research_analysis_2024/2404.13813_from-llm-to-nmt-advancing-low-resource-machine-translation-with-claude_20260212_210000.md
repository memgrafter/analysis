# From LLM to NMT: Advancing Low-Resource Machine Translation with Claude

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.13813
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13813
- Authors: Maxim Enis; Mark Hopkins
- Reference count: 35
- Key outcome: Claude 3 Opus exhibits stronger translation ability than other LLMs, surpassing NLLB-54B and Google Translate on many low- and very low-resource language pairs when translating into English.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates Claude 3 Opus's translation capabilities on low-resource language pairs, finding it outperforms other large language models, NLLB-54B, and Google Translate on many very low-resource pairs when translating into English. The authors discover evidence of data contamination on the FLORES-200 benchmark and create new unseen evaluation datasets from BBC News articles and Maltese speech. They demonstrate Claude's superior resource efficiency compared to other LLMs and show that its translation quality can be distilled into compact NLLB-1.3B models, advancing state-of-the-art Yoruba-English translation by over 3 spBLEU/chrF++ points.

## Method Summary
The authors evaluate Claude 3 Opus's translation performance using prompt tuning with in-context exemplars, document-level translation batching to reduce API costs, and knowledge distillation into NLLB-1.3B models. They create new unseen benchmarks by mining parallel BBC News articles using LASER-based alignment with a 1.03 score threshold and a September 1, 2023 date cutoff, plus using Maltese speech data from IWSLT 2024. For distillation experiments, they generate synthetic data using document-level translation of Yoruba monolingual news articles and fine-tune NLLB-1.3B models using both sequence-level and document-level approaches.

## Key Results
- Claude 3 Opus outperforms other LLMs, NLLB-54B, and Google Translate on many low- and very low-resource language pairs when translating into English
- Document-level translation with Claude improves Yoruba-English translation quality by over 3 spBLEU/chrF++ points compared to sentence-level
- Knowledge distillation from Claude to NLLB-1.3B advances state-of-the-art Yoruba-English translation by over 3 spBLEU/chrF++ points
- Evidence of data contamination on FLORES-200 leads to creation of new unseen benchmarks from BBC News and Maltese speech

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Claude exhibits superior resource efficiency compared to other LLMs on low-resource translation tasks.
- Mechanism: Claude's architecture allows it to maintain competitive translation quality even with limited training data, unlike other LLMs whose performance degrades more significantly with resource scarcity.
- Core assumption: The resource efficiency is due to Claude's internal representations being more robust to data scarcity than other LLMs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we find that Claude has remarkable resource efficiency – the degree to which the quality of the translation model depends on a language pair's resource level"
  - [section] "In Figure 2b, we show that in xxx->eng translation, Claude has comparable resource efficiency to NLLB"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - the corpus doesn't provide direct evidence of architectural reasons for resource efficiency
- Break condition: If Claude's performance degrades significantly on truly unseen data or if resource efficiency claims cannot be replicated on new benchmarks

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Knowledge distillation from Claude to NMT models can advance state-of-the-art performance on low-resource languages.
- Mechanism: Claude's superior translation capabilities can be transferred to smaller, more efficient NMT models through synthetic data generation and fine-tuning.
- Core assumption: The distilled knowledge from Claude is sufficient to improve NMT models beyond their original capabilities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we show that advancements in LLM translation can be compressed into traditional neural machine translation (NMT) models"
  - [section] "Using Claude to generate synthetic data, we demonstrate that knowledge distillation advances the state-of-the-art in Yoruba-English translation"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus shows related work on data augmentation but doesn't directly support distillation effectiveness
- Break condition: If the distilled models fail to outperform strong baselines or if the improvement doesn't generalize to other language pairs

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Document-level context improves translation quality and reduces API costs when using Claude.
- Mechanism: By batching sentences from the same document, Claude can leverage contextual information across sentences, leading to better translations and more efficient API usage.
- Core assumption: Claude's architecture benefits from document-level context in a way that improves translation quality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we describe an approach that leverages Claude's context window to reduce distillation costs and improve translation quality, by 'batching' sentences from the same web-crawled document into the same prompt"
  - [section] "In Table 1, the best model by far is claude_doc, surpassing all other models by over 3 spBLEU and chrF++"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus doesn't provide direct evidence of document-level context benefits
- Break condition: If document-level context doesn't consistently improve translation quality or if the cost savings are not significant

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Resource efficiency in machine translation
  - Why needed here: Understanding how translation quality varies with available training data is crucial for evaluating Claude's performance on low-resource languages
  - Quick check question: What metric would you use to compare the resource efficiency of two translation systems?

- Concept: Knowledge distillation in neural networks
  - Why needed here: The paper relies on transferring knowledge from Claude to smaller NMT models, which requires understanding distillation techniques
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between sequence-level and token-level knowledge distillation?

- Concept: Data contamination in machine learning benchmarks
  - Why needed here: The paper highlights the importance of using unseen data for evaluation, which requires understanding data contamination issues
  - Quick check question: How might data contamination affect the validity of benchmark results for LLMs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Claude API -> Translation Generation -> NMT Models -> Evaluation -> Knowledge Distillation Pipeline
- Critical path: Generate synthetic data with Claude → Fine-tune NMT model → Evaluate on unseen benchmarks
- Design tradeoffs: Using Claude for translation provides superior quality but at higher cost, while NMT models are cheaper but potentially lower quality
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on unseen data, failure to outperform baselines, high API costs relative to improvements
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test Claude's translation quality on a small subset of FLORES-200 to establish baseline performance
  2. Generate synthetic data for a low-resource language pair and fine-tune an NMT model
  3. Compare the distilled model's performance against strong baselines on unseen data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we evaluate Claude's translation performance on non-English-centric language pairs given the data contamination concerns?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses that all evaluated language pairs involved English as the source or target and mentions that previous work has shown LLMs struggle with non-English-centric machine translation. The authors explicitly state "our methods (and automatic dataset construction) should apply to any language pair" but also note "an important question remains on how to evaluate Claude (and other closed-source LLMs) on a broader set of languages."
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates that Claude shows signs of data contamination on FLORES-200 and therefore creates new unseen benchmarks. However, these new benchmarks are also English-centric. The authors acknowledge the need for evaluation methods on non-English-centric pairs but do not provide a solution.
- What evidence would resolve it: A methodology for creating unseen evaluation benchmarks for non-English-centric language pairs, or experimental results showing Claude's performance on such pairs using newly created datasets that are verifiably unseen by the model.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does document-level context consistently improve translation quality across all language pairs and domains, or is the improvement specific to certain conditions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows that document-level translation with Claude improves results for Yoruba-English translation by over 3 spBLEU/chrF++ points compared to sentence-level translation. The authors introduce a novel approach to generate training data by using sentence-aligned document translation and observe quality improvements.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests document-level context on Yoruba-English translation. While promising results are shown, there is no evidence that this approach generalizes to other language pairs or domains. The improvement could be specific to Yoruba-English or the BBC News domain.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments comparing sentence-level and document-level translation across multiple language pairs, domains, and resource levels, with statistical analysis of when and why document-level context provides benefits.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal strategy for leveraging Claude's context window to maximize resource efficiency and minimize API costs during knowledge distillation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper describes an approach that leverages Claude's context window to reduce distillation costs and improve translation quality by 'batching' sentences from the same web-crawled document into the same prompt. However, they do not explore alternative batching strategies or determine optimal batch sizes.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates that batching sentences from the same document reduces costs and improves quality, it does not systematically investigate different batching strategies, document sizes, or sentence groupings that might yield better results. The current approach appears to be a proof of concept rather than an optimized methodology.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing different batching strategies (e.g., sentences from different documents, varying batch sizes, hierarchical batching), cost-benefit analyses, and identification of the conditions under which specific batching approaches are most effective.

## Limitations

- Evidence of data contamination in FLORES-200 limits the validity of benchmark comparisons and necessitates new unseen evaluation datasets
- Knowledge distillation experiments are limited to only one language pair (Yoruba-English), raising questions about generalizability to other low-resource languages
- The resource efficiency analysis relies on Wikipedia article count as a proxy for language resource level, which may not capture all aspects of resource availability

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The demonstration that Claude 3 Opus outperforms other LLMs and traditional NMT systems on low-resource translation tasks, as evidenced by comparisons with Google Translate and NLLB-54B on both FLORES-200 and newly created unseen benchmarks.

**Medium Confidence**: The resource efficiency analysis showing Claude's comparable efficiency to NLLB, based on the correlation between translation quality and Wikipedia article count. The analysis is sound but the proxy measure may not capture all resource dimensions.

**Medium Confidence**: The knowledge distillation results showing 3+ spBLEU improvement for Yoruba-English, given the controlled experimental setup and comparison with strong baselines. However, the single language pair limit prevents high confidence in generalization.

## Next Checks

1. **Benchmark Contamination Verification**: Replicate the FLORES-200 evaluation using a diverse set of LLM providers and compare performance distributions to identify contamination patterns across language pairs. This would validate the contamination hypothesis and establish more robust evaluation protocols.

2. **Cross-Lingual Distillation Replication**: Extend the knowledge distillation experiments to at least 5 additional low-resource language pairs with varying resource levels and language family relationships to test the generalizability of the observed improvements.

3. **Resource Efficiency Under Data Scarcity**: Conduct controlled experiments systematically reducing training data for both Claude and NLLB on multiple language pairs to measure the actual degradation curves and validate the claimed resource efficiency advantages.
