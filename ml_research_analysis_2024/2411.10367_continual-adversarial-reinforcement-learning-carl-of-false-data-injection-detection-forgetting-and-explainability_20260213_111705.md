# Continual Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (CARL) of False Data Injection detection: forgetting and explainability

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2411.10367
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10367
- **Reference count**: 20
- **Primary result**: Data-based FDIA detectors are vulnerable to RL-crafted adversarial examples; R-CARL mitigates catastrophic forgetting and improves detection accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the vulnerability of data-based false data injection attack (FDIA) detection methods to adversarial examples crafted using reinforcement learning (RL). The authors propose a continual adversarial reinforcement learning (CARL) framework that trains a detector agent against progressively more complex FDIA adversaries to improve detection while maintaining explainability. A rehearsal continual adversarial RL (R-CARL) variant is introduced to address catastrophic forgetting by exposing the detector to an ensemble of adversaries. Results show that while the baseline offline detector is highly vulnerable to RL-crafted attacks, R-CARL achieves significantly better detection accuracy and mitigates forgetting issues compared to standard CARL.

## Method Summary
The method employs a continual adversarial reinforcement learning framework where a detector agent is trained against sequentially more complex FDIA adversaries. The framework uses proximal policy optimization with 2 hidden layers of 256 neurons for both attacker and defender RL agents. The power system frequency dynamics are modeled using swing equations with droop control for smart inverters. Synthetic FDIA scenarios are generated by modifying droop coefficients. Detection is performed using an LSTM-based state predictor combined with a neural network classifier. The R-CARL variant mitigates catastrophic forgetting by training the detector against an ensemble of all previously encountered adversaries rather than just the most recent one.

## Key Results
- Baseline offline detector accuracy drops from 71.6% to 3.61% when faced with specifically trained adversarial attacks
- CARL exhibits catastrophic forgetting, with detection accuracy decreasing by factors of 1.7, 2.3, and 3.1 after one, two, and three iterations respectively
- R-CARL achieves 75.42% detection accuracy on unseen synthetic attacks compared to CARL's lower performance
- Adversaries become more aggressive over iterations, with R-CARL adversaries showing distinct behavior patterns including never muting and consistently attacking buses

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: CARL framework incrementally improves FDIA detection by training against progressively more complex adversaries, exposing detection model deficiencies.
- Mechanism: The detector is continually retrained against a sequence of adversaries (A1, A2, A3, A4), each trained to defeat the previous detector. This exposes the detector to increasingly sophisticated attack strategies, allowing it to adapt and improve its detection capabilities.
- Core assumption: Each new adversary generates novel attack patterns that are sufficiently different from previous ones to force the detector to learn new detection strategies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We propose to include such adversarial examples in data-based detection training procedure via a continual adversarial RL (CARL) approach."
  - [section] "This approach naturally pairs the defense with the adversarial examples it addresses."
  - [corpus] Weak - No direct corpus evidence supporting the effectiveness of CARL for FDIA detection specifically.
- Break condition: If adversaries fail to generate sufficiently novel attack patterns, the detector will not learn meaningful improvements.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: R-CARL mitigates catastrophic forgetting by exposing the detector to an ensemble of all previously encountered adversaries.
- Mechanism: Instead of training against only the most recent adversary, R-CARL trains the detector against a mixture of all previous adversaries. This forces the model to maintain detection capabilities across all attack types encountered.
- Core assumption: Maintaining a diverse set of adversarial examples during training prevents the model from overfitting to recent attacks and forgetting older ones.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We show that forgetting can be addressed by employing a joint training strategy on all generated FDIA scenarios."
  - [section] "To address the issue of CF in continual learning [12], several methods have been proposed... Here, a rehearsal continual adversarial RL (R-CARL) approach that trains an ultimate detector D against an ensemble of adversaries is used to address the problem of CF."
  - [corpus] Weak - Limited corpus evidence on the specific application of rehearsal strategies to RL-based FDIA detection.
- Break condition: If the ensemble becomes too large or diverse, training may become computationally infeasible or the model may struggle to generalize effectively.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Explainability is achieved by maintaining access to individual adversaries throughout the CARL/R-CARL training process.
- Mechanism: By preserving the sequence of adversaries (A0, A1, A2, A3, A4), researchers can analyze how attack strategies evolve over time and understand what specific deficiencies each detector iteration addressed.
- Core assumption: The evolution of adversary strategies can be meaningfully analyzed to understand detection weaknesses and improvements.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we show that they remain vulnerable to impactful and stealthy adversarial examples that can be crafted using Reinforcement Learning (RL). We propose to include such adversarial examples in data-based detection training procedure via a continual adversarial RL (CARL) approach. This way, one can pinpoint the deficiencies of data-based detection, thereby offering explainability during their incremental improvement."
  - [section] "The benefit of the CARL and R-CARL approaches is that one can access the individual adversaries that are incrementally added to the knowledge pool of the detector. Here, the objective is to leverage this property to understand how adversaries change throughout the CARL iterations."
  - [corpus] Weak - No direct corpus evidence on using adversarial evolution for explainability in RL-based FDIA detection.
- Break condition: If adversary evolution is too subtle or complex to analyze meaningfully, explainability benefits may be limited.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Reinforcement Learning basics (policy optimization, reward functions, action spaces)
  - Why needed here: The entire framework relies on RL agents (both attacker and defender) learning optimal policies through interaction with the environment.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between on-policy and off-policy RL algorithms and why PPO (used here) is on-policy?

- Concept: Catastrophic Forgetting in neural networks
  - Why needed here: Understanding why continual learning without mitigation leads to forgetting is crucial for appreciating the R-CARL contribution.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between catastrophic forgetting and interference in continual learning?

- Concept: False Data Injection Attacks on power systems
  - Why needed here: The specific threat model (modifying droop coefficients to cause frequency instability) is central to the problem formulation.
  - Quick check question: How does modifying the droop coefficient of a smart inverter affect grid frequency stability?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Power system dynamics model -> RL environment -> State predictor (LSTM) -> Classifier -> Reward computation -> Policy update
- Critical path: Attacker generates FDIAs → Power system dynamics simulate consequences → State predictor and classifier process observations → Detection reward/penalty computed → Both agents update policies → Repeat
- Design tradeoffs: 
  - Detection frequency (d=6 timesteps) vs. computational cost
  - Attack impact maximization vs. stealth requirement
  - Model complexity (LSTM + classifier) vs. real-time feasibility
  - Ensemble size in R-CARL vs. training efficiency
- Failure signatures:
  - High detection accuracy on seen attacks but poor generalization to unseen attacks
  - Gradual degradation of detection accuracy across CARL iterations
  - Adversary convergence to simple, repetitive attack patterns
  - Computational bottlenecks during ensemble training in R-CARL
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test baseline offline detector (D0) against synthetic attacks (A0) to establish vulnerability baseline
  2. Run single CARL iteration to observe catastrophic forgetting magnitude
  3. Compare detection accuracy of D (R-CARL) against all adversaries vs. individual CARL-trained detectors

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the diversity of adversarial examples affect the performance of the detector when trained using R-CARL?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the high detection accuracy on RL adversaries is primarily due to the lack of diversity in the attacks generated, and suggests improving adversary diversity as future work.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore how varying the diversity of adversarial examples impacts the detector's performance, leaving this aspect untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with varying levels of adversarial example diversity and measuring the corresponding detection accuracy would provide insights into the impact of diversity on detector performance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the initial condition variability influence the space of FDIA that can be explored with few CARL iterations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests relaxing the assumption of focusing on a single initial condition to induce further variabilities in the adversaries, thereby exploring the space of FDIA more extensively with few CARL iterations.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not test how different initial conditions affect the exploration of FDIA space, leaving this aspect unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the CARL framework with multiple initial conditions and analyzing the resulting adversarial examples would reveal how initial condition variability influences FDIA exploration.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the implications of using a rehearsal strategy like R-CARL on the long-term stability and adaptability of the detector?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates that R-CARL addresses catastrophic forgetting by training the detector against an ensemble of adversaries, but does not explore the long-term effects of this approach.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate the long-term stability and adaptability of detectors trained with R-CARL, leaving potential implications untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting long-term studies on detectors trained with R-CARL, assessing their stability and adaptability over time, would provide insights into the implications of using a rehearsal strategy.

## Limitations

- Catastrophic forgetting measurements lack context about absolute detection accuracy baseline, making the scale of forgetting unclear
- Explainability analysis focuses on adversary behavior patterns without concrete interpretability metrics or human-readable explanations
- R-CARL ensemble approach may include outdated attack strategies that no longer reflect current threat landscapes

## Confidence

- High confidence: Baseline detector vulnerability to RL-crafted attacks (71.6% → 3.61% accuracy drop is substantial and well-demonstrated)
- Medium confidence: CARL's effectiveness in improving detection through iterative adversarial training (mechanism is sound but forgetting rates need more context)
- Medium confidence: R-CARL's mitigation of catastrophic forgetting (results show improvement but comparison metrics could be more comprehensive)

## Next Checks

1. Test detection performance on a completely held-out adversary not seen during any training phase to assess true generalization capabilities
2. Conduct ablation studies to determine the optimal ensemble size in R-CARL and whether all previous adversaries are necessary
3. Implement interpretability metrics (e.g., feature importance scores, decision boundary analysis) to quantify the explainability claims beyond behavioral observations
