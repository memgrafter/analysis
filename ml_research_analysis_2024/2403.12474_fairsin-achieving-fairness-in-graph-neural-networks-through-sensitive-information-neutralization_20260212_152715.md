# FairSIN: Achieving Fairness in Graph Neural Networks through Sensitive Information Neutralization

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.12474
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12474
- Reference count: 13
- Primary result: Neutralization-based paradigm (FairSIN) improves fairness metrics by 63.29% (DP) and 33.82% (EO) while maintaining or improving accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses fairness issues in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that can produce biased predictions based on sensitive attributes like race and gender. The authors propose a novel neutralization-based paradigm called FairSIN that introduces Fairness-facilitating Features (F3) to node features/representations to neutralize sensitive biases while preserving non-sensitive information. FairSIN emphasizes the features of each node's heterogeneous neighbors (those with different sensitive attributes) as F3. The method is implemented in three variants: FairSIN-G (graph modification), FairSIN-F (feature modification), and FairSIN (full model with adversarial discriminator). Experiments on five benchmark datasets with three GNN backbones show that FairSIN significantly improves fairness metrics while maintaining or even improving prediction accuracy.

## Method Summary
FairSIN introduces a neutralization-based approach to achieve fairness in GNNs by adding Fairness-facilitating Features (F3) that emphasize heterogeneous neighbors. The method has three variants: FairSIN-G modifies graph structure by adjusting edge weights based on sensitive attributes, FairSIN-F modifies node features by predicting and incorporating heterogeneous neighbor features through an estimator MLP, and FairSIN combines both with an adversarial discriminator for joint training. The neutralization mechanism statistically counteracts sensitive biases in node representations while preserving task-relevant information. The estimator enables knowledge transfer from nodes with rich heterogeneous neighbors to those with few or none.

## Key Results
- FairSIN significantly improves fairness metrics, reducing Demographic Parity by 63.29% and Equal Opportunity by 33.82%
- Maintains or improves prediction accuracy (F1 score and accuracy) compared to baseline methods
- FairSIN-F achieves similar performance to the full FairSIN model while being more computationally efficient
- Outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods including FairGNN, EDITS, NIFTY, and FairVGNN on five benchmark datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Message passing in GNNs exacerbates sensitive attribute biases by aggregating both non-sensitive information and sensitive biases from neighbors.
- Mechanism: The homophily effect causes nodes with similar sensitive attributes to connect more frequently, leading to intensified sensitive information leakage during message passing as the model aggregates features from neighbors.
- Core assumption: Graph topology exhibits homophily with respect to sensitive attributes, and node features are correlated with these attributes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "According to the homophily effects (McPherson, Smith-Lovin, and Cook 2001; La Fond and Neville 2010), nodes with the same sensitive attribute tend to link with each other, which will make the node representations in the same sensitive group more similar during message passing."
  - [section] "Then we have E{Dθ(si|x′i) − Dθ(¯si|x′i)} > E{Dθ(si|xi) − Dθ(¯si|xi)}, which means that the predictor ˆPθ can identify the sensitive attributes more accurately."
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers discuss fairness but don't specifically address the message passing bias amplification mechanism.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Introducing Fairness-facilitating Features (F3) that emphasize heterogeneous neighbors neutralizes sensitive biases while providing additional non-sensitive information.
- Mechanism: By incorporating features from neighbors with different sensitive attributes, F3 statistically counteracts the sensitive bias in node representations, reducing the conditional entropy between sensitive attributes and node representations.
- Core assumption: Nodes with different sensitive attributes provide complementary information that can neutralize biases present in same-group neighbors.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The F3 are expected to statistically neutralize the sensitive bias in node representations and provide additional non-sensitive information."
  - [section] "For node vi, we consider a message passing process that updates xi by x′i = xi + xneighi. Then we have E{Dθ(si|x′i) − Dθ(¯si|x′i)} > E{Dθ(si|xi) − Dθ(¯si|xi)}."
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers mention fairness methods but don't specifically discuss the neutralization paradigm through heterogeneous neighbor emphasis.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The estimator trained to predict average features of heterogeneous neighbors enables knowledge transfer from nodes with rich heterogeneous neighbors to those with few or none.
- Mechanism: The MLP estimator learns the relationship between a node's own features and its heterogeneous neighbors' features, allowing nodes lacking heterogeneous neighbors to approximate their beneficial effects.
- Core assumption: There exists a learnable mapping between a node's features and the features of its heterogeneous neighbors.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Therefore, we propose to train an estimator to predict the average features or representations of a node's heterogeneous neighbors given its own feature. In this way, nodes with rich heterogeneous neighbors can transfer their knowledge to other nodes through the estimator."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence in corpus about the estimator mechanism for knowledge transfer.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Homophily and heterophily in graphs
  - Why needed here: Understanding how graph structure affects sensitive attribute distribution is crucial for grasping why message passing can exacerbate biases and how F3 can help.
  - Quick check question: If nodes with the same race tend to connect more frequently, what type of homophily is this graph exhibiting?

- Concept: Conditional entropy and information leakage
  - Why needed here: The paper uses conditional entropy to measure sensitive information leakage, which is central to understanding the fairness problem and the effectiveness of neutralization.
  - Quick check question: If a predictor can accurately determine a node's race from its representation, is the conditional entropy high or low?

- Concept: Message passing in GNNs
  - Why needed here: The paper's entire mechanism relies on understanding how message passing works and why it can amplify biases through neighbor aggregation.
  - Quick check question: In a simple GNN layer, how is a node's new representation typically computed from its neighbors?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Node features matrix X -> Estimator MLPϕ -> Heterogeneous neighbor features -> Neutralization -> GNN encoder -> Discriminator MLPψ -> Classification head

- Critical path:
  1. Compute heterogeneous neighbor features or estimate them via MLPϕ
  2. Apply neutralization by adding weighted heterogeneous neighbor features to node features
  3. Pass neutralized features through GNN encoder
  4. Apply discriminator constraint to enforce fairness
  5. Perform classification

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Data-centric vs model-centric variants: Data-centric (FairSIN-G/F) is task-agnostic and more efficient but less flexible; model-centric (FairSIN) allows joint learning and better performance.
  - Hyperparameter δ: Controls the amount of neutralization - too small has little effect, too large may introduce opposite bias.
  - Estimator complexity: Simple MLPs are sufficient but more sophisticated architectures could capture complex relationships.

- Failure signatures:
  - Fairness metrics don't improve: Could indicate insufficient neutralization or that heterogeneous neighbor features aren't informative.
  - Accuracy drops significantly: May suggest over-neutralization or that F3 introduces noise.
  - Training instability: Could occur if discriminator loss conflicts too strongly with classification loss.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement FairSIN-F on a simple dataset (like Cora) with binary sensitive attribute to verify basic functionality.
  2. Compare DP and EO metrics between vanilla GNN, FairSIN-F, and FairSIN to validate the effectiveness of different variants.
  3. Perform sensitivity analysis on hyperparameter δ to find optimal values for different datasets.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can FairSIN's F3 mechanism be extended to handle multiple sensitive attributes simultaneously rather than binary sensitive attributes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions "For simplicity, we assume that the sensitive attribute is binary as previous work did" and uses binary sensitive groups denoted by +/- in their illustrations
- Why unresolved: The current theoretical framework and implementation are built around binary sensitive attributes, but real-world scenarios often involve multiple intersecting sensitive attributes (e.g., race, gender, age simultaneously)
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing FairSIN's performance when extended to multi-attribute scenarios versus its binary version, along with theoretical analysis of how the F3 mechanism would need to be modified for multiple sensitive attributes

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the theoretical upper bound on the trade-off between predictive accuracy and fairness that FairSIN can achieve, and how does it compare to the theoretical limits of filtering-based methods?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper claims FairSIN achieves "a better trade-off between predictive performance and fairness compared with recent SOTA methods" and suggests filtering-based methods lead to "a sub-optimal balance between accuracy and fairness"
- Why unresolved: While empirical results show FairSIN performs well, there is no theoretical analysis establishing the fundamental limits of what FairSIN can achieve versus what filtering-based methods can achieve
- What evidence would resolve it: Mathematical proofs establishing the theoretical bounds for both FairSIN and filtering-based methods, along with proofs showing the gap between these bounds

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does FairSIN perform on dynamic graphs where sensitive attributes and node features evolve over time, and what modifications would be needed to maintain fairness in such scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "In practice, many fair representation learning methods will minimize the dependency between node representations and sensitive attributes instead" but focuses on static graph scenarios
- Why unresolved: All experiments and theoretical analysis are conducted on static graphs, but real-world applications often involve temporal graphs with changing sensitive attributes and evolving node features
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results showing FairSIN's performance degradation over time on dynamic graphs, along with proposed modifications to handle temporal evolution while maintaining fairness

## Limitations

- Effectiveness relies heavily on the presence of heterogeneous neighbors, which may be limited in highly segregated networks
- Computational overhead from training the estimator and discriminator may be prohibitive for very large graphs
- Assumes a learnable mapping between node features and heterogeneous neighbor features, which may not hold in all cases

## Confidence

- High confidence in the core neutralization mechanism and its ability to reduce sensitive attribute leakage
- Medium confidence in the estimator's effectiveness across diverse graph structures
- Medium confidence in the practical applicability to large-scale graphs

## Next Checks

1. **Heterogeneity Analysis**: Conduct experiments on graphs with varying levels of sensitive attribute homophily to determine FairSIN's effectiveness threshold when heterogeneous neighbors are scarce.

2. **Estimator Ablation**: Systematically evaluate the contribution of the estimator component by comparing FairSIN variants with and without it across different graph sizes and complexities.

3. **Scalability Testing**: Implement FairSIN on larger, real-world graphs to measure computational overhead and identify optimization opportunities for practical deployment.
