# Wav2Gloss: Generating Interlinear Glossed Text from Speech

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2403.13169
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13169
- **Reference count:** 30
- **Primary result:** Introduces WAV2GLOSS task and FIELDWORK dataset for extracting IGT annotations directly from speech

## Executive Summary
This paper presents WAV2GLOSS, a novel task that automatically extracts Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT) annotations from speech, including transcription, morphological segmentation, glossing, and translation. The authors introduce FIELDWORK, the first dataset pairing speech with IGT annotations across 37 languages derived from linguistic fieldwork. They establish benchmarks using end-to-end and cascaded approaches, demonstrating that while transcription is relatively feasible, glossing and translation from speech remain challenging, particularly for unseen languages. The work addresses a critical need in language documentation for endangered languages with limited resources.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a comprehensive approach to the WAV2GLOSS task by creating the FIELDWORK dataset and establishing multiple benchmark models. They employ both end-to-end models that directly map speech to IGT annotations and cascaded approaches that combine Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with text-based models. The framework supports multilingual and multi-task learning, with experiments conducted across various languages including Amharic, Cantonese, and Turkish. Performance is evaluated using character error rates for transcription and translation metrics for glossing and translation tasks.

## Key Results
- Transcription achieves reasonable performance with character error rates of 6.54-15.39% for seen languages
- Glossing and translation show significantly higher error rates (36.83-42.75% and 41.15-53.84% respectively)
- Performance degrades substantially for unseen languages, with Amharic reaching 23.55% CER
- End-to-end models demonstrate competitive performance compared to cascaded approaches for transcription

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system leverages the structured nature of IGT annotations to create a direct mapping from speech features to linguistic representations. By training on aligned speech-IGT pairs, the model learns to extract phonological, morphological, and semantic information simultaneously. The multi-task framework allows sharing of lower-level speech representations across different annotation types, while multilingual training provides cross-linguistic generalization. The cascaded approach benefits from pretrained ASR models that handle acoustic variations, though it introduces error propagation from the speech-to-text stage.

## Foundational Learning

**Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT):** A standardized linguistic annotation format showing word-by-word breakdown of utterances with morphological segmentation and semantic glosses. Why needed: Provides the structured output format for the task. Quick check: Verify understanding of glossing conventions and tier structure.

**Morphological Segmentation:** The process of breaking words into their constituent morphemes (smallest meaningful units). Why needed: Essential for capturing morphological structure in low-resource languages. Quick check: Practice segmenting words in unfamiliar languages.

**Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR):** Technology that converts spoken language into text. Why needed: Forms the basis for cascaded approaches to WAV2GLOSS. Quick check: Understand how acoustic features map to phonetic representations.

**Cross-linguistic Transfer Learning:** Training models on multiple languages to improve performance on low-resource languages. Why needed: Critical for handling the 37 diverse languages in FIELDWORK. Quick check: Review multilingual model architectures and their limitations.

**Character-level vs Word-level Processing:** Different granularities for handling linguistic units. Why needed: Character-level processing is more robust for morphologically rich languages. Quick check: Compare error patterns at different processing levels.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Raw Speech -> Feature Extractor -> Speech Encoder -> Task-specific Decoders (Transcription, Segmentation, Glossing, Translation)

**Critical Path:** Feature extraction and speech encoding are shared across all tasks, with separate decoder heads for each IGT component. The multi-task loss combines objectives with weighting factors.

**Design Tradeoffs:** End-to-end models avoid error propagation from ASR but require more training data. Cascaded approaches leverage pretrained models but accumulate errors. Multilingual training improves generalization but may dilute language-specific patterns.

**Failure Signatures:** High CER indicates acoustic modeling issues; high glossing errors suggest poor morphological parsing; translation failures point to semantic representation problems. Unseen language performance drops indicate limited cross-linguistic transfer.

**First Experiments:**
1. Test transcription performance on held-out data from seen languages to establish baseline capability
2. Evaluate cascaded approach using pretrained ASR on the same test set for comparison
3. Measure performance degradation when training on multilingual data versus monolingual data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper identifies several open challenges including the need for improved cross-linguistic generalization, better handling of morphological complexity, and more robust semantic representation learning. It calls for research into semi-supervised and unsupervised approaches to reduce data requirements, as well as exploration of alternative architectures that might better capture the hierarchical structure of linguistic information in speech.

## Limitations

- Data quality concerns due to potential alignment errors between text-based IGT resources and spoken data
- Significant performance degradation for unseen languages, particularly in transcription (23.55% CER for Amharic)
- High error rates in glossing (36.83-42.75%) and translation (41.15-53.84%) tasks indicate fundamental challenges in capturing morphological and semantic mappings
- Limited coverage of certain morphemes in target languages may affect model generalizability

## Confidence

**High confidence:** Transcription capabilities for languages within the training set, evidenced by relatively low CER scores (6.54-15.39%) and BLEU scores (26.05-33.90%)

**Medium confidence:** Cascaded approach effectiveness for languages with available pretrained ASR models, though performance degrades significantly for unseen languages

**Low confidence:** Current model's ability to handle complex morphological segmentation and translation tasks, given high error rates and the paper's acknowledgment that these remain "challenging" aspects requiring further research

## Next Checks

1. Conduct systematic error analysis on alignment quality between speech and IGT annotations in FIELDWORK to quantify potential data quality issues affecting model performance

2. Evaluate model robustness across diverse acoustic conditions (noisy environments, different speaker demographics) to assess real-world applicability beyond controlled linguistic fieldwork recordings

3. Test transfer learning capabilities by fine-tuning models on limited target language data to determine minimum data requirements for achieving acceptable performance on unseen languages
