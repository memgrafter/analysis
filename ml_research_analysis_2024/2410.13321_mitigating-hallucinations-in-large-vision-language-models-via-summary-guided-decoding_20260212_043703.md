# Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models via Summary-Guided Decoding

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2410.13321
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13321
- **Reference count**: 29
- **Primary result**: SumGD achieves state-of-the-art performance on object hallucination benchmarks while maintaining high object recall

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical problem of object hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where models over-rely on language priors and generate descriptions contradicting visual input. Through fundamental analysis, the authors discover that LVLMs increasingly rely on linguistic priors as token sequences grow, amplifying hallucinations. Based on these findings, they propose Summary-Guided Decoding (SumGD), a novel method that reduces text context through summaries while selectively controlling only image-related part-of-speech tokens. SumGD significantly outperforms existing decoding approaches on hallucination benchmarks while maintaining high object recall, achieving Pareto optimal performance.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes Summary-Guided Decoding (SumGD) to mitigate object hallucinations in LVLMs by reducing language prior dependency. SumGD works by summarizing previously generated text and using it as context for predicting only image-related part-of-speech (POS) tokens. The method uses a summarization model (Distilled-Flan-T5-base or self-summarization) to create concise context, then applies POS tagging to identify image-related tokens (NOUN, ADJ, PROPN) that require visual information. During decoding, the model generates language-related POS tokens using standard LVLM behavior while selectively controlling image-related POS tokens based on the summarized context. This approach maintains text quality by preserving the natural distribution of language-related tokens while reducing hallucinations by increasing focus on image information.

## Key Results
- SumGD achieves state-of-the-art performance on object hallucination benchmarks, outperforming all other decoding approaches
- The method demonstrates Pareto optimal performance, effectively balancing hallucination reduction with high object recall preservation
- SumGD shows clear reduction in language priors when predicting image-related POS tokens while preserving original dependencies on language-related POS tokens

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Language priors in LVLMs increase with token sequence length, causing reduced visual information usage and increased hallucinations.
- **Mechanism**: As LVLMs generate longer text sequences, they increasingly rely on learned textual patterns rather than visual information, evidenced by decreasing Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) between LVLM and LLM output distributions for image-related POS tokens.
- **Core assumption**: The model's attention to image tokens diminishes as text generation progresses, making language priors more dominant.
- **Evidence anchors**: [section] "we discover that even for these image-related POS tokens, the distributional distance rapidly decreases as the number of generated tokens increases"; [section] "initially, LVLMs give sufficient attention to input image tokens when computing the next token. However, as the sentence grows longer, this attention becomes significantly shallower"

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Direct calibration of LVLM output distributions to mitigate language priors degrades text quality and can exacerbate hallucinations.
- **Mechanism**: Methods like M3ID that aggressively contrast output distributions to reduce language priors disrupt the natural distribution of language-related tokens, leading to text quality degradation.
- **Core assumption**: The language modeling capability of LVLMs depends on maintaining proper token distributions for language-related POS categories.
- **Evidence anchors**: [section] "The effort to reduce language priors through contrastive decoding can disrupt the natural distribution of language-related tokens, potentially degrading overall text quality"; [section] "text quality drops considerably when generating up to 64 tokens compared to 256 tokens... declining from 4.85 to 2.39, a reduction of about 50.7%"

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Summary-Guided Decoding reduces object hallucinations while preserving text quality by selectively controlling only image-related POS tokens.
- **Mechanism**: By summarizing previously generated text and using it as context for predicting only image-related POS tokens, SumGD maintains focus on visual information without disrupting language modeling for other tokens.
- **Core assumption**: Image-related POS tokens are the primary source of hallucination risk, while language-related POS tokens can be safely generated using standard LVLM behavior.
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract] "This method naturally encourages the model to focus more on image information by reducing the text context through summaries, while controlling only the image-related POS tokens to maintain text quality"; [section] "SumGD demonstrates a clear reduction in language priors when predicting image-related POS tokens, while preserving the original dependency on language-related POS tokens"

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) for measuring distributional distance between models
  - **Why needed here**: JSD quantifies how much LVLMs rely on language priors by measuring the divergence between LVLM and LLM output distributions
  - **Quick check question**: If JSD between LVLM and LLM is 0.01 versus 0.3, which indicates more reliance on language priors and why?

- **Concept**: Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging and its role in multimodal generation
  - **Why needed here**: Different POS categories have varying dependencies on visual information, with image-related POS requiring more visual input
  - **Quick check question**: Which POS categories (NOUN, ADJ, PROPN) would you expect to show higher JSD values and why?

- **Concept**: Contrastive decoding and its limitations in multimodal settings
  - **Why needed here**: Understanding why standard contrastive approaches fail to reduce hallucinations while maintaining text quality
  - **Quick check question**: Why might contrasting distributions become less effective as token length increases in LVLMs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: LVLM -> POS tagger -> Summarization model -> Conditional decoder -> Output generation
- **Critical path**: LVLM generates text → POS tagging identifies image-related tokens → Summarization creates context → Conditional decoding based on POS type → Output generation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Self-summarization vs external summarization model (efficiency vs quality), controlling all POS vs only image-related POS (simplicity vs quality preservation)
- **Failure signatures**: Degraded text quality scores, increased hallucinations in language-related POS tokens, computational overhead from summarization, POS tagging errors affecting decoding decisions
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Compare JSD values between LVLM and LLM across different POS categories to verify language prior patterns
  2. Implement basic summarization context reduction and measure hallucination reduction vs text quality impact
  3. Test POS-selective decoding by applying SumGD only to image-related POS tokens and measuring both hallucination reduction and text quality preservation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How does the effectiveness of Summary-Guided Decoding (SumGD) vary across different types of visual content, such as abstract art, complex scenes, or images with low visual salience?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The paper primarily evaluates SumGD on the MSCOCO dataset, which consists of relatively straightforward images with clear objects. The authors mention that the summarization process may lose critical contextual information, which could be more problematic for complex or abstract visual content.
- **Why unresolved**: The experiments focus on object-centric images, and there is no analysis of SumGD's performance on more challenging visual content types.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Conducting experiments on diverse image datasets, including abstract art, complex scenes, and images with low visual salience, to compare SumGD's performance against baseline methods.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: Can the principles of Summary-Guided Decoding be extended to other modalities beyond text, such as audio or video, to mitigate hallucinations in multi-modal models?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper discusses the effectiveness of SumGD in reducing hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by focusing on image-related part-of-speech (POS) tokens. The authors suggest that the method could be adapted to other contexts where modality-specific information is crucial.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper only applies SumGD to text generation from images and does not explore its applicability to other modalities.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Implementing and evaluating SumGD or a similar approach in audio-to-text or video-to-text models to assess its effectiveness in reducing hallucinations in those contexts.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: What is the impact of varying the summarization model's capacity (e.g., using larger or smaller models) on the trade-off between hallucination reduction and text quality in SumGD?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The authors compare SumGD with Self-Summarization (SumGD-S) and SumGD with a distilled Flan-T5-base model (SumGD-D), noting differences in computational efficiency and performance. However, they do not explore the impact of using models with different capacities.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper only tests two specific summarization models, and there is no analysis of how the summarization model's size or complexity affects the overall performance.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Conducting experiments with a range of summarization models of varying capacities to measure their impact on hallucination reduction, text quality, and computational efficiency.

### Open Question 4
- **Question**: How does the reliance on part-of-speech (POS) tagging in SumGD affect its performance across languages with different grammatical structures or those with less robust POS tagging tools?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The authors acknowledge that POS tagging is used to distinguish between image-related and language-related tokens, and they note that relying solely on POS tagging can be problematic. However, they do not explore how this limitation affects performance across different languages.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper focuses on English text and does not address the applicability of SumGD to other languages with varying grammatical structures or the availability of POS tagging tools.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Evaluating SumGD on multilingual datasets and comparing its performance across languages with different grammatical structures or varying levels of POS tagging tool availability.

## Limitations

- The method's effectiveness may diminish for complex visual scenes requiring detailed descriptions, as summarization could lose critical contextual information
- Computational overhead from the summarization step could limit practical deployment, particularly for real-time applications
- The assumption that image-related POS tokens are the primary source of hallucinations while language-related POS tokens can be safely generated may not hold across all domains and image types

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims:**
- Language priors in LVLMs increase with token sequence length, causing reduced visual information usage and increased hallucinations
- Direct calibration of LVLM output distributions to mitigate language priors degrades text quality and can exacerbate hallucinations

**Medium Confidence Claims:**
- Summary-Guided Decoding reduces object hallucinations while preserving text quality by selectively controlling only image-related POS tokens
- The summarization approach effectively reduces conditioning context length while maintaining sufficient information for hallucination mitigation

**Low Confidence Claims:**
- The selective intervention approach is sufficient for hallucination mitigation across all image types and complexity levels
- The proposed method maintains Pareto optimal performance across all evaluation metrics

## Next Checks

1. **Generalization Test**: Evaluate SumGD performance on diverse datasets beyond MSCOCO, including medical imaging, satellite imagery, and abstract art, to assess the method's robustness across different visual domains and complexity levels.

2. **Ablation Study**: Conduct systematic ablation experiments removing the summarization component to quantify its specific contribution to hallucination reduction versus the POS-selective decoding mechanism alone, helping isolate the most critical components of the approach.

3. **Long-sequence Analysis**: Test SumGD on extended caption generation tasks (512+ tokens) to verify whether the language prior reduction mechanism scales effectively with longer text sequences and whether attention mechanisms maintain their effectiveness over extended contexts.
