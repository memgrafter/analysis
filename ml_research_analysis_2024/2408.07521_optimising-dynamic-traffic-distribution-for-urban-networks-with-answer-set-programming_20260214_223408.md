# Optimising Dynamic Traffic Distribution for Urban Networks with Answer Set Programming

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2408.07521
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07521
- **Reference count**: 7
- **Primary result**: ASP framework optimizes traffic routes, improving KPIs for up to 600 vehicles in under 30 seconds on real urban networks

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a framework for dynamic traffic distribution in urban networks using Answer Set Programming (ASP). The approach addresses the challenge of real-time traffic optimization by computing optimal routes for all vehicles while considering current traffic conditions and minimizing congestion. The framework consists of four integrated phases: network analysis, domain-independent route search, ASP-based optimization, and mobility simulation using SUMO. Experimental results on real-world data from Milton Keynes and Bologna demonstrate significant improvements in traffic KPIs compared to actual traffic conditions, with the ASP component efficiently solving instances with up to 600 vehicles within 30 seconds.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a four-phase approach to dynamic traffic optimization. First, the Network Analyser preprocesses raw network data by simplifying topology, computing street capacities, and establishing discretization parameters. Second, the Domain Independent Search uses Dijkstra-based algorithms to generate candidate routes for each vehicle while filtering similar routes to reduce computational burden. Third, the ASP Optimiser computes optimal vehicle routes by scheduling street entry/exit times within pre-computed bounds, using weak constraints to balance multiple optimization criteria. Finally, the Mobility Simulator (SUMO) executes the optimized routes and evaluates key performance indicators. The ASP component leverages time-discretized modeling and network simplification to maintain computational efficiency while finding optimal solutions for practical vehicle counts.

## Key Results
- The ASP component finds optimal solutions for up to 600 vehicles in under 30 seconds
- Framework improves traffic KPIs including total duration, average speed, and waiting time compared to actual traffic data
- Performance benefits are topology-dependent, with greater improvements observed in grid-like networks like Milton Keynes
- Pre-computed time ranges and network simplification significantly reduce computational complexity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: ASP provides efficient optimization for routing decisions in dynamic traffic scenarios.
- **Mechanism**: The ASP component computes optimal routes by evaluating constraints and minimizing vehicle counts on streets and travel times. The use of weak constraints allows prioritization of different optimization criteria.
- **Core assumption**: The search space can be effectively pruned to a manageable number of candidate routes, and the simplified network representation preserves essential traffic dynamics.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "The ASP component efficiently finds optimal solutions for up to 600 vehicles in under 30 seconds."
  - [section 4] "Figure 4 presents the scalability results... all instances of Milton Keynes and Bologna with less than 600 vehicles can all be solved optimally within 30 seconds."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence: Neighbor papers focus on ASP extensions and hybrid approaches but do not directly support traffic routing claims.
- **Break condition**: If the number of vehicles exceeds 600, solving time increases beyond practical limits; if the network topology becomes too complex, the simplifications may lose critical traffic dynamics.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Pre-computed time ranges for street entry/exit reduce the computational burden during optimization.
- **Mechanism**: By performing relaxed simulations to estimate minimum and maximum traversal times for each street in candidate routes, the ASP solver only needs to schedule within these bounds, drastically reducing the search space.
- **Core assumption**: The relaxed simulations provide tight enough bounds to capture realistic traffic conditions without missing optimal solutions.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section 3.2] "Computing the speed proportional to the congestion... The selected routes... together with the minimum and maximum entry and exit times are then passed to the third component of the architecture, the asp Optimiser."
  - [section 3.2] "This computation serves two purposes: speeding up the simulation of traffic flow and reducing overall computation time."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence: No direct support from neighbor papers; the claim relies on internal simulation methodology.
- **Break condition**: If congestion patterns deviate significantly from the assumed traffic thresholds, the pre-computed bounds may exclude viable optimal routes.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Network topology simplification improves optimization efficiency without significantly degrading solution quality.
- **Mechanism**: The Network Analyser combines small streets, simplifies intersections, and removes unusable streets, reducing the number of decision points for the ASP solver while preserving major traffic flows.
- **Core assumption**: Simplified routes maintain sufficient granularity to represent realistic vehicle paths and congestion patterns.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section 3.2] "The purpose of the Network Analyser component is to simplify the topology of the network... The preprocessor performs various tasks to simplify the network."
  - [section 3.2] "Ensuring that the total capacity of the roundabout is respected becomes the responsibility of the optimiser."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence: No direct support from neighbor papers; claim is based on described preprocessing steps.
- **Break condition**: If simplification removes critical bottlenecks or unique routing options, the optimizer may propose suboptimal routes that fail in practice.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Answer Set Programming (ASP) semantics and syntax
  - **Why needed here**: Understanding ASP is essential to grasp how the optimization phase represents and solves the routing problem.
  - **Quick check question**: What is the difference between a ground atom and a standard atom in ASP?

- **Concept**: Discretized time modeling in traffic simulation
  - **Why needed here**: The framework discretizes time to balance accuracy and computational efficiency; understanding this tradeoff is key to tuning the system.
  - **Quick check question**: How does the choice of discretization step affect both the accuracy of travel time estimates and the complexity of the ASP problem?

- **Concept**: Network simplification techniques and their impact on routing
  - **Why needed here**: Knowing how the Network Analyser transforms the raw network into a simplified model helps in assessing the trade-off between performance and solution fidelity.
  - **Quick check question**: What are the risks of merging streets in a roundabout when modeling traffic flow?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  Network Analyser -> Domain Independent Search -> ASP Optimiser -> Mobility Simulator (SUMO)

- **Critical path**:
  1. New vehicle detected → Network Analyser updates network state.
  2. Domain Independent Search generates candidate routes for the vehicle.
  3. ASP Optimiser assigns optimal route based on current traffic conditions.
  4. SUMO executes the plan and records KPIs.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Route candidate set size vs. ASP solving time: Larger sets improve solution quality but slow optimization.
  - Discretization granularity vs. computational complexity: Finer steps improve accuracy but increase ASP instance size.
  - Network simplification level vs. routing fidelity: Aggressive simplification speeds up solving but may miss important routing options.

- **Failure signatures**:
  - ASP solver timeout → Increase candidate route similarity threshold or reduce discretization step.
  - Poor KPI improvement vs. baseline → Check if network simplification removed critical streets or if traffic thresholds are misaligned.
  - SUMO execution diverges from ASP plan → Re-evaluate time range calculations or ASP constraints.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Vary the candidate route similarity threshold (σT) and measure impact on ASP solving time and KPI improvement.
  2. Adjust the discretization step (5s default) and observe changes in total duration and average speed.
  3. Modify the number of candidate routes per vehicle (k=5 default) to study the tradeoff between solution quality and computational overhead.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: How would the proposed framework perform in urban areas with significantly different topologies compared to the tested scenarios (e.g., cities with many narrow, winding streets vs. cities with large grids)?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The paper notes that the framework's effectiveness depends on the network topology, with greater improvements seen in grid-like layouts like Milton Keynes. It suggests that future work includes assessing the framework in different urban areas.
- **Why unresolved**: The experiments were limited to two specific urban areas, Milton Keynes and Bologna, which have different but specific topologies. The impact of other topological characteristics on the framework's performance is not explored.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Conducting experiments in urban areas with diverse topologies, such as cities with narrow, winding streets or cities with irregular street patterns, and comparing the results to those obtained in Milton Keynes and Bologna.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: How would the framework handle disruptions such as car accidents, unexpected roadworks, or extreme weather conditions, and what would be the impact on the computed optimal routes?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper mentions that the framework is designed to support updates for unexpected events but does not explicitly take them into account in the current implementation. It suggests that the implementation of the feedback loop in a target area is left for future work.
- **Why unresolved**: The current implementation does not explicitly consider disruptions, and the paper does not provide details on how the framework would handle such events or their impact on the computed optimal routes.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Implementing the feedback loop to update the network representation based on disruptions and evaluating the framework's performance in handling these events, including the quality of the recomputed optimal routes.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: How would the framework's performance be affected if vehicles do not follow the provided routing instructions, and what strategies could be implemented to mitigate this issue?
- **Basis in paper**: [explicit] The paper mentions that future work includes extending the approach to deal with vehicles that do not follow the provided instructions.
- **Why unresolved**: The paper does not provide any details on how the framework would handle non-compliant vehicles or the potential impact on the overall traffic distribution and route optimization.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Implementing strategies to handle non-compliant vehicles, such as rerouting nearby vehicles or adjusting traffic signals, and evaluating the framework's performance in scenarios with a mix of compliant and non-compliant vehicles.

## Limitations

- **Scalability ceiling**: The ASP component shows optimal performance only up to 600 vehicles, with no data on how solution quality degrades beyond this point.
- **Network topology dependency**: The framework shows substantially better results in grid-like layouts (Milton Keynes) compared to complex historical layouts (Bologna).
- **Traffic threshold sensitivity**: The ASP encoding relies on fixed traffic thresholds (0.4 for medium, 0.7 for heavy traffic) without validation across different network conditions.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: ASP optimization efficiency for ≤600 vehicles and the four-phase framework architecture
- **Medium confidence**: Route optimization effectiveness and KPI improvements, given the real-world dataset validation
- **Low confidence**: Generalizability to networks with different topologies and scalability beyond tested vehicle counts

## Next Checks

1. **Scalability validation**: Test the framework with 600-2000 vehicles on both Milton Keynes and Bologna networks to identify the precise scalability limits and measure solution quality degradation.
2. **Cross-topology testing**: Apply the framework to networks with varied topologies (ring, radial, irregular) to quantify the impact of urban form on optimization effectiveness.
3. **Parameter sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary the traffic thresholds, discretization step, and candidate route similarity parameters to determine their impact on solution quality and computational performance.
