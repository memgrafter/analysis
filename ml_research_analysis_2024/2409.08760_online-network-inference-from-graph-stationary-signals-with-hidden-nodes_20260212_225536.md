# Online Network Inference from Graph-Stationary Signals with Hidden Nodes

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.08760
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08760
- Reference count: 36
- Key outcome: Online graph learning method that estimates connectivity among observed nodes while accounting for hidden nodes through graph stationarity modeling

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of online graph learning when some nodes are never observed during the learning process. The authors propose a method that estimates the connectivity among observed nodes while modeling the influence of hidden nodes through graph stationarity assumptions. The approach formulates a convex optimization problem that can be solved using a proximal gradient algorithm, enabling real-time tracking of time-varying graph topologies even when significant changes in data distribution occur.

## Method Summary
The method formulates online graph learning as a convex optimization problem that minimizes a combination of ℓ1 and ℓ2,1 norms while enforcing graph stationarity constraints. The algorithm uses proximal gradient descent with recursive covariance updates to process streaming graph signals sequentially. At each time step, the algorithm performs one iteration of proximal gradient descent on the time-varying problem, updating the sample covariance submatrix and computing gradients for both the observed node connectivity matrix and the hidden node influence matrix. The approach can handle time-varying graph topologies and provides theoretical guarantees for tracking the ideal batch-wise solution when graph structures don't change too rapidly.

## Key Results
- Improved performance compared to existing methods when accounting for hidden nodes
- Ability to track time-varying graph topologies even under significant data distribution changes
- Good performance on real-world financial data capturing changes in relationships between companies during COVID-19 period

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The method can estimate the connectivity among observed nodes while accounting for hidden nodes by modeling their influence through graph stationarity.
- Mechanism: Graph stationarity implies that the covariance matrix of graph signals commutes with the graph shift operator (GSO). This commutativity allows the authors to model the relationship between observed and hidden nodes through the equation COSO + P = SOCO + P⊤, where P captures the influence of hidden nodes.
- Core assumption: The graph signals are stationary on the underlying graph structure.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We consider signals that are stationary on the underlying graph, which provides a model for the unknown connections to hidden nodes."
  - [section]: "Graph stationarity implies that the matrices CS and SC must be equal... we have that stationarity implies COSO + P = SOCO + P⊤."
- Break condition: If the graph signals are not stationary, the commutativity assumption breaks down, and the model for hidden node influence becomes invalid.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The online proximal gradient algorithm can efficiently track time-varying graph topologies while accounting for hidden nodes.
- Mechanism: At each time step t, the algorithm performs one iteration of proximal gradient descent on the time-varying problem (4), using a recursive update of the sample covariance submatrix. This allows the algorithm to adapt to changes in the graph structure over time.
- Core assumption: The time-varying solution to (4) does not change too rapidly over time.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We present an algorithm based on proximal gradient descent to solve the problem given either a batch or a stream of nodal observations."
  - [section]: "Theorem 1 shows our algorithm can approximate the inefficient but ideal batch-wise solution in (4). In particular, we can ensure that ˆSO,t and ˆPt track the solutions S* O,t and P* t as long as they do not vary too rapidly over time."
- Break condition: If the graph topology changes too rapidly, the online algorithm may not be able to track the time-varying solution effectively.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The ℓ1 and ℓ2,1 norms in the objective function promote parsimonious estimation of the graph structure and the influence of hidden nodes.
- Mechanism: The ℓ1 norm penalty on SO encourages sparse estimation of the observed node connectivity, while the ℓ2,1 norm penalty on P encourages column sparsity, which is suitable for modeling the low-rank influence of hidden nodes.
- Core assumption: The true graph structure and the influence of hidden nodes are sparse or have low rank.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Thus, the ℓ2,1 norm penalty in (3) similarly encourages parsimonious estimation through the matrix P."
- Break condition: If the true graph structure or the influence of hidden nodes is not sparse or low rank, the norm penalties may lead to suboptimal estimation.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph Signal Processing (GSP)
  - Why needed here: The paper relies on GSP concepts such as graph stationarity, graph shift operators, and the relationship between covariance matrices and graph structure.
  - Quick check question: What is the significance of the commutativity between the covariance matrix and the graph shift operator in the context of graph stationarity?

- Concept: Convex Optimization
  - Why needed here: The graph learning problem is formulated as a convex optimization problem, and the proposed algorithm is based on proximal gradient descent, which requires understanding of convex optimization concepts.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the proximal operators in the proposed algorithm, and how do they ensure that the estimated graph structure is feasible?

- Concept: Online Learning and Time-varying Systems
  - Why needed here: The paper addresses the problem of online graph learning from streaming data, where the underlying graph topology may change over time.
  - Quick check question: How does the online proximal gradient algorithm adapt to changes in the graph structure over time, and what are the theoretical guarantees for its performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Streaming graph signals -> Recursive covariance update -> Proximal gradient descent -> Estimated graph structure

- Critical path:
  1. Receive new graph signal at time t
  2. Update sample covariance submatrix using recursive formula (6)
  3. Compute gradients of the objective function with respect to SO and P
  4. Perform proximal gradient descent steps on SO and P
  5. Output estimated graph structure at time t

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Computational efficiency vs. estimation accuracy: Increasing the number of proximal gradient iterations per sample improves accuracy but increases computation time.
  - Adaptivity to time-varying graphs vs. stability: The online algorithm can adapt to changes in the graph structure, but rapid changes may lead to unstable estimates.

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor estimation performance: If the number of hidden nodes is too large relative to the number of observed nodes, or if the graph signals are not stationary.
  - Unstable estimates: If the graph topology changes too rapidly over time.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Synthetic data experiment with known graph structure and hidden nodes to evaluate estimation performance and compare with baseline methods.
  2. Sensitivity analysis of the number of proximal gradient iterations per sample on estimation accuracy and computational efficiency.
  3. Real-world financial data experiment to assess the ability of the method to capture changes in financial relationships between companies in the presence of hidden information.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the theoretical conditions under which the online algorithm can track the time-varying solution obtained by batch-wise estimation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that they provide theoretical guarantees for the performance of their method for estimating both the time-varying subgraph of observed nodes and accounting for the connections between observed and hidden nodes.
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions providing theoretical conditions but does not specify what these conditions are or how they can be verified in practice.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal statement of the theoretical conditions, including specific mathematical expressions or inequalities that must be satisfied, along with a proof of why these conditions ensure tracking performance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the choice of the number of proximal gradient iterations per time step affect the trade-off between estimation accuracy and computational efficiency in online graph learning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that increasing the number of proximal gradient iterations per sample improves the performance of both OnST and OnST-H, but also highlights the necessity of seeking a trade-off between computation time and estimation accuracy.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a systematic study or analysis of how the number of iterations affects the trade-off, nor does it suggest an optimal number of iterations for different scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results showing the relationship between the number of iterations, estimation error, and computational time for various datasets and graph structures, along with a theoretical analysis of the convergence rate and complexity of the algorithm.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How robust is the proposed method to the presence of noise in the observed signals, and what are the theoretical guarantees for the performance in the presence of noise?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on the problem of online graph learning from stationary graph signals in the presence of hidden nodes, but does not explicitly address the issue of noise in the observed signals.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any analysis or results on the performance of the method in the presence of noise, which is a common issue in real-world applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Theoretical analysis of the robustness of the method to noise, including bounds on the estimation error in the presence of noise, as well as empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets with varying levels of noise.

## Limitations
- Theoretical guarantees assume hidden nodes are much fewer than observed nodes (H << O), which may not hold in practice
- Method's performance degrades when graph stationarity is violated or when hidden nodes are too numerous relative to observed nodes
- Real-world financial data experiment provides limited evidence for effectiveness in complex, noisy real-world scenarios

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The proximal gradient algorithm's convergence properties and the theoretical tracking guarantees (Theorem 1) are well-established, given the assumptions hold. The mathematical framework for modeling hidden node influence through graph stationarity is rigorous.
- Medium Confidence: The practical performance improvements over baseline methods are demonstrated but depend on specific parameter choices (µ, ρ) that are not fully specified. The sensitivity to hyperparameter selection and the robustness to violations of graph stationarity assumptions need further validation.
- Low Confidence: The real-world financial data experiment provides limited evidence for the method's effectiveness in complex, noisy real-world scenarios. The COVID-19 period analysis is suggestive but lacks statistical rigor in assessing the significance of detected changes.

## Next Checks
1. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Conduct systematic experiments varying the number of hidden nodes H relative to observed nodes O to quantify the breaking point where estimation performance degrades significantly.

2. **Graph Stationarity Robustness**: Test the method on synthetic data with varying degrees of graph stationarity violation to assess its robustness and identify when the commutativity assumption breaks down.

3. **Hyperparameter Selection**: Implement and test different strategies for selecting the hyperparameters (µ, ρ) and the number of proximal gradient iterations per sample to optimize the trade-off between computational efficiency and estimation accuracy.
