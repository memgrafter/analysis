# Speech Emotion Recognition Using CNN and Its Use Case in Digital Healthcare

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.10741
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10741
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: CNN-based speech emotion recognition achieved 0.5444 precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy on RAVDESS dataset, lower than DNN baseline (0.5583)

## Executive Summary
This thesis investigates speech emotion recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for digital healthcare applications. The research develops a CNN model to classify emotions from audio data using the RAVDESS dataset, comparing its performance against LSTM and DNN models. The study demonstrates the potential of CNN-based approaches for mental health assessment while highlighting the need for improved architectures and larger, more diverse datasets to achieve clinical-grade performance.

## Method Summary
The study employs the RAVDESS dataset containing 1440 audio files with 7 emotions at different intensities. Audio data is converted to spectrograms using Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT), then processed by a CNN architecture with two convolutional layers (32 and 64 filters), max pooling, dropout regularization, and dense layers. The model is trained using 75% of the data with categorical crossentropy loss and Adam optimizer, evaluated on precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy metrics against LSTM and DNN baselines.

## Key Results
- CNN model achieved 0.5444 precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy on emotion classification
- DNN model outperformed CNN with 0.5583 across all metrics
- CNN architecture successfully processed spectrogram inputs but showed moderate performance relative to alternative deep learning approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: CNN layers extract hierarchical acoustic features that improve emotion discrimination compared to handcrafted features.
- Mechanism: Convolutional layers learn local spectral patterns (e.g., pitch contours, formant transitions) at multiple time-frequency resolutions; pooling reduces dimensionality while preserving salient patterns; dense layers integrate features for classification.
- Core assumption: Emotion-related acoustic cues in speech are spatially localized in time-frequency representation and can be captured by learned filters.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The goal of speech emotion recognition... is to identify a nd evaluate the emotional content of spoken language... With the emergence of deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has revolutionized the field..."
  - [section] "The CNN is a powerful deep learning algorithm known for its effectiveness in processing complex data such as speech signals. By leveraging the hierarchical feature extraction capabilities of CNN, I aimed to capture meaningful patterns..."
  - [corpus] Weak corpus match; no direct comparison of CNN vs handcrafted feature performance.
- Break condition: If emotion cues are not spatially localized or require long-range temporal dependencies beyond CNN receptive fields, performance degrades.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: STFT conversion to spectrogram preserves essential emotional information while making it amenable to CNN processing.
- Mechanism: STFT transforms time-domain speech into time-frequency domain, highlighting variations in pitch, energy, and spectral envelope; CNN processes these 2D spectrograms similarly to images, capturing discriminative regions.
- Core assumption: Emotional expression in speech is reliably encoded in the spectral and temporal structure of the signal, which STFT preserves.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) is a widely used technique for analyzing the frequency content of time-varying signals... It breaks down the signal into its constituent frequency components by dividing it into short overlapping windows..."
  - [section] "The resulting spectrogram represents the distribution of different frequency components over time, providing insights into the spectral characteristics of the signal."
  - [corpus] Weak corpus match; no direct empirical evidence of STFT preserving emotion cues.
- Break condition: If emotional cues are not sufficiently captured in the spectrogram or are lost during windowing/overlap, STFT representation fails.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Training/test split and dropout regularization mitigate overfitting, improving generalization to unseen emotion samples.
- Mechanism: 75/25 data split ensures evaluation on unseen data; dropout randomly disables neurons during training, forcing redundancy and reducing co-adaptation; this combination yields a model that generalizes beyond training set.
- Core assumption: The training set is representative of the broader emotion distribution; dropout appropriately balances bias-variance tradeoff.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "I partitioned the dataset into a training set and a separate test set, following a split ratio of 75% for training and 25% for testing... Such a train-test split is commonly employed in machine learning tasks to assess the generalization capability of the model."
  - [section] "To prevent overfitting, a Dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.25 is inserted after the max pooling layer... Another Dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.5 is included after the dense layer."
  - [corpus] Weak corpus match; no explicit mention of dropout effectiveness in cited works.
- Break condition: If the dataset is small or biased, even with dropout the model overfits or fails to generalize.

## Foundational Learning

- STFT and Spectrogram Representation
  - Why needed here: CNN requires structured input; STFT provides time-frequency maps preserving pitch/energy cues essential for emotion detection.
  - Quick check question: What is the main difference between STFT and continuous Fourier Transform regarding time resolution?

- Convolutional Neural Networks for Time-Frequency Data
  - Why needed here: CNN automatically learns discriminative spatial patterns in spectrograms, replacing manual feature engineering.
  - Quick check question: Why are convolutional layers followed by pooling layers beneficial in emotion recognition from spectrograms?

- Overfitting Prevention via Dropout and Data Splits
  - Why needed here: Limited dataset size makes model prone to overfitting; dropout and holdout test set ensure realistic performance estimates.
  - Quick check question: How does dropout reduce overfitting in dense layers of a CNN?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input: STFT spectrogram (time x frequency x 1) -> Conv2D(32,2x2) -> ReLU -> MaxPool2D(2x2) -> Dropout(0.25) -> Conv2D(64,3x3) -> ReLU -> MaxPool2D(2x2) -> Dropout(0.25) -> Flatten -> Dense(128) -> ReLU -> Dropout(0.5) -> Dense(NUM_CLASSES) -> Softmax -> Output probabilities

- Critical path:
  1. Load and preprocess audio -> STFT spectrogram
  2. Feed into CNN pipeline
  3. Forward pass through conv/pool/dropout layers
  4. Dense layers produce class probabilities
  5. Compare with ground truth, compute loss
  6. Backpropagate, update weights
  7. Evaluate on held-out test set

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Fewer filters vs. more expressive power (32->64 chosen)
  - Larger kernels vs. capturing broader patterns (2x2, 3x3 chosen)
  - Higher dropout vs. underfitting (0.25, 0.5 chosen)
  - Dense layer size vs. overfitting (128 units chosen)

- Failure signatures:
  - Training accuracy high, validation accuracy low -> overfitting
  - Both accuracies low -> underfitting or bad feature extraction
  - Loss plateauing early -> learning rate too low or data issue

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train CNN on spectrograms without dropout; observe overfitting.
  2. Add dropout layers; measure impact on validation accuracy.
  3. Compare CNN performance to baseline LSTM/DNN on same dataset.

## Limitations
- CNN model achieved only moderate performance (0.5444) compared to DNN baseline (0.5583)
- Small dataset size (1440 samples) limits model's ability to learn robust emotion representations
- Spectrogram representation may not capture all temporal dynamics of emotional expression

## Confidence
- CNN effectiveness for emotion recognition: Medium (moderate performance but not state-of-the-art)
- CNN superiority over other architectures: Low (DNN outperformed CNN)
- STFT spectrogram preservation of emotional information: Medium (mechanism lacks direct empirical validation)

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Test the trained CNN model on additional emotion recognition datasets (e.g., IEMOCAP, SAVEE) to assess generalizability beyond RAVDESS.
2. **Ablation study**: Remove dropout layers or modify STFT parameters to quantify their specific impact on model performance and overfitting.
3. **Architectural comparison**: Implement and compare CNN with attention mechanisms or hybrid CNN-LSTM models to determine if combining spatial and temporal processing improves emotion recognition accuracy.
