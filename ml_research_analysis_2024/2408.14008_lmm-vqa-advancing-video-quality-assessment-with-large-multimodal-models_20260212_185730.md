# LMM-VQA: Advancing Video Quality Assessment with Large Multimodal Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.14008
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14008
- Reference count: 40
- LMM-VQA achieves state-of-the-art performance across five VQA benchmarks with 5% improvement in generalization ability

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LMM-VQA, the first large multimodal model (LMM) designed specifically for video quality assessment (VQA). The approach reformulates quality regression as a question-answering task and employs a novel spatiotemporal visual modeling strategy to capture both spatial and temporal distortions in videos. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance across five VQA benchmarks while demonstrating strong generalization capabilities and versatility in general video understanding tasks.

## Method Summary
LMM-VQA is a large multimodal model that reformulates VQA as a question-answering task, using a spatiotemporal enhanced visual encoder to extract spatial and temporal features separately. The model processes videos through a two-branch encoder (2D for spatial features, 3D for temporal features), maps these features into language space using separate projectors, and uses a large language model (LLM) to generate quality scores. The approach uses instruction tuning on Q&A pairs derived from VQA datasets, with pair-wised training to improve performance.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance across five VQA benchmarks (LSVQ, KoNViD-1k, YouTube-UGC, LIVE-VQC, LIVE-YT-Gaming)
- Improves average generalization ability by 5% compared to existing methods
- Demonstrates versatility in general video understanding tasks beyond quality assessment
- Outperforms traditional VQA methods that rely on hand-crafted features or deep learning features

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Reformulating quality regression into a question-answering task enables better alignment with LMMs' natural language processing strengths. By constructing Q&A prompts with system prompts, instruction prompts, and response restrictions, the model leverages the LMM's ability to process instructions and generate structured outputs (quality scores and levels).

### Mechanism 2
The spatiotemporal enhanced visual encoder captures both spatial and temporal distortions effectively by using separate 2D and 3D encoders. Spatial features are extracted from sparse key frames while temporal features are extracted from continuous frames, allowing the model to capture distinct types of distortions.

### Mechanism 3
The spatiotemporal projector effectively aligns visual tokens with language space, enabling the LLM to process video quality features. Spatial and temporal features are mapped into language space using separate projectors (spatial: ViT-based; temporal: MLP), facilitating modality alignment for the LLM.

## Foundational Learning

- **Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and instruction tuning**: Understanding how LMMs can be adapted for VQA tasks through instruction tuning is crucial for implementing LMM-VQA. *Quick check: What are the key components of an effective instruction tuning pipeline for adapting LMMs to new tasks?*

- **Video quality assessment (VQA) and spatial/temporal distortions**: Recognizing the unique challenges in VQA, such as diverse video content and complex spatial and temporal distortions, is essential for designing an effective model. *Quick check: How do spatial and temporal distortions differ in their impact on video quality, and why is it important to address both in VQA?*

- **Spatiotemporal feature extraction and modality alignment**: Understanding how to extract and align spatial and temporal features for use in LMMs is critical for implementing the spatiotemporal encoder and projector components of LMM-VQA. *Quick check: What are the advantages and disadvantages of using separate 2D and 3D encoders for spatial and temporal feature extraction compared to a unified approach?*

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Video Preprocessor -> Spatiotemporal Enhanced Visual Encoder -> Spatiotemporal Projector -> LLM with Q&A Instruction Prompts -> Quality scores and levels

- **Critical path**: Video input → Video Preprocessor → Spatiotemporal Enhanced Visual Encoder → Spatiotemporal Projector → LLM with Q&A Instruction Prompts → Quality scores and levels

- **Design tradeoffs**: Separate 2D and 3D encoders for spatial and temporal features increase model complexity but may capture distinct distortion types more effectively; using a large LLM (Llama-3) enables powerful language processing but requires significant computational resources; multi-task training may improve performance but could introduce confusion if quality distributions differ between training and test sets

- **Failure signatures**: Poor performance on spatial distortions may indicate issues with the 2D encoder or spatial projector; poor performance on temporal distortions may indicate issues with the 3D encoder or temporal projector; failure to generate accurate quality scores may indicate problems with the LLM or Q&A instruction tuning; overfitting to training data may suggest insufficient regularization or need for more diverse training data

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Evaluate the performance of the spatiotemporal enhanced visual encoder with and without temporal tokens on a VQA benchmark to assess the impact of temporal information
  2. Compare the performance of different projection modules (MLP, Perceiver, ViT) for modality alignment to determine the most effective approach
  3. Test the impact of multi-task training (quality score regression and classification) on VQA performance to assess the benefits and potential drawbacks of this approach

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How would the proposed LMM-VQA model perform with different LLM architectures (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) as the decoder, and what architectural changes would be needed? The paper only tested two LLM variants (Llama-2 and Llama-3) from the same family, leaving questions about how other LLM architectures would perform.

### Open Question 2
What is the minimum amount of training data required for LMM-VQA to achieve competitive performance, and how does performance scale with data size? The paper only tested discrete data proportions (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) without exploring the relationship between data size and performance in detail.

### Open Question 3
How does the spatiotemporal enhanced visual encoder compare to end-to-end video understanding models like Video Swin Transformers for VQA tasks? The paper introduces a novel spatiotemporal encoder but doesn't compare it to state-of-the-art video models that could potentially handle spatiotemporal features more effectively.

## Limitations
- The Q&A reformulation mechanism needs empirical comparison with traditional regression approaches to confirm its effectiveness
- The separate spatial and temporal feature extraction approach adds complexity, and its benefits over unified methods are not conclusively demonstrated
- The modality alignment using separate projectors is innovative but lacks ablation studies to quantify its impact on performance

## Confidence
- **State-of-the-art performance claim**: High - quantitative results across five benchmarks provide strong evidence
- **Spatiotemporal modeling effectiveness**: Medium - novel approach but limited empirical evidence compared to unified methods
- **Q&A reformulation benefits**: Medium - theoretical justification reasonable but lacks direct comparisons with traditional regression

## Next Checks
1. Conduct an ablation study comparing the performance of LMM-VQA with and without the temporal tokens to quantify the impact of temporal information on video quality assessment

2. Perform a direct comparison between the separate 2D and 3D encoder approach and a unified encoder approach to assess the benefits and drawbacks of the added complexity in LMM-VQA

3. Compare the performance of LMM-VQA using the Q&A reformulation approach with a traditional regression approach on the same VQA benchmarks to validate the claimed benefits of the Q&A reformulation
