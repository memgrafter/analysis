# On the Efficacy of Text-Based Input Modalities for Action Anticipation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.12972
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12972
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: M-CAT achieves state-of-the-art action anticipation performance on EpicKitchens datasets using text-based modalities

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a Multi-modal Contrastive Anticipative Transformer (M-CAT) that leverages text-based input modalities for action anticipation in egocentric videos. The model uses natural language descriptions of actions and objects to provide contextual cues that significantly improve performance compared to using only visual modalities. M-CAT employs a two-stage training process: contrastive pre-training to align video clips with descriptions of future actions, followed by fine-tuning to predict future actions. The approach demonstrates state-of-the-art results on the EpicKitchens-100 and EpicKitchens-55 datasets, particularly excelling in class-mean Recall@5 metrics.

## Method Summary
M-CAT uses a two-stage training process to learn action anticipation from multi-modal features and text descriptions. First, the model learns to align video clips with rich text descriptions of future actions through contrastive pre-training. This involves extracting features from RGB, optical flow, audio, and text modalities, then using a self-attention fuser to combine these features. The model contrasts these fused features against text embeddings computed from future action descriptions. In the second stage, the model is fine-tuned to predict future actions while keeping the fusion and anticipation modules frozen. The approach leverages frozen pre-trained language models to obtain embeddings for text descriptions, using the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs to generate rich descriptions of actions and objects.

## Key Results
- M-CAT outperforms previous methods on EpicKitchens-100 and EpicKitchens-55 datasets
- Text-based modalities, particularly action descriptions, provide valuable contextual cues for action anticipation
- Class-mean Recall@5 improves significantly compared to visual-only approaches
- Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy improvements across actions, verbs, and nouns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Contrastive pre-training aligns multi-modal video features with text embeddings of future actions, improving action anticipation accuracy
- Mechanism: The model fuses features from video, audio, flow, and text (objects/actions) using a self-attention fuser, then contrasts these fused features against rich text descriptions of future actions
- Core assumption: The rich text descriptions generated by LLMs provide meaningful contextual cues about future actions that complement visual and other modality features
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions M-CAT "jointly learns from multi-modal features and text descriptions of actions and objects"; Section describes CLIP-like setup contrasting embeddings against text descriptions
- Break condition: If the LLM-generated text descriptions don't capture relevant context about future actions, the contrastive alignment will not improve performance

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Using text descriptions of detected objects and actions provides additional contextual information that improves action anticipation
- Mechanism: The model generates text descriptions of objects and actions present in the video and encodes these using a frozen CLIP text encoder
- Core assumption: The text descriptions of current objects and actions contain information that helps disambiguate future actions
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions learning from "text descriptions of actions and objects"; Section describes generating sentences for current actions in the video
- Break condition: If the object/action detection is inaccurate or the text descriptions don't capture relevant context, this mechanism will not improve performance

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The two-stage training process (contrastive pre-training followed by fine-tuning) improves action anticipation performance
- Mechanism: First, the model learns to align multi-modal features with rich text descriptions of future actions through contrastive pre-training. Then, the model is fine-tuned to predict future actions using the learned representations
- Core assumption: Pre-training the model to align features with future action descriptions provides better initialization for the action anticipation task than training from scratch
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states model "first learns to align video clips with descriptions of future actions, and is subsequently fine-tuned to predict future actions"; Section describes the two-stage training procedure
- Break condition: If the pre-training doesn't effectively align features with future action descriptions, the subsequent fine-tuning will not benefit from the pre-trained weights

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contrastive learning
  - Why needed here: The model uses contrastive pre-training to align multi-modal features with text embeddings of future actions, which requires understanding how contrastive learning works
  - Quick check question: What is the goal of contrastive learning, and how does it differ from traditional supervised learning?

- Concept: Transformer architectures
  - Why needed here: The model uses transformer-based modules for feature fusion and anticipation, requiring understanding of self-attention and transformer components
  - Quick check question: How does self-attention in transformers allow the model to weigh the importance of different input elements?

- Concept: Multi-modal feature fusion
  - Why needed here: The model fuses features from video, audio, flow, and text modalities, requiring understanding of how to combine information from different sources
  - Quick check question: What are the key considerations when fusing features from different modalities, and how can modality-specific characteristics be preserved?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: RGB video features → Swin transformer → Text encoder (CLIP) → Self-Attention Fuser → Anticipative module (GPT-2) → Classifier → Action prediction

- Critical path: Input videos → modality feature extraction → text description generation → text encoding → modality fusion → feature anticipation → action prediction

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using pre-trained feature extractors vs. training from scratch (tradeoff between performance and computational cost)
  - Freezing the text encoder vs. fine-tuning it (tradeoff between leveraging pre-trained knowledge and adapting to task-specific language)
  - Two-stage training vs. end-to-end training (tradeoff between effective initialization and potential loss of task-specific adaptation)

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on action anticipation could indicate issues with: Contrastive pre-training not effectively aligning features with future action descriptions; Modality fusion not effectively combining information from different sources; LLM-generated text descriptions not capturing relevant context about future actions

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the impact of using text descriptions of detected objects and actions as additional modalities
  2. Test different training strategies (e.g., single-stage vs. two-stage training)
  3. Analyze the effect of action recognition accuracy on action anticipation performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive evaluation of M-CAT's performance on a diverse set of action anticipation datasets, compared to other state-of-the-art methods, would provide insights into its strengths and limitations in different scenarios

## Limitations
- Relies on pre-trained models for feature extraction and text generation, which may not generalize well to other datasets or domains
- Limited ablation studies on the importance of different modality combinations
- No analysis of computational efficiency or comparison with real-time requirements for practical applications

## Confidence

- Mechanism 1: Medium - While the contrastive pre-training approach shows promise, the paper doesn't fully explore the sensitivity of performance to the quality of LLM-generated text descriptions
- Mechanism 2: Medium - The effectiveness of text descriptions depends heavily on the accuracy of the underlying detection models, which isn't thoroughly analyzed
- Mechanism 3: Low-Medium - The two-stage training process shows benefits, but the paper doesn't adequately compare against other training strategies or justify why this particular approach is optimal

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation Study**: Systematically remove each modality (video, audio, flow, text) to quantify their individual contributions to performance improvements

2. **Detection Error Analysis**: Evaluate how action anticipation performance degrades with varying levels of object/action detection accuracy to understand robustness requirements

3. **Alternative Training Strategies**: Compare the two-stage training approach against end-to-end training and other pre-training/fine-tuning combinations to validate the claimed benefits
