# Enhancing Event Causality Identification with Rationale and Structure-Aware Causal Question Answering

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2403.11129
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11129
- **Reference count:** 26
- **Primary result:** Transforms document-level event causality identification into a multiple-choice QA task, achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art discriminative models while outperforming other generative approaches.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of document-level event causality identification (DECI) by proposing a novel framework that leverages generative large language models. The key insight is to transform the causality identification task into a multiple-choice question answering problem, where observed events are presented as questions and candidate events as options. The framework enhances reasoning by incorporating rationales generated by larger language models and linearized event causality graphs. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that this approach achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art discriminative models while significantly outperforming existing generative methods, establishing a new baseline for generative approaches to event causality identification.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework transforms DECI into a multiple-choice question answering task by constructing questions from observed events and providing candidate events as answer options. To enhance reasoning capabilities, the framework generates rationales using larger language models to provide reasoning explanations for each candidate event. Additionally, it incorporates linearized event causality graphs that capture the structural relationships between events. These components are integrated into a generative model that processes the question, options, rationales, and linearized ECG simultaneously to predict the correct causal event. The approach leverages the reasoning capabilities of large language models while addressing the limitations of existing generative methods through the incorporation of structured information and explicit reasoning rationales.

## Key Results
- The framework achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art discriminative models on EventStoryLine and Causal-TimeBank datasets
- Integrating rationales and linearized ECG representations improves causal identification accuracy
- Optimal performance achieved using four candidate events plus one unrelated event as options
- Rationales generated by larger language models prove more effective than those from smaller models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by transforming a complex causal reasoning task into a structured multiple-choice question answering format that generative models can handle more effectively. By providing explicit rationales and linearized event causality graph representations, the framework guides the model's reasoning process and supplies additional context about event relationships. The multiple-choice format constrains the search space while the rationales offer step-by-step reasoning that helps the model understand causal connections. The linearized ECG captures structural dependencies between events in a format that can be processed by sequence-based models, providing crucial relational information that would otherwise be difficult for generative models to infer from text alone.

## Foundational Learning
- **Event Causality Identification (ECI):** The task of determining causal relationships between events in text. *Why needed:* This is the core problem being addressed, requiring models to understand how events influence each other.
- **Document-level vs Sentence-level ECI:** Document-level analysis considers broader context across multiple sentences, while sentence-level focuses on local relationships. *Why needed:* The paper targets document-level causality, which is more challenging but more practical for real-world applications.
- **Multiple-choice QA Format:** Presenting a question with predefined answer options rather than open-ended generation. *Why needed:* This format constrains the output space and makes the task more manageable for generative models.
- **Rationale Generation:** Creating explicit reasoning explanations to support model predictions. *Why needed:* Provides interpretable reasoning steps and additional context that guides the model's decision-making process.
- **Event Causality Graph (ECG):** A graph structure representing events as nodes and causal relationships as edges. *Why needed:* Captures structural dependencies between events that are crucial for understanding complex causal chains.
- **Graph Linearization:** Converting graph structures into sequential representations. *Why needed:* Enables graph information to be processed by sequence-based language models while preserving relational information.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Observed Event -> Question Construction -> Candidate Events -> Rationale Generation -> Linearized ECG -> Multiple-choice QA Model -> Causal Prediction

**Critical Path:** The most critical processing path involves constructing the question from the observed event, generating rationales for each candidate event, linearizing the ECG, and processing all components through the multiple-choice QA model to produce the final causal prediction.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The framework trades computational efficiency for improved performance by generating rationales and linearizing ECGs. While this adds processing overhead, it provides the structured information necessary for generative models to perform well on causality identification. The multiple-choice format limits output flexibility but significantly improves accuracy.

**Failure Signatures:** The model may fail when rationales are incorrect or incomplete, when ECG linearization loses critical structural information, or when the candidate event pool doesn't contain the true causal event. Performance degradation may also occur with documents containing complex, nested causality or when events are described ambiguously.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Evaluate baseline performance without rationales or ECG linearization to measure their individual contributions
2. Test different numbers of candidate events (2, 3, 4, 5) to determine optimal pool size
3. Compare rationale quality from different sized language models to quantify their impact on performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation restricted to two specific benchmark datasets, limiting generalizability to other domains or languages
- Performance gap remains significant between generative and discriminative approaches, with no superiority demonstrated
- Linearization of event causality graphs may lose structural information critical for understanding complex causal relationships
- Reliance on rationales generated by larger language models introduces computational overhead and potential scalability issues
- Does not address potential biases in generated rationales or examine model robustness to noisy or incomplete input

## Confidence

**High Confidence:** The core methodology of transforming DECI into a multiple-choice QA task with rationale and structure-aware components is well-supported by experimental results. The observation that larger language models generate more effective rationales is empirically validated.

**Medium Confidence:** Claims about optimal hyperparameter settings (four events plus one unrelated event as options, weight of 0.5 for answer generation) are based on ablation studies but may not generalize across different datasets or contexts. The comparative performance against discriminative models is well-established but does not indicate superiority.

**Low Confidence:** The claim that this approach provides a new baseline for future research in generative models for event causality identification is premature given the limited evaluation scope and the significant performance gap with discriminative methods.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-Domain Validation:** Test the framework on additional event causality datasets from different domains (e.g., news articles, scientific literature, social media) to assess generalizability beyond the EventStoryLine and Causal-TimeBank datasets.

2. **Ablation Study on Graph Linearization:** Conduct experiments comparing different graph linearization strategies and evaluate whether preserving more structural information (e.g., through graph neural networks or attention mechanisms over the graph structure) could improve performance.

3. **Computational Efficiency Analysis:** Measure and compare the computational resources required for rationale generation versus inference time, and evaluate whether the performance gains justify the additional computational costs in practical applications.
