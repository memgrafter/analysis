# Multimodal Learning with Uncertainty Quantification based on Discounted Belief Fusion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.18024
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18024
- Reference count: 24
- This paper introduces Discounted Belief Fusion (DBF), a multimodal learning method that improves uncertainty quantification in the presence of conflicting information.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of multimodal learning with conflicting information by introducing Discounted Belief Fusion (DBF), a method that quantifies uncertainty while distinguishing between conflicting and non-conflicting samples. The approach uses evidential neural networks to extract subjective opinions from each modality, then applies a conflict-based discounting mechanism to adjust belief masses when unreliable modalities are detected. Unlike previous methods that either ignore conflicts or treat them uniformly, DBF increases uncertainty estimates specifically for conflictive decisions while maintaining high classification accuracy. The method demonstrates strong performance across five multimodal datasets, achieving AUC scores up to 1.00 on Caltech dataset and 0.80 on HandWritten dataset for conflict detection.

## Method Summary
DBF combines evidential neural networks with a conflict-based discounting mechanism and generalized belief averaging fusion. The method extracts subjective opinions (evidence values) from each modality using evidential neural networks with exponential activation functions. It then computes a conflict matrix to assess pairwise conflicts between modalities, derives discounting factors based on the agreement matrix, and applies discounting to beliefs and uncertainties. Finally, it fuses the discounted opinions using generalized belief averaging that is order-invariant and scalable to multiple modalities. The approach is trained using a three-part loss function combining cross-entropy, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and consistency loss.

## Key Results
- DBF outperforms baseline methods in detecting conflicting samples, achieving AUC scores up to 1.00 on Caltech dataset and 0.80 on HandWritten dataset
- The method maintains high classification accuracy across all tested benchmarks while providing better reliability assessment
- DBF demonstrates effective distinction between conflicting and non-conflicting samples through uncertainty estimates

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The conflict-based discounting mechanism reallocates uncertain mass when unreliable modalities are detected, improving uncertainty quantification.
- Mechanism: When the degree of conflict between modalities is high, the discounting factor ηv is computed using the agreement matrix, which discounts belief masses of conflicting modalities and reallocates them to uncertainty. This ensures that decisions based on conflicting information carry higher uncertainty estimates.
- Core assumption: The degree of conflict between modalities is a reliable indicator of their reliability.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "introduce a conflict-based discounting mechanism that reallocates uncertain mass when unreliable modalities are detected"
  - [section]: "we propose the Discounted Belief Fusion (DBF) solution to mitigate this issue. The general pipeline of the DBF approach is shown in Figure 1."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; no direct mention of discounted belief fusion in corpus. The corpus papers discuss uncertainty-aware multimodal learning but do not specifically address discounted belief fusion or conflict-based discounting.
- Break condition: If the degree of conflict does not correlate with the actual reliability of the modalities, the discounting mechanism will incorrectly allocate uncertainty.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The generalized belief averaging fusion operator is order-invariant and scalable to multiple modalities.
- Mechanism: Unlike the standard pairwise averaging belief fusion, the generalized version incorporates all V sources simultaneously with equal weighting, avoiding the imbalance in evidence contributions that occurs with sequential pairwise fusion.
- Core assumption: The order in which modalities are fused should not affect the final result.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "combined with a generalized belief averaging fusion operator that is order-invariant and scalable to multiple modalities"
  - [section]: "To make the fusion process scalable and efficient for many sources, we suggest to use the generalized version of the belief averaging fusion for multiple sources (Jøsang et al., 2017)"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; corpus papers discuss multimodal fusion but do not specifically address order-invariance or the generalized belief averaging fusion operator.
- Break condition: If the generalized belief averaging fusion introduces biases or artifacts not present in the sequential pairwise approach, the order-invariance assumption may be violated.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The proposed approach effectively distinguishes between conflicting and non-conflicting samples based on uncertainty estimates.
- Mechanism: By increasing uncertainty estimates for conflictive decisions, the method provides better reliability assessment without compromising predictive performance. This allows for more accurate detection of conflicting samples.
- Core assumption: Higher uncertainty estimates for conflictive decisions will lead to better separation between conflicting and non-conflicting samples.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "unlike the previous work, the proposed approach effectively distinguishes between conflicting and non-conflicting samples based on the provided uncertainty estimates"
  - [section]: "We provide an experimental validation of our proposed approach, and open-source the source code in a public repository"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; corpus papers discuss uncertainty quantification but do not specifically address the distinction between conflicting and non-conflicting samples based on uncertainty estimates.
- Break condition: If the uncertainty estimates do not accurately reflect the reliability of the decisions, the distinction between conflicting and non-conflicting samples will be compromised.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Subjective Logic and Uncertainty
  - Why needed here: The paper uses subjective logic to model classification uncertainty by learning evidence scores for each class, which are then used in the discounted belief fusion process.
  - Quick check question: What are the three components of a subjective opinion in subjective logic, and how do they relate to the Dirichlet distribution parameters?

- Concept: Evidence Accumulation and Fusion
  - Why needed here: The paper builds upon evidence accumulation and fusion methods to combine information from multiple modalities, addressing the shortcomings of existing approaches in handling conflicts.
  - Quick check question: How does the generalized belief averaging fusion operator differ from the standard pairwise averaging belief fusion, and why is this difference important for handling multiple modalities?

- Concept: Degree of Conflict
  - Why needed here: The degree of conflict is used to assess the amount of conflict between modalities, which is then used to compute the discounting factors for the discounted belief fusion.
  - Quick check question: What are the three components of the degree of conflict measure, and how do they contribute to the overall assessment of conflict between modalities?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Evidential Neural Networks -> Conflict Matrix Computation -> Discounting Factor Calculation -> Discounted Belief Fusion -> Loss Functions

- Critical path:
  1. Forward pass through evidential neural networks to obtain opinions
  2. Compute conflict matrix and agreement matrix
  3. Calculate discounting factors and apply discounting
  4. Fuse discounted opinions using generalized belief averaging
  5. Compute loss and perform backpropagation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Computational cost vs. accuracy: The conflict matrix computation has quadratic time complexity relative to the number of modalities, but the practical time overhead remains low due to the typically small number of modalities
  - Sensitivity to hyperparameter λ: The choice of λ controls the strictness of discounting based on conflict, requiring careful tuning for optimal performance

- Failure signatures:
  - Low separation between conflictive and non-conflictive samples: Indicates that the discounting mechanism is not effectively capturing the degree of conflict
  - Degraded classification accuracy: Suggests that the discounting or fusion process is introducing errors or biases
  - High computational cost: May indicate that the conflict matrix computation or discounting process is inefficient

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the discounting mechanism on a simple two-modality dataset with known conflicts to verify that uncertainty increases appropriately
  2. Evaluate the order-invariance of the generalized belief averaging fusion by fusing modalities in different orders and comparing results
  3. Assess the impact of the hyperparameter λ on the separation between conflictive and non-conflictive samples using a validation set

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the Discounted Belief Fusion (DBF) method perform on larger multimodal benchmark datasets like LUMA, which are specifically designed for uncertainty-aware multimodal learning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention plans to validate their approach using larger benchmark datasets designed for uncertainty-aware multimodal learning, such as the LUMA dataset.
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates DBF on five relatively small multimodal datasets (HandWritten, CUB, Scene15, Caltech101, and PIE). These datasets may not fully represent the complexity and scale of real-world multimodal applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing DBF on larger, more diverse multimodal datasets like LUMA would demonstrate its scalability and effectiveness in more complex scenarios.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of DBF change when modality interactions and dependency structures are explicitly modeled and incorporated into the uncertainty quantification strategy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors plan to explore modality interactions and dependency structures in future work to enhance their uncertainty quantification strategy.
- Why unresolved: The current DBF approach treats modalities independently and does not account for potential interactions or dependencies between them. Incorporating these relationships could potentially improve uncertainty quantification.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparing DBF's performance with and without explicit modeling of modality interactions and dependencies would quantify the impact of these relationships on uncertainty quantification.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How sensitive is DBF's performance to the choice of the hyperparameter λ, and what are the optimal strategies for selecting λ in different application domains?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper demonstrates that the parameter λ controls the strictness of discounting and suggests that its choice can be made using a validation set or based on problem-specific requirements.
- Why unresolved: While the paper shows that λ affects the uncertainty distributions, it does not provide a systematic method for selecting λ or analyze its sensitivity across different datasets and application domains.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive sensitivity analysis of λ across various datasets and domains, along with guidelines for selecting λ based on application-specific characteristics, would clarify its impact on DBF's performance.

## Limitations
- Limited empirical validation scope with only five relatively small multimodal datasets
- Reliance on the assumption that degree of conflict reliably indicates modality reliability
- Absence of direct comparison with state-of-the-art multimodal uncertainty quantification methods on standardized benchmarks

## Confidence
- Theoretical foundation: High
- Experimental results: Medium-High
- Novelty claims: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test DBF on datasets with known, severe modality conflicts to verify the discounting mechanism's robustness under extreme conditions
2. Evaluate the sensitivity of results to the hyperparameter λ through systematic ablation studies
3. Compare DBF's performance against state-of-the-art multimodal uncertainty quantification methods on a standardized benchmark to establish relative effectiveness
