# LLM Reasoners: New Evaluation, Library, and Analysis of Step-by-Step Reasoning with Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2404.05221
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05221
- **Reference count**: 39
- **Primary result**: Introduces AutoRace evaluation method and LLM Reasoners library to analyze step-by-step reasoning chains

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the limitations of answer-only evaluation for LLM reasoning by introducing AutoRace, an automatic evaluation method that generates task-specific criteria to assess reasoning chains step-by-step. The authors also develop LLM Reasoners, a modular library implementing diverse reasoning algorithms under a unified formulation. Through extensive experiments across six reasoning tasks, the study reveals key insights about reasoning strategies, finding that reward-guided search methods like Tree-of-Thoughts reduce false positive chains compared to Chain-of-Thought, breadth of search matters more than depth for most tasks, and world models significantly improve reasoning in embodied environments.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces AutoRace, which automatically generates evaluation criteria for reasoning chains by prompting LLMs to create task-specific rubrics, then uses these rubrics to evaluate each step of reasoning chains rather than just final answers. LLM Reasoners provides a modular library implementing various reasoning algorithms including Chain-of-Thought, Tree-of-Thoughts, and reward-guided search under a unified framework. The evaluation combines automatic step-by-step assessment with human evaluation to validate findings. The analysis spans six diverse reasoning tasks, comparing multiple LLMs and reasoning strategies while examining factors like search breadth versus depth and the impact of world models.

## Key Results
- Reward-guided search methods like Tree-of-Thoughts reduce false positive reasoning chains compared to Chain-of-Thought
- Breadth of search is generally more important than depth for most reasoning tasks
- Explicit world models significantly improve reasoning performance in embodied environments
- AutoRace detects 70.4% of false positive reasoning chains missed by answer-based evaluation
- GPT-4 and Claude-3 demonstrate the strongest reasoning abilities across tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper's approach works because it addresses a fundamental limitation in LLM reasoning evaluation: current methods only check final answers, missing errors in intermediate reasoning steps that can lead to correct but invalid conclusions. By generating task-specific evaluation criteria automatically and applying them to each step of reasoning chains, AutoRace captures the logical validity of the entire reasoning process. The modular library implementation enables systematic comparison of different reasoning algorithms under consistent conditions, revealing which architectural choices (like search breadth vs depth) most impact performance.

## Foundational Learning

**Automatic evaluation generation** - AutoRace prompts LLMs to create task-specific rubrics, then uses these rubrics to evaluate reasoning steps. Why needed: Standard evaluation only checks final answers, missing reasoning errors. Quick check: Verify rubric quality by comparing against human-annotated step-by-step evaluation.

**Unified reasoning formulation** - LLM Reasoners implements diverse algorithms under a common framework with consistent interfaces. Why needed: Enables fair comparison across different reasoning approaches. Quick check: Confirm modular components can be swapped without breaking functionality.

**Reward-guided search** - Tree-of-Thoughts and similar methods use intermediate rewards to guide reasoning paths. Why needed: Helps avoid invalid reasoning chains that happen to reach correct answers. Quick check: Compare reasoning chain validity rates between reward-guided and non-guided approaches.

**Search breadth vs depth tradeoff** - Different tasks benefit from varying levels of exploration breadth versus reasoning depth. Why needed: Optimizing this tradeoff improves reasoning efficiency and accuracy. Quick check: Measure performance changes when adjusting breadth/depth parameters across tasks.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: AutoRace -> Evaluation Criteria Generator -> Step-by-Step Evaluator -> Results Aggregator

**Critical path**: LLM Reasoners library implements reasoning algorithms → Reasoning chains generated → AutoRace evaluates each step → Performance metrics calculated

**Design tradeoffs**: The paper balances evaluation automation (AutoRace) against potential bias from prompt engineering, and modular library design against implementation complexity. Reward-guided search trades computational cost for improved reasoning validity.

**Failure signatures**: Answer-only evaluation misses invalid reasoning chains; limited search breadth traps reasoning in local optima; absence of world models fails in embodied tasks; prompt format design can create false positives in specific domains.

**First experiments**: 1) Compare AutoRace step-by-step evaluation against human evaluation on reasoning chains; 2) Test search breadth vs depth parameters across different reasoning tasks; 3) Evaluate reasoning performance with and without world models in embodied environments.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Findings based on six reasoning tasks may not capture full diversity of reasoning challenges
- AutoRace evaluation relies on prompt engineering which could introduce bias
- Library implementation may not represent all possible reasoning approaches
- Model performance differences could be influenced by factors beyond reasoning ability

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Relative effectiveness of reward-guided search versus Chain-of-Thought, importance of breadth over depth in search, and role of world models in embodied reasoning - supported by consistent results across multiple tasks and model comparisons.

**Medium confidence**: Quantitative claim that AutoRace detects 70.4% of false positive chains - depends on evaluation methodology and task selection, though general finding that step-by-step evaluation catches errors missed by answer-only assessment is robust.

**Low confidence**: Ranking of specific models' reasoning abilities (GPT-4 and Claude-3 as strongest) - could be influenced by confounding factors like prompt engineering, task selection, and specific evaluation criteria used.

## Next Checks
1. Test AutoRace on a broader set of reasoning tasks, including those outside current domains, to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies on prompt engineering components of AutoRace to quantify impact on evaluation accuracy
3. Implement additional reasoning algorithms not covered in current library to test whether reported findings hold across wider algorithmic space
