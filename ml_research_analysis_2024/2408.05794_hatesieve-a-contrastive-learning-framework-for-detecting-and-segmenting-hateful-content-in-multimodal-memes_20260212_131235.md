# HateSieve: A Contrastive Learning Framework for Detecting and Segmenting Hateful Content in Multimodal Memes

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.05794
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05794
- Authors: Xuanyu Su; Yansong Li; Diana Inkpen; Nathalie Japkowicz
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: 71.64% F1-score with 3.61M parameters on Hateful Memes Dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper presents HATESIEVE, a framework for detecting and segmenting hateful content in multimodal memes. The key innovation is a Contrastive Meme Generator that creates context-correlated triplet datasets by generating semantically similar but contrasting hateful and non-hateful meme pairs, addressing the scarcity of detailed annotations in existing datasets. The framework also introduces an Image-Text Alignment module with contrastive learning pre-training to produce context-aware embeddings for accurate meme segmentation. Experiments show HATESIEVE achieves competitive performance with only 3.61M trainable parameters, outperforming existing large multimodal models while requiring fewer resources.

## Method Summary
HATESIEVE operates in two phases: first, a Contrastive Meme Generator (CMGen) creates triplet datasets by generating non-hateful versions of hateful memes using InstructBLIP and SDXL, then finding semantically similar hateful pairs from external datasets. Second, an Image-Text Alignment (ITA) module with contrastive learning pre-training learns to align visual and textual embeddings through self-attention mechanisms. The framework is then fine-tuned for classification and produces attention maps for segmentation. The approach addresses the lack of detailed annotations by synthetically generating context-correlated meme pairs.

## Key Results
- Achieves 71.64% F1-score on Hateful Memes Dataset
- Uses only 3.61M trainable parameters (vs 1.12B for larger models)
- Outperforms existing large multimodal models while maintaining parameter efficiency
- Excels at identifying and isolating hateful content through detailed segmentation of visual and textual components

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: CMGen fills annotation scarcity by creating context-correlated triplet datasets
- Mechanism: Generates semantically similar hateful and non-hateful meme pairs within same contextual scenarios
- Core assumption: Context-correlated pairs capture meaningful hateful/non-hateful distinctions
- Evidence anchors: CMGen generates pairs using InstructBLIP for text and SDXL for images, then uses FAISS for similarity search

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: ITA module with pre-training produces context-aware attention maps for accurate segmentation
- Mechanism: Self-attention integrates image and text embeddings, creating token-level representations
- Core assumption: Attention maps effectively capture contextual relationships between visual and textual components
- Evidence anchors: ITA uses CLIP encoder and self-attention mechanism to extract aligned token-level representations

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Contrastive learning pre-training on triplet datasets improves classification performance
- Mechanism: Pre-training on context-correlated triplets using contrastive loss enables discriminative feature learning
- Core assumption: Contrastive learning on carefully constructed triplets transfers better than direct classification training
- Evidence anchors: Ablation studies show modifying pre-training strategy negatively impacts model performance

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contrastive learning and triplet loss
  - Why needed here: Enables learning discriminative features between hateful and non-hateful content using generated context-correlated pairs
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between contrastive learning and standard classification training in terms of feature learning?

- Concept: Multimodal representation learning
  - Why needed here: Combines visual and textual information to understand memes where hate speech emerges from interaction between modalities
  - Quick check question: Why can't we simply classify text and images separately for meme hate speech detection?

- Concept: Attention mechanisms and self-attention
  - Why needed here: Generates token-level attention maps that highlight specific visual and textual components contributing to hateful content
  - Quick check question: How does self-attention help in understanding the relationship between different parts of a meme?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Contrastive Meme Generator -> Image-Text Alignment module -> Classification head

- Critical path:
  1. Generate triplet dataset using CMGen
  2. Pre-train ITA module with contrastive learning on triplets
  3. Fine-tune classification head on labeled data
  4. Use trained model for classification and segmentation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Parameter efficiency vs. performance: 3.61M vs 1.12B parameters
  - Generated data vs. real annotations: CMGen reduces annotation burden but relies on generation quality
  - Segmentation detail vs. accuracy: Pixel-level segmentation remains challenging despite attention maps

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor triplet dataset quality (images not semantically correlated)
  - Attention maps not highlighting relevant hateful content
  - Model overfits to generated data and fails on real memes
  - Segmentation accuracy significantly lower than classification accuracy

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test CMGen triplet generation quality by measuring embedding distances between original and generated pairs
  2. Evaluate ITA attention map quality by checking if hateful text correlates with highlighted image regions
  3. Compare pre-training vs. no pre-training performance to validate contrastive learning benefits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can CMGen be improved to better incorporate text content when generating context-correlated meme pairs?
- Basis in paper: CMGen primarily generates based on image content, with text embedding distances comparable to baseline
- Why unresolved: Text content often lacks detailed information or uses slang, making mass production challenging due to safety policies
- What evidence would resolve it: Improved CMGen performance with better text integration, demonstrated by lower text embedding distances

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can image segmentation accuracy be enhanced beyond current patch-level attention maps?
- Basis in paper: Achieving high accuracy in image segmentation remains challenging
- Why unresolved: Current approach uses attention maps at image-patch level; pixel-level refinement hasn't yielded significant improvements
- What evidence would resolve it: New segmentation method achieving higher accuracy than patch-level approach

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can HATESIEVE be effectively extended to support languages other than English?
- Basis in paper: Current version focuses exclusively on English hate speech
- Why unresolved: Framework is tailored to English hate speech, requiring additional resources for other languages
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful implementation in multiple languages with comparable performance to English version

### Open Question 4
- Question: How can HATESIEVE be optimized to better handle underrepresented hate speech categories?
- Basis in paper: Category-specific evaluation shows inconsistent performance across different types of hate speech
- Why unresolved: Current model may lack sufficient training data or targeted refinement for underrepresented categories
- What evidence would resolve it: Improved classification and segmentation performance for underrepresented categories

## Limitations

- Dataset Generation Quality: Effectiveness depends on quality of CMGen outputs; no quantitative evaluation of generated meme quality or semantic correlation
- Segmentation Performance: Reported F1-score is for classification, not segmentation; segmentation capability lacks comprehensive evaluation metrics
- Generalizability: Evaluated primarily on English memes; doesn't address multilingual performance or cultural context variations

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Parameter efficiency claims (3.61M vs 1.12B parameters) and classification performance metrics
- **Medium Confidence**: Contrastive learning mechanism's effectiveness supported by ablation studies, but triplet quality not quantitatively validated
- **Low Confidence**: Segmentation capability claims lack comprehensive evaluation metrics and validation beyond qualitative examples

## Next Checks

1. Conduct human evaluation study where annotators rate semantic correlation between original memes and generated pairs, measuring consistency and quality using embedding similarity metrics

2. Implement comprehensive segmentation evaluation using IoU, Dice coefficient, and pixel accuracy metrics on memes with ground truth segmentation masks, comparing against baseline approaches

3. Evaluate HATESIEVE on multiple hate speech meme datasets from different platforms and languages to assess robustness to different meme styles and cultural contexts, reporting performance degradation patterns
