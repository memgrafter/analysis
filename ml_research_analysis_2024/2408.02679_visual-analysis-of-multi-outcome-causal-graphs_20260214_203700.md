# Visual Analysis of Multi-outcome Causal Graphs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.02679
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02679
- Reference count: 40
- Method combines three causal discovery algorithms to improve accuracy on healthcare graphs

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a visual analysis framework for multi-outcome causal graphs in healthcare settings. The approach combines progressive visualization of three causal discovery algorithms (PC, DAG-GNN, and HCM) for single graph exploration with a novel layout technique for comparing multiple outcome graphs. The method addresses the challenge of understanding complex multimorbidity and comorbidity relationships by providing interactive graph editing capabilities and specialized visual encodings for multi-outcome comparison.

## Method Summary
The method consists of two stages: single graph exploration and multi-outcome comparison. For single graphs, it employs progressive visualization of three causal discovery algorithms to aid interactive graph editing. The approach uses a novel graph layout that preserves relative node positions while compressing horizontal space for multi-outcome comparison, along with specialized visual encodings. The framework was evaluated through benchmark datasets, a case study with a medical expert, and expert user studies, demonstrating higher accuracy when combining algorithms and better layout preservation compared to direct extraction methods.

## Key Results
- Combined algorithms achieved 100% and 92% accuracy on benchmark datasets, outperforming individual methods
- Novel layout reduced horizontal stress from 58.6 to 25.6 in one example, indicating better preservation of graph distances
- Medical expert case study demonstrated practical applicability in healthcare settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The progressive visualization approach allows users to gradually refine causal graphs by combining strengths of multiple discovery algorithms. The layout compression technique preserves spatial relationships between nodes while reducing visual complexity when comparing multiple outcome graphs. Specialized visual encodings help users identify patterns and differences across multiple causal graphs simultaneously, making complex multimorbidity relationships more interpretable.

## Foundational Learning
- **Causal discovery algorithms**: Need to understand how PC, DAG-GNN, and HCM differ in detecting causal relationships. Quick check: Compare algorithm assumptions and output characteristics.
- **Graph stress metrics**: Important for quantifying layout preservation quality. Quick check: Calculate stress values for simple graph transformations.
- **Multimorbidity analysis**: Core application domain requiring domain knowledge. Quick check: Map common comorbidities to understand healthcare relevance.
- **Progressive visualization**: Technique for iterative refinement of complex visualizations. Quick check: Implement simple progressive refinement on sample data.
- **Visual encoding principles**: Essential for designing effective comparison views. Quick check: Test encoding effectiveness with small user studies.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
User Interface -> Graph Processing Engine -> Algorithm Pipeline -> Layout Engine -> Visual Display

### Critical Path
1. User initiates graph exploration
2. Algorithm pipeline processes input data
3. Layout engine computes node positions
4. Visual display renders interactive graph
5. User performs editing operations
6. Results feed back into pipeline

### Design Tradeoffs
- Algorithm diversity vs. computational efficiency
- Layout preservation vs. space optimization
- Visual complexity vs. information density
- Interactive responsiveness vs. processing accuracy

### Failure Signatures
- High stress values indicating poor layout preservation
- Inconsistent node positioning across multiple outcomes
- Algorithm convergence failures or long processing times
- User confusion with visual encodings or interactions

### First Experiments
1. Test progressive visualization with simple synthetic graphs
2. Validate layout compression on known graph structures
3. Evaluate visual encoding effectiveness with small user groups

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Only three causal discovery algorithms implemented, limiting methodological coverage
- Evaluation relies heavily on synthetic benchmark datasets rather than real-world healthcare data
- Single medical expert case study provides limited evidence of clinical utility
- Stress metric may not fully capture practitioner usability and interpretability

## Confidence
- **High**: Novel layout approach reducing stress values compared to direct extraction
- **Medium**: Algorithm combination achieving high accuracy on benchmark datasets
- **Low**: Clinical utility claims based on single case study with one medical expert

## Next Checks
1. Conduct larger-scale user study with multiple medical experts across different specialties to assess clinical utility and identify workflow integration challenges
2. Test method on real-world healthcare datasets with known ground truth causal relationships to validate accuracy beyond synthetic benchmarks
3. Implement and evaluate additional causal discovery algorithms to assess generalizability of progressive visualization approach
