## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ArabicaQA, the first large-scale dataset for Arabic Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) and Open-domain Question Answering (Open-domain QA). ArabicaQA consists of 89,095 answerable and 3,701 unanswerable questions, along with additional labels for open-domain questions. The dataset is created by crowdworkers and undergoes a rigorous filtering and transforming process to ensure high quality. The paper also presents AraDPR, the first dense passage retrieval model specifically trained on the Arabic Wikipedia corpus. Extensive benchmarking of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Arabic QA is conducted, evaluating models like GPT-3, Llama, and Falcon. The results show that AraBERT, a variant of BERT specifically pre-trained on Arabic text, outperforms other models in MRC tasks. Dense retrieval methods like AraDPR demonstrate superior performance compared to traditional retrieval methods. However, LLMs face challenges in utilizing retrieved documents to improve MRC accuracy, indicating the need for further research in this area.

## Method Summary
The ArabicaQA dataset is constructed through a multi-stage process involving crowdworkers who generate questions from Arabic Wikipedia articles. These questions are then filtered and transformed to ensure quality and diversity. The dataset includes both answerable and unanswerable questions to evaluate model robustness. For retrieval, the paper introduces AraDPR, a dense passage retrieval model trained on the Arabic Wikipedia corpus. The model uses bi-encoder architecture to encode questions and passages into dense vectors, enabling efficient similarity search. Extensive experiments are conducted to benchmark various LLMs and retrieval methods on the ArabicaQA dataset, with a focus on MRC and Open-domain QA tasks.

## Key Results
- AraBERT outperforms other models in Arabic MRC tasks
- Dense retrieval methods like AraDPR demonstrate superior performance compared to traditional retrieval methods
- LLMs face challenges in utilizing retrieved documents to improve MRC accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of ArabicaQA stems from its large scale and rigorous construction process, which ensures high-quality questions covering diverse topics. The inclusion of unanswerable questions adds a critical dimension for evaluating model robustness. AraDPR's effectiveness is attributed to its domain-specific training on Arabic Wikipedia, allowing it to better capture the nuances of Arabic language and context. The benchmarking of LLMs highlights the current limitations in their ability to effectively leverage retrieved documents, pointing to areas for future research.

## Foundational Learning

- **Crowdworker Annotation**: Questions are generated by crowdworkers to ensure variety and naturalness. Why needed: Human-generated questions better reflect real user queries. Quick check: Assess inter-annotator agreement.
- **Dense Passage Retrieval**: AraDPR uses dense vector representations for efficient retrieval. Why needed: Handles semantic similarity better than keyword-based methods. Quick check: Compare retrieval performance on morphological variants.
- **MRC Task Definition**: Models must extract answers from provided passages. Why needed: Evaluates comprehension rather than just retrieval. Quick check: Test on unanswerable questions to assess robustness.
- **Open-domain QA**: Questions require retrieving relevant passages before answering. Why needed: Simulates real-world QA scenarios. Quick check: Measure impact of retrieval quality on final answers.
- **Question Difficulty Classification**: Questions are classified as easy or difficult based on retrieval performance. Why needed: Enables targeted evaluation of model capabilities. Quick check: Validate difficulty classification with human judges.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Crowdworker Question Generation -> Quality Filtering -> Dataset Construction -> Model Training -> Evaluation

Critical path: Question Generation → Filtering → Dataset Construction → Model Training → Evaluation → Analysis

Design tradeoffs:
- Quality vs. quantity in question generation
- Answerable vs. unanswerable questions for robustness
- Dense vs. traditional retrieval methods
- Model complexity vs. computational efficiency

Failure signatures:
- Low inter-annotator agreement indicating unclear questions
- High unanswerable accuracy suggesting models exploit dataset artifacts
- Poor retrieval performance on morphologically complex queries

First experiments:
1. Evaluate baseline models on a stratified sample of easy and difficult questions
2. Compare AraDPR performance against traditional retrieval on morphologically complex queries
3. Assess model robustness by testing on unanswerable questions
