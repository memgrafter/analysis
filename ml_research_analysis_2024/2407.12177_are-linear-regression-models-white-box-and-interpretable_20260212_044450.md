# Are Linear Regression Models White Box and Interpretable?

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2407.12177
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12177
- **Reference count**: 36
- **Primary result**: Challenges the notion that linear regression models are inherently interpretable and should be considered "white box" models

## Executive Summary
This paper challenges the common perception that linear regression models (LRMs) are inherently interpretable and should be treated as "white box" models. Despite their mathematical simplicity, the authors argue that LRMs face significant interpretability challenges including linearity assumptions, local explanations, multicollinearity, covariate effects, data scaling, uncertainty measurement, feature contribution, and fairness. The paper demonstrates that these challenges make LRMs as difficult to interpret as complex models, suggesting they should be treated equally when it comes to explainability. The authors provide recommendations for improving LRM interpretability, including using post-hoc XAI methods and developing better uncertainty metrics.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a theoretical analysis of interpretability challenges in linear regression models. Rather than conducting empirical experiments, the authors systematically examine various aspects of LRM interpretation through mathematical reasoning and illustrative examples. The methodology involves identifying specific interpretability challenges (linearity assumptions, multicollinearity, etc.), explaining why these challenges arise in practice, and demonstrating their impact on interpretation through conceptual examples and theoretical discussion. The authors also discuss potential mitigation strategies, particularly the use of post-hoc XAI methods like SHAP and LIME.

## Key Results
- Linear regression models face significant interpretability challenges despite being considered "white box"
- Multicollinearity severely impacts the reliability of coefficient interpretation in real-world applications
- Local explanations are crucial for interpretability but LRMs lack this capability, only providing global coefficients
- Data preprocessing techniques like normalization complicate coefficient interpretation and require additional explanation steps

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Linear regression models (LRMs) are not inherently interpretable despite being labeled as "white box" due to challenges with linearity assumptions.
- Mechanism: The paper argues that the interpretability of LRMs is compromised when the underlying data relationships are non-linear, leading to misleading coefficient interpretations.
- Core assumption: The association between input variables and output is not always linear in real-world applications.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This includes linearity, local explanation, multicollinearity, covariates, normalization, uncertainty, features contribution and fairness."
  - [section 4.1] "The association between the input variables and output might be linear, monotonic or more complex... To explain and interpret the LRMs with this kind of data, the end-users report the coefficient value as the effect size and the direction of the effect which is not accurate and does not reflect the actual association."
- Break condition: When data relationships are truly linear and all other interpretability challenges are resolved.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Local explanations are crucial for interpretability but LRMs lack this capability.
- Mechanism: LRMs provide global coefficients that represent average effects across all samples, failing to show how individual instances are affected differently.
- Core assumption: Different instances may have different feature contributions that are averaged out in global coefficients.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2] "LRMs are lack of such valuable property which is one of the most significant aims of XAI methods... LRMs cannot be considered as a white box within this context because it is not clear how it works at local level."
  - [section 2] "The interpretation of the β represents the effect in one unit of the variable of interest toward the outcome while assuming/holding all other independent variables in the model constant."
- Break condition: When all instances behave identically and global coefficients perfectly represent local behavior.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multicollinearity severely impacts the interpretability of LRMs by making coefficient values unreliable.
- Mechanism: When independent variables are highly correlated, the classic interpretation of coefficient values as effect sizes becomes meaningless since variables change simultaneously rather than independently.
- Core assumption: Independent variables in real-world applications are often correlated rather than truly independent.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.3] "The interpretation of the coefficient value represents the effect of one unit of the independent variable of interest on the outcome while holding all other independent variables in the model constant... Such interpretation might be correct when the independent variables are really independent... However, in real life applications the independent variables are usually collinear and they change simultaneously."
  - [section 4.3] "Figure 3 shows that X1 and X2 are highly positively correlated (A)."
- Break condition: When all independent variables are truly independent and uncorrelated.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Linearity assumptions in regression models
  - Why needed here: Understanding when linearity assumptions break down is fundamental to recognizing LRMs' interpretability limitations
  - Quick check question: What happens to LRM coefficient interpretation when the true relationship between variables is U-shaped rather than linear?

- Concept: Local vs. global model explanations
  - Why needed here: The paper emphasizes that LRMs only provide global explanations, missing the crucial local interpretability component
  - Quick check question: How would you explain to a user why their specific mortgage application was rejected if you only had LRM coefficients?

- Concept: Multicollinearity and its effects on regression coefficients
  - Why needed here: Multicollinearity is identified as a major barrier to interpreting LRMs correctly in real-world applications
  - Quick check question: If two predictors are perfectly correlated, what can you say about their individual coefficient estimates in an LRM?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing pipeline → Linear regression model fitting → Coefficient extraction and interpretation module → Uncertainty quantification component → Post-hoc XAI method integration point → Fairness evaluation framework

- Critical path: Data → Preprocessing → Model fitting → Coefficient extraction → Interpretation → Uncertainty quantification → Fairness check

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Interpretability vs. predictive performance when choosing between LRMs and complex models
  - Coefficient interpretability vs. model performance when deciding whether to preprocess data
  - Computational efficiency vs. explanation depth when choosing between global and local explanations

- Failure signatures:
  - High variance inflation factors (VIF) indicating multicollinearity issues
  - Poor model performance on non-linear relationships despite high R-squared values
  - Confidence intervals that are too wide to be meaningful
  - Significant differences between global and local explanations

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Fit an LRM on a synthetic dataset with known non-linear relationships and observe how coefficients misrepresent the true relationships
  2. Create a dataset with highly correlated predictors and demonstrate how coefficient signs and magnitudes become unstable
  3. Compare LRM coefficient interpretations before and after standardization to show how preprocessing affects interpretability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we develop better metrics for measuring uncertainty in linear regression models beyond confidence intervals?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the limitations of confidence intervals as a proxy for measuring model uncertainty and suggests that more sophisticated metrics might be needed.
- Why unresolved: Current confidence intervals have known fallacies and limitations in representing precision and plausibility of estimates. There's a need for more accurate uncertainty measures that better reflect the model's certainty.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of new uncertainty metrics for LRMs, with empirical comparisons showing their superiority over traditional confidence intervals in various real-world scenarios.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What approaches can be developed to interpret feature effects in linear regression models when data normalization or standardization is applied?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the challenge of interpreting coefficient values after normalization or standardization, as these processes convert features into unitless values or deviations from the mean.
- Why unresolved: While normalization and standardization are common preprocessing steps, there's currently no established method to interpret the resulting coefficients in terms of their original units or practical meaning.
- What evidence would resolve it: Proposed methods that allow for meaningful interpretation of standardized/normalized feature effects, with demonstrations on real-world datasets showing improved interpretability without sacrificing model performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we effectively measure and improve fairness in linear regression models, especially for continuous outcomes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the challenges of measuring fairness in LRMs, noting that most fairness metrics are designed for classification tasks and that LRMs are inherently biased against minorities in the data.
- Why unresolved: Unlike classification models where fairness can be measured using metrics like equal opportunity or equal odds, fairness in regression models with continuous outcomes is less straightforward and lacks established metrics and mitigation strategies.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of fairness metrics specifically for regression tasks, along with effective strategies to mitigate bias in LRMs, validated through empirical studies on diverse datasets.

## Limitations
- The paper relies primarily on theoretical arguments rather than empirical validation with real-world datasets
- Lacks concrete examples demonstrating the practical impact of interpretability challenges on decision-making
- Does not explore potential mitigation strategies beyond mentioning post-hoc XAI methods

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The fundamental mathematical arguments about linearity assumptions, multicollinearity effects, and the difference between local and global explanations are well-established in statistics literature
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that LRMs should be treated as complex models for explainability purposes is novel and requires further empirical validation
- **Medium confidence**: The fairness implications of LRM interpretability challenges are discussed but not deeply explored with concrete examples

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a controlled experiment using real-world datasets with varying degrees of non-linearity and multicollinearity to empirically demonstrate how LRM coefficient interpretations diverge from actual relationships
2. Compare SHAP values and LIME explanations for LRMs against traditional coefficient interpretation to quantify the differences in local vs. global explanations
3. Develop and test a standardized uncertainty quantification framework specifically designed for LRM coefficients that accounts for multicollinearity and non-linearity issues
