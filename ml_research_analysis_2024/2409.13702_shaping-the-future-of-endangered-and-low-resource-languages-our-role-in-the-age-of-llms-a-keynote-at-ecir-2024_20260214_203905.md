# Shaping the Future of Endangered and Low-Resource Languages -- Our Role in the Age of LLMs: A Keynote at ECIR 2024

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2409.13702
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13702
- **Reference count:** 6
- **Primary result:** Highlights challenges and opportunities of preserving endangered languages using LLMs, emphasizing the need for human-AI collaboration

## Executive Summary
This keynote addresses the critical challenge of preserving endangered and low-resource languages in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs offer powerful tools for translation and content generation, they also pose risks of cultural homogenization. The paper emphasizes the need for collaborative approaches that combine human expertise with AI capabilities, using the Occitan language as a case study. It explores technical solutions like prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and retrieval augmented generation while highlighting the importance of ethical considerations and community engagement in language preservation efforts.

## Method Summary
The paper presents a conceptual framework for supporting endangered languages through LLMs, drawing on the specific example of Occitan. It analyzes the dual nature of LLMs as both opportunities and threats for language preservation, examining technical approaches including prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG). The methodology emphasizes the critical role of human expertise and community involvement in ensuring culturally appropriate and effective language preservation strategies.

## Key Results
- LLMs present both opportunities and threats for endangered language preservation, enabling translation and content generation while risking cultural homogenization
- Human expertise and AI collaboration are essential for maintaining linguistic diversity in the age of LLMs
- Technical approaches like prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and RAG can support low-resource languages when combined with community engagement

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging the pattern recognition and generation capabilities of LLMs while maintaining human oversight and cultural sensitivity. The combination of technical solutions (prompt engineering, fine-tuning, RAG) with community engagement ensures that language preservation efforts are both technically effective and culturally appropriate. This hybrid approach addresses the data scarcity problem while respecting the unique characteristics of each language community.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Language Resource Scarcity**: Why needed - Limited digital content for endangered languages makes traditional ML approaches difficult; Quick check - Count available parallel corpora for target language
2. **Cultural Context**: Why needed - Language preservation requires understanding cultural nuances beyond pure translation; Quick check - Assess community involvement in preservation efforts
3. **LLM Adaptation Techniques**: Why needed - Standard models perform poorly on low-resource languages without modification; Quick check - Compare performance of base vs. fine-tuned models
4. **Ethical AI Implementation**: Why needed - Language preservation raises unique ethical considerations around representation and authenticity; Quick check - Review community feedback on AI-generated content

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Human Experts <-> Community Engagement <-> AI Tools (Prompt Engineering -> Fine-tuning -> RAG)

**Critical Path:**
Community Input → Prompt Engineering → Fine-tuning → Content Generation → Community Validation

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Computational efficiency vs. model accuracy
- Speed of content generation vs. cultural authenticity
- Technical sophistication vs. community accessibility

**Failure Signatures:**
- Cultural misrepresentation in generated content
- Low community adoption of AI tools
- Technical barriers preventing implementation

**First Experiments:**
1. Test prompt engineering effectiveness on small language sample
2. Evaluate fine-tuning impact on model performance
3. Measure community response to AI-assisted content generation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Analysis is primarily theoretical with limited empirical validation
- Focus on Occitan may not generalize to all endangered language contexts
- Does not address computational cost barriers for resource-constrained communities

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Challenges facing endangered languages in LLM era, cultural homogenization risks, data scarcity issues
- **Medium Confidence:** Technical solutions (prompt engineering, fine-tuning, RAG) for supporting low-resource languages
- **Low Confidence:** Practical feasibility and scalability of collaborative human-AI approach in communities with limited technical infrastructure

## Next Checks
1. Conduct empirical studies measuring fine-tuned LLM performance on specific endangered language tasks across multiple language contexts
2. Assess computational and resource requirements for implementing solutions in typical endangered language community settings
3. Evaluate effectiveness of community engagement strategies through pilot projects measuring both technical outcomes and cultural impact
