# Explainable Finite-Memory Policies for Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.13365
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13365
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: DT-FSC approach significantly reduces policy representation size with transition functions up to 16.37 times smaller than traditional FSC representations

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of explaining finite-memory policies in POMDPs, where traditional Finite State Controllers (FSCs) are complex and hard to interpret. The authors propose a novel method that combines Mealy machines with decision trees to represent policies in a more interpretable and compact form. Decision trees are used to represent both stationary policies and transitions within the FSC, improving explainability while maintaining policy performance.

## Method Summary
The method converts traditional FSCs into DT-FSCs by extracting stationary policies and transition functions for each node and representing them as decision trees. For attractor-based policies, a skip-FSC optimization further reduces complexity by incorporating skip actions. The approach leverages decision tree learning to automatically remove irrelevant observation variables, resulting in more compact representations. The method is evaluated on various benchmarks, demonstrating significant reductions in representation size compared to traditional FSC approaches.

## Key Results
- DT-FSC representations achieve significant size reduction compared to traditional FSCs
- Transition functions in DT-FSC are up to 16.37 times smaller than FSC representations
- Decision trees effectively remove irrelevant observation variables from policy representations
- Skip-FSC optimization works well for attractor-based policies with structural characteristics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Decision trees used for both policy actions and transitions yield compact representations by exploiting irrelevant observation variables. DT learning prunes unnecessary observation variables from decision rules, reducing the number of nodes and improving interpretability. Core assumption: Observation variables can be conditionally irrelevant to both the policy action and the transition decision.

### Mechanism 2
Skip-FSC representation reduces transition complexity by collapsing redundant nodes into skip actions. In attractor-based policies, repeated transitions to a previously computed winning policy are replaced with skip actions, reducing the number of distinct transitions. Core assumption: Policies exhibit attractor-based structure where reaching a winning observation leads to switching to a previously computed policy.

### Mechanism 3
Modular DT-FSC structure separates policy components, enabling independent explanation and diagnosis. Each FSC node's policy and transition function are represented by separate decision trees, allowing focused analysis of each component. Core assumption: Explainability benefits from decomposing complex policies into interpretable subcomponents.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs)
  - Why needed here: POMDPs model decision-making under uncertainty with partial observability, which is the core problem domain.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between MDPs and POMDPs regarding state observability?

- Concept: Finite State Controllers (FSCs)
  - Why needed here: FSCs represent finite-memory policies for POMDPs, which is the baseline representation being improved.
  - Quick check question: How does an FSC transition between nodes based on current and next observations?

- Concept: Decision Tree Learning
  - Why needed here: Decision trees are used to represent both policy actions and transitions in a more interpretable form.
  - Quick check question: What property of decision trees allows them to automatically remove irrelevant features?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: POMDP problem definition → FSC generation (iterative/SMT-based) → DT-FSC conversion → Explainable policy output
- Critical path: 1. Parse POMDP model and objective 2. Generate FSC using iterative approach or other method 3. Extract stationary policies and transitions from FSC 4. Learn decision trees for each component 5. (Optional) Apply skip-FSC optimization 6. Output DT-FSC representation
- Design tradeoffs: FSC size vs. DT-FSC compactness: FSCs may be smaller but less interpretable; Transition complexity: Skip-FSC reduces transitions but adds skip actions; Generality vs. optimization: DT-FSC works for general policies, skip-FSC requires attractor-based structure
- Failure signatures: DT-FSC not smaller than FSC: May indicate all observations are relevant or poor DT learning; Skip-FSC adds complexity: May indicate policies don't follow attractor-based structure; Poor policy performance: May indicate loss of information during DT approximation
- First 3 experiments: 1. Implement DT-FSC conversion on a small POMDP benchmark and compare FSC vs DT-FSC sizes 2. Test skip-FSC optimization on a problem known to have attractor-based structure 3. Evaluate explainability of DT-FSC on a simple domain with known optimal policy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the performance of DT-FSC policies compare to traditional FSC policies in terms of computational efficiency and policy size reduction across different problem domains? The paper provides empirical evidence from specific benchmarks but does not explore the generalizability of these results across diverse problem domains or provide a theoretical analysis of the performance bounds.

### Open Question 2
Can the DT-FSC approach be extended to handle infinite-memory policies, and if so, what modifications would be necessary? The paper mentions that in general, optimal policies may require infinite memory, which makes them impractical for real-world implementation. The DT-FSC approach is designed for finite-memory policies.

### Open Question 3
How does the explainability of DT-FSC policies compare to other existing methods for representing and explaining policies in POMDPs? The paper claims that DT-FSCs provide a more interpretable and explainable representation of policies compared to traditional FSCs by using decision trees to represent both stationary policies and transitions.

## Limitations
- Relies on specific structural properties of attractor-based policies that may not generalize to all POMDP domains
- Decision tree learning component requires careful tuning to balance between policy accuracy and explainability
- Experimental validation lacks real-world application scenarios that would demonstrate practical utility

## Confidence
- DT-FSC size reduction claims: High confidence (supported by multiple benchmark experiments)
- Skip-FSC mechanism effectiveness: Medium confidence (relies on specific policy structures)
- General explainability improvements: Medium confidence (qualitative benefits not fully quantified)

## Next Checks
1. Test DT-FSC conversion on a synthetic POMDP with known irrelevant observation variables to verify decision tree pruning effectiveness
2. Implement counterexample analysis to identify when skip-FSC optimization fails or increases complexity
3. Conduct user study comparing human interpretability of DT-FSC vs traditional FSC representations on simple domains
