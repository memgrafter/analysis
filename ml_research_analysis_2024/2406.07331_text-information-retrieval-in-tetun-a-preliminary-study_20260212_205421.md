# Text Information Retrieval in Tetun: A Preliminary Study

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.07331
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07331
- Authors: Gabriel de Jesus
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Title-only indexing without stemming achieved best performance (nDCG=0.79, MAP=0.73) for Tetun news search

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a preliminary investigation into text information retrieval for Tetun, a low-resource language spoken in Timor-Leste. The study develops search solutions for Tetun by building a corpus, creating text processing methods, and experimenting with various indexing and retrieval strategies. Using Apache Solr, the research evaluates 12 different retrieval configurations on 442 news articles and 5 search queries from Timor News. The results demonstrate that indexing by title alone, without stemming, provides superior performance, suggesting that Tetun news writing standards contribute to effective retrieval. This work establishes a foundation for developing information retrieval solutions for Tetun and other low-resource languages.

## Method Summary
The study employs Apache Solr for indexing and retrieval, using 442 news articles and 5 search queries from Timor News. The research tests 12 different retrieval strategies combining document processing configurations (with/without stopwords, stemming) and indexing methods (title only, title+content, lead+content, title+lead+content). Text preprocessing includes rule-based tokenization, light stemming, and normalization lists for misspelled terms, abbreviations, and synonyms. The evaluation uses TREC-style methodology with normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG) and mean average precision (MAP) as metrics, employing 4 Timorese evaluators for relevance judgments.

## Key Results
- Title-only indexing without stemming achieved the best performance (nDCG=0.79, MAP=0.73)
- Document processing with stopword removal showed no significant improvement in retrieval effectiveness
- Light stemming performed better than default aggressive stemming for Tetun

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Indexing by title alone improves retrieval performance for Tetun news documents
- Mechanism: Title-based indexing leverages the established news writing standards in Timor News, where titles concisely summarize content, making them highly discriminative for retrieval
- Core assumption: Timor News titles follow consistent, informative writing standards that make them more effective retrieval signals than full content
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Results showed that indexing by title without stemming achieved the best performance, with a normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG) of 0.79 and mean average precision (MAP) of 0.73. This outcome suggests that title-based indexing is more effective for Tetun text search, likely due to the established news writing standards in Timor News."
  - [section]: "Since Timor News has established its news writing standard and designed it for the readers to understand the news content quickly from the title, we believe that it also contributes to the retrieval effectiveness result."
- Break condition: If Tetun news sites adopt inconsistent or keyword-stuffed title practices, title-only indexing would degrade performance compared to full-text indexing

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Rule-based light stemming without aggressive morphological reduction performs better for Tetun
- Mechanism: Tetun has significant Portuguese loanwords and simple morphological patterns; light stemming preserves enough lexical distinction while reducing inflectional variance
- Core assumption: Tetun morphology is relatively simple compared to highly agglutinative languages, making light stemming sufficient
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Results showed that indexing by title without stemming achieved the best performance"
  - [section]: "Since the overall scores of the default configuration (with stemming) is slightly lower, we assume that it can be affected by the quality of stemming rules and the amount of the documents and queries used in the experimentation."
- Break condition: If Tetun develops more complex morphological patterns or if stemming rules improve significantly, aggressive stemming might outperform light stemming

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Rule-based text normalization and expansion lists improve retrieval for low-resource languages
- Mechanism: Manual construction of normalization rules, abbreviation expansions, and synonym lists compensates for lack of large-scale language resources and handles domain-specific variations
- Core assumption: Domain-specific knowledge can effectively substitute for large-scale statistical language models in low-resource settings
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "For the text normalization, we developed a rule-based list, e.g., junho, junu → juñu (june), to correct the misspelled Tetun terms. The same rule-based list is also used in constructing the lists of abbreviation and synonym expansions. The misspelled, abbreviation expansion and synonym lists were built based on the information extracted from the Timor News search query logs."
- Break condition: If the domain grows too large or diverse, manual rule creation becomes unsustainable compared to data-driven approaches

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Information Retrieval fundamentals (inverted indexes, ranking functions, evaluation metrics)
  - Why needed here: The study uses Apache Solr for indexing and retrieval, requiring understanding of how inverted indexes work and how ranking functions like BM25 operate
  - Quick check question: How does an inverted index enable efficient keyword search, and what role does the posting list play?

- Concept: Text preprocessing techniques (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, normalization)
  - Why needed here: The research develops specific preprocessing methods for Tetun, including custom tokenization and light stemming rules
  - Quick check question: What's the difference between stemming and lemmatization, and why might light stemming be preferable for Tetun?

- Concept: Evaluation methodology for IR systems (Cranfield paradigm, relevance judgments, evaluation metrics)
  - Why needed here: The study uses TREC-style evaluation with relevance judgments and metrics like nDCG and MAP
  - Quick check question: How does the Cranfield paradigm structure IR evaluation, and why are multiple evaluation metrics necessary?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data collection -> Text preprocessing -> Indexing -> Retrieval -> Evaluation -> Prototype deployment
- Critical path: Document collection -> Corpus characterization -> Text processing development -> Indexing strategy testing -> Evaluation with relevance judgments
- Design tradeoffs: Title-only vs. full-text indexing (precision vs. recall), light vs. aggressive stemming (accuracy vs. coverage), manual vs. automated preprocessing (quality vs. scalability)
- Failure signatures: Poor retrieval performance indicates inadequate preprocessing rules, insufficient training data for relevance judgments, or inappropriate indexing strategy for the domain
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare title-only indexing vs. title+content indexing using default Solr configuration
  2. Test different preprocessing configurations (with/without stopwords, with/without stemming) while keeping indexing constant
  3. Evaluate the impact of custom text normalization rules by comparing runs with and without normalization applied

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal approach for building a comprehensive Tetun corpus that balances quality and coverage, considering the language's orthographic variations and Portuguese loanwords?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions the need to build a Tetun corpus and discusses different corpus construction techniques, but doesn't provide specific methodology for Tetun.
- Why unresolved: The paper only briefly mentions the need for corpus construction without detailing specific strategies for handling Tetun's unique linguistic features.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of different corpus construction approaches (e.g., ad-hoc crawling vs. query-based crawling) specifically applied to Tetun, evaluating their effectiveness in capturing the language's linguistic diversity.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do different text preprocessing techniques (e.g., stemming, stopword removal) impact information retrieval performance for Tetun compared to other low-resource languages?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper presents preliminary results on text preprocessing but acknowledges that more investigation is needed, especially regarding stemming effectiveness.
- Why unresolved: The preliminary study only tested a limited set of preprocessing techniques and documents/queries, with results suggesting that stemming may not be beneficial but requiring further validation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive experiments comparing various preprocessing configurations across larger document collections and query sets, analyzing their impact on retrieval metrics like MAP and nDCG.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What neural language model approaches are most effective for ad-hoc retrieval in Tetun, and how do they compare to traditional retrieval methods?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that recent works have reported promising results of applying neural language models in ad-hoc retrieval tasks and plans to adopt both traditional and neural-based approaches in future experiments.
- Why unresolved: The preliminary study only used traditional retrieval methods with Apache Solr, without exploring neural approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: Direct comparison of neural language model-based retrieval methods (e.g., BERT-based approaches) with traditional methods on Tetun text, evaluating their effectiveness using standard IR metrics.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does the quality and consistency of relevance judgments vary across different evaluator backgrounds (e.g., linguistics vs. computer science) for Tetun information retrieval tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that relevance judgments will require Timorese expertise from different subjects and backgrounds, but doesn't provide results on inter-judge agreement or consistency.
- Why unresolved: The paper only mentions the intention to involve diverse evaluators but doesn't report on the actual agreement or differences in their assessments.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of inter-judge agreement (e.g., using kappa statistics) across different evaluator groups, examining how their backgrounds influence relevance judgments for Tetun queries.

## Limitations

- Small query set (5 queries) and modest document collection (442 articles) limit statistical power
- Results may not generalize beyond Timor News due to its established writing standards
- Manual rule-based approach may not scale to larger, more diverse corpora

## Confidence

- High confidence: Title-only indexing superiority for this specific news corpus (supported by quantitative results nDCG=0.79, MAP=0.73)
- Medium confidence: Light stemming effectiveness for Tetun (based on comparison with default configuration but limited by corpus size)
- Low confidence: Generalizability to other low-resource languages and domains (extrapolated from single-language, single-domain results)

## Next Checks

1. **External Corpus Validation**: Test the title-only indexing approach on Tetun documents from different sources (social media, government documents, literature) to assess robustness across domains and writing styles.

2. **Query Expansion Experiment**: Evaluate whether automatically expanding queries with synonym and abbreviation lists improves retrieval effectiveness, particularly for the 3 queries that showed lower performance (nDCG<0.6).

3. **Language Transfer Study**: Apply the developed Tetun preprocessing pipeline (tokenization, light stemming, normalization rules) to another Austronesian language with similar characteristics to test the methodology's transferability to related low-resource languages.
