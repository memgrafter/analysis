- Primary result: FairExtract and FairGPT achieve perfect fairness (F=1) without sacrificing quality in extractive multi-document summarization

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses fairness in multi-document summarization by introducing two methods—FairExtract (clustering-based) and FairGPT (LLM-based)—that ensure equitable representation across social groups while maintaining quality. FairExtract uses fairlet decomposition and k-median clustering on document embeddings to create balanced summaries, while FairGPT leverages GPT-3.5 with fairness constraints and LCS-based matching. Both methods achieve perfect fairness (F=1) without sacrificing competitive summarization quality, outperforming baselines on metrics like SUPERT (0.644), BLANC (0.139), and BARTScore (-0.821). Composite metrics combining quality and fairness further demonstrate their effectiveness, with FairGPT setting new benchmarks among LLM-based approaches. The study highlights the importance of integrating fairness into summarization tasks for inclusive representation.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces two fairness-aware summarization methods: FairExtract and FairGPT. FairExtract uses fairlet decomposition to partition documents into balanced groups, then applies k-median clustering on fairlet centers to select representative summaries while preserving group balance. FairGPT uses GPT-3.5-turbo with fairness constraints to generate summaries, selecting equal numbers of sentences from each group, then employs LCS-based matching to ensure content accuracy with original tweets. Both methods are evaluated on the DivSumm dataset using fairness metric F (1-RG) and quality metrics including SUPERT, BLANC, and BARTScore, with composite metrics integrating both dimensions.

## Key Results
- Both FairExtract and FairGPT achieve perfect fairness (F=1) across all experiments
- FairExtract achieves competitive quality scores: SUPERT 0.644, BLANC 0.139, BARTScore -0.821
- FairGPT outperforms traditional baselines on all quality metrics while maintaining perfect fairness
- Composite metrics (e.g., SUPERT+F) demonstrate balanced assessment of quality and fairness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: FairExtract ensures perfect fairness (F=1) by enforcing proportional representation through fairlet decomposition and k-median clustering on fairlet centers
- Mechanism: Documents are embedded into high-dimensional space using BERT, decomposed into fairlets that maintain exact proportional balance (g1:g2) between groups, and clustered to select representative fairlets that guarantee equal group representation in the summary
- Core assumption: Fairlet decomposition can be computed efficiently while minimizing intra-fairlet distances, and k-median clustering on fairlet centers preserves the fairness properties of the fairlets
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "FairExtract uses fairlet decomposition and k-median clustering on document embeddings to create balanced summaries"
  - [section] "Fairlet is defined as the smallest group of documents that exactly preserves this ratio, containing exactly g1 documents from G1 and g2 documents from G2"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus neighbors focus on extractive summarization but not fairness-aware methods
- Break condition: If fairlet decomposition cannot be computed within acceptable computational bounds, or if k-median clustering fails to preserve fairlet balance due to edge cases in clustering assignment

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: FairGPT achieves perfect fairness (F=1) by using LLM with fairness constraints and LCS-based matching to ensure equal representation and accurate content extraction
- Mechanism: LLM generates summary selecting L/2 sentences from each group, LCS matches generated sentences to original tweets to ensure content accuracy, and fairness check enforces equal representation before final output
- Core assumption: GPT-3.5-turbo can be reliably prompted to select equal numbers of sentences from each group, and LCS matching will successfully identify appropriate original content even when GPT generates partial sentences
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "FairGPT leverages GPT-3.5 with fairness constraints and LCS-based matching"
  - [section] "We use an LLM (GPT-3.5-turbo) to generate a summary of length L, selecting L/2 sentences from each group to ensure balanced representation"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus contains LLM-based summarization papers but not fairness-aware LLM methods
- Break condition: If LLM repeatedly fails to follow fairness constraints despite prompting, or if LCS matching cannot find sufficient content overlap (>50%) with original tweets

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Composite metrics (e.g., SUPERT+F, BLANC+F) provide balanced assessment by equally weighting normalized quality scores and fairness score F
- Mechanism: Quality metrics are min-max normalized to [0,1] range, fairness score F is computed as 1-RG, then composite metrics are calculated as average of normalized quality and fairness scores
- Core assumption: Min-max normalization makes quality and fairness metrics directly comparable, and equal weighting appropriately balances the two objectives for evaluation
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Additionally, we introduce composite metrics (e.g., SUPERT+F, BLANC+F) that integrate quality and fairness into a single evaluation framework"
  - [section] "we apply min-max normalization to rescale all metrics to the range [0, 1], ensuring comparability across different scales"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus neighbors focus on evaluation metrics but not composite quality-fairness metrics
- Break condition: If quality and fairness metrics have fundamentally different distributions that make equal weighting inappropriate, or if min-max normalization fails due to outliers

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Fairlet decomposition and k-median clustering
  - Why needed here: To ensure proportional representation of groups while maintaining cluster quality in summarization
  - Quick check question: How does fairlet decomposition differ from standard clustering in terms of group balance constraints?

- Concept: Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) for content matching
  - Why needed here: To accurately match LLM-generated partial sentences with full original tweets while maintaining content fidelity
  - Quick check question: Why is LCS preferred over simple string matching for comparing LLM-generated content with original tweets?

- Concept: Min-max normalization for metric comparability
  - Why needed here: To make quality and fairness metrics directly comparable despite different scales and ranges
  - Quick check question: What are the risks of using min-max normalization when metric distributions have outliers?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Document embedding → Fairlet decomposition → Fairlet center computation → k-median clustering → Summary construction (FairExtract); Input preparation → LLM summarization → LCS matching → Fairness check → Output validation (FairGPT)
- Critical path: For FairExtract: embedding → fairlet decomposition → clustering → summary selection. For FairGPT: LLM generation → LCS matching → fairness validation → output
- Design tradeoffs: FairExtract prioritizes computational efficiency and provable fairness guarantees but may sacrifice some quality; FairGPT leverages powerful LLM capabilities for quality but requires iterative validation and may have higher computational cost
- Failure signatures: Poor quality metrics despite perfect fairness (indicates fairness constraints overly restrictive), failure to achieve F=1 (indicates algorithm implementation issues), high iteration counts in FairGPT (indicates LLM prompt engineering problems)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify fairlet decomposition produces balanced groups by checking representation ratios in test cases
  2. Test LCS matching accuracy on LLM-generated partial sentences vs original tweets
  3. Validate min-max normalization correctly scales all metrics to [0,1] range with reasonable distributions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How do FairExtract and FairGPT perform when extended to abstractive summarization rather than extractive summarization? The paper acknowledges this as future work due to challenges in balancing fairness with coherence and fluency.
- How do the proposed methods perform on multilingual datasets, particularly in terms of ensuring fairness across different languages? The current work focuses on English tweets, with multilingual fairness identified as an unexplored area.
- How do FairExtract and FairGPT perform in real-time or resource-constrained environments, given their computational complexity? The paper notes computational complexity may limit scalability but doesn't provide empirical data on resource usage.

## Limitations
- Computational complexity of fairlet decomposition and large language models may limit scalability in real-time or resource-constrained environments
- The study focuses on social group fairness but does not address other fairness dimensions (e.g., topic coverage, sentiment balance)
- Limited comparison baselines restricted to traditional extractive methods, with no evaluation against abstractive summarization approaches

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The fairness mechanisms (fairlet decomposition, LCS matching) are well-defined and theoretically sound
- **Medium confidence**: Quality metrics are competitive but comparison baselines are limited to traditional extractive methods
- **Medium confidence**: Composite metrics provide useful evaluation framework but equal weighting assumption needs validation

## Next Checks
1. **Scalability test**: Apply FairExtract to a larger multi-document dataset (e.g., news articles) to evaluate computational efficiency and fairness preservation at scale
2. **Ablation study**: Remove LCS matching from FairGPT to quantify its impact on quality-fairness tradeoff and iteration counts
3. **Alternative weighting**: Test composite metrics with weighted combinations (e.g., 70% quality, 30% fairness) to evaluate sensitivity to equal weighting assumption
