# Speech Translation with Speech Foundation Models and Large Language Models: What is There and What is Missing?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.12025
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12025
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Survey identifies five building blocks in SFM+LLM architectures but reveals no consensus on optimal design choices or evaluation protocols

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically analyzes recent approaches combining Speech Foundation Models (SFMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) for speech-to-text translation (ST). The authors identify a common architectural framework consisting of five building blocks: SFM, length adapter, modality adapter, prompt-speech mixer, and LLM. However, significant variability exists across nine surveyed works in terms of architectural choices, training strategies, and evaluation protocols, making direct comparisons difficult. The study finds that while LLM finetuning generally improves performance, the necessity of SFM adaptation and the impact of supporting multiple translation languages remain unclear.

## Method Summary
The survey systematically analyzes nine recent works that combine SFMs and LLMs for speech-to-text translation. The common architecture consists of five building blocks: a Speech Foundation Model (SFM) for extracting semantic representations from audio, a length adapter for compressing speech sequences, a modality adapter for projecting speech embeddings to LLM-compatible space, a prompt-speech mixer for fusing speech content with translation instructions, and an LLM for generating final translations. Training involves finetuning or using LoRA for SFM and LLM components, with evaluation typically using BLEU and COMET metrics on datasets like CoVoST2 and MUST-C.

## Key Results
- Nine surveyed works share a common five-building-block architecture but vary significantly in component choices and training strategies
- LLM finetuning generally improves performance, but the necessity of SFM adaptation remains unclear
- Current approaches lack standardized training settings and evaluation protocols, making direct comparisons difficult
- Supporting multiple translation languages shows mixed results, with some works reporting benefits while others show degradation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: SFMs provide high-level semantic representations that LLMs can use for translation
- Mechanism: SFMs encode speech into semantic embeddings which are then projected into LLM-compatible space via modality adapters
- Core assumption: The semantic representations from SFMs capture enough linguistic information for LLMs to generate accurate translations
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "SFMs ability to encode speech content into rich and high-level representations"
  - [section] "The SFM is in charge of extracting rich, semantic representations from the audio signal"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors discuss similar concepts but don't directly address this specific mechanism
- Break condition: If SFMs fail to capture semantic information beyond surface acoustic features, translation quality degrades significantly

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Length adapters are necessary to bridge the temporal mismatch between speech and text inputs
- Mechanism: Compresses longer speech sequences to match typical LLM input lengths, reducing computational costs and modality mismatch
- Core assumption: Speech sequences are inherently longer than text sequences, creating a mismatch for LLMs trained on text
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "compressing the length of audio sequences – typically longer than the corresponding textual ones"
  - [section] "compressing the length of audio sequences... contributes to reducing the difference between the two modalities"
  - [corpus] Missing - corpus doesn't contain direct evidence about length adapter mechanisms
- Break condition: If length compression is too aggressive, it may lose critical temporal information needed for accurate translation

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Prompt-speech mixers enable effective fusion of speech representations with textual prompts
- Mechanism: Concatenates or interleaves speech embeddings with prompt embeddings to provide context for translation
- Core assumption: LLMs need both speech content and translation instructions to generate accurate outputs
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the prompt-speech mixer that merges the textual prompt with the adapted speech representation"
  - [section] "The goal of the PSMix is to merge the speech representation with the textual prompt"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus mentions related concepts but lacks specific evidence about prompt-speech mixing
- Break condition: If mixing strategy doesn't preserve semantic integrity of either component, translation quality suffers

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Foundation models and their emergent capabilities
  - Why needed here: Understanding why SFMs and LLMs can be combined for ST requires grasping the foundation model paradigm
  - Quick check question: What makes foundation models different from traditional models in terms of capabilities and training approaches?

- Concept: Speech representation learning
  - Why needed here: The quality of speech-to-text translation depends on how well SFMs encode speech into meaningful representations
  - Quick check question: How do self-supervised learning approaches in SFMs differ from supervised approaches in traditional ASR systems?

- Concept: Multimodal learning and cross-modal alignment
  - Why needed here: Combining SFMs and LLMs requires understanding how to align different modalities in a shared semantic space
  - Quick check question: What are the key challenges in aligning speech representations with text representations in a unified model?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: SFM → Length Adapter → Modality Adapter → Prompt-Speech Mixer → LLM
- Critical path: SFM → Length Adapter → Modality Adapter → Prompt-Speech Mixer → LLM
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Freezing vs. finetuning components (SFM/LLM) affects performance vs. computational cost
  - Length compression ratio impacts temporal resolution vs. computational efficiency
  - Modality adapter complexity vs. ability to align modalities
  - Mixing strategy (prepend/append/interleave) vs. preservation of semantic integrity
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor translation quality: Check SFM representation quality and modality alignment
  - High computational costs: Evaluate length compression strategy and component sizes
  - Training instability: Review mixing strategy and prompt design
  - Limited generalization: Examine training data diversity and task scope
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline comparison: Run SFM+LLM with all components frozen vs. standard cascade ST system on CoVoST2
  2. Ablation study: Remove each component (LA, MA, PSMix) individually to measure impact on translation quality
  3. Mixing strategy comparison: Test different PSMix approaches (prepend vs. append vs. interleave) while keeping other components constant

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal architecture for combining SFMs and LLMs for speech-to-text translation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies five architectural building blocks (SFM, length adapter, modality adapter, prompt-speech mixer, and LLM) but notes no consensus on optimal choices for each component.
- Why unresolved: Different works use varying SFMs, length adapters, and LLM integration techniques without systematic comparative studies under controlled conditions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled ablation studies comparing different architectural choices (e.g., different SFMs, length adapters, and LLM integration methods) on the same dataset and evaluation metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How much does SFM finetuning improve speech-to-text translation performance compared to using frozen SFMs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that more than half of examined papers finetune the SFM, while others keep it frozen, but systematic studies on the necessity of SFM adaptation are lacking.
- Why unresolved: Only one study presents results with both SFM and LLM frozen, and the observed benefits of finetuning may be partially attributed to domain adaptation rather than SFM adaptation alone.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of SFM+LLM models with and without SFM finetuning on the same dataset and evaluation metrics, controlling for other factors.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does integrating SFMs with LLMs transfer the in-context learning ability of LLMs to speech-to-text translation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that while LLMs have in-context learning abilities, the transfer of these capabilities to SFM+LLM models for ST is unclear and has not been systematically investigated.
- Why unresolved: Only one attempt at assessing ICL in ST has not been successful, and SFMs like Whisper have their own limited ICL capabilities, making the necessity of SFM+LLM integration for ICL unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Studies comparing the in-context learning performance of SFM+LLM models with standalone SFMs and LLMs on speech-to-text translation tasks with varying amounts of demonstration data.

## Limitations
- Significant architectural heterogeneity across surveyed works makes direct comparisons difficult
- Most works use non-public datasets, limiting reproducibility and fair comparison
- No consensus on optimal choices for any of the five building blocks identified in the survey
- Unclear impact of supporting multiple translation languages versus single-direction approaches

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The identification of five common building blocks in SFM+LLM architectures, the observation that LLM finetuning generally improves performance, and the call for standardized evaluation protocols are well-supported by the surveyed literature.
- **Medium Confidence**: Claims about the effectiveness of specific length compression methods and the impact of modality adapters are based on limited empirical evidence, with most works using different approaches and reporting varying results.
- **Low Confidence**: The necessity of SFM adaptation and the optimal mixing strategy for prompt-speech fusion lack sufficient empirical validation, with conflicting evidence across surveyed works.

## Next Checks

1. **Architecture Ablation Study**: Systematically remove each of the five building blocks (SFM, length adapter, modality adapter, prompt-speech mixer, LLM) individually from a baseline SFM+LLM system to quantify their contribution to translation quality on standardized benchmarks like CoVoST2.

2. **Cross-Architecture Comparison**: Implement three distinct architectural variants (different SFMs, length compression methods, and mixing strategies) using identical training protocols and evaluate on the same public dataset to determine which design choices yield the largest performance gains.

3. **Generalization Assessment**: Test the same SFM+LLM architecture across multiple translation directions (many-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many) and multiple domains to evaluate whether findings from English-centric setups generalize to broader multilingual and multi-domain settings.
