core_contribution: This paper provides the first systematic survey of negotiation
  dialogue systems, covering methodologies, benchmarks, and evaluation metrics. It
  categorizes approaches into negotiator modeling (preference, emotion, opponent behavior),
  strategy modeling (integrative, distributive, multi-party), and action learning
  (reinforcement learning, supervised learning, in-context learning).

# Let's Negotiate! A Survey of Negotiation Dialogue Systems

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2402.01097
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01097
- **Reference count**: 27
- **Primary result**: First systematic survey of negotiation dialogue systems covering methodologies, benchmarks, and evaluation metrics

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of negotiation dialogue systems, systematically categorizing approaches into negotiator modeling, strategy modeling, and action learning. The survey reviews 14 negotiation datasets spanning integrative and distributive negotiation types, including price bargaining, item assignment, and job interviews. The authors identify key research directions including multi-modal, multi-party, and cross-cultural negotiation scenarios while emphasizing the need for real-world negotiation dialogue collection.

The survey provides a foundational framework for understanding the current state of negotiation dialogue systems and serves as a roadmap for future research in this domain. By organizing existing literature into coherent categories and identifying gaps in current methodologies, the paper aims to inspire and facilitate further advancements in negotiation technology.

## Method Summary
The survey systematically categorizes negotiation dialogue systems literature into three main approaches: negotiator modeling (preference, emotion, opponent behavior), strategy modeling (integrative, distributive, multi-party), and action learning (reinforcement learning, supervised learning, in-context learning). The authors reviewed 14 negotiation datasets across different negotiation types and grouped evaluation methods into goal-based, game-based, and human evaluation metrics. The survey methodology is asserted but not explicitly detailed in terms of systematic paper selection or literature search procedures.

## Key Results
- First comprehensive survey categorizing negotiation dialogue system approaches into negotiator modeling, strategy modeling, and action learning
- Review of 14 negotiation datasets spanning integrative and distributive negotiation types including price bargaining, item assignment, and job interviews
- Identification of future research directions including multi-modal, multi-party, and cross-cultural negotiation scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey works by providing a systematic framework that organizes the diverse landscape of negotiation dialogue systems research. By categorizing approaches into three coherent groups (negotiator modeling, strategy modeling, and action learning), the paper creates a taxonomy that helps researchers understand the relationships between different methodologies. The comprehensive dataset review establishes a foundation for understanding available resources, while the evaluation metric classification provides guidance for assessing system performance. This structured approach enables researchers to identify gaps in current research and understand how different components of negotiation systems interact.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Negotiation Types (Integrative vs Distributive)**: Why needed - Different negotiation scenarios require different modeling approaches; quick check - Verify whether a dataset involves win-win or zero-sum scenarios

2. **Negotiator Modeling Components**: Why needed - Understanding preferences, emotions, and opponent behavior is crucial for realistic negotiation agents; quick check - Ensure all three components are represented in system design

3. **Strategy Modeling Frameworks**: Why needed - Different negotiation strategies (integrative, distributive, multi-party) require distinct algorithmic approaches; quick check - Match strategy type to appropriate modeling technique

4. **Action Learning Paradigms**: Why needed - Choice between reinforcement learning, supervised learning, or in-context learning affects system capabilities and training requirements; quick check - Verify alignment between learning paradigm and negotiation complexity

5. **Evaluation Metric Categories**: Why needed - Different evaluation approaches measure different aspects of system performance; quick check - Ensure evaluation metrics align with system goals

6. **Dataset Characteristics**: Why needed - Dataset properties determine suitability for different research questions; quick check - Verify dataset aligns with target negotiation scenario

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Negotiator Modeling (Preference, Emotion, Opponent Behavior) -> Strategy Modeling (Integrative, Distributive, Multi-party) -> Action Learning (RL, Supervised, In-context) -> Evaluation Metrics (Goal-based, Game-based, Human)

**Critical Path**: Data Collection -> Negotiator Modeling -> Strategy Selection -> Action Learning -> System Evaluation

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Choice between integrative and distributive strategies affects system complexity and potential outcomes
- Reinforcement learning offers adaptability but requires extensive training data, while supervised learning is faster but less flexible
- Multi-party negotiation systems are more complex but more realistic for many real-world scenarios

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Poor negotiator modeling leads to unrealistic opponent behavior and suboptimal outcomes
- Inappropriate strategy selection results in failed negotiations or suboptimal agreements
- Inadequate evaluation metrics may miss critical system weaknesses

**First Experiments**:
1. Test negotiator preference modeling on a simple integrative negotiation dataset
2. Compare reinforcement learning vs supervised learning approaches on a distributive negotiation task
3. Evaluate strategy selection performance across different negotiation types

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How to effectively model multi-modal negotiation scenarios that involve non-verbal communication
- Methods for handling cross-cultural differences in negotiation styles and preferences
- Techniques for scaling negotiation systems to handle complex multi-party scenarios
- Approaches for collecting and utilizing real-world negotiation dialogues to improve system performance

## Limitations
- The systematic nature of the survey is asserted but not demonstrated through explicit methodology for paper selection, potentially introducing selection bias
- The classification framework may oversimplify nuanced distinctions between negotiation strategies and modeling approaches
- The survey lacks quantitative analysis of dataset characteristics and their relative utility, limiting reproducibility

## Confidence
- **Systematic coverage claim**: Medium confidence - Asserted but methodology not explicitly detailed
- **First comprehensive survey claim**: Low confidence - No evidence of exhaustive literature search provided
- **Future directions**: Medium confidence - Reasonable but not empirically grounded in identified research gaps

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the paper selection methodology to verify the completeness of the literature coverage and assess potential selection bias
2. Conduct empirical comparisons of the reviewed datasets and evaluation metrics to determine their relative effectiveness
3. Perform a systematic mapping study to validate the proposed classification framework and identify any missing research categories or approaches
