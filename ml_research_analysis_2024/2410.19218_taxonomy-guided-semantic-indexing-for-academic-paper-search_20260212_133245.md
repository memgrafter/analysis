- Key outcome: TaxoIndex achieves up to 30% improvement in NDCG@5 over state-of-the-art baselines for academic paper search

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Taxonomy-guided Semantic Indexing (TaxoIndex), a framework that addresses the challenge of matching underlying academic concepts between queries and documents in academic paper search. TaxoIndex constructs a semantic index that stores key concepts from papers at both topic and phrase levels, guided by an academic taxonomy. The framework then leverages this index to identify and incorporate these concepts into relevance predictions, enhancing existing dense retrievers. Extensive experiments on two academic paper search datasets demonstrate that TaxoIndex significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 30% improvement in NDCG@5 even with limited training data, while offering enhanced interpretability by explicitly representing each text with topics and phrases.

## Method Summary
TaxoIndex is a taxonomy-guided semantic indexing framework that enhances academic paper search by constructing a semantic index of key concepts at topic and phrase levels. The framework first builds a semantic index using an academic taxonomy, extracting core topics and indicative phrases from papers. It then trains an indexing network to identify the most related concepts from input text through two-level classification tasks. Finally, it fuses these index-based representations with backbone embeddings using a fusion network, allowing for enhanced relevance prediction while maintaining interpretability by explicitly representing each text with identified topics and phrases.

## Key Results
- TaxoIndex achieves up to 30% improvement in NDCG@5 compared to state-of-the-art dense retrievers
- Demonstrates significant robustness to limited training data availability
- Enhances interpretability by explicitly representing documents and queries with topics and phrases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: TaxoIndex extracts key concepts from papers and organizes them as a semantic index guided by an academic taxonomy, then leverages this index to identify academic concepts and link queries and documents.
- Mechanism: The framework constructs a semantic index that stores semantic components best describing each paper, representing each paper at both topic and phrase levels. This index serves as foundational knowledge to identify academic concepts and link queries and documents, enhancing existing dense retrievers.
- Core assumption: Academic concepts can be effectively captured and organized using an academic taxonomy to guide the indexing process.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "TaxoIndex extracts key concepts from papers and organizes them as a semantic index guided by an academic taxonomy, and then leverages this index as foundational knowledge to identify academic concepts and link queries and documents."
  - [section 4.1]: "We construct a semantic index that stores semantic components that best describe each paper. To guide this process, we propose using the academic taxonomy."
- Break condition: If the academic taxonomy is incomplete or outdated, or if the extracted concepts do not accurately represent the underlying academic concepts in the papers.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: TaxoIndex introduces an index learning strategy that allows for identifying the most related concepts from an input text.
- Mechanism: The framework trains an add-on module to explicitly identify the indexed information for input text. This is achieved through two-level classification tasks (topic and phrase levels) that predict the corresponding core topics and indicative phrases for each input text.
- Core assumption: The indexed information can be effectively used to identify the most related concepts from input text, even if expressed in different terms or not explicitly mentioned.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We then propose a new training strategy, called index learning, that trains a model to explicitly identify the indexed information for input text."
  - [section 4.2.1]: "We train an add-on module to enhance relevance prediction while keeping the backbone retriever frozen... It comprises an indexing network and a fusion network, and is applied identically
