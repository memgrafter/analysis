## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a volumetric conditional score-based residual diffusion model for PET/MR denoising. The CSRD framework combines score-based generative modeling with residual learning to address noise in medical imaging data. The approach leverages conditional information from both PET and MR modalities to produce cleaner, more diagnostically useful images while preserving anatomical details critical for clinical interpretation.

## Method Summary
The CSRD model employs a diffusion probabilistic framework that learns the score function of the data distribution conditioned on both PET and MR inputs. The architecture incorporates a residual connection that allows the model to focus on learning the noise component rather than the full image distribution. During training, the model is exposed to noisy PET/MR pairs and learns to predict the clean image through a sequence of denoising steps guided by the learned score function. The conditional aspect enables the model to utilize complementary information from both modalities to achieve superior denoising performance.

## Key Results
- CSRD achieves lower mean squared error compared to conventional denoising approaches on PET/MR datasets
- The model preserves fine anatomical details while effectively reducing noise in low-count PET images
- Cross-validation results show consistent performance improvements across different noise levels and imaging protocols

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The model's effectiveness stems from combining score-based generative modeling with residual learning in a volumetric setting. By learning the score function of the conditional distribution, the model can effectively guide the denoising process through the reverse diffusion process. The residual formulation allows the network to focus on the noise component rather than learning the entire image distribution, making training more efficient and stable. The volumetric approach leverages 3D spatial context, which is particularly important for medical imaging where anatomical relationships span multiple slices.

## Foundational Learning
- **Score-based generative modeling**: A framework for learning data distributions through denoising score matching; needed to enable the reverse diffusion process for image generation/denoising
- **Residual learning**: Technique where the model predicts the difference between noisy and clean images rather than the full image; improves training stability and convergence
- **Conditional diffusion models**: Models that incorporate additional information (PET/MR) to guide the denoising process; enables modality-specific noise characteristics to be addressed
- **Volumetric processing**: 3D convolution operations that process entire volumes rather than individual slices; captures spatial context across slices
- **Denoising score matching**: Training objective that minimizes the difference between estimated and true scores; provides stable training for score-based models
- **Cross-modality learning**: Joint processing of complementary imaging modalities; leverages information from both PET and MR for improved denoising

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: PET/MR inputs -> Encoder -> Score Network -> Residual Block -> Denoising Steps -> Clean Output

Critical path: The score network with residual connections forms the core of the denoising pipeline, where the model iteratively refines noisy estimates through the learned score function.

Design tradeoffs: The model balances between the expressiveness of the score network and computational efficiency, with volumetric processing providing improved spatial context at the cost of increased memory requirements.

Failure signatures: Poor performance may manifest as over-smoothing of fine details, failure to remove high-frequency noise, or introduction of artifacts when modalities are poorly aligned or when noise levels exceed training distribution.

First experiments:
1. Test denoising performance on synthetic noise injection to establish baseline capabilities
2. Evaluate cross-modal information utilization by ablating one modality during inference
3. Assess sensitivity to noise level variations by testing on images with noise levels outside the training distribution
