# Few-shot Novel View Synthesis using Depth Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2410.11080
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11080
- **Authors**: Raja Kumar; Vanshika Vats
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: 10.5% PSNR, 6% SSIM, and 14.1% LPIPS improvement on LLFF dataset with 5 input views

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a depth-aware 3D Gaussian splatting method for few-shot novel view synthesis, addressing the challenge of reconstructing high-quality novel views from limited input views. The authors introduce monocular depth prediction as a prior to constrain 3D shape reconstruction, combined with a scale-invariant depth loss and lower-order spherical harmonics for color modeling to prevent overfitting. Their approach retains all Gaussians rather than periodically removing low-opacity ones, maintaining point cloud density. The method demonstrates significant quantitative improvements over traditional 3D Gaussian splatting on the LLFF dataset.

## Method Summary
The proposed method leverages monocular depth prediction as geometric prior to constrain 3D shape reconstruction in few-shot scenarios. A scale-invariant depth loss is employed alongside lower-order spherical harmonics for color modeling to avoid overfitting when training data is limited. The approach uniquely retains all Gaussians throughout training rather than periodically culling low-opacity ones, preserving point cloud density. These modifications to standard 3D Gaussian splatting enable better generalization from sparse input views while maintaining reconstruction quality.

## Key Results
- Achieves 10.5% improvement in PSNR compared to traditional 3D Gaussian splatting
- Demonstrates 6% improvement in SSIM metric
- Shows 14.1% improvement in LPIPS metric on LLFF dataset with 5 input views

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by introducing geometric priors through monocular depth estimation, which provides strong constraints on 3D shape when few input views are available. The scale-invariant depth loss ensures consistent optimization regardless of depth scale variations, while lower-order spherical harmonics for color modeling reduces parameter complexity and prevents overfitting to limited training data. Retaining all Gaussians maintains dense point cloud representation, avoiding information loss that occurs with periodic culling. These combined strategies address the fundamental challenge of sparse-view reconstruction by providing additional constraints beyond what can be learned from limited observations alone.

## Foundational Learning

**3D Gaussian Splatting**: A rendering technique that represents scenes using anisotropic Gaussian primitives for efficient novel view synthesis. *Why needed*: Provides the base framework for the proposed depth-aware enhancements. *Quick check*: Understand how Gaussians are parameterized (position, covariance, color) and rendered.

**Monocular Depth Estimation**: Predicting per-pixel depth from single images using deep neural networks. *Why needed*: Serves as geometric prior to constrain 3D shape reconstruction when input views are limited. *Quick check*: Review depth prediction accuracy on various scene types and failure modes.

**Scale-Invariant Depth Loss**: A loss function that remains consistent across different depth scales, typically using inverse depth or log-space formulations. *Why needed*: Ensures stable training regardless of depth magnitude variations across scenes. *Quick check*: Compare scale-invariant vs standard depth loss performance on synthetic data.

**Spherical Harmonics for Color Modeling**: Using lower-order spherical harmonic basis functions to represent lighting and material properties. *Why needed*: Reduces model complexity and prevents overfitting when training data is limited. *Quick check*: Examine how different harmonic orders affect color reconstruction quality.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Views -> Depth Estimation -> 3D Gaussian Initialization -> Depth-Aware Optimization -> Novel View Synthesis

**Critical Path**: The most critical components are the monocular depth estimation module and the scale-invariant depth loss computation, as these provide the primary constraints that enable few-shot generalization.

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Gaussian retention vs. culling: Retaining all Gaussians maintains density but may increase computational cost
- Lower-order vs. full spherical harmonics: Reduces overfitting risk but may limit color fidelity
- Depth prior vs. data-driven learning: Provides strong constraints but depends on depth estimation accuracy

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Poor depth estimation quality propagates to geometry artifacts
- Insufficient spherical harmonic order leads to color bleeding or inaccurate lighting
- Excessive Gaussian density causes rendering inefficiency without quality gains

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Validate depth estimation accuracy on the target dataset and analyze failure cases
2. Compare reconstruction quality with different spherical harmonic orders (2nd, 4th, 6th)
3. Measure rendering performance impact of Gaussian retention strategy versus periodic culling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on monocular depth estimation introduces uncertainty, particularly for textureless or reflective surfaces
- Improvement metrics are reported only on LLFF dataset with 5 input views, limiting generalizability
- No discussion of computational overhead from retaining all Gaussians and its impact on rendering efficiency

## Confidence
- Depth-aware constraints and scale-invariant loss: High
- Gaussian retention strategy: Medium
- Quantitative improvements: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Test the method on multiple datasets (e.g., Tanks and Temples, BlendedMVG) with varying numbers of input views (3, 5, 8, 10) to establish robustness across different scenarios.
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing the proposed spherical harmonics approach against full spherical harmonics and other color representations in terms of both reconstruction quality and overfitting prevention.
3. Measure and report rendering performance (FPS) and memory usage with the all-Gaussian retention strategy compared to the periodic culling approach, particularly as scene complexity increases.
