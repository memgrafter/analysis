## Executive Summary
This paper introduces AirSketch, a novel approach for generating sketches directly from hand motion videos without requiring specialized hardware or markers. The method leverages controllable diffusion models trained via a self-supervised augmentation-based procedure to transform noisy hand-tracking images into clean, aesthetically pleasing sketches. Two datasets—synthetic and real—were created for evaluation, featuring hand-drawn sketches paired with corresponding motion videos. The approach significantly improves sketch fidelity over baselines, with SSIM increases of up to 10% and reductions in Chamfer Distance of up to 21%. The model generalizes well to unseen categories and supports additional tasks like sketch completion and text-conditioned styling. The results demonstrate that controllable diffusion models can effectively interpret distorted motion inputs to produce faithful, visually coherent sketches, advancing marker-less air drawing applications.

## Method Summary
AirSketch uses controllable diffusion models (specifically ControlNet with Stable Diffusion XL) trained through an augmentation-based self-supervised procedure to generate sketches from hand motion videos. The method extracts hand tracking images from video using MediaPipe, then applies random augmentations (local distortions, structural misalignments, false strokes) to clean sketches from the Quick, Draw! dataset to create synthetic noisy inputs. During training, the model learns to map these distorted views back to clean sketches. The approach supports both unconditional generation and text-conditioned styling, with CLIP embeddings providing semantic guidance for ambiguous cases.

## Key Results
- SSIM increases of up to 10% over baseline methods on sketch generation from hand motion
- Chamfer Distance reductions of up to 21% on unseen sketch categories
- Effective generalization to unseen categories with 24.7% CLIP I2T similarity improvement when using text prompts
- Robust performance across different hand tracking algorithms (MediaPipe, OpenPose, NSRM)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The augmentation-based training enables ControlNet to learn a robust mapping from noisy tracking images to clean sketches by simulating common distortions during training. By applying structured augmentations (local distortions, structural misalignments, and false strokes) to clean sketches, the model learns to recognize and correct these errors when presented with real tracking data. The core assumption is that the distribution of simulated augmentations closely matches real-world tracking errors.

### Mechanism 2
Text prompts provide semantic guidance that helps the model disambiguate between visually similar but semantically different sketches. When the input tracking image is ambiguous, the text prompt helps the model generate the correct sketch by providing category-level semantic information. The core assumption is that the model can effectively integrate text embeddings with spatial conditioning information.

### Mechanism 3
Controllable diffusion models can effectively "reconstruct" clean sketches from severely distorted inputs by learning a non-linear mapping function. The ControlNet adapter learns to transform the distorted conditioning image into spatial features that guide the denoising UNet toward generating the clean target sketch. The core assumption is that the diffusion model's architecture is sufficiently flexible to learn this mapping despite the large domain gap between noisy and clean sketches.

## Foundational Learning

- **Diffusion Probabilistic Models**: The method uses diffusion models as the base architecture for sketch generation. *Why needed*: Diffusion models provide a framework for generating high-quality images through iterative denoising. *Quick check*: What are the key components of a diffusion model's forward and reverse processes?

- **Controllable Generation with Conditioners**: ControlNet and T2IAdapter are used to add spatial conditioning to the diffusion model. *Why needed*: These adapters enable the model to incorporate spatial information from hand tracking images. *Quick check*: How do ControlNet and T2IAdapter differ in their approach to conditioning?

- **Self-supervised Learning**: The training procedure is self-supervised, using augmentations of clean sketches as pseudo-noisy inputs. *Why needed*: This approach enables training without requiring paired noisy-clean sketch datasets. *Quick check*: What are the advantages of using self-supervised learning for this task?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Clean sketch → Augmentation → Distorted sketch → ControlNet → Clean sketch generation
- **Critical path**: 1) Load clean sketch from Quick, Draw! dataset, 2) Apply random augmentations to create distorted version, 3) Pass distorted sketch to ControlNet conditioner, 4) Generate clean sketch using diffusion UNet, 5) Compute similarity metrics between generated and ground truth
- **Design tradeoffs**: Using augmentations vs real noisy data (synthetic but controllable vs authentic but harder to collect), ControlNet vs T2IAdapter (more spatial control vs lighter weight), text conditioning strength (helps with ambiguity vs may override visual cues)
- **Failure signatures**: Model fails to improve over baseline when augmentations are absent, performance drops significantly on unseen categories, generated sketches retain noise characteristics from tracking images
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Train ControlNet without augmentations as baseline, 2) Train with only local augmentations to assess their importance, 3) Train with text prompts disabled to measure their contribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the traditional sense, but several important limitations are acknowledged in the discussion section. The authors note that this work does not explore the possibility of using hand gestures to create complex, full color images, and assumes that the desired output sketch is simple and often cartoon-like. They also acknowledge that while the method generalizes to unseen categories, there is a notable performance drop (24.7% CLIP I2T similarity decrease) when text prompts are not present, suggesting limitations in visual feature extraction from noisy inputs.

## Limitations

- Domain gap concerns between simulated augmentations and real tracking noise across diverse scenarios
- Strong dependence on text prompts for unseen categories, indicating limitations in visual feature extraction
- Performance degradation on unseen categories (24.7% CLIP I2T similarity decrease without prompts)

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims**:
- Augmentation-based training effectively improves sketch generation quality over baseline methods
- Controllable diffusion model architecture can learn to denoise hand-tracking images when properly trained
- Approach successfully generates sketches from hand motion videos without specialized hardware

**Medium Confidence Claims**:
- Method generalizes well to unseen sketch categories (supported by metrics but with notable performance degradation)
- Text prompts significantly improve generation quality for ambiguous cases
- Synthetic dataset sufficiently represents real-world tracking conditions

**Low Confidence Claims**:
- Approach will maintain performance across diverse real-world tracking conditions
- Method's robustness to varying sketch styles and complexity levels
- Scalability of approach to more complex drawing tasks beyond simple sketches

## Next Checks

1. **Real-World Tracking Validation**: Test the model on hand motion videos captured with different cameras and tracking conditions (varying lighting, occlusion, camera angles) to assess robustness beyond the synthetic dataset.

2. **Ablation Study on Augmentation Types**: Systematically disable each augmentation type (local, structural, false strokes) to quantify their individual contributions and identify which are most critical for bridging the domain gap.

3. **Cross-Category Transfer Analysis**: Evaluate performance on categories with varying degrees of visual similarity to training data, particularly focusing on fine-grained distinctions (e.g., different animal types) to better understand generalization limits.
