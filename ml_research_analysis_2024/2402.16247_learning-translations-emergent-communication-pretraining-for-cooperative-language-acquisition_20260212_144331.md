# Learning Translations: Emergent Communication Pretraining for Cooperative Language Acquisition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.16247
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16247
- Reference count: 26
- Key outcome: ECTL outperforms IL in data-scarce settings and can communicate with human users while IL cannot

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Cooperative Language Acquisition Problem (CLAP), where an agent must learn to communicate with a target community from observational data. The authors propose two methods: Imitation Learning (IL) and Emergent Communication pretraining and Translation Learning (ECTL). ECTL combines self-play emergent communication pretraining with supervised translation learning, allowing agents to first develop general environment skills before adapting to a specific communication protocol. Experiments on gridworld and driving environments demonstrate that ECTL outperforms IL when data is limited and achieves better robustness to incomplete expert demonstrations. Most notably, ECTL can learn to communicate with human users while IL fails in this setting.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces two approaches for the CLAP problem: Imitation Learning (IL) and Emergent Communication pretraining and Translation Learning (ECTL). IL directly learns from expert demonstrations using supervised learning on signaling and listening datasets. ECTL first pretrains agents in self-play using emergent communication (EC), then learns translation functions to map between the emergent protocol and target community protocol. The translation phase involves learning two functions: τs (signaling) mapping from EC to target protocol, and τr (listening) mapping from target to EC protocol. During evaluation, ECTL agents use the pretrained communication policy with translation functions to interact with the target community.

## Key Results
- ECTL outperforms IL when data is limited, achieving higher rewards with fewer training episodes
- ECTL demonstrates better robustness to incomplete expert demonstrations, particularly in environments with state space biases
- ECTL can learn to communicate with human users, while IL fails in this setting
- The advantage of ECTL stems from pretraining in self-play, which provides broader state space coverage before learning to translate between communication protocols

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** ECTL outperforms IL in data-scarce settings because pretraining provides broader state space coverage before translation.
- **Mechanism:** The agent first learns general environment-level skills through emergent communication self-play, exploring states that expert demonstrations might miss. When translating to the target protocol, it already has a robust policy foundation, reducing error compounding.
- **Core assumption:** The self-play environment is sufficiently similar to the target community's environment for skills to transfer.
- **Evidence anchors:** Abstract shows ECTL outperforms IL with limited data; section 4.2 discusses IL brittleness and error compounding in Figure 2; corpus evidence is weak.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** ECTL maintains performance better than IL when expert demonstrations cover limited state distributions (e.g., avoiding the pit region).
- **Mechanism:** IL agents learn reactive policies only from demonstrated states, so when they encounter unseen states (like the pit region), they fail catastrophically. ECTL agents, having explored the full state space during pretraining, can navigate unseen regions effectively.
- **Core assumption:** Expert demonstrations exhibit sampling bias that omits important regions of the state space.
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 5.5 shows IL significantly degrades when data is limited without the pit; section 4.2 discusses IL exiting expert state distribution; corpus evidence is weak.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** ECTL can learn to communicate with human users while IL cannot because the translation framework handles protocol mismatches.
- **Mechanism:** ECTL learns a bidirectional translation between the emergent protocol and target protocol. When the target is human-generated, the translation function adapts the learned protocol to human communication patterns, while IL lacks this adaptation mechanism.
- **Core assumption:** Human communication patterns can be modeled as a protocol that differs from the emergent protocol but is learnable through supervised translation.
- **Evidence anchors:** Section 5.6 shows only ECTL agent effectively communicates with user; section 4.2 describes τs and τr translation functions; corpus evidence is weak.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Dec-POMDPs and Dec-POMDP-Com**
  - Why needed here: The problem is formally defined as a Dec-POMDP-Com where agents communicate via cheap-talk channels, and understanding the factorization of policies is crucial for the ECTL architecture.
  - Quick check question: In a Dec-POMDP-Com with N agents, how many communication channels exist if each agent can send messages to every other agent?

- **Concept: Imitation Learning vs. Reinforcement Learning**
  - Why needed here: The paper contrasts IL (learning from demonstrations) with RL (learning through interaction), and the ECTL method combines both approaches. Understanding their tradeoffs is essential for grasping why ECTL works.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between how IL and RL handle unseen states during evaluation?

- **Concept: Zero-Shot Coordination**
  - Why needed here: CLAP is positioned between ZSC and AHT, relaxing ZSC assumptions by allowing observational data. Understanding ZSC helps frame why the problem is interesting.
  - Quick check question: What is the fundamental challenge in Zero-Shot Coordination that CLAP attempts to address by allowing observational data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Observation → Encoder → Communication Translation → Message → Listening Translation → Action Head → Action
- **Critical path:** The communication channel goes through both translation functions before affecting the action
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Fixed vs. learned translation: Fixed translation (e.g., identity) is simpler but cannot handle protocol mismatches
  - Separate vs. joint translation: Separate translation functions allow asymmetric protocols but double the parameters
  - Pretraining environment: Must balance between being rich enough for skill transfer but similar enough to target
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Poor pretraining: ECTL performs similarly to IL, suggesting the pretraining phase didn't provide benefits
  - Translation collapse: If τs and τr mappings become degenerate, communication breaks down
  - Distribution mismatch: If evaluation states differ greatly from pretraining states, the policy fails
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Gridworld CLAP-Replace with unbiased data: Should show ECTL ≈ IL performance, validating both methods work
  2. Gridworld CLAP-Replace with biased data (limited columns): Should show ECTL >> IL, demonstrating pretraining advantage
  3. Driving game CLAP-Replace with/without pit: Should show ECTL robust to pit while IL degrades, demonstrating state space coverage benefits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do IL and ECTL methods scale with larger message alphabets and more complex environments?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions that IL scales better than ECTL with more data in the driving environment, but does not explore larger message spaces or more complex environments.
- Why unresolved: The experiments were limited to small message alphabets (5 and 16 symbols) and relatively simple environments. Scaling to larger message spaces or more complex tasks could reveal fundamental limitations of either approach.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying message alphabet size, environment complexity, and state space dimensions while comparing IL and ECTL performance and data efficiency.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between EC pretraining and target community data collection for ECTL?
- Basis in paper: The paper shows ECTL outperforms IL with limited data but does not explore the trade-off between EC pretraining quality and amount of target community data needed.
- Why unresolved: The experiments used fixed EC pretraining and varied only target data collection. The relationship between pretraining quality, pretraining duration, and target data requirements is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments varying EC pretraining duration, quality metrics, and target data collection simultaneously to identify optimal resource allocation.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do communication protocols learned through ECTL generalize to completely new tasks or environments?
- Basis in paper: The paper focuses on learning to communicate within the same environment as the target community, but does not test cross-task or cross-environment generalization.
- Why unresolved: The experiments only evaluate within-environment transfer. The ability to leverage learned communication protocols for novel tasks remains unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing ECTL-trained agents on modified versions of the original environments or entirely different tasks to measure protocol generalization.

## Limitations

- The human-AI communication experiments use fixed identity translation functions rather than learned translation, weakening the claim about ECTL's ability to communicate with humans
- The analysis of why ECTL works better (broader state space coverage) is supported by gridworld experiments but not comprehensively validated in the driving environment
- The claim about ECTL's robustness to biased expert demonstrations is demonstrated in gridworld but not tested across different types of bias

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: ECTL outperforms IL when data is limited in gridworld CLAP-Replace experiments
- **Medium confidence**: ECTL provides better state space coverage than IL due to pretraining
- **Low confidence**: ECTL can learn to communicate with human users (fixed translation used in human experiments)

## Next Checks

1. Re-run the human-AI communication experiment with learned translation functions rather than fixed identity mappings to properly test the ECTL claim about human communication.

2. Test ECTL robustness to different types of expert demonstration bias beyond the limited column bias shown in gridworld, such as state-action biases or temporal biases.

3. Conduct ablation studies removing the pretraining phase to quantify exactly how much of ECTL's advantage comes from pretraining versus the translation learning component.
