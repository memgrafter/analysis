# k-MLE, k-Bregman, k-VARs: Theory, Convergence, Computation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2409.06938
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06938
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: A new hard clustering method (k-MLE) based on likelihood rather than distance, with convergence guarantees and application to time series clustering (k-VARs).

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces k-MLE, a hard clustering method that maximizes likelihood rather than minimizing distance or divergence. Unlike traditional clustering algorithms, k-MLE can handle multimodal, hybrid, and spatio-temporal data by leveraging appropriate probability models. The authors prove convergence of k-MLE using cyclic ascent optimization and show that k-Bregman clustering is a special case of k-MLE, providing the first complete convergence proof for this class. The paper extends k-MLE to autocorrelated time series clustering with k-VARs, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods on both simulated and real data.

## Method Summary
The paper develops k-MLE as a hard clustering framework based on maximizing a classification likelihood. The method uses cyclic ascent to iteratively optimize cluster assignments and parameters, with convergence guaranteed under compactness conditions. The authors show k-Bregman clustering is a special case when distributions belong to exponential families. For time series clustering, they develop k-VARs using VAR models with QR decomposition for efficient parameter estimation. Model selection employs BIC to choose cluster numbers and model orders. The algorithms are validated on synthetic and real time series data, showing improved performance over baselines like k-DBA, k-Shape, and k-GAK.

## Key Results
- k-MLE provides a general framework for hard clustering based on likelihood rather than distance measures
- k-Bregman clustering is proven to be a special case of k-MLE with guaranteed convergence
- k-VARs outperforms existing time series clustering methods, particularly for strongly autocorrelated data
- The BIC-based model selection procedure effectively chooses appropriate model orders and cluster numbers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: k-MLE's convergence is guaranteed because its cyclic ascent algorithm produces a non-decreasing sequence of log-likelihoods that must converge to a partial maximum in finite steps.
- **Mechanism**: The algorithm iteratively maximizes the log-likelihood over discrete label assignments (τ) and continuous parameters (Θ) in a cyclic manner. Because B is a finite set and Ω is compact, the algorithm cannot cycle indefinitely and must terminate at a point where further improvement is impossible.
- **Core assumption**: The log-likelihood is continuous in parameters and the parameter space is compact (bounded and closed).
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "We develop hard clustering based on likelihood rather than distance and prove convergence."
  - [section] "The k-MLE algorithm solves the hybrid k-MLE problem by cyclic ascent... Notice there is no requirement that the log-density is a similarity measure."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence for convergence guarantees; corpus papers focus on other clustering aspects without convergence proofs.
- **Break condition**: If the parameter space is not compact or the log-likelihood is discontinuous, convergence is not guaranteed.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: k-MLE generalizes hard clustering by replacing distance-based similarity with likelihood-based clustering, enabling application to a broader range of data types.
- **Mechanism**: By formulating clustering as a maximum likelihood problem, k-MLE can handle multimodal data, hybrid data, and spatio-temporal data where traditional distance measures fail to capture the underlying structure.
- **Core assumption**: The data can be modeled with appropriate probability distributions for each cluster.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "k-MLE is based on likelihood and thus has a far greater range of application."
  - [section] "We now note two important properties of the DL-CL which now follow immediately... Property P2: L(τ, Θ) is separable in (τ, Θ)."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence; corpus focuses on other clustering methodologies without likelihood-based approaches.
- **Break condition**: If no suitable probability model exists for the data, k-MLE cannot be applied.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: k-Bregman clustering is a special case of k-MLE, and k-MLE provides the first complete convergence proof for this class of methods.
- **Mechanism**: Bregman divergences arise naturally from exponential family distributions. By recognizing k-Bregman as a special case of k-MLE, we can leverage the general convergence theory to prove convergence for k-Bregman methods.
- **Core assumption**: The cluster distributions belong to regular exponential families.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "We show that ‘k-Bregman’ clustering is a special case of k-MLE and thus provide, for the first time, a complete proof of convergence for k-Bregman clustering."
  - [section] "We now show that the Bregman hard clustering algorithm for exponential families is a special case of k-MLE; we henceforth refer to it as k-Bregman."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; corpus papers discuss clustering but not specifically k-Bregman or its convergence.
- **Break condition**: If the distributions are not exponential families, k-Bregman methods cannot be applied and the convergence proof does not hold.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
  - Why needed here: k-MLE is fundamentally based on maximizing the likelihood of the data given cluster assignments and parameters.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between likelihood and probability, and why is maximizing likelihood appropriate for clustering?

- **Concept**: Exponential Family Distributions
  - Why needed here: Understanding Bregman divergences and their connection to exponential families is crucial for recognizing k-Bregman as a special case of k-MLE.
  - Quick check question: What are the key properties of exponential family distributions, and how do they relate to Bregman divergences?

- **Concept**: Cyclic Ascent/Coordinate Ascent Optimization
  - Why needed here: The k-MLE algorithm uses cyclic ascent to iteratively optimize over labels and parameters, and understanding its convergence properties is essential.
  - Quick check question: Under what conditions does cyclic ascent converge to a local maximum, and what are the potential pitfalls?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data input -> Parameter initialization -> Label assignment -> Parameter estimation -> Convergence check -> Model selection
- **Critical path**:
  1. Initialize parameters (randomly or using k-means)
  2. Assign labels based on current parameters
  3. Update parameters using MLE equations
  4. Check for convergence (log-likelihood change < epsilon)
  5. Repeat steps 2-4 until convergence

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Computational cost vs. accuracy: More iterations improve accuracy but increase computation time
  - Model complexity vs. overfitting: Complex models may fit noise rather than underlying structure
  - Initialization sensitivity: Different initializations may lead to different local optima

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Slow convergence: May indicate poor initialization or ill-conditioned data
  - Convergence to poor local optima: Try multiple random initializations and select the best
  - Numerical instability: Check for singular matrices or overflow/underflow in computations

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Test on synthetic Gaussian mixture data with known clusters to verify accuracy
  2. Compare performance with k-means on real-world datasets to demonstrate advantages
  3. Evaluate robustness to noise and outliers by adding varying levels of contamination to data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question**: Under what specific conditions on the log-likelihood function ℓ(xn, θ) does k-MLE exhibit guaranteed convergence to a global optimum rather than just a local one?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The paper discusses convergence to partial maxima and local maxima, but does not establish conditions for global convergence. It mentions uniqueness conditions for MLE but focuses on local optimality.
- **Why unresolved**: The general convergence proof only establishes convergence to a partial maximum, which may not be a global optimum. The paper does not explore conditions under which the partial maximum is also a global maximum.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Mathematical proof showing that under certain conditions on the log-likelihood function (e.g., convexity, strict concavity) the partial maximum is guaranteed to be the global maximum. Empirical validation on datasets with known global optima would support theoretical findings.

### Open Question 2
- **Question**: How does the performance of k-MLE compare to other clustering methods when applied to high-dimensional data (d >> N) where the number of parameters in the model exceeds the number of data points?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The paper focuses on applications with moderate dimensions and does not address the high-dimensional setting. The model selection procedure using BIC assumes sufficient data for reliable parameter estimation.
- **Why unresolved**: High-dimensional settings present challenges for parameter estimation and model selection that are not addressed in the current framework. The convergence proof relies on bounded parameter spaces which may not hold in high dimensions.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Comparative studies of k-MLE versus other methods on high-dimensional datasets with varying n and d. Development of modified model selection criteria for high-dimensional settings would be needed.

### Open Question 3
- **Question**: Can the k-MLE framework be extended to handle non-stationary time series where the underlying data generating process changes over time?
- **Basis in paper**: [inferred] The k-VARs application assumes stationary time series. The convergence proof relies on stationary likelihood functions. The paper does not discuss extensions to non-stationary settings.
- **Why unresolved**: Non-stationary data violates the assumptions underlying the k-MLE derivation and convergence proof. The current framework assumes a fixed number of clusters and fixed model parameters within each cluster.
- **What evidence would resolve it**: Mathematical extension of the k-MLE framework to handle time-varying parameters or regime-switching models. Empirical validation on non-stationary datasets showing improved clustering performance over stationary methods.

## Limitations
- The convergence proof requires compact parameter spaces, which may need explicit truncation for many practical distributions
- Computational complexity of k-VARs may limit scalability to long time series or high-dimensional data
- The claim about handling "spatio-temporal data" is mentioned but not demonstrated or elaborated upon

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The theoretical framework connecting k-MLE to existing clustering methods and the general convergence result for k-MLE. The BIC-based model selection procedure is well-established.
- **Medium Confidence**: The practical performance of k-VARs on real-world time series data, as the experimental validation is limited to a few datasets with specific characteristics.
- **Low Confidence**: The claim about handling "spatio-temporal data" is mentioned but not demonstrated or elaborated upon in the paper.

## Next Checks
1. **Compactness Enforcement**: Implement and test explicit parameter space constraints in the k-MLE algorithm to verify that convergence is maintained under practical, non-compact distributions.
2. **Scalability Analysis**: Benchmark k-VARs on time series of varying lengths and dimensions to quantify the computational burden of the QR decomposition optimization and identify practical limits.
3. **Spatio-Temporal Extension**: Design and implement a prototype k-MLE variant for spatio-temporal data (e.g., using Gaussian processes or conditional random fields) to assess the feasibility of the claimed broader applicability.
