# Unveiling Ontological Commitment in Multi-Modal Foundation Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.17109
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17109
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Extracts meaningful ontological hierarchies from multimodal models, achieving 92% accuracy with transformer-based CLIP

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a method to extract ontological commitment from multimodal foundation models by identifying superclass hierarchies for given leaf concepts. The approach leverages the semantic similarity encoding of deep neural networks via vector distances and their text-to-image alignment capability. By applying hierarchical clustering to leaf concept embeddings and labeling the resulting clusters using search in available ontologies, the method successfully extracts meaningful ontologies that can be verified against given knowledge graphs.

## Method Summary
The approach extracts ontological commitments by first obtaining leaf concept embeddings from a multimodal model's textual input modality, then applying hierarchical clustering to these embeddings to discover superclass relationships. The cluster centers are labeled using nearest-neighbor search in available ontologies like ConceptNet. The method was validated on CIFAR-10 using CLIP models, showing that ontology inference significantly improves accuracy compared to naive zero-shot classification, with transformer-based CLIP achieving 92% accuracy.

## Key Results
- Best transformer-based CLIP model achieves 92% accuracy in ontology inference
- Ontology-based inference significantly outperforms naive zero-shot classification
- Ablation study shows prompt engineering, model architecture, and similarity metrics affect human-alignedness and fidelity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The DNN's internal vector space preserves semantic similarity, allowing hierarchical clustering to discover superclass relationships.
- Mechanism: When the model is trained on multimodal data with text-to-image alignment, similar concepts are encoded close together in the latent space. This geometric structure means that clustering similar embeddings naturally groups related concepts and reveals hierarchical parent classes.
- Core assumption: The model's embedding space forms concentric distributions around parent concepts, such that the mean of child embeddings approximates the parent embedding.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "DNNs encode semantic similarities via vector distances"
  - [section] "Vision DNNs generally encode learned concept similarities via distances in their latent representation vector space"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus lacks direct mention of vector space preservation, but related work on CLIP confirms this property
- Break condition: If the model is not trained for text-to-image alignment or the embedding space does not preserve semantic similarity, clustering will not reveal meaningful hierarchies.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Textual descriptions can be used as proxies for visual concepts through the model's text-to-image alignment.
- Mechanism: Since the model is trained to map both images and their textual descriptions to similar vectors, we can obtain embeddings for visual concepts by encoding their textual descriptions. This creates a bridge between symbolic concepts and the model's latent representations.
- Core assumption: The text-to-image alignment is sufficiently strong that textual and visual embeddings of the same concept are close in the latent space.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "foundation models accept textual descriptions as inputs, trained for text-to-image alignment"
  - [section] "Foundation models accept textual descriptions as inputs, trained for text-to-image alignment"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus mentions alignment but doesn't quantify its strength
- Break condition: If text-to-image alignment is poor, textual and visual embeddings will diverge, making textual descriptions poor proxies for visual concepts.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Hierarchical clustering followed by nearest-neighbor search in a concept bank can label discovered clusters with interpretable concepts.
- Mechanism: After clustering concept embeddings to find superclass representations, we search for the closest concept in a predefined concept bank using distance metrics. This maps abstract cluster centers to human-interpretable concepts.
- Core assumption: The concept bank contains concepts that are semantically close to the discovered superclasses, making nearest-neighbor search effective.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "label the such-obtained parent concepts using search in available ontologies from QR"
  - [section] "assign each cluster center a concept from the concept bank C"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus doesn't discuss concept bank effectiveness
- Break condition: If the concept bank lacks appropriate concepts or the distance metric poorly captures semantic similarity, cluster labeling will be inaccurate.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Vector embeddings and distance metrics
  - Why needed here: The entire approach relies on representing concepts as vectors and measuring their similarity using distances like cosine or Euclidean distance.
  - Quick check question: Given two concept embeddings, how would you determine if they represent similar concepts using vector operations?

- Concept: Hierarchical clustering algorithms
  - Why needed here: The method uses agglomerative hierarchical clustering to group similar concept embeddings and discover superclass relationships.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between single-linkage and complete-linkage clustering, and how might each affect the discovered hierarchies?

- Concept: Text-to-image alignment in multimodal models
  - Why needed here: This property allows using textual descriptions as proxies for visual concepts, enabling the extraction of ontologies from image-based models.
  - Quick check question: Why is text-to-image alignment important for using textual prompts to represent visual concepts in CLIP models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: CLIP model -> Text prompt generation -> Embedding extraction -> Hierarchical clustering -> Nearest-neighbor search in ConceptNet -> Ontology validation
- Critical path: Concept embedding extraction → hierarchical clustering → cluster labeling → ontology validation
- Design tradeoffs: Using textual vs. image embeddings for leaves (text is cheaper but may be less accurate), choice of distance metric and clustering linkage method, breadth vs. depth of concept bank
- Failure signatures: Poor text-to-image alignment shows up as low accuracy between textual and visual embeddings; inadequate concept bank shows up as nonsensical parent labels; bad clustering parameters show up as shallow or deep incorrect hierarchies
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Extract embeddings for CIFAR-10 classes using both textual and image inputs, compare their distances to validate text-to-image alignment
  2. Apply hierarchical clustering with different linkage methods and distance metrics, visualize resulting dendrograms to find optimal parameters
  3. Test ontology inference accuracy on CIFAR-10 test set, compare naive zero-shot baseline to ontology-based inference

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the ontological commitment extraction approach be extended to unimodal neural networks, and what differences in the extracted ontologies would be expected compared to multimodal models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions this as a future step: "Lastly, it can be investigated how to extend the here proposed approach from multimodal models to unimodal ones, allowing to compare the ontologies of large foundation models against that of state-of-practice small and efficient object detectors."
- Why unresolved: The current approach relies on text-to-image alignment which is not available in unimodal models, requiring new techniques for concept extraction and hierarchy formation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and application of a modified approach for unimodal networks, followed by comparison of extracted ontologies between unimodal and multimodal models on the same datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of different similarity metrics on the extracted ontology's fidelity and human-alignedness, and how can the optimal metric be automatically determined for a given model?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The ablation study investigates different affinity and linkage metrics but notes that "the embeddings' optimal similarity metric is unknown" and treats it as a hyperparameter.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests a limited set of standard metrics and does not explore automated determination of the optimal metric.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic testing of additional similarity metrics, development of an automated metric selection method, and validation of its effectiveness across different model architectures.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the proposed ontology extraction and verification approach be scaled to handle large, complex ontologies like Cyc or SUMO, and what computational challenges would arise?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions validation against "high quality available ontologies" and discusses using ConceptNet, but does not address scalability to very large ontologies.
- Why unresolved: The current approach uses a limited concept bank and simple parent-child relationships, which may not scale to the complexity of comprehensive ontologies.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation of the approach on a large ontology, measurement of computational requirements, and development of optimization techniques to handle the increased complexity.

## Limitations

- Evaluation restricted to CIFAR-10 with only 10 classes, making scalability to complex ontologies unclear
- Ablation study focuses primarily on CLIP architectures without exploring other foundation model families
- Does not address potential biases in ConceptNet that could influence extracted ontologies

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core mechanism of using hierarchical clustering on concept embeddings to discover superclass relationships (Mechanism 1) is well-supported by the evidence showing CLIP models preserve semantic similarity in their embedding space.
- **Medium Confidence**: The text-to-image alignment assumption (Mechanism 2) is plausible given CLIP's training objective, but the paper does not provide quantitative validation of alignment strength across different prompt formulations.
- **Low Confidence**: The effectiveness of nearest-neighbor search in ConceptNet for labeling clusters (Mechanism 3) lacks empirical support, as the paper does not evaluate how concept bank coverage affects labeling accuracy.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Dataset Validation**: Apply the method to a more complex dataset like ImageNet-1000 and evaluate whether the extracted hierarchies remain meaningful and interpretable at scale.

2. **Alignment Quantification**: Systematically measure the semantic alignment between textual and visual embeddings across different prompt formulations and CLIP variants to identify optimal configurations.

3. **Concept Bank Robustness**: Test the labeling mechanism using alternative knowledge bases (e.g., WordNet, DBpedia) and measure how coverage and structure affect ontology extraction quality.
