# Debiasing surgeon: fantastic weights and how to find them

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.14200
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14200
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces FFW (Finding Fantastic Weights), a method to debias pre-trained neural networks without additional training by pruning biased subnetworks.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents FFW, a novel debiasing method that identifies and prunes biased subnetworks within pre-trained models without requiring additional training. The approach leverages mutual information minimization and gating mechanisms to selectively remove bias information while preserving task-relevant features. FFW demonstrates state-of-the-art debiasing performance on benchmark datasets while offering potential computational efficiency through structured pruning variants.

## Method Summary
FFW is a two-step debiasing method that operates on frozen pre-trained models. First, it attaches a bias extraction head to the model's bottleneck layer to estimate bias information propagation. Second, it optimizes gating parameters that minimize both task loss and mutual information between extracted bias and target labels, then prunes weights based on these parameters. The method offers both unstructured (weight-level) and structured (neuron-level) pruning variants, with the latter providing computational efficiency benefits.

## Key Results
- FFW achieves comparable or better task accuracy than state-of-the-art debiasing methods while significantly reducing bias propagation
- The method is particularly effective at lower bias correlation levels (ρ), maintaining performance when other methods fail
- Structured pruning variant offers computational efficiency gains without sacrificing debiasing performance
- Theoretical analysis reveals that debiasing effectiveness depends on both model biasedness and task biasedness parameters

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: FFW can find an unbiased subnetwork within a pre-trained model by pruning weights that propagate bias information.
- Mechanism: The method attaches a bias extraction head to the bottleneck layer and prunes weights to minimize mutual information between the extracted bias and target labels while maintaining task performance.
- Core assumption: The vanilla-trained model already contains a subnetwork that solves the task without relying on biased features, even if the full model is biased.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we show that such a sub-network typically exists, and can be extracted from a vanilla-trained model without requiring additional training."
  - [section] "we show the existence of unbiased sub-networks in vanilla-trained models, providing also some analysis on the final performance."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; neighboring papers focus on debiasing but not on subnetwork extraction from frozen models.
- Break condition: If the model is underfitting or the task intrinsically requires the biased features (high task biasedness Kbia), removing the bias will harm performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Pruning based on gating parameters can selectively remove bias information while preserving task-relevant features.
- Mechanism: Each weight has an associated gating parameter that is optimized to minimize both task loss and mutual information between bias and target. As temperature τ → 0, weights are either kept or set to zero.
- Core assumption: The bias information is localized in specific weights or neurons that can be identified and removed without affecting task performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we maintain the model's parameters frozen and remove the sub-network responsible for bias information propagation."
  - [section] "we target to learn a mask on the encoder E such that the information on the bias is filtered and not usable by the task classifier C."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; neighboring papers discuss debiasing but not structured pruning from frozen models.
- Break condition: If bias information is distributed across many weights or entangled with task features, pruning may not isolate bias effectively.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The model's biasedness φ and task biasedness Kbia determine whether removing bias improves or harms performance.
- Mechanism: Theoretical analysis shows that mutual information between target and prediction depends on both φ and Kbia. When Kbia is low, removing bias (φ → 0) improves performance; when Kbia is high, it degrades performance.
- Core assumption: The relationship between model biasedness, task biasedness, and performance can be quantified and used to guide debiasing.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "we draft a theory that shows how the performance on some given task might depend on biased features, suggesting that removing the bias source not always results in an enhanced performance."
  - [section] "if Kbia is high, then the performance drops as φ approaches zero; on the contrary, if Kbia is low, the performance increases as φ → 0."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; neighboring papers do not discuss theoretical bounds on bias-task performance relationships.
- Break condition: If the theoretical assumptions (e.g., uniform error distribution, single bias per class) do not hold in practice.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Mutual information as a measure of dependency between variables.
  - Why needed here: FFW uses mutual information to quantify and minimize the amount of bias information that can be extracted from the model's features.
  - Quick check question: How does mutual information differ from correlation, and why is it more suitable for measuring bias in neural network features?

- Concept: Structured vs. unstructured pruning in neural networks.
  - Why needed here: FFW offers both structured (neuron-level) and unstructured (weight-level) variants, each with different computational and performance trade-offs.
  - Quick check question: What are the main advantages and disadvantages of structured pruning compared to unstructured pruning in terms of model efficiency and task performance?

- Concept: The lottery ticket hypothesis and its implications for subnetwork extraction.
  - Why needed here: The paper builds on the idea that sparse subnetworks exist within dense models, but extends it to the context of debiasing without retraining.
  - Quick check question: How does the lottery ticket hypothesis relate to the claim that unbiased subnetworks exist in vanilla-trained models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Encoder E (frozen) -> Bias Extraction Head P (trainable) -> Task Classifier C (frozen) -> Gating Parameters m_i (trainable)
- Critical path: Attach P → Train P to estimate bias → Optimize m_i to minimize task loss + bias mutual information → Prune weights based on m_i → Evaluate task and bias performance
- Design tradeoffs: Unstructured pruning offers finer control but less computational savings; structured pruning is more efficient but may be less precise in isolating bias
- Failure signatures: Task accuracy drops significantly; bias accuracy remains high (pruning failed to remove bias); sparsity is very low (gating failed to converge)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Apply FFW to Biased-MNIST with ρ = 0.99 and evaluate task vs. bias accuracy trade-off
  2. Compare structured vs. unstructured FFW on CelebA for gender-biased attribute classification
  3. Test FFW on Corrupted CIFAR10 to assess robustness to synthetic biases

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Under what specific conditions does the model biasedness (φ) approach zero, and how does this impact the overall task performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the relationship between model biasedness (φ), task biasedness (Kbia), and their impact on performance in Section 3.1.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides a theoretical framework but does not offer empirical evidence on the exact conditions under which φ approaches zero and the resulting impact on performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing the relationship between φ, Kbia, and task performance across various datasets and bias levels.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the effectiveness of FFW vary across different neural network architectures and tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates FFW's effectiveness on specific architectures (CNNs and ResNet-18) and tasks (image classification), but does not explore its generalizability to other architectures and tasks.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on a limited set of architectures and tasks, leaving the generalizability of FFW unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying FFW to a diverse range of neural network architectures and tasks, including NLP and reinforcement learning.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the computational overhead of FFW compared to other debiasing methods, and how does it scale with model size?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions the potential computational gains of the structured pruning variant of FFW but does not provide a detailed comparison with other debiasing methods or analyze its scalability.
- Why unresolved: The paper lacks a comprehensive analysis of FFW's computational efficiency and scalability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking studies comparing FFW's computational overhead and scalability to other debiasing methods across various model sizes and datasets.

## Limitations

- The theoretical claims about task-biasedness Kbia are promising but not empirically validated across diverse tasks
- Limited evidence for when the assumption of existing unbiased subnetworks in vanilla-trained models breaks down
- Computational efficiency claims for structured pruning lack comprehensive runtime comparisons across hardware platforms

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The empirical results on standard benchmarks (Biased-MNIST, CelebA) demonstrating FFW's ability to reduce bias while maintaining task accuracy
- **Medium confidence**: The theoretical analysis linking model biasedness φ and task biasedness Kbia to performance
- **Low confidence**: Claims about computational efficiency gains from structured pruning without comprehensive benchmarking

## Next Checks

1. **Theoretical validation**: Test the Kbia-φ relationship across diverse tasks (e.g., medical diagnosis vs. object detection) to verify the theoretical bounds hold beyond simple classification problems
2. **Robustness analysis**: Systematically evaluate FFW's performance when bias features are highly entangled with task features or when the model is underfitting, to identify failure conditions
3. **Efficiency benchmarking**: Compare structured vs. unstructured FFW variants on different hardware (CPU vs. GPU) and measure actual inference speedups to validate computational claims
