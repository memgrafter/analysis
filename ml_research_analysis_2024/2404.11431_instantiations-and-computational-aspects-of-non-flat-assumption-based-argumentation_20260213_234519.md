# Instantiations and Computational Aspects of Non-Flat Assumption-based Argumentation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.11431
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11431
- Reference count: 0
- This work presents the first instantiation-based algorithms for non-flat assumption-based argumentation (ABA)

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the first instantiation-based algorithms for non-flat assumption-based argumentation (ABA), addressing the challenge of exponential argument growth through redundancy elimination. The authors develop two complementary approaches: ABABAF (instantiation-based) and ABASP (direct), both leveraging Answer Set Programming and SAT solving. Empirical evaluation shows that instantiation-based methods can outperform direct approaches in this domain, contrasting with typical structured argumentation settings.

## Method Summary
The paper presents two algorithmic approaches for credulous reasoning in non-flat ABA. The ABABAF approach uses ASP to generate arguments, constructs a bipolar argumentation framework (BAF), and applies SAT-based reasoning. The ABASP approach uses iterative ASP solving without instantiation. Both methods incorporate redundancy elimination mechanisms (derivation, expendable, and assumption redundancy) to reduce the argument set size while preserving semantics.

## Key Results
- ABABAF outperforms ABASP on additive and atomic ABA instances
- Both approaches are competitive overall, with performance dependent on benchmark parameters
- Redundancy elimination can dramatically reduce argument set size while preserving semantics
- Instantiation-based methods can be advantageous for structured argumentation problems with lower complexity BAF reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Non-flat ABA instantiation to BAF preserves semantics while enabling more efficient reasoning
- Mechanism: The translation from non-flat ABA to BAF maintains the semantics of argument acceptability, allowing reasoning to be performed in the BAF framework where computational complexity is lower
- Core assumption: The semantics-preserving translation between ABA and BAF is correct and complete
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We make use of a semantics-preserving translation between ABA and bipolar argumentation frameworks (BAFs)"
  - [section 2]: Theorem 2.9 states that if E is in σ(FD) then asms(E) is in σ(D) and vice versa
  - [corpus]: Weak - the corpus contains related work on ABA but no direct evidence about this specific translation mechanism
- Break condition: If the translation fails to preserve semantics for certain argument sets, the entire approach becomes invalid

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Redundancy elimination reduces exponential argument growth to manageable levels
- Mechanism: Three redundancy notions (derivation, expendable, and assumption redundancy) identify and remove arguments that don't affect semantics, dramatically reducing the argument set size
- Core assumption: Redundant arguments can be safely removed without altering the set of accepted assumptions
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we present three ways of identifying redundant arguments"
  - [section 3]: Propositions 3.4, 3.7, and 3.10 prove that removing redundant arguments preserves semantics
  - [corpus]: Weak - no corpus evidence about redundancy elimination in ABA specifically
- Break condition: If redundancy detection misses some redundant arguments or incorrectly removes non-redundant ones, the semantics may be altered

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Different algorithmic approaches excel under different parameter regimes
- Mechanism: ABABAF (instantiation-based) performs better on additive and atomic fragments where argument construction is efficient, while ABASP (direct) excels on general non-flat ABA with complex dependencies
- Core assumption: The relative performance of instantiation-based vs direct approaches depends on the structural properties of the ABA framework
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "empirical evaluation shows that the former outperforms the latter on many instances, with relative performance depending on benchmark parameters"
  - [section 6]: Tables show ABABAF outperforms ABASP on additive instances (ms=1) while ABASP performs better when mr=5
  - [corpus]: Weak - no corpus evidence about performance tradeoffs in ABA specifically
- Break condition: If parameter relationships change or new ABA fragments are discovered, the performance predictions may become invalid

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Answer Set Programming (ASP)
  - Why needed here: ASP is used for generating arguments and candidate solutions in both algorithmic approaches
  - Quick check question: How does ASP differ from traditional logic programming in handling negation?

- Concept: SAT solving for BAF reasoning
  - Why needed here: SAT encodings are used to perform reasoning on instantiated BAFs after argument generation
  - Quick check question: What makes SAT solving suitable for BAF reasoning compared to other approaches?

- Concept: Compilability theory
  - Why needed here: Used to prove that non-flat ABA instantiation cannot avoid exponential argument growth in general
  - Quick check question: How does compilability theory differ from standard complexity theory in analyzing problem reductions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input: ABA framework (L, R, A, )
  - ABABAF pipeline: ABA → ASP argument generation → BAF construction → SAT reasoning
  - ABASP pipeline: ABA → ASP candidate generation → ASP verification → result
  - Output: Credulous acceptance decision

- Critical path:
  - ABABAF: Argument generation (most time-consuming) → BAF construction → SAT solving
  - ABASP: Candidate generation → Verification (potentially multiple iterations)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Memory vs. time: ABABAF requires more memory for argument storage but can be faster on certain instances
  - Completeness vs. efficiency: Redundancy elimination trades some completeness for efficiency
  - Generality vs. specialization: ABABAF excels on additive/atomic fragments while ABASP handles general cases better

- Failure signatures:
  - ABABAF: Timeout likely due to argument explosion when redundancy elimination fails
  - ABASP: Timeout likely due to deep search in complex dependency structures
  - Both: Memory exhaustion when dealing with very large frameworks

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test both algorithms on a simple atomic ABA instance to verify basic functionality
  2. Compare performance on an additive ABA instance with varying rule sizes
  3. Stress test with a non-flat ABA instance containing complex assumption dependencies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the exact computational complexity of credulous reasoning under preferred semantics in non-flat ABA, and how does it compare to the complexity of the instantiated BAF?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions results for preferred semantics in the technical appendix and states that skeptical reasoning under preferred semantics lies on the third level of the polynomial hierarchy, but does not provide explicit complexity results.
- Why unresolved: The main paper focuses on complete-based semantics and only briefly mentions preferred semantics in the appendix. The complexity of preferred semantics in non-flat ABA remains unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal proof showing the complexity class of credulous reasoning under preferred semantics in non-flat ABA, along with a comparison to the complexity of the corresponding BAF reasoning problem.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do the proposed redundancy notions (derivation, expendable, and assumption redundancy) interact with each other when applied in combination, and what is the optimal order for applying them?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper presents three redundancy notions and mentions that they can be applied iteratively, but does not investigate their interactions or optimal application order.
- Why unresolved: The paper only establishes that each redundancy notion can be applied independently and that their application is order-independent, but does not explore how they might interact or what order might be most efficient.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing different orders of applying the redundancy notions, or theoretical analysis showing how they interact and what order minimizes the number of arguments.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the BAF instantiation approach be extended to handle more expressive structured argumentation frameworks beyond non-flat ABA, such as ASPIC+ or DeLP?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on non-flat ABA and mentions other structured argumentation frameworks like ASPIC+ and DeLP in the introduction, but does not explore extensions to these frameworks.
- Why unresolved: The paper develops the instantiation approach specifically for non-flat ABA and does not investigate its applicability to other structured argumentation frameworks.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal translation from another structured argumentation framework (e.g., ASPIC+ or DeLP) to BAFs, along with complexity analysis and empirical evaluation showing the approach's effectiveness on these frameworks.

## Limitations
- Computational complexity remains exponential for non-flat ABA instantiation despite redundancy elimination
- Performance evaluation based on synthetic benchmarks with specific parameter ranges
- Implementation details of ASP and SAT encodings not fully specified

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The semantics-preserving translation between ABA and BAF (Theorem 2.9) is well-established with clear proof.
- **Medium Confidence**: The redundancy elimination mechanisms are theoretically sound but may not achieve optimal reductions in all cases.
- **Medium Confidence**: The empirical performance comparison is valid for the tested parameter ranges but may not generalize beyond them.

## Next Checks

1. **Verify Translation Correctness**: Test Theorem 2.9 on small ABA instances with known semantics to confirm the translation preserves acceptability.
2. **Benchmark Diversity**: Evaluate both algorithms on ABA instances from real-world applications to assess practical performance beyond synthetic benchmarks.
3. **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary the assumption ratio (ms) and rule size (mr) parameters to identify precise performance boundaries between ABABAF and ABASP approaches.
