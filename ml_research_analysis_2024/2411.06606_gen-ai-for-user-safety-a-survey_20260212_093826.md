# Gen-AI for User Safety: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.06606
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06606
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Comprehensive survey of how Generative AI techniques are applied to enhance user safety across digital and physical domains

## Executive Summary
This survey provides the first comprehensive overview of how Generative AI (Gen-AI) techniques are being applied to enhance user safety across multiple domains including phishing detection, malware analysis, misinformation identification, content moderation, and mental health support. The paper systematically explores how Gen-AI approaches work across different data modalities - text, images, videos, audio, and code - to detect safety violations that traditional machine learning approaches struggle with. It also examines how Gen-AI can be used adversarially for large-scale attacks, personalized content generation, and second-order effects that accumulate over time. The survey identifies future research directions including content understanding, foundation model ensembles, multi-modal approaches, and preventing second-order harms.

## Method Summary
This survey paper synthesizes existing research on Gen-AI applications in user safety domains through comprehensive literature review and analysis. The authors systematically categorize applications by safety domain (e.g., phishing, malware, content moderation, mental health) and organize findings by data modalities (text, images, videos, audio, code). The survey methodology involves identifying relevant papers, analyzing their contributions, and synthesizing insights about both defensive applications and potential adversarial uses of Gen-AI in user safety contexts.

## Key Results
- Gen-AI techniques overcome contextual understanding limitations of traditional ML classifiers in user safety applications through extensive pre-training on diverse datasets
- Multimodal Gen-AI models enable comprehensive safety analysis across text, images, audio, and video data for detecting complex safety violations
- Gen-AI enables both defensive and adversarial applications at unprecedented scale and personalization, with bad actors leveraging these capabilities for sophisticated attacks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Gen-AI techniques overcome the contextual understanding limitations of traditional ML/DM classifiers in user safety applications
- Mechanism: Large language models and multimodal models leverage extensive pre-training on diverse datasets to capture nuanced context and language patterns that traditional classifiers miss
- Core assumption: The pre-training data contains sufficient coverage of safety-relevant contexts and language patterns to enable generalization
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "existing ML/DM classifiers are limited in their ability to understand natural languages w.r.t the context and nuances. The aforementioned challenges are overcome with the arrival of Gen-AI techniques"; [section III.A] "Large language models, such as GPT-4, Gemini and LLaMA have demonstrated outstanding performance across downstream NLP (Natural Language Processing) tasks"
- Break condition: When safety violations involve contexts or language patterns not well-represented in the pre-training data, or when adversaries deliberately craft content to evade the learned patterns

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Gen-AI's multimodal capabilities enable comprehensive safety analysis across text, images, audio, and video data
- Mechanism: Multimodal models like GPT-4v integrate visual and textual understanding to detect safety violations that require cross-modal reasoning, such as deepfakes or policy violations involving both image and text components
- Core assumption: The model's training process effectively learned the relationships between different modalities for safety-relevant tasks
- Evidence anchors: [section III.B.3] "VLM's nuanced understanding of a scene has applications in defect recognition and safety equipment recognition"; [section III.C.1] "Gen-AI breakthroughs now allow people to generate videos simply by using text prompts"
- Break condition: When safety violations involve complex interactions between modalities that weren't adequately represented in training, or when the model's cross-modal reasoning fails on novel combinations

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Gen-AI enables both defensive and adversarial applications at unprecedented scale and personalization
- Mechanism: The ability to generate content at scale and personalize attacks allows bad actors to create sophisticated phishing campaigns, deepfakes, and coordinated misinformation efforts that were previously resource-intensive
- Core assumption: The same capabilities that enable defensive applications can be repurposed for adversarial use with minimal modification
- Evidence anchors: [section IV.A] "Gen-AI technology, they can reduce human involvement in large-scale operations thereby decreasing the time and cost of their attacks"; [section IV.C] "Gen-AI techniques can also be used for pre-texting based scams"
- Break condition: When detection systems evolve faster than adversarial techniques, or when the cost-benefit ratio of personalized attacks becomes unfavorable for attackers

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Transformer architecture and attention mechanisms
  - Why needed here: Understanding how Gen-AI models process and contextualize information across different modalities is fundamental to grasping their safety applications
  - Quick check question: How does self-attention enable models to capture long-range dependencies in safety-relevant contexts like phishing emails or deepfake detection?

- Concept: Multimodal representation learning
  - Why needed here: Many safety violations span multiple data types (text + image, audio + video), requiring understanding of how models fuse different modalities
  - Quick check question: What are the key challenges in aligning representations from text and visual modalities for detecting harmful content?

- Concept: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)
  - Why needed here: Understanding how safety models are aligned with human values and how this process can be both beneficial and vulnerable to adversarial manipulation
  - Quick check question: How does RLHF help in fine-tuning safety models, and what are its limitations in preventing jailbreaking attempts?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data ingestion pipeline (text, images, audio, video, code) -> Multimodal feature extraction and fusion layer -> Task-specific detection/classification heads -> Adversarial detection subsystem -> Feedback and learning loop for continuous improvement -> Safety guardrails and jailbreak prevention mechanisms

- Critical path: Data ingestion → Multimodal processing → Safety violation detection → Alert generation → Human review (for high-stakes decisions)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model size vs. latency: Larger models provide better accuracy but slower response times
  - Generalization vs. specialization: General models handle multiple safety domains but may miss domain-specific nuances
  - Privacy vs. effectiveness: More data improves detection but raises privacy concerns
  - False positives vs. false negatives: Conservative models miss fewer violations but generate more false alarms

- Failure signatures:
  - High false negative rate: Indicates model not generalizing well to new attack patterns
  - High false positive rate: Suggests over-sensitivity or insufficient context understanding
  - Slow response times: May indicate computational bottlenecks or inefficient architecture
  - Degradation over time: Could signal concept drift or emerging adversarial techniques

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Benchmark existing safety classifiers against GPT-4/GPT-4v on phishing detection and deepfake detection tasks using standard datasets
  2. Evaluate multimodal model performance on synthetic safety violation examples combining text and images
  3. Test jailbreak resistance by attempting to bypass safety guardrails using various prompt engineering techniques

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can Gen-AI systems be designed to effectively prevent "second-order harms" that arise from the long-term accumulation and interaction of seemingly harmless individual AI uses?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section V-D discusses second-order harms and mentions that future research will likely focus on preventing these effects, but provides no specific technical solutions or frameworks for achieving this prevention
- Why unresolved: Second-order harms are complex emergent phenomena that result from the interaction of multiple AI systems over time, making them difficult to predict and mitigate with current detection methods that focus on individual violations
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of comprehensive monitoring frameworks that can detect and prevent the formation of synthetic realities and misuse chains through holistic analysis of user behavior patterns across multiple platforms and time periods

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the most effective techniques for making Gen-AI-based user safety detection systems robust against adversarial attacks that use reinforcement learning and feedback from previous failures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section IV-B discusses how adversaries can use sophisticated Gen-AI techniques with reinforcement learning and feedback from past attempts to create more effective attacks, but doesn't address defensive countermeasures
- Why unresolved: Current Gen-AI safety systems are primarily designed for static threat detection, while adversaries are increasingly using dynamic learning approaches that adapt based on system responses and past failures
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of Gen-AI safety systems that can dynamically adapt their detection models in real-time based on observed attack patterns and that maintain effectiveness even when adversaries have access to feedback from previous attempts

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can multi-modal Gen-AI approaches be optimized to improve user safety detection across different data types (text, images, audio, video) while maintaining computational efficiency and real-time performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section III and Section V-C discuss the potential of multi-modal approaches for user safety but don't provide specific solutions for optimizing these systems or addressing the computational challenges they present
- Why unresolved: Multi-modal systems require processing and integrating information from multiple data streams simultaneously, which creates significant computational overhead and latency issues that current single-modality approaches don't face
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of efficient multi-modal architectures that can process and integrate multiple data types in real-time while maintaining or improving detection accuracy compared to specialized single-modality systems

## Limitations
- The survey relies heavily on theoretical mechanisms and existing literature rather than empirical validation of claimed capabilities
- The analysis does not provide experimental results or quantitative comparisons between Gen-AI and traditional safety detection methods
- Related papers identified focus primarily on finance and public sector applications rather than direct safety domain evidence

## Confidence
- High confidence: The general observation that Gen-AI can be used for both defensive and adversarial applications is well-supported by the literature
- Medium confidence: Claims about multimodal capabilities and contextual understanding are theoretically sound but lack direct empirical validation in safety contexts
- Low confidence: Specific performance claims and quantitative improvements over traditional methods are not substantiated with experimental evidence

## Next Checks
1. Conduct controlled experiments comparing Gen-AI-based safety detection systems against traditional ML/DM approaches on standardized safety datasets (e.g., phishing detection, deepfake detection)
2. Systematically evaluate jailbreak resistance and adversarial attack detection capabilities using established benchmark suites for safety model evaluation
3. Test multimodal models on safety-relevant tasks that require understanding relationships between text, images, and audio to verify claimed capabilities for detecting complex safety violations
