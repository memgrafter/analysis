# Automating IRAC Analysis in Malaysian Contract Law using a Semi-Structured Knowledge Base

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13217

- 54 Malaysian contract law scenarios annotated by legal experts using IRAC framework

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LEGAL SEMI, a dataset for automating IRAC (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) analysis in Malaysian contract law. The dataset comprises 54 annotated scenarios developed by legal experts, paired with a structured knowledge graph (SKG) to support legal reasoning. Experiments with four LLMs demonstrate that incorporating legal concepts from the SKG significantly improves issue identification and rule retrieval performance. While the approach shows promise in bridging the gap between legal scenarios and statutes, the study identifies ongoing challenges with lower-level concept identification.

## Method Summary
The study employs a semi-structured knowledge base approach where legal concepts and lay language interpretations are used to connect case scenarios with statutory law. A structured knowledge graph (SKG) is constructed to represent relationships between legal concepts, rules, and case elements. Four different LLMs are evaluated using this framework, with the SKG providing contextual legal knowledge to enhance reasoning capabilities. The dataset includes expert-annotated Malaysian contract law scenarios following the IRAC framework.

## Key Results
- Issue identification accuracy improved by 21.4% when using legal concepts from the SKG
- Rule retrieval recall increased by 60% and F1 score improved by 12% with SKG integration
- Legal concepts and lay language interpretations effectively bridge gaps between scenarios and legal statutes
- LLMs still struggle with lower-level concept identification despite overall performance improvements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by creating a structured knowledge graph that encodes legal concepts and their relationships, allowing LLMs to access relevant legal knowledge during reasoning tasks. The semi-structured format combines formal legal concepts with lay language interpretations, making the knowledge more accessible to language models while maintaining legal precision.

## Foundational Learning
1. **IRAC Framework**: Legal analysis method breaking cases into Issue, Rule, Application, and Conclusion - needed to structure legal reasoning tasks; quick check: verify all four components are present in annotated data
2. **Structured Knowledge Graphs**: Formal representation of legal concepts and relationships - needed to provide context for LLMs; quick check: validate graph connectivity and completeness
3. **Lay Language Interpretation**: Simplified explanations of legal concepts - needed to bridge expert knowledge and model understanding; quick check: ensure interpretations maintain legal accuracy

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Scenarios -> Legal Concepts -> SKG -> LLM -> IRAC Output

**Critical Path**: Legal scenario input → Concept mapping → SKG retrieval → LLM processing → IRAC component extraction

**Design Tradeoffs**: The semi-structured approach balances formal legal precision with accessibility, but requires careful curation of legal concepts to avoid ambiguity.

**Failure Signatures**: LLMs struggle with lower-level concept identification, suggesting incomplete semantic understanding or insufficient training on granular legal distinctions.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test SKG performance with increasing complexity of legal scenarios
2. Compare different legal concept selection strategies for SKG construction
3. Evaluate cross-jurisdiction transferability of the SKG approach

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dataset size of 54 scenarios may limit generalizability to broader legal domains
- Performance improvements specific to Malaysian contract law may not transfer to other jurisdictions
- Ongoing challenges with lower-level concept identification indicate incomplete reasoning capabilities
- Results dependent on specific LLM architectures used in experiments

## Confidence
- High confidence in dataset creation methodology and annotation process
- Medium confidence in reported performance improvements, pending replication with larger datasets
- Medium confidence in generalizability of approach beyond Malaysian contract law

## Next Checks
1. Test approach on larger and more diverse dataset covering multiple legal domains
2. Conduct comprehensive error analysis of LLM failures in lower-level concept identification
3. Perform ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of SKG components to performance improvements
