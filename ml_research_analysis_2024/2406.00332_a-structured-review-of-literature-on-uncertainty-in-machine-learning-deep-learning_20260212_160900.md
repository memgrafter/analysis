# A Structured Review of Literature on Uncertainty in Machine Learning & Deep Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.00332
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00332
- Authors: Fahimeh Fakour; Ali Mosleh; Ramin Ramezani
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Survey of uncertainty quantification techniques for deep learning, categorizing uncertainty sources and methods while identifying open challenges

## Executive Summary
This survey paper comprehensively reviews uncertainty quantification (UQ) in machine learning, particularly for risk-sensitive applications where understanding model uncertainty is critical. The authors systematically categorize uncertainty sources (data and model), distinguish between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty types, and survey various quantification techniques including Bayesian Neural Networks, ensembles, and conformal prediction. The paper emphasizes that standard metrics like softmax outputs are insufficient for capturing predictive uncertainty, especially in high-risk settings, and discusses calibration methods and decision-making under uncertainty. Key contributions include a holistic framework for understanding uncertainty in ML and an updated review of UQ techniques for deep learning, while highlighting open challenges such as the lack of ground truth uncertainty datasets and scalable methods for small datasets.

## Method Summary
The paper conducts a structured literature review of uncertainty quantification in machine learning and deep learning, synthesizing existing research across multiple domains. The methodology involves categorizing uncertainty into aleatoric (irreducible) and epistemic (reducible) types, identifying sources of uncertainty in data and model components, and surveying UQ techniques including Bayesian Neural Networks, ensembles, credal sets, and conformal prediction. The review evaluates metrics for uncertainty quantification such as entropy, prediction intervals, standard deviation, Brier score, expected calibration error (ECE), and negative log likelihood. The approach synthesizes findings from various applications including medical data, computer vision, and NLP to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding and measuring uncertainty in predictive models.

## Key Results
- Softmax probabilities alone are insufficient for capturing predictive uncertainty, especially for out-of-distribution samples and combined labels
- Data uncertainty sources (missing values, noise, bias, OOD samples) propagate into predictive uncertainty and affect model reliability
- Bayesian Neural Networks, ensembles, and conformal prediction techniques provide more informative uncertainty estimates than point predictions
- Calibration methods are essential for aligning predicted uncertainty with true uncertainty in risk-sensitive applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Softmax outputs are insufficient for capturing predictive uncertainty because they normalize scores to sum to 1, preventing expression of "unknown unknowns." This forces the model to always assign probabilities across known classes even when encountering out-of-distribution samples or unseen feature combinations. For example, when presented with a cactus image (never seen during training), softmax must force it into one of the known categories rather than signaling uncertainty. Similarly, combined labels like "cat + dog" force softmax to output [0.5, 0.5], misleadingly suggesting uncertainty about which class rather than confidence about seeing both classes.

### Mechanism 2
Data uncertainty sources propagate into predictive uncertainty through reduced model ability to learn true data distributions. Incomplete, noisy, or biased training data increases epistemic uncertainty as the model cannot confidently learn the underlying patterns. Domain shifts and out-of-distribution samples create distributional uncertainty that the model cannot capture if training data is limited or unrepresentative. The quality and representativeness of training data directly influence the model's uncertainty estimates - poor data leads to overconfident or miscalibrated predictions, while diverse, high-quality data enables better uncertainty quantification.

### Mechanism 3
Uncertainty quantification techniques providing distributions or sets are more informative than point estimates because they explicitly model both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty components. Bayesian Neural Networks output predictive distributions over parameters, ensembles provide variance across model predictions, and conformal prediction generates sample-wise prediction intervals. These approaches convey the degree of uncertainty rather than just point predictions, which is crucial for risk-sensitive applications where knowing "how uncertain" the model is matters as much as the prediction itself. This distributional representation allows for better decision-making under uncertainty compared to deterministic softmax outputs.

## Foundational Learning

- **Aleatoric vs. epistemic uncertainty**: Understanding these categories is essential for interpreting uncertainty estimates and choosing appropriate UQ techniques. Quick check: Can you give an example where reducing epistemic uncertainty (more data) would help, but reducing aleatoric uncertainty (inherent randomness) would not?

- **Bayesian inference and posterior distributions**: Many UQ methods rely on Bayesian principles to model uncertainty over model parameters or predictions. Quick check: How does the choice of prior influence the posterior uncertainty in a Bayesian Neural Network?

- **Conformal prediction and prediction intervals**: Conformal methods provide sample-wise uncertainty intervals, addressing the limitation of global metrics like standard error. Quick check: What is the role of the calibration set in conformal prediction, and how does it affect the width of prediction intervals?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data preprocessing (handling uncertainty sources) → Model training (with uncertainty-aware techniques) → Calibration (aligning predicted uncertainty with true uncertainty) → Decision-making (using uncertainty estimates)
- **Critical path**: Data quality → UQ technique selection → Model training with uncertainty → Calibration → Uncertainty-aware decisions
- **Design tradeoffs**: Bayesian methods provide rich uncertainty estimates but are computationally expensive; ensembles are simpler but memory-heavy; deterministic methods are efficient but may be less robust; conformal prediction is distribution-free but requires a calibration set
- **Failure signatures**: Overconfident predictions on OOD data, miscalibration (predicted probabilities don't match true frequencies), high epistemic uncertainty in well-sampled regions, or failure to detect ambiguous inputs
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Compare softmax entropy vs. ensemble variance on a simple image classification task with added OOD samples to see which better detects uncertainty
  2. Train a BNN and a deterministic NN on the same dataset, then evaluate their uncertainty estimates on in-domain vs. OOD data
  3. Apply conformal prediction to a regression task and measure how prediction interval widths correlate with actual errors

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can we develop a standardized benchmark dataset with ground truth uncertainty labels to evaluate uncertainty quantification methods? The paper identifies the lack of uncertainty ground truths as a key challenge, stating it remains difficult to validate existing methods due to the lack of uncertain ground truths. Creating such a dataset requires careful design to ensure ground truth uncertainty labels are accurate and representative of real-world scenarios, covering various types of uncertainty and application domains.

### Open Question 2
Can we develop more computationally efficient uncertainty quantification methods that maintain performance for small datasets? Most uncertainty quantification methods are suitable for large datasets, but the paper highlights the need for techniques better suited for small datasets, especially in domains like medicine where large labeled datasets are expensive to obtain. Current UQ methods often rely on large datasets for effective training and uncertainty estimation, making adaptation for small datasets while maintaining computational efficiency challenging.

### Open Question 3
How can we develop explainable uncertainty estimation models that provide insights into the neural network's decision process? Uncertainty estimations are an important step towards explainable AI, and explainable uncertainty estimations would give an even deeper understanding of the neural network's decision process. Current UQ methods often provide uncertainty estimates without explaining the underlying reasons for the uncertainty, and developing methods that can attribute uncertainty to specific features or decision paths remains an active area of research.

## Limitations

- Review lacks empirical validation; claims about technique effectiveness are based on literature synthesis rather than new experiments
- No quantitative comparison between UQ methods on common benchmarks
- Ground truth uncertainty datasets are acknowledged as lacking, limiting objective evaluation of proposed frameworks
- Trade-offs between computational cost and uncertainty quality are discussed qualitatively but not measured

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The categorization of uncertainty into aleatoric vs. epistemic types is well-established in the literature and correctly presented
- **Medium Confidence**: The survey comprehensively covers UQ techniques, but effectiveness claims require empirical validation
- **Medium Confidence**: The assertion that softmax is insufficient for uncertainty is theoretically sound but would benefit from quantitative comparison with alternatives

## Next Checks

1. Conduct controlled experiments comparing softmax entropy, ensemble variance, and MC Dropout uncertainty estimates on MNIST with injected OOD samples (e.g., NotMNIST, noise)
2. Evaluate calibration performance (ECE, Brier score) of different UQ techniques on standard classification datasets with and without domain shift
3. Measure computational overhead vs. uncertainty quality trade-offs for Bayesian Neural Networks vs. deep ensembles on a fixed hardware budget
