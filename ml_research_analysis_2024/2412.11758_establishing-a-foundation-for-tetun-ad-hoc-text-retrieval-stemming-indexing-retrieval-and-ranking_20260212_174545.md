# Establishing a Foundation for Tetun Ad-Hoc Text Retrieval: Stemming, Indexing, Retrieval, and Ranking

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.11758
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11758
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Developed essential IR resources for Tetun including a 160-word stopword list, language-specific stemmer, and test collection with 59 topics and 33,550 documents

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of developing information retrieval resources for Tetun, a low-resource language spoken in Timor-Leste. The authors create essential IR components including a stopword list (160 words), a language-specific stemmer with three variants, and a test collection with 59 topics and 33,550 documents. Through systematic experimentation with various preprocessing techniques and retrieval models, they establish baselines for Tetun ad-hoc text retrieval and demonstrate that language-specific preprocessing strategies tailored to linguistic characteristics significantly improve performance. The publicly available resources provide a foundation for future research in Tetun information retrieval and offer insights applicable to other low-resource languages.

## Method Summary
The research employs a systematic approach to establish Tetun IR baselines by first creating essential resources: a stopword list through frequency analysis, a stemmer evaluated by native speakers, and a test collection from search logs. The Labadain-30k+ dataset (33,550 Tetun documents) serves as the corpus. Retrieval experiments compare multiple models (BM25, DFR BM25, TF-IDF, Dirichlet LM, Hiemstra LM) with various preprocessing configurations including lowercase conversion, punctuation removal, tokenization, hyphen removal, apostrophe removal, and accent removal. Evaluation uses standard IR metrics (MAP, NDCG, P@5, P@10, P@20) across different retrieval scenarios.

## Key Results
- Hyphen removal to split compound words and apostrophe elimination significantly improve retrieval effectiveness by up to 8.19%
- DFR BM25 performs best for short-text retrieval (document titles) up to top-10 results
- Hiemstra LM shows stronger performance at higher cutoffs beyond top-10
- Stemming does not improve retrieval effectiveness for Tetun, likely due to its relatively simple morphology

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Removing hyphens to split compound words improves retrieval effectiveness in Tetun ad-hoc text retrieval.
- Mechanism: Tetun uses hyphens to join monosemantic compound words (e.g., "harii-kaben" = morning time). Splitting these compounds into individual tokens increases the chance of matching query terms with document content.
- Core assumption: Hyphenated compounds in Tetun function as separate lexical units when split.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The results show that retrieving document titles, after removing hyphens and apostrophes but without applying stemming, improves performance compared to the baseline."
  - [section 9.6]: "In Tetun ad-hoc text retrieval, text preprocessing techniques that involve the removal of apostrophes and hyphens generally lead to performance gains of up to 8.19% with DFR BM25 in short-text retrieval up to the top-10 cutoffs."
- Break condition: If hyphen removal introduces false splits or degrades term cohesion in compound expressions.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Stemming does not improve retrieval effectiveness for Tetun due to its relatively simple morphology.
- Mechanism: Tetun has minimal inflectional morphology, with few prefixes and suffixes. Applying stemming algorithms may overstem or understem words, reducing precision and recall.
- Core assumption: Tetun's morphological simplicity limits the benefits of stemming.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Notably, stemming does not improve retrieval effectiveness for Tetun, likely due to its relatively simple morphology."
  - [section 7.4]: "Given that three variants of the Labadain-Stemmershow similar performance, it might be affected by the characteristics of the sample of words used for evaluation."
- Break condition: If future datasets reveal more complex morphological patterns in Tetun.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: DFR BM25 is more effective than Hiemstra LM for short-text retrieval up to top-10 results, while Hiemstra LM excels beyond top-10 cutoffs.
- Mechanism: DFR BM25's probabilistic ranking is well-suited for short queries and documents, optimizing precision at higher ranks. Hiemstra LM's language modeling approach better captures semantic relationships, improving recall at lower ranks.
- Core assumption: Different ranking models have complementary strengths depending on the cutoff depth.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "DFR BM25 performs best for short-text retrieval (document titles) up to top-10 results, while Hiemstra LM shows stronger performance at higher cutoffs."
  - [section 9.6]: "DFR BM25 performs best for short-text retrieval up to top-10 results, while Hiemstra LM shows stronger performance at higher cutoffs."
- Break condition: If the dataset characteristics or query patterns change significantly.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Text preprocessing techniques (lowercase conversion, punctuation removal, tokenization).
  - Why needed here: These steps standardize text and prepare it for indexing and retrieval.
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of converting text to lowercase in information retrieval?

- Concept: Stopword removal and its impact on retrieval effectiveness.
  - Why needed here: Removing stopwords can reduce index size and improve retrieval efficiency, but may also remove important context.
  - Quick check question: Why might retaining stopwords be beneficial in some retrieval models?

- Concept: Stemming and its role in morphological normalization.
  - Why needed here: Stemming reduces words to their root form, but its effectiveness depends on the language's morphological complexity.
  - Quick check question: In which scenarios might stemming not improve retrieval effectiveness?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Text preprocessing pipeline → Indexing → Retrieval → Ranking → Evaluation
  - Key components: Tetun tokenizer, stopword list, stemmer variants, retrieval models (DFR BM25, Hiemstra LM)
- Critical path:
  - Document preprocessing → Indexing → Query processing → Retrieval → Ranking → Relevance judgment
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Stemming vs. no stemming: Tetun's simple morphology favors no stemming.
  - Short-text vs. long-text retrieval: Short-text retrieval with DFR BM25 up to top-10; Hiemstra LM beyond top-10.
  - Stopword removal: Mixed impact; retention may improve effectiveness in some models.
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor retrieval effectiveness: Incorrect preprocessing steps, suboptimal retrieval model.
  - High index size: Inefficient preprocessing, lack of compression techniques.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare retrieval effectiveness with and without hyphen removal.
  2. Test DFR BM25 vs. Hiemstra LM on short-text retrieval up to top-10 results.
  3. Evaluate the impact of stopword removal on retrieval effectiveness.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would Tetun information retrieval performance change with a more balanced dataset containing equal proportions of Portuguese loanwords and native Tetun words?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that the stemmer evaluation sample was unbalanced, with 81.79% Portuguese loanwords versus 18.21% native Tetun words, and suggests this may have affected the results.
- Why unresolved: The current dataset composition may not accurately reflect the true linguistic distribution or potential performance differences across different word types.
- What evidence would resolve it: A new stemmer evaluation using a dataset with equal proportions of Portuguese loanwords and native Tetun words, followed by comparative performance analysis across different retrieval tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Would involving linguistic experts in Tetun morphology improve the accuracy and effectiveness of the Labadain-Stemmer compared to native speaker student evaluations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly states that the lack of funding to hire linguists represents a limitation and suggests that expert involvement would be crucial for enhancing stemmer accuracy.
- Why unresolved: Current stemmer development relied on student assessments rather than expert linguistic analysis, potentially missing nuanced morphological patterns.
- What evidence would resolve it: A new stemmer development cycle involving Tetun linguistics experts, with systematic comparison of stemming accuracy and retrieval effectiveness against the current student-based approach.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How would incorporating semantic search capabilities using large language models affect retrieval effectiveness in Tetun compared to traditional keyword-based approaches?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The conclusion section explicitly identifies semantic search and LLM integration as future research directions, suggesting current keyword-based methods may have limitations.
- Why unresolved: The study focused exclusively on traditional IR approaches without exploring semantic or contextual understanding capabilities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation and evaluation of a semantic search system for Tetun using LLMs, with direct comparison of retrieval effectiveness metrics against the established baselines using traditional methods.

## Limitations
- Limited generalizability: Results are specific to Tetun and may not directly apply to other low-resource languages without careful adaptation
- Small test collection: 59 topics may not fully represent the diversity of Tetun information needs
- Single dataset constraint: Performance metrics are based on one corpus (Labadain-30k+) which may have domain-specific characteristics
- Resource development stage: The created resources (stopword list, stemmer) are initial versions requiring further refinement

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims:**
- Hyphen and apostrophe removal improves retrieval effectiveness (supported by quantitative results across multiple models)
- DFR BM25 outperforms other models for short-text retrieval up to top-10 (statistically significant results in Table 23)
- Stemming provides no benefit for Tetun retrieval (consistent across all three stemmer variants)

**Medium Confidence Claims:**
- Hiemstra LM performs better at higher cutoffs (observed trend but with smaller effect sizes)
- Tetun's simple morphology explains lack of stemming benefits (reasonable linguistic assumption but not empirically proven)

**Low Confidence Claims:**
- Stopword removal impacts vary by model (inconsistent results across evaluation metrics)
- Generalizability to other low-resource languages (extrapolation beyond tested domain)

## Next Checks
1. Cross-validation with external corpora: Test the developed resources and findings on independently collected Tetun document collections to assess generalizability
2. Linguistic verification of preprocessing decisions: Conduct manual analysis of hyphen-split compounds and stemming outputs to confirm that automated preprocessing aligns with Tetun linguistic rules
3. User study on query effectiveness: Evaluate whether retrieved documents at different cutoffs (top-10 vs. top-100) actually satisfy information needs for typical Tetun search tasks
