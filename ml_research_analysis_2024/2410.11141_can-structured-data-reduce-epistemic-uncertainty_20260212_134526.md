# Can Structured Data Reduce Epistemic Uncertainty?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.11141
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11141
- Authors: Shriram M S; Sushmitha S; Gayathri K S; Shahina A
- Reference count: 4
- Key outcome: Ontology alignment reduces epistemic uncertainty in LLMs by 4.847% and improves learning rates

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a framework using ontology alignment to reduce epistemic uncertainty in deep learning models, particularly language models. The core idea leverages structured data from ontologies to improve model learning rates and reduce hallucinations in retrieval-augmented generation. Experiments demonstrate that models fine-tuned with ontologies learn at higher rates compared to native models, and incorporating subsumption mappings into prompts reduces hallucination while improving contextual similarity and factual accuracy.

## Method Summary
The methodology involves aligning ontologies to extract equivalence and subsumption mappings, using these mappings to enhance sequential classification tasks, and incorporating subsumptions into prompts to improve RAG outputs. The process uses pre-trained BERT models for ontology alignment, fine-tunes models with ontological data, and measures performance improvements through learning rate comparisons and hallucination reduction metrics. The approach is tested on medical ontologies with sequential classification tasks and RAG systems.

## Key Results
- Models fine-tuned with ontologies learned at a higher rate compared to native models on sequential classification tasks
- Incorporating subsumption mappings into prompts increased contextual similarity by 8.97%
- Factual accuracy improved by 1% and hallucination in LLMs reduced by 4.847% as measured by the proposed Hallucination Index

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Ontology alignment introduces structured semantic relationships that reduce epistemic uncertainty by providing explicit domain knowledge during model training
- Mechanism: Structured ontologies encode hierarchical and equivalence relationships that guide the model toward more precise representations
- Core assumption: The semantic relationships in ontologies are valid and complete enough to meaningfully constrain model learning
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "ontology can be used as a means to reduce epistemic uncertainty in LLMs, wherein we show how additional knowledge acquired through the structural format of an ontology reduces EU"
  - [section] "We define our hypothesis as follows: Consider two models α and β. Let model α be an extremely fine-tuned model with additional ability acquired through structured data and model β be the native version of model α"
- Break condition: If the ontology contains errors, inconsistencies, or lacks coverage of the target domain

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Subsumption mappings retrieved during ontology alignment enhance retrieval-augmented generation by providing additional contextual information that reduces hallucinations
- Mechanism: When subsumption relationships are identified, they provide hierarchical context that can be injected into prompts
- Core assumption: The subsumption relationships accurately represent meaningful hierarchical connections in the domain knowledge
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we extend our work to showcase how subsumption mappings retrieved during the process of ontology alignment can help enhance Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models"
  - [section] "By incorporating subsumptions in the prompt, we ensure hallucination is minimized and the response of the Language Model is more contextually and factually intact"
- Break condition: If the subsumption mappings are incorrectly identified or don't capture meaningful relationships

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Models fine-tuned on ontology-aligned data learn at a higher rate compared to native models, reaching optimal accuracy states faster
- Mechanism: Structured ontological data provides more informative gradients during training, allowing the model to converge to optimal solutions with fewer epochs
- Core assumption: The ontology-aligned training process provides gradients that are more informative and directionally correct than standard training data
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "models fine-tuned using ontologies learn a downstream task at a higher rate with better performance on a sequential classification task compared to the native version of the model"
  - [section] "Our idea is to define a hypothesis to show how important structured data is for a model" with quantitative comparisons showing faster convergence
- Break condition: If the ontology alignment process introduces noise or the structured data doesn't generalize well to the target task

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Epistemic vs Aleatoric Uncertainty
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly distinguishes between these two types of uncertainty and claims to address only epistemic uncertainty through structured data
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between epistemic uncertainty (lack of knowledge) and aleatoric uncertainty (inherent randomness) and why ontologies specifically address epistemic uncertainty?

- Concept: Ontology Alignment and Subsumption
  - Why needed here: The methodology relies on identifying equivalence and subsumption mappings between ontologies as the core mechanism for knowledge transfer
  - Quick check question: How would you explain the difference between equivalence mappings (similar concepts) and subsumption mappings (hierarchical relationships) in ontology alignment?

- Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  - Why needed here: The paper extends its methodology to enhance RAG systems by incorporating subsumption mappings into prompts
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of a RAG system and how does incorporating structured ontological knowledge into prompts potentially improve its performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Ontology alignment module (BERT-based model for sequential classification) -> Fine-tuning pipeline (pre-trained model → ontology-aligned model) -> Subsumption extraction module (processes equivalence mappings to identify hierarchical relationships) -> RAG enhancement module (modifies prompts with subsumption information) -> Evaluation framework (measures contextual similarity, factual accuracy, hallucination index)

- Critical path:
  1. Load source and target ontologies
  2. Perform ontology alignment to extract equivalence mappings
  3. Extract subsumption mappings from equivalence pairs
  4. Fine-tune pre-trained model using ontology-aligned data
  5. Use subsumption mappings to enhance RAG prompts
  6. Evaluate hallucination reduction and learning rate improvements

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using pre-trained BERT models provides strong starting points but may introduce domain-specific biases
  - Ontology alignment quality directly impacts downstream performance - poor alignments could degrade results
  - The computational cost of ontology alignment and subsumption extraction versus the benefits in reduced hallucination and faster learning

- Failure signatures:
  - If ontology alignments are incorrect, the model may learn incorrect relationships and perform worse than the native model
  - If subsumption mappings don't capture meaningful hierarchies, prompt enhancement may introduce confusion rather than clarity
  - If the evaluation metrics don't properly capture hallucination or learning rate improvements, the methodology's effectiveness may be overstated

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the sequential classification task comparison between native and ontology-aligned models on the MedQuAD-MedicalQnA dataset to verify the learning rate hypothesis
  2. Test subsumption-based prompt enhancement on a controlled set of RAG queries with known ground truth to measure hallucination reduction
  3. Vary the threshold for accepting subsumption mappings (currently 0.5) to find the optimal balance between information gain and noise introduction

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Open Question 1: How do the hallucination reduction benefits of subsumption mappings scale across different domains and ontology sizes?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper demonstrates reduced hallucinations in medical ontologies but does not explore scalability across domains
  - Why unresolved: The experiments are limited to medical ontologies, leaving uncertainty about performance in other domains
  - What evidence would resolve it: Systematic testing across multiple domains (legal, financial, technical) with varying ontology sizes and complexity

- Open Question 2: What is the optimal method for selecting and integrating subsumption mappings to maximize contextual enhancement without overwhelming the prompt?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses a simple token-matching approach but doesn't explore optimization strategies
  - Why unresolved: The current implementation uses basic token matching, but doesn't investigate whether all subsumptions are equally valuable or how to prioritize them
  - What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies testing different selection criteria, weighting schemes, and integration methods

- Open Question 3: How does the performance of ontology-enhanced models compare to other uncertainty reduction techniques like ensemble methods or probabilistic reasoning frameworks?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper focuses solely on ontology-based approaches without comparing to alternative uncertainty reduction methods
  - Why unresolved: No baseline comparisons with other established techniques for reducing epistemic uncertainty in language models
  - What evidence would resolve it: Head-to-head comparisons measuring performance, computational efficiency, and generalization across multiple uncertainty reduction approaches

- Open Question 4: What are the computational trade-offs between the benefits of ontology alignment and the additional processing overhead?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The framework requires ontology alignment and additional prompt processing, but no efficiency analysis is provided
  - Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates performance improvements but doesn't quantify the computational costs of the ontology-based approach
  - What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis of processing time, memory usage, and scalability metrics compared to baseline models

## Limitations
- The methodology assumes ontologies are accurate and complete, but real-world ontologies often contain inconsistencies or gaps
- The framework's performance on non-medical domains remains untested, limiting generalizability claims
- Computational overhead of ontology alignment and subsumption extraction may offset benefits in resource-constrained applications

## Confidence
- Learning rate improvements: Medium confidence - supported by experimental comparisons but with unspecified evaluation details
- Hallucination reduction claims: Low confidence - promising percentages but introduced metrics lack detailed validation procedures
- Cross-domain generalizability: Low confidence - methodology untested beyond medical ontologies

## Next Checks
1. Test the methodology on non-medical ontologies (e.g., financial or legal domains) to evaluate cross-domain generalizability and identify domain-specific limitations
2. Conduct ablation studies varying the ontology alignment quality threshold to quantify the relationship between alignment accuracy and downstream performance
3. Compare the Hallucination Index metric against established hallucination detection benchmarks like TruthfulQA or self-consistency to validate its effectiveness and reliability
