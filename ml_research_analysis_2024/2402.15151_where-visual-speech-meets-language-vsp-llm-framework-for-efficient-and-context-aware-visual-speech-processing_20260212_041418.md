# Where Visual Speech Meets Language: VSP-LLM Framework for Efficient and Context-Aware Visual Speech Processing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.15151
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15151
- Reference count: 21
- Primary result: VSP-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on visual speech recognition and translation with significantly less training data (30h vs 433h)

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of visual speech processing, particularly distinguishing homophenes (words with identical lip movements but different sounds) using context. The proposed VSP-LLM framework integrates visual speech processing with large language models (LLMs) to leverage their rich context modeling capabilities. The method maps input video frames to LLM input space using a self-supervised visual speech model, employs a novel deduplication strategy based on visual speech units to reduce redundant information, and uses instructions to control multi-task learning for visual speech recognition (VSR) and translation (VST). Experimental results show that VSP-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both VSR and VST tasks, outperforming recent models even with significantly less training data (30 hours vs. 433 hours).

## Method Summary
VSP-LLM is a unified framework that combines visual speech processing with large language models. The core approach involves embedding visual speech features into the input space of a pre-trained LLM using A V-HuBERT as the visual encoder. A novel deduplication method based on visual speech units reduces sequence length by clustering and averaging redundant features. The framework employs instruction tuning to control multi-task learning for VSR and VST. QLoRA is used for efficient fine-tuning of the LLM. The model is trained on 30 hours of labeled data but leverages the pre-trained LLM's language knowledge for improved performance and data efficiency.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on both VSR and VST tasks
- Outperforms recent models with significantly less training data (30h vs 433h)
- Deduplication strategy reduces sequence length by about 50% with minimal performance degradation
- Demonstrates superior ability to handle homophenes by considering broader context

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Visual Speech Unit Deduplication
Visual speech units derived from discretized self-supervised visual speech representations enable efficient deduplication of redundant frames while preserving semantic content. K-means clustering is applied to the visual speech representations to create visual speech units, which act as pseudo-text. By mapping video frames to these units and averaging features within the same unit, redundant information from contiguous frames is removed without losing linguistic meaning. This works because adjacent video frames contain highly similar lip movements, and the visual speech units capture pronunciation cues effectively enough to identify redundancy.

### Mechanism 2: LLM Context Modeling for Homophones
Integrating LLM with visual speech processing improves homophone handling by leveraging rich contextual modeling. The visual speech features are embedded into the input space of a pre-trained LLM. The LLM's strong context modeling ability allows it to distinguish homophones (words with identical lip movements but different sounds) by considering surrounding context during recognition and translation tasks. This works because the pre-trained LLM has sufficient contextual understanding of language to disambiguate homophones when provided with visual speech features in its input space.

### Mechanism 3: Data Efficiency Through LLM Transfer
The unified VSP-LLM model achieves data efficiency by leveraging the pre-trained LLM's language knowledge, requiring minimal labeled visual speech data. The LLM is pre-trained on vast text corpora, providing rich language understanding. The visual encoder is trained on large-scale unlabeled data, and only the mapping between visual features and LLM input requires labeled data. This reduces the dependency on extensive labeled visual speech datasets. This works because the pre-trained LLM's language knowledge transfers effectively to the visual speech domain, and the visual encoder provides sufficient quality representations.

## Foundational Learning

- **Visual speech processing and homophenes**: Understanding the challenge of distinguishing words with identical lip movements is crucial for grasping why context modeling is essential and why integrating LLMs helps.
  - Quick check: What are homophenes, and why do they pose a challenge in visual speech recognition?

- **Self-supervised speech models (e.g., A V-HuBERT)**: The visual encoder is based on A V-HuBERT, which provides phoneme-level representations. Understanding how these models work is key to understanding the visual-to-text space mapping.
  - Quick check: How does A V-HuBERT learn visual speech representations without text labels?

- **LLM integration and instruction tuning**: The framework relies on mapping visual features to LLM input space and using instructions to control tasks. Understanding LLM basics and instruction tuning is necessary to grasp the architecture.
  - Quick check: How does instruction tuning work in LLMs, and why is it used here to control VSR vs VST tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Video frames -> A V-HuBERT (visual encoder) -> Visual features -> Visual-to-Text Embedding -> LLM input space -> LLM (LLaMA2-7B with QLoRA) -> Predicted tokens

- **Critical path**: 
  1. Input video → Visual Encoder → Visual features
  2. Visual features → Visual-to-Text Embedding → LLM input space
  3. Deduplication (optional) → Reduced visual features
  4. LLM input (visual features + instruction) → LLM → Predicted tokens

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Deduplication vs. performance: Reduces computational load but may slightly impact performance if too aggressive
  - Number of visual speech units: Affects deduplication effectiveness and sequence length reduction
  - LLM size and adaptation method (QLoRA): Balances performance and computational efficiency

- **Failure signatures**:
  - High WER/BLEU but low FLOPs: Deduplication may be too aggressive, removing important information
  - High FLOPs but poor performance: Visual-to-text mapping or deduplication may not be working correctly
  - Task confusion (VSR vs VST): Instruction embedding may not be effective

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline without deduplication: Measure performance and FLOPs to establish a reference point
  2. Vary number of visual speech unit clusters: Analyze the impact on performance and computational efficiency
  3. Ablation of visual-to-text embedding: Assess the importance of aligning visual features with LLM input space

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: What is the optimal number of clusters for visual speech units to maximize performance and computational efficiency across different languages and datasets?
  - Basis: The paper experiments with different cluster numbers (2000, 200, 50) but doesn't determine an optimal value
  - Unresolved: The experiments only test three specific values without exploring the full parameter space or considering different languages and datasets
  - Evidence needed: A comprehensive study testing various cluster numbers across multiple languages and datasets, including analysis of performance-FLOPs trade-offs and language-specific optimal values

- **Open Question 2**: How does the VSP-LLM framework perform when integrating non-verbal cues such as facial expressions and gestures?
  - Basis: The limitations section mentions the potential for integrating non-verbal cues and their expected benefits for tasks like emotional recognition and dialog generation
  - Unresolved: The paper focuses solely on visual speech and text, without exploring the integration of additional non-verbal modalities
  - Evidence needed: Experiments extending the VSP-LLM framework to incorporate facial expressions and gestures, with performance comparisons on tasks like emotion recognition and dialog generation

- **Open Question 3**: What is the impact of potential exposure to LRS3 dataset during LLaMA2 pre-training on the VSP-LLM's performance?
  - Basis: The erratum and section C discuss concerns about LLaMA2 potentially being exposed to LRS3 during pre-training, but conclude it's unlikely to significantly impact performance
  - Unresolved: The paper cannot definitively confirm or deny LLaMA2's exposure to LRS3 due to lack of transparency in LLaMA2's training data
  - Evidence needed: Access to LLaMA2's training data details or controlled experiments training LLaMA2 from scratch without LRS3 exposure, comparing performance to the original VSP-LLM

## Next Checks

1. **Reproduce deduplication efficiency**: Implement the visual speech unit clustering with varying numbers of clusters to quantify sequence length reduction and measure corresponding performance impact across different datasets.

2. **Validate computational savings**: Compare actual inference time and FLOPs between VSP-LLM and baseline models on identical hardware, measuring the real-world efficiency gains from deduplication and QLoRA adaptation.

3. **Test homophone handling**: Create controlled test cases with clear homophone pairs in different contexts to systematically evaluate the framework's ability to distinguish them compared to baseline models without LLM integration.
