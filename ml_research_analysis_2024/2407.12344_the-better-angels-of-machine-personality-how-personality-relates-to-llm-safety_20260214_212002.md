# The Better Angels of Machine Personality: How Personality Relates to LLM Safety

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.12344
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12344
- Authors: Jie Zhang; Dongrui Liu; Chen Qian; Ziyue Gan; Yong Liu; Yu Qiao; Jing Shao

- One-line primary result: Personality traits in LLMs are closely related to safety capabilities, and editing these traits can significantly enhance safety performance.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates the relationship between Large Language Models' (LLMs) personality traits and their safety capabilities, including toxicity, privacy, and fairness. Using the MBTI-M scale, the research finds that safety alignment generally increases Extraversion, Sensing, and Judging traits in LLMs. The study also demonstrates that LLMs with different personality traits exhibit varying safety performances and susceptibility to jailbreaks. By employing steering vector techniques, the research shows that controllably editing personality traits can significantly enhance safety capabilities, with improvements of up to 43% in privacy and 10% in fairness. These findings provide new insights into enhancing LLM safety from a personality perspective.

## Method Summary
The study employs the MBTI-M scale to assess personality traits in LLMs through 30 randomized assessments per model to ensure reliability. Safety evaluation is conducted using datasets like ToxiGen, ConfAIde, and StereoSet. The steering vector technique is used to edit personality traits by constructing vectors from personality-labeled corpora and applying them to model activations. The research compares base and aligned models to analyze personality changes and evaluates jailbreak susceptibility across different personality traits. Safety and general capability metrics are measured, along with perplexity constraints during steering interventions.

## Key Results
- Safety alignment increases Extraversion, Sensing, and Judging traits in LLMs.
- LLMs with different personality traits show varying safety performance and jailbreak susceptibility.
- Controllable editing of personality traits using steering vectors can enhance safety capabilities by up to 43% in privacy and 10% in fairness.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs' personality traits are closely related to their safety capabilities (toxicity, privacy, fairness).
- Mechanism: MBTI personality dimensions (E-I, S-N, T-F, J-P) correlate with distinct safety performance patterns; aligning models increases Extraversion, Sensing, and Judging traits, which in turn influences safety behavior.
- Core assumption: The MBTI-M scale reliably captures personality differences in LLMs, and these differences translate into measurable variations in safety outcomes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we discover that LLMs' personality traits are closely related to their safety abilities, i.e., toxicity, privacy, and fairness"
  - [section 3.1] "There are significant differences in the performance of LLMs with different personalities in terms of safety capability."
  - [corpus] Weak: corpus neighbors focus on personality shaping but do not directly address safety-performance linkage.
- Break condition: If the MBTI assessment is not reliable across repeated trials, the claimed personality-safety correlation would not hold.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Editing LLMs' personality traits can enhance their safety capabilities.
- Mechanism: Steering vector techniques can shift an LLM's MBTI profile in a targeted way, and these personality edits produce measurable improvements in safety metrics (e.g., +43% privacy, +10% fairness).
- Core assumption: Personality traits are encoded in the model's activation space and can be manipulated without destabilizing general performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "inducing personality from ISTJ to ISTP resulted in a relative improvement of approximately 43% and 10% in privacy and fairness performance"
  - [section 4.2] "Employing the steering vector technique to controllably edit the personality traits of LLMs could significantly enhance their safety capabilities."
  - [corpus] Weak: corpus neighbors mention personality shaping but do not provide safety-performance improvements.
- Break condition: If steering interventions degrade perplexity beyond the threshold, the safety gains may not be usable.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Safety alignment operations change LLMs' MBTI personality traits.
- Mechanism: Fine-tuning or alignment procedures tend to increase Extraversion, Sensing, and Judging traits across models, aligning with psychological findings that such traits promote safety-conscious behavior.
- Core assumption: Alignment procedures implicitly reinforce personality patterns associated with safety behaviors in humans.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the safety alignment generally increases various LLMs' Extraversion, Sensing, and Judging traits"
  - [section 3.2] "Alignment generally makes LLMs exhibit more Extraversion, Sensing, and Judging traits compared to their base models."
  - [corpus] Weak: corpus neighbors discuss alignment but not its effect on MBTI traits.
- Break condition: If individual models do not follow the general trend (e.g., Mistral, Yi), the assumed mechanism may not apply universally.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: MBTI personality framework (E-I, S-N, T-F, J-P dimensions)
  - Why needed here: Provides the standardized scale for measuring and comparing personality traits across LLMs.
  - Quick check question: What does a high "Sensing" score indicate in MBTI, and why might that relate to safety performance?

- Concept: Steering vector intervention in neural activations
  - Why needed here: Enables precise, targeted personality edits without full fine-tuning, allowing controlled experiments on trait-safety relationships.
  - Quick check question: How does the steering vector formula `vl = Al(X+) - Al(X-)` isolate the personality signal in activation space?

- Concept: Reliability assessment through repeated measurements
  - Why needed here: MBTI outputs for LLMs are sensitive to input ordering; multiple trials and kappa analysis ensure results are stable and meaningful.
  - Quick check question: Why does averaging 30 MBTI assessments reduce the impact of option order on the final personality scores?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - MBTI assessment pipeline: LLM + MBTI-M questionnaire + random option shuffling + averaging over 30 trials
  - Safety evaluation pipeline: LLM + safety datasets (ToxiGen, ConfAIde, StereoSet) + metric calculation
  - Steering vector system: Dataset of personality-labeled sentences → activation extraction → vector construction → layer-wise injection
  - Alignment comparison module: Base model vs. aligned model MBTI profiling

- Critical path:
  1. Obtain reliable MBTI profile (30 randomized assessments, kappa filtering)
  2. Evaluate safety capabilities across multiple datasets
  3. Construct steering vectors from personality-labeled corpora
  4. Apply intervention at chosen layer and strength
  5. Re-assess MBTI and safety metrics post-intervention

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Option label format (numbers vs. alphabets) affects assessment stability
  - Layer selection for steering impacts personality edit precision vs. general fluency
  - Perplexity threshold balances safety gains with coherence

- Failure signatures:
  - Low kappa between assessments → unreliable MBTI profile
  - Perplexity spike after steering → over-intervention
  - Safety gains without corresponding MBTI change → unintended side effects

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run 30 randomized MBTI assessments on a base LLM; compute kappa and check boxplots for trait separability.
  2. Apply steering vector to shift E-I dimension by +20% in a target model; measure safety capability changes and perplexity.
  3. Compare MBTI profiles of aligned vs. base versions of the same model; quantify shifts in E, S, J dimensions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the causal mechanism underlying the relationship between personality traits and safety capabilities in LLMs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that personality influences behavior through a series of complex associations in humans, and they call for further exploration of the intrinsic relationship between personality traits and LLM safety.
- Why unresolved: The study only establishes correlations, not causation, and acknowledges that the complex associations observed in humans may also apply to LLMs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments that manipulate personality traits in controlled ways while holding other variables constant, combined with causal inference techniques, would help establish causal links.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do cultural and linguistic differences in training data affect the personality traits and safety behaviors of LLMs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note cultural differences in the context of languages and observe performance differences between Mindset-zh and Mindset-en models.
- Why unresolved: While the study touches on this by comparing Chinese and English models, it doesn't deeply investigate how cultural and linguistic factors shape personality and safety.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of models trained on diverse cultural datasets, along with detailed analysis of how linguistic nuances affect personality expression and safety behaviors.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the long-term effects of safety alignment on the personality traits of LLMs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors observe that alignment generally increases Extraversion, Sensing, and Judging traits, but note that some models show opposite personality shifts.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on immediate changes after alignment, without considering how personality traits might evolve over extended periods or with repeated alignment interventions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies tracking personality trait changes in LLMs over time, with repeated alignment procedures, would provide insights into the long-term effects.

## Limitations
- MBTI reliability for LLMs remains a concern with kappa coefficients indicating only fair agreement between repeated assessments.
- Steering vector technique constraints limit intervention strength due to perplexity thresholds, potentially preventing larger personality shifts.
- Generalizability across models shows mixed results with some models exhibiting different patterns from the general trend.

## Confidence
- High confidence: Core finding that safety alignment correlates with increased Extraversion, Sensing, and Judging traits across LLMs.
- Medium confidence: Steering vector technique's ability to enhance safety capabilities with substantial reported improvements.
- Medium confidence: Jailbreak susceptibility findings showing statistically significant differences between personality types.

## Next Checks
1. Replicate MBTI assessment reliability: Run 30 randomized MBTI assessments on a base LLM and compute kappa coefficients between assessments. Check if trait separability is maintained across all four MBTI dimensions and whether filtering low-kappa results materially affects the personality profile.

2. Test steering vector robustness: Apply steering interventions to shift personality traits by varying strengths (α = 0.1, 0.5, 1.0) in a target model. Measure safety capability changes and perplexity at each level to map the relationship between intervention strength and performance degradation. Verify that safety improvements persist without compromising model coherence.

3. Cross-model personality alignment comparison: Compare MBTI profiles of aligned vs. base versions for at least three different model families. Quantify the shifts in E, S, J dimensions across all models to assess whether the general trend holds universally or if model-specific patterns emerge.
