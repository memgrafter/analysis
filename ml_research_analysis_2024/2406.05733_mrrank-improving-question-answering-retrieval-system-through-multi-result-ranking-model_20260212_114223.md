# MrRank: Improving Question Answering Retrieval System through Multi-Result Ranking Model

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.05733
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05733
- Reference count: 15
- Primary result: Improves MRR by 13.6% on average across datasets using multi-result ranking model

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of hallucinations and outdated information in large language models by improving question answering retrieval systems. The proposed MrRank method combines multiple heterogeneous information retrieval systems using a learning-to-rank approach. By leveraging both neural-based and term-weighting retrieval models, MrRank achieves state-of-the-art performance on ReQA SQuAD tasks while reducing training time through sample mining techniques.

## Method Summary
MrRank uses a two-stage retrieval process where a primary neural retriever (SGPT-5.8B-msmarco) provides top candidates which are then re-ranked using features from both the neural and supporting BM25 retrievers. The re-ranker employs a Siamese feed-forward neural network trained with pairwise learning-to-rank using a modified RankNet objective that excludes tied pairs. This approach combines the semantic strengths of neural models with the precision of term-weighting models, achieving improved retrieval performance while reducing computational overhead through sample mining.

## Key Results
- Achieves 13.6% average MRR improvement across datasets compared to baseline models
- Outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on ReQA SQuAD task
- Reduces training time by eliminating 97% of uninformative training pairs through sample mining
- Demonstrates effectiveness across multiple datasets including ReQA SQuAD, ReQA NQ, and Thai language datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Re-ranking with pairwise learning-to-rank improves retrieval by leveraging relative document quality rather than absolute scores
- Mechanism: The model is trained to produce higher scores for document pairs where one is known to be better, learning a relative ordering that improves the final ranked list
- Core assumption: Relative quality judgments between document pairs are easier to learn than absolute quality scores, and excluding ties reduces noise
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art (Zhao et al., 2023) on ReQA SQuAD, surpassing all individual retrieval models, RRF, and the statistical routing strategy"
  - [section]: "We have modified the conventional RankNet learning-to-rank algorithm by excluding the training sample with a target value of 0.5"
- Break condition: If the dataset lacks sufficient true answer documents per query, pairwise training will have too few positive pairs to learn from

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Combining neural and term-weighting models captures complementary retrieval strengths
- Mechanism: Neural models excel at semantic matching while term-weighting models (BM25) handle exact term overlap; fusing them via re-ranking leverages both
- Core assumption: The best neural model (SGPT) is consistently stronger than BM25 on R@10, so using it as the main retriever captures most of the semantic signal while BM25 adds precision
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "We select top candidate retrievers from MTEB benchmarks within the retrieval and re-ranking category"
  - [section]: "Our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art (Zhao et al., 2023) on ReQA SQuAD"
- Break condition: If a single model dominates both semantic and lexical matching, combining adds little and may hurt performance

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Sample mining reduces training time and improves re-ranker accuracy by removing uninformative ties
- Mechanism: By excluding pairs where both documents are non-targets (target=0.5), the model focuses on meaningful positive/negative distinctions
- Core assumption: The ReQA dataset has many non-target documents, so random pairing creates mostly ties that do not help the model learn
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Since the ReQA dataset has a lot of non-target documents, selecting random pairs will usually result in a tie"
  - [section]: "The reduction in unnecessary training pairs resulted in a significant decrease in training time while simultaneously enhancing performance"
- Break condition: If the dataset has few non-target documents or many ties, sample mining will remove too much training data

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Pairwise learning-to-rank (RankNet)
  - Why needed here: The re-ranker must learn relative ordering of documents rather than absolute relevance scores
  - Quick check question: What is the target output for a positive pair in RankNet training?

- Concept: Siamese neural network architecture
  - Why needed here: The re-ranker must process two documents in parallel to compare their scores
  - Quick check question: How many hidden layers and units are used in the re-ranker network?

- Concept: Topological sorting for final ranking
  - Why needed here: The re-ranker outputs pairwise comparisons that must be converted into a total order
  - Quick check question: What happens when the pairwise comparisons produce a cycle or are inconclusive?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Main retriever (neural model) → Support retriever (BM25) → Feature concatenation → Re-ranker (Siamese RankNet) → Topological sort → Final ranking
- Critical path: Main retriever scores → BM25 scores → Re-ranker prediction → Topological sort → Final ranking
- Design tradeoffs: Using only top-k (64) documents limits computation but may miss relevant documents; using main retriever as primary reduces supporting model load but caps potential gains
- Failure signatures: If the re-ranker adds latency without improving MRR, check if the main retriever already has high R@10; if topological sort fails often, check if pairwise predictions are too uncertain
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train re-ranker with k=16 to measure latency vs performance trade-off
  2. Compare sample mining vs full pairwise training on training time and accuracy
  3. Test neural-neural combinations (e.g., USE+SGPT) to see if the framework works beyond BM25 hybrids

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of MrRank scale with an increasing number of heterogeneous retrieval models?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the framework supports extensions beyond two models and shows results for combining three models, but does not explore scaling to a larger number of models
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on combining two or three models and does not investigate the impact of scaling up the number of models on performance and computational efficiency
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the performance and efficiency of MrRank with varying numbers of retrieval models (e.g., 4, 5, 6+) would provide insights into the scalability of the approach

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can MrRank be effectively applied to other types of retrieval tasks beyond question answering, such as document retrieval or recommendation systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the technique is not restricted to a specific type of retrieval models and focuses on improving QA systems by enhancing retrieval, but does not explore applications to other retrieval tasks
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of MrRank in the context of question answering retrieval tasks, but does not investigate its applicability to other types of retrieval tasks
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying MrRank to different retrieval tasks, such as document retrieval or recommendation systems, and comparing its performance to state-of-the-art methods in those domains would demonstrate its versatility

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of MrRank compare to end-to-end fine-tuning approaches that optimize both the retrieval and reader components simultaneously?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that MrRank focuses on improving the retrieval component, which is identified as a bottleneck, and suggests that further investigation into improving the overall performance by directly optimizing the reader along with the retrieval model might be beneficial
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of MrRank in improving retrieval performance, but does not compare it to end-to-end fine-tuning approaches that optimize both retrieval and reader components
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the performance of MrRank to end-to-end fine-tuning approaches on question answering tasks would provide insights into the relative benefits of each method and their impact on overall system performance

## Limitations

- Limited validation to ReQA SQuAD dataset with minimal testing on diverse question answering domains
- Unclear exact implementation details of the sample mining technique that reduces training pairs by 97%
- Assumes main retriever (SGPT) consistently outperforms supporting models, which may not hold across all datasets
- Lacks comprehensive ablation studies to isolate contribution of each component

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The pairwise learning-to-rank mechanism and topological sorting approach are well-established methods that should work as described
- **Medium Confidence**: The performance improvements are statistically significant but may not generalize beyond the tested datasets
- **Low Confidence**: The exact sample mining implementation and its impact on training efficiency cannot be verified without additional details

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Test MrRank on diverse QA datasets (different domains, languages, and formats) to assess generalizability beyond ReQA SQuAD
2. **Ablation study**: Systematically remove components (sample mining, BM25 combination, pairwise ranking) to quantify each contribution to performance gains
3. **Model combination analysis**: Test different neural model combinations (e.g., two neural retrievers instead of neural+BM25) to determine if the framework works beyond the neural-BM25 pairing
