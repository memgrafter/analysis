# Coordinated Flaw Disclosure for AI: Beyond Security Vulnerabilities

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.07039
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07039
- Reference count: 35
- Introduces Coordinated Flaw Disclosure (CFD) framework for AI systems

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes Coordinated Flaw Disclosure (CFD), a framework for reporting and addressing algorithmic flaws in AI systems. CFD adapts cybersecurity Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) practices to machine learning contexts by extending model cards to document intent and scope, establishing an independent adjudication panel, and implementing automated verification. The framework aims to improve AI accountability and public trust while balancing vendor and community interests. A pilot implementation at DEF CON 32 will test the framework's real-world applicability.

## Method Summary
The CFD framework adapts CVD processes for AI systems by introducing extended model cards with detailed intent and scope documentation, an independent adjudication panel to mediate disputes, and an automated verification system for issue reporting. The framework also proposes dynamic scope expansion based on common use cases and the development of a Common Use Enumeration (CUE) system to standardize tracking of AI model applications. The approach aims to address challenges in ML flaw disclosure including ethical issues, vendor interests, and managing dynamic model behaviors.

## Key Results
- Introduces extended model cards to document intent and scope for flaw assessment
- Establishes independent adjudication panel for dispute resolution
- Proposes automated verification to streamline issue reporting and reproduction
- Plans pilot implementation at DEF CON 32 to test framework applicability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Extending model cards to include detailed intent and scope enables precise flaw identification and adjudication.
- Mechanism: The extended model cards serve as a baseline for assessing whether reported issues are actual flaws by comparing them against the stated intent and scope of the model.
- Core assumption: Model cards can be standardized and made sufficiently detailed to capture the nuances of a model's intended use and limitations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "extended model cards that include detailed documentation of intent and scope, providing a baseline for flaw assessment"
  - [section] "Extended Model Cards: Model Cards, traditionally used for complete systems, will be extended to provide detailed documentation of intent and scope"
- Break condition: If model cards remain inconsistent or incomplete, the adjudication process cannot reliably distinguish valid flaws from misunderstandings.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: An independent adjudication panel can fairly mediate disputes between submitters and vendors in ML flaw disclosure.
- Mechanism: The panel provides an impartial third-party review of rejected reports, examining sensitive proprietary information from vendors without public disclosure.
- Core assumption: A trusted panel can be established with the expertise and neutrality to evaluate complex ML issues fairly.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "an independent adjudication panel to mediate disputes and handle edge cases"
  - [section] "The primary function of this committee is to distinguish between issues that involve valid violations of the model's intent and scope and those that do not"
- Break condition: If the panel becomes biased or lacks the technical expertise to evaluate ML-specific issues, it cannot fulfill its role effectively.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Dynamic scope expansion based on common use allows the framework to adapt to real-world applications of general-purpose models.
- Mechanism: The framework can extend its scope to include common uses that emerge after deployment, even if not originally anticipated in the model card.
- Core assumption: Common use cases can be identified and quantified to trigger scope expansion.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "dynamic scope expansion mechanism that allows for the inclusion of common, unforeseen uses of the model"
  - [section] "We propose a 'Common Use' clause in the model card. This clause allows for the dynamic expansion of the model's intent and scope based on widespread adoption of certain use cases"
- Break condition: If common use cannot be reliably identified or quantified, the dynamic scope expansion mechanism becomes ineffective.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) processes in cybersecurity
  - Why needed here: The CFD framework is explicitly modeled after CVD processes, so understanding CVD is crucial for implementing CFD
  - Quick check question: What are the three key components of a comprehensive CVE entry in the National Vulnerability Database?

- Concept: Model cards and their role in ML transparency
  - Why needed here: Extended model cards are a core innovation of the CFD framework, serving as the basis for flaw assessment
  - Quick check question: What information should be included in the intent and scope sections of an extended model card?

- Concept: Statistical validity in ML model evaluation
  - Why needed here: The framework emphasizes the need for statistically valid reports and addresses the challenge of distinguishing real flaws from sampling bias
  - Quick check question: Why is it important to consider mistakes collectively from a statistical standpoint before deeming them as issues requiring attention in ML systems?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Submission platform -> Triage system -> Vendor review -> Adjudication panel (if rejected) -> Resolution interface

- Critical path:
  1. User submits flaw report
  2. Triage and initial review by vendor
  3. Vendor acceptance or rejection
  4. If rejected, appeal to adjudication panel
  5. Panel review and decision
  6. Issue resolution and documentation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Balance between transparency and protection of sensitive vendor information
  - Tradeoff between comprehensive model card documentation and practical implementation burden
  - Decision between centralized adjudication panel vs. decentralized approach

- Failure signatures:
  - High rate of report rejections without meaningful explanation
  - Adjudication panel backlog leading to delays
  - Inconsistent application of scope expansion criteria
  - Low submission quality leading to inefficient use of resources

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Pilot the submission and triage process with a small set of known ML issues to test the workflow
  2. Conduct a mock adjudication process with a panel of experts to refine dispute resolution procedures
  3. Test the automated verification system with a diverse set of model errors to ensure it can handle different types of issues

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How effective would the proposed CFD framework be in practice for identifying and addressing algorithmic flaws in AI systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions a forthcoming pilot implementation at DEF CON 32 to test the framework's robustness and applicability.
- Why unresolved: The pilot has not yet occurred, so empirical evidence on the framework's effectiveness is lacking.
- What evidence would resolve it: Results and lessons learned from the DEF CON 32 pilot implementation, including metrics on flaw identification, resolution rates, and stakeholder satisfaction.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the challenges of managing dynamic ML datasets and evolving model behaviors be effectively addressed in the CFD framework?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies the lack of standardized model cards and challenges in managing evolving ML datasets as limitations of the framework.
- Why unresolved: Current tools and practices for tracking and managing dynamic ML datasets are insufficient, and the paper does not provide specific solutions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of new tools or processes for tracking ML dataset evolution and model behavior changes, along with empirical data on their effectiveness in the CFD context.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can a Common Use Enumeration (CUE) system be effectively developed and governed to standardize the tracking of AI model applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper proposes developing a CUE system and outlines its proposed structure and governance model.
- Why unresolved: The CUE system is still in the proposal stage, and its practical implementation and governance mechanisms are not yet established.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful implementation of a CUE system with active participation from AI industry stakeholders, comprehensive documentation of AI model uses, and demonstrated impact on AI accountability and transparency.

## Limitations

- Lack of standardized model cards across different AI systems could hinder the effectiveness of the CFD framework
- Dynamic nature of ML datasets presents challenges in tracking and managing evolving data used in model training
- Proposed Common Use Enumeration (CUE) system is still in proposal stage with undefined practical implementation

## Confidence

- High confidence: The basic framework structure and adaptation of CVD principles to ML contexts
- Medium confidence: The effectiveness of extended model cards and adjudication panel in practice
- Low confidence: The automated verification system and CUE implementation details

## Next Checks

1. **Pilot Study Design**: Develop and execute a controlled pilot study at DEF CON 32 that tracks submission quality and rejection rates, time-to-resolution for different types of issues, adjudication panel decision consistency, and vendor participation patterns.

2. **Model Card Interoperability Test**: Create a reference implementation comparing different model card formats and their effectiveness in supporting the CFD framework, evaluating information completeness, ease of interpretation by non-experts, and consistency in flaw assessment outcomes.

3. **Adjudication Panel Performance Analysis**: Design and conduct mock adjudication sessions using real ML issues from public datasets to assess decision-making consistency across panel members, time required for resolution, impact of proprietary information constraints, and scalability to higher submission volumes.
