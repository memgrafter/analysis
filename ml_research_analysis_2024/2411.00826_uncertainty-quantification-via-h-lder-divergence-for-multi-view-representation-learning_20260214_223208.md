# Uncertainty Quantification via Hölder Divergence for Multi-View Representation Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.00826
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00826
- Authors: Yan Zhang; Ming Li; Chun Li; Zhaoxia Liu; Ye Zhang; Fei Richard Yu

- Key outcome: Hölder Divergence improves multi-view representation learning by better measuring distribution distances, achieving superior performance across four datasets with higher accuracy and robustness to noise.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Hölder Divergence (HD) as an alternative to Kullback-Leibler divergence for uncertainty quantification in multi-view representation learning. The method addresses challenges with incomplete or noisy data by extracting representations from multiple modalities through parallel network branches, estimating prediction uncertainties using HD, and integrating these uncertainties via Dempster-Shafer theory. The approach demonstrates significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets (SUNRGBD, NYUDV2, ADE20K, ScanNet) while maintaining computational efficiency. The model shows particular strength in fusion modality recognition and exhibits robustness to noisy data, with adaptability confirmed across different backbone architectures.

## Method Summary
The proposed method uses Hölder Divergence to quantify uncertainty in multi-view representation learning. It processes multiple data modalities through parallel network branches to extract modality-specific representations, then estimates prediction uncertainties using HD instead of traditional KL divergence. These uncertainties are integrated using Dempster-Shafer theory to produce final predictions. The approach is evaluated across four datasets using different backbone architectures (ResNet-18, Mamba, ViT) to demonstrate its adaptability and effectiveness in both classification and clustering tasks.

## Key Results
- Achieves higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods, particularly in fusion modality recognition
- Demonstrates superior robustness to noisy data compared to traditional approaches
- Maintains computational efficiency with "negligible extra computational overheads"
- Shows consistent performance across different backbone architectures (ResNet-18, Mamba, ViT)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Hölder Divergence provides a more flexible and robust measure of distance between probability distributions compared to KL divergence. This flexibility allows the model to better capture the uncertainty inherent in multi-view data where modalities may be incomplete or noisy. By using HD instead of KL divergence, the method can more accurately estimate the divergence between real and predictive distributions, leading to improved uncertainty quantification. The integration of modality-specific uncertainties through Dempster-Shafer theory allows for principled combination of evidence from different sources while properly accounting for uncertainty.

## Foundational Learning

**Hölder Divergence**: A family of divergence measures parameterized by exponent α that generalizes several well-known divergences. *Why needed*: Provides more flexibility than KL divergence for measuring distribution distances. *Quick check*: Verify that HD reduces to KL divergence when α→1 and to other known divergences for different α values.

**Dempster-Shafer Theory**: A mathematical framework for reasoning with uncertainty that allows combination of evidence from multiple sources. *Why needed*: Provides principled method for integrating uncertainty from different modalities. *Quick check*: Confirm that evidence combination follows the Dempster's rule and properly handles conflict between sources.

**Multi-view Representation Learning**: Learning joint representations from multiple data modalities or views. *Why needed*: Enables leveraging complementary information from different data sources. *Quick check*: Verify that representations from different modalities capture complementary rather than redundant information.

**Uncertainty Quantification**: Methods for estimating and representing uncertainty in model predictions. *Why needed*: Critical for reliable decision-making in real-world applications. *Quick check*: Validate that uncertainty estimates correlate with prediction accuracy and calibration.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Modalities → Parallel Network Branches → Representation Extraction → Hölder Divergence Uncertainty Estimation → Dempster-Shafer Integration → Final Prediction

**Critical Path**: The forward pass through parallel branches, uncertainty estimation via HD, and Dempster-Shafer integration forms the core inference pipeline. The Hölder exponent α selection is critical for performance.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Parallel branches enable modality-specific feature extraction but increase parameter count. Hölder Divergence provides flexibility but requires tuning α. Dempster-Shafer integration handles uncertainty well but assumes modality independence.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance when Hölder exponent α is far from optimal (1.7 in experiments). Degradation when modalities are highly correlated, violating Dempster-Shafer independence assumptions. Performance drops with extreme noise levels.

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Run the model with different Hölder exponents (1.5, 1.7, 2.0) on a validation set to find optimal α
2. Compare uncertainty estimates from HD vs KL divergence on a simple two-class problem
3. Test the Dempster-Shafer integration on synthetic multi-modal data with known uncertainty levels

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the Hölder exponent (α) specifically affect the performance of the HDMVL model across different datasets and scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the highest accuracy in the fusion mode occurs when the Hölder exponent is 1.7, but deviating from this value leads to a decline in fusion mode accuracy.
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides some insights into the impact of the Hölder exponent, it does not fully explore the underlying reasons for this optimal value or how it might vary across different datasets and scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Further experiments testing a wider range of Hölder exponents on various datasets and scenarios, along with an analysis of the underlying mechanisms, would provide more comprehensive insights into the optimal Hölder exponent for different contexts.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the HDMVL model be extended to handle more than two modalities effectively, and what are the potential challenges and limitations?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on multi-view learning with two modalities (RGB and depth), but does not explicitly discuss the model's performance or limitations when handling more than two modalities.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide evidence or analysis of the model's performance when dealing with more than two modalities, leaving questions about its scalability and effectiveness in such scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing the HDMVL model on datasets with more than two modalities, along with an analysis of its performance and limitations in such scenarios, would provide insights into its scalability and effectiveness.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the HDMVL model compare to other uncertainty quantification methods in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy, especially in real-time applications?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the HDMVL model offers reliable predictions with negligible extra computational overheads, but does not provide a detailed comparison with other uncertainty quantification methods in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy.
- Why unresolved: While the paper suggests that the HDMVL model is computationally efficient, it does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other methods to validate this claim or explore its potential limitations in real-time applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed comparative study of the HDMVL model with other uncertainty quantification methods, focusing on computational efficiency and accuracy, especially in real-time applications, would provide valuable insights into its strengths and limitations.

## Limitations
- Theoretical grounding of Hölder Divergence for multi-view learning remains relatively underdeveloped
- Assumes complete independence between modality-specific uncertainties via Dempster-Shafer theory
- Evaluation focuses primarily on classification accuracy without extensive ablation studies
- Limited exploration of Hölder exponent sensitivity across different datasets and scenarios

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Empirical results showing improved accuracy over baseline methods
- **Medium Confidence**: Claim that HD better measures distance between real and predictive distributions
- **Medium Confidence**: Robustness to noisy data claim is supported but could benefit from more systematic experiments

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies systematically removing Hölder Divergence, Dempster-Shafer integration, and parallel branch architecture to quantify each component's contribution to overall performance.

2. Extend evaluation to include uncertainty calibration metrics (e.g., expected calibration error, reliability diagrams) to verify that the model's uncertainty estimates are well-calibrated, not just high-performing.

3. Test the method on datasets with known modality correlations to evaluate whether the independence assumption in Dempster-Shafer integration introduces significant errors, and explore alternative uncertainty fusion methods that account for modality dependencies.
