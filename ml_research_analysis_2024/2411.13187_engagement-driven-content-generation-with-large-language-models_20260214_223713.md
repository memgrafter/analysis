# Engagement-Driven Content Generation with Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.13187
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13187
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: LLM-generated content can maximize social network engagement by adapting to network opinion distributions, achieving levels comparable to real content.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether Large Language Models can generate content that maximizes user engagement on social networks. The authors propose a reinforcement learning framework where LLM-generated content is evaluated using a propagation model that simulates how opinions spread through a network based on users' opinions and a bounded confidence threshold. Experiments on both synthetic and real social networks show that the LLM learns to adapt the sentiment of its content to the network's opinion distribution, achieving engagement levels comparable to real content.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a reinforcement learning framework with simulated feedback where an LLM is fine-tuned to generate content that maximizes user engagement on social networks. The approach uses Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to train the LLM, with rewards based on a geometric mean of readability scores and engagement size. Content is evaluated using a bounded confidence propagation model that simulates how opinions spread through a network based on users' opinions and a confidence threshold. The framework is trained iteratively until convergence or a KL-divergence threshold is reached.

## Key Results
- LLM-generated content achieves engagement levels comparable to real content on both synthetic and real social networks
- The LLM learns to adapt content sentiment to match the network's opinion distribution
- Framework demonstrates engagement optimization while maintaining readability and topic alignment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by simulating social dynamics through a bounded confidence model where content propagates through networks based on opinion similarity. The LLM receives feedback on engagement outcomes and adjusts its content generation strategy accordingly. By optimizing for the geometric mean of readability and engagement, the model balances content quality with its ability to engage users, while sentiment analysis ensures alignment with network opinions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Bounded Confidence Model**: A social dynamics model where individuals adopt opinions similar to their neighbors within a confidence threshold. Needed to simulate realistic opinion propagation and engagement dynamics.
- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: A reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes policies while maintaining stability through clipped probability ratios. Needed for efficient fine-tuning of LLMs with simulated feedback.
- **Geometric Mean Reward**: A composite reward function combining multiple objectives (readability and engagement) multiplicatively. Needed to balance competing objectives in content generation.
- **Sentiment Analysis with DistilBERT**: A lightweight transformer model for determining text sentiment. Needed to measure alignment between generated content and network opinions.
- **Flesch-Kincaid Readability**: A metric measuring text readability based on sentence and word complexity. Needed to ensure generated content maintains quality while maximizing engagement.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
LLM (query) -> Sentiment Analysis -> Readability Score -> Engagement Model -> Reward -> PPO Update -> LLM

**Critical Path**
1. LLM generates content from topic query
2. Content is evaluated for sentiment and readability
3. Engagement model simulates propagation through network
4. Reward is calculated and PPO updates LLM policy

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Simple bounded confidence model vs. more complex multi-dimensional opinion propagation
- Geometric mean reward vs. weighted sum for balancing objectives
- Sentiment analysis vs. direct opinion matching for alignment measurement

**Failure Signatures**
- Slow convergence or reward plateaus: indicates learning rate or exploration issues
- Generated content lacks readability: suggests reward weighting imbalance
- Poor sentiment alignment: indicates sentiment analysis model limitations or insufficient training

**3 First Experiments**
1. Verify reward signal behaves as expected by testing on a simple synthetic network
2. Check sentiment distribution alignment between LLM-generated and real content
3. Test sensitivity of engagement outcomes to bounded confidence threshold variations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the sentiment alignment between LLM-generated content and the underlying network's opinion distribution affect engagement levels across different network topologies?
- Basis in paper: The paper shows that LLM-generated content sentiment aligns with the network's opinion distribution and that this alignment affects engagement levels, but does not explore how different network topologies influence this relationship.
- Why unresolved: The experiments primarily focus on synthetic networks with controlled parameters and a single real-world network, leaving the generalizability across diverse network structures unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying network topologies (e.g., scale-free, small-world) while maintaining consistent opinion distributions and measuring engagement levels would clarify this relationship.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of prompt structure and task specification on the effectiveness of LLM-generated content for engagement maximization?
- Basis in paper: The authors note that they used query completion tasks and mention that alternative approaches like generation from scratch are possible, but defer a detailed study on prompt effects to future work.
- Why unresolved: The current experiments use a specific prompt format without exploring how different prompt structures or task specifications might influence content generation and engagement outcomes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments using various prompt structures (e.g., generation from scratch, multi-turn conversations) while measuring engagement levels would reveal the impact of prompt design.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do more sophisticated propagation models that account for multi-dimensional opinion axes affect the engagement optimization capabilities of LLMs?
- Basis in paper: The authors suggest that more sophisticated propagation models accounting for opinion differences along multiple axes could be considered for future research.
- Why unresolved: The current study uses a bounded confidence model with scalar opinions, which may oversimplify complex opinion dynamics in real social networks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments using multi-dimensional opinion propagation models and comparing engagement outcomes with the current scalar model would demonstrate the benefits of more complex opinion representations.

## Limitations
- Simplified bounded confidence model may not capture complex real-world social dynamics
- Missing implementation details (hyperparameters, network generation parameters) hinder exact reproduction
- Limited exploration of how network topology affects engagement optimization

## Confidence
- Theoretical framework soundness: High
- Methodological soundness: Medium
- Reproducibility: Medium
- Generalizability: Low

## Next Checks
1. Run a small-scale pilot with synthetic networks to verify the reward signal (geometric mean of readability and engagement) behaves as expected and drives sentiment alignment.
2. Compare sentiment distributions of LLM-generated vs. real content on a held-out set to confirm the model adapts to network opinion distributions.
3. Test the sensitivity of engagement outcomes to changes in the bounded confidence threshold ϵ to understand model robustness.
