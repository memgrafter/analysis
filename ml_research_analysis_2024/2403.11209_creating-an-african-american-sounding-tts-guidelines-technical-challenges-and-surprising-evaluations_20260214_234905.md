# Creating an African American-Sounding TTS: Guidelines, Technical Challenges,and Surprising Evaluations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.11209
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11209
- Authors: Claudio Pinhanez; Raul Fernandez; Marcelo Grave; Julio Nogima; Ron Hoory
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Developed African American-sounding TTS system; U.S. English speakers couldn't recognize it while African American professionals could

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the development of an African American-sounding text-to-speech (TTS) system to address diversity gaps in AI voices. The authors conducted focus groups with African American IT professionals to establish guidelines and select a voice talent, then created a TTS system using neural text-to-speech technologies with a professional African American woman's voice. The evaluation revealed a surprising discrepancy: U.S. English speakers were unable to recognize the African American TTS voice, while African American professionals could, suggesting potential misconceptions and prejudice among the broader U.S. English-speaking population.

## Method Summary
The development process began with focus groups of African American IT professionals to gather guidelines and select a voice talent. A professional African American woman's voice was recorded and used to create a neural TTS system. Two evaluation studies were conducted: one with a representative U.S. English-speaking audience and another with African American professionals. The evaluations aimed to assess whether listeners could identify the African American characteristics of the synthesized voice, though the paper lacks detailed information about evaluation protocols, sample sizes, and statistical methods.

## Key Results
- Developed neural TTS system using professional African American woman's voice
- U.S. English speakers unable to recognize African American characteristics of TTS voice
- African American professionals successfully identified African American characteristics
- Discrepancy suggests potential prejudice or misconceptions among U.S. English speakers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper does not provide detailed mechanism explanations for why the TTS system works or why the evaluation results showed such discrepancies.

## Foundational Learning

**Neural TTS Technologies**
- Why needed: Forms the technical foundation for voice synthesis
- Quick check: Can synthesize natural-sounding speech from text

**Voice Talent Selection**
- Why needed: Ensures authentic representation of target speech characteristics
- Quick check: Voice must reflect intended demographic characteristics

**Focus Group Methodology**
- Why needed: Gathers authentic input from target demographic
- Quick check: Participants represent intended user base

**Voice Recognition Testing**
- Why needed: Validates system achieves intended voice characteristics
- Quick check: Listeners can identify target demographic features

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Voice Recording -> Neural TTS Processing -> Evaluation Testing

Critical Path: Voice talent recording → Neural network training → System deployment → User evaluation

Design Tradeoffs: Single voice talent (authenticity vs. diversity), neural approach (quality vs. computational cost)

Failure Signatures: Inability to capture distinctive phonetic patterns, system misidentifying demographic characteristics

First Experiments:
1. Test basic TTS functionality with simple text inputs
2. Compare synthesized voice to original recordings
3. Conduct preliminary voice recognition tests with small user groups

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions but raises implicit questions about the role of prejudice in voice recognition and the broader implications of race-specific TTS systems.

## Limitations

- Limited evaluation methodology details and statistical validation
- Single voice talent may not represent full diversity of African American speech
- No comparative analysis with existing TTS systems
- Potential ethical concerns about creating race-specific voices not addressed

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| TTS system was successfully developed | High |
| Evaluation results show discrepancy between groups | Medium |
| Discrepancy due to prejudice | Low |
| System represents African American speech patterns | Medium |

## Next Checks

1. Conduct replication study with larger, more diverse sample sizes and standardized evaluation protocols
2. Implement blinded testing where evaluators are unaware of the study's racial focus
3. Test TTS system's performance across different contexts and tasks (reading comprehension, emotional expression, etc.)
