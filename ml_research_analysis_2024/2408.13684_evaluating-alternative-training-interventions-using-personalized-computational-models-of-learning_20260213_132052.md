# Evaluating Alternative Training Interventions Using Personalized Computational Models of Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.13684
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13684
- Reference count: 4
- The study demonstrates that personalized computational models significantly reduce prediction error compared to generic models and generate plausible counterfactual predictions for training interventions in fractions arithmetic learning.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach for evaluating training interventions using personalized computational models of learning. The authors use the Apprentice Learner Architecture to simulate student behavior and automatically tune these models to individual students using performance data via the HyperOpt toolkit. The approach successfully generates counterfactual predictions for how different student types (high vs. low performers) would respond to various interventions including blocked, interleaved, and a novel "faded" ordering. Results show personalized models achieve significantly lower prediction error than generic models, and the faded condition is predicted to produce faster learning and lower error rates compared to traditional practice methods.

## Method Summary
The method employs the Apprentice Learner Architecture, a computational cognitive model that simulates human learning and decision-making in fractions arithmetic. HyperOpt is used to automatically tune model parameters and skills (representing prior knowledge) to individual students by minimizing prediction error on their first ten problems. Once personalized, these models simulate student behavior under counterfactual conditions (different problem orderings) to predict learning outcomes. The approach is evaluated using data from 118 sixth-grade students learning fractions arithmetic with blocked and interleaved practice, and generates predictions for a novel faded condition.

## Key Results
- Personalized models reduce prediction error by 50-75% compared to generic models on both seen and unseen data (Figures 4a and 4b)
- The faded condition is predicted to produce faster learning and lower error rates than blocked or interleaved practice
- Low-performing students are predicted to benefit more from the faded condition than high-performing students

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Personalized computational models reduce prediction error compared to generic models by tuning prior knowledge and cognitive parameters to individual students.
- Mechanism: HyperOpt iteratively samples combinations of skills (representing prior knowledge) and parameters (e.g., exploration rate, learning rate) to construct Apprentice Learner agents. Each agent is evaluated by simulating the target student's behavior on their first ten tutor problems. The error between the agent's predictions and the actual student performance is used to update HyperOpt's sampling distribution via Bayesian inference, converging toward configurations that minimize prediction error.
- Core assumption: Student differences in prior knowledge and cognitive parameters significantly impact learning trajectories, and these differences can be captured by adjusting the agent's initial skill set and parameters.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We present an approach for automatically tuning models to specific individuals and show that personalized models make better predictions of students' behavior than generic ones."
  - [section] "We find that tuning also yields better predictions on unseen data that were not used for that purpose." (Section 5.2)
  - [corpus] Weak - No direct evidence in corpus about hyperparameter tuning for learning models; only general mentions of model evaluation.
- Break condition: If student differences are not meaningfully captured by the skill and parameter space, or if the simulation environment does not accurately reflect real student behavior.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Computational models can generate plausible counterfactual predictions for interventions without human data by simulating learning under different problem orderings.
- Mechanism: Once a personalized agent is tuned to a student, it can simulate the student's behavior under counterfactual conditions (e.g., different problem orderings) by applying the same learning mechanisms to new sequences of problems. The agent's skill execution and learning components update based on the simulated feedback, generating learning curves for the counterfactual condition.
- Core assumption: The Apprentice Learner architecture's mechanistic model of learning (skill matching, execution, explanation, and Q-learning) can generalize to predict behavior under novel conditions, even without human data for those conditions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our approach makes predictions that align with previous human findings, as well as testable predictions that might be evaluated with future human experiments."
  - [section] "They also provide a picture of how low and high performers would respond differently to these interventions." (Section 6.2)
  - [corpus] Weak - No direct evidence in corpus about counterfactual prediction in learning models; only general mentions of intervention evaluation.
- Break condition: If the learning mechanisms do not generalize to novel conditions, or if the simulation environment does not accurately represent the new intervention.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Personalized models can support instructional designers in selecting optimal interventions by predicting differential effects for different student types (e.g., high vs. low performers).
- Mechanism: By constructing personalized models for different student types and simulating their behavior under various interventions, designers can compare predicted learning outcomes and select interventions that are predicted to be most effective for each student type. The model's predictions can reveal interactions between student characteristics and intervention effectiveness.
- Core assumption: Different student types (e.g., high vs. low performers) have meaningfully different learning characteristics that can be captured by personalized models, and these differences lead to differential responses to interventions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Designers can use these agents to generate plausible counterfactual predictions for how individuals will respond to different interventions."
  - [section] "In particular, our study suggests that which intervention the high performer receives matters little due to their ample prior fractions knowledge. However, the low performer improves in all three conditions, but seems to improve the most in the faded condition." (Section 6.2)
  - [corpus] Weak - No direct evidence in corpus about personalized intervention selection; only general mentions of model evaluation.
- Break condition: If student types do not have meaningfully different learning characteristics, or if the model's predictions do not accurately reflect real student responses to interventions.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Bayesian inference and optimization
  - Why needed here: HyperOpt uses Bayesian inference to update its sampling distribution based on prediction error, guiding the search for optimal skill and parameter configurations.
  - Quick check question: How does Bayesian inference help HyperOpt focus its search on more promising configurations?

- Concept: Reinforcement learning (Q-learning)
  - Why needed here: The Apprentice Learner agents use Q-learning to update the expected value function associated with each skill based on feedback, allowing them to learn which skills are most effective in different situations.
  - Quick check question: How does Q-learning enable the agents to improve their performance over time?

- Concept: Computational cognitive modeling
  - Why needed here: The Apprentice Learner architecture provides a mechanistic model of human learning and decision-making, allowing it to simulate student behavior and generate predictions for novel interventions.
  - Quick check question: How does the Apprentice Learner architecture differ from abstract knowledge tracing models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Apprentice Learner Architecture -> HyperOpt tuning -> Fraction Arithmetic Tutor simulation -> DataShop data
- Critical path:
  1. Load human performance data from DataShop
  2. Initialize HyperOpt with skill and parameter space
  3. Iteratively sample configurations, simulate behavior, and evaluate error
  4. Construct personalized agents for target students
  5. Simulate counterfactual interventions using personalized agents
  6. Analyze and compare predicted learning outcomes
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Explicit vs. implicit model tuning: Explicit tuning (this work) generates interpretable prior knowledge but requires specifying the knowledge space; implicit tuning (e.g., pretraining) estimates prior practice but lacks interpretability.
  - Generic vs. personalized models: Generic models are simpler but less accurate; personalized models are more accurate but require individual data for tuning.
  - Simulation vs. human experiments: Simulations are faster and cheaper but less certain; human experiments are more certain but slower and more expensive.
- Failure signatures:
  - High prediction error even after tuning: Suggests the skill and parameter space does not capture student differences, or the simulation environment is inaccurate.
  - Counterfactual predictions that contradict known learning principles: Suggests the learning mechanisms do not generalize to novel conditions.
  - No difference in predicted outcomes between interventions: Suggests the model does not capture the differential effects of interventions on different student types.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Tune a generic Apprentice Learner agent to a high-performing student and compare its prediction error to the baseline (whole number arithmetic, default parameters).
  2. Simulate the high-performing student's behavior under the blocked and interleaved conditions using the personalized agent and compare the predicted learning curves to the observed data.
  3. Construct personalized models for a low-performing student and a high-performing student, then simulate their behavior under the faded condition and compare the predicted outcomes.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can computational models of learning be extended to account for learning phenomena beyond fraction arithmetic, such as the testing effect or learning in educational games?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that future work should explore how the approach applies to other settings like educational games and how to model learning phenomena such as the testing effect.
- Why unresolved: The current framework focuses on step-based interactions and immediate feedback, which are not typical of many educational games or scenarios where the testing effect occurs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful application of the model to predict learning in diverse educational contexts, demonstrating its ability to handle delayed feedback and continuous-time interactions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the model tuning process be made more accessible to instructional designers without technical expertise?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper suggests collaborating with end users to design interfaces that do not require technical expertise, indicating a need for more accessible model tuning.
- Why unresolved: The current process involves complex steps that may be challenging for non-technical users to navigate and automate.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of user-friendly interfaces and tools that allow instructional designers to easily input data and receive model predictions without needing to understand the underlying technical details.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the model be used to automatically search the space of training interventions to find optimal problem orderings for learning?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions exploring approaches that support instructional designers by automatically searching the space of training interventions, such as problem orderings.
- Why unresolved: The paper discusses the potential for such automation but does not provide a concrete method or evidence of its effectiveness.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstration of the model's ability to efficiently explore and identify effective training interventions, validated through human studies or simulations.

## Limitations
- The tuning process relies on limited early performance data (first 10 problems), which may not fully characterize individual differences
- Counterfactual predictions, while promising, lack validation against actual human experiments under the novel faded condition
- The Apprentice Learner Architecture's skill representation may not capture all relevant aspects of student knowledge, potentially limiting generalizability to other domains

## Confidence
- Personalized model prediction accuracy (High): Strong empirical evidence shows significant error reduction on both seen and unseen data.
- Counterfactual prediction plausibility (Medium): Predictions align with known learning principles and generate reasonable expectations, but lack experimental validation.
- Faded condition superiority (Low): Predictions suggest benefits, but no human data exists to confirm these outcomes.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human experiments testing the faded condition predictions, comparing learning outcomes to blocked and interleaved practice across different student performance levels.
2. Test model generalizability by applying the personalized tuning approach to a different mathematical domain (e.g., algebra or geometry) and evaluating prediction accuracy.
3. Perform ablation studies removing specific learning mechanisms (e.g., Q-learning, skill matching) to determine which components contribute most to prediction accuracy and identify potential overfitting.
