# S$^2$DN: Learning to Denoise Unconvincing Knowledge for Inductive Knowledge Graph Completion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.15822
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15822
- Authors: Tengfei Ma; Yujie Chen; Liang Wang; Xuan Lin; Bosheng Song; Xiangxiang Zeng
- Reference count: 35
- Key outcome: S2DN achieves state-of-the-art performance on inductive knowledge graph completion, with Hits@10 scores reaching up to 87.64% on WN18RR.

## Executive Summary
Inductive knowledge graph completion (KGC) faces challenges with semantic inconsistencies and unreliable interactions in newly emerged entities. S$^2$DN introduces a semantic smoothing module to unify similar relations and a structure refining module to filter unreliable edges. By integrating general semantics and reliable structure, S$^2$DN denoises unconvincing knowledge from a semantic-structure synergy perspective. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that S$^2$DN significantly outperforms existing rule-based and GNN-based methods.

## Method Summary
S$^2$DN addresses inductive KGC by learning to denoise unconvincing knowledge through semantic smoothing and structure refining. The method extracts enclosing subgraphs around target links and applies a trainable Gumbel-Softmax strategy to blur similar relations, ensuring consistent semantic representation. Simultaneously, it dynamically filters unreliable edges based on learned node features and task feedback. The approach combines RGNN and GNN models to capture global semantic and structural representations, which are then classified using an MLP to predict interaction probabilities.

## Key Results
- S2DN achieves state-of-the-art performance on WN18RR, FB15k-237, and NELL-995 datasets
- Hits@10 scores reach up to 87.64% on WN18RR, significantly outperforming baseline methods
- The method demonstrates robustness to various noise ratios (0%, 15%, 35%, 50%) in contaminated KGs
- Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of both semantic smoothing and structure refining modules

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Semantic smoothing reduces inconsistencies in similar relations by mapping them into a unified representation space.
- **Mechanism:** The semantic smoothing module uses a trainable Gumbel-Softmax strategy to blur similar relations, enabling relations with the same semantics to be categorized into consistent representation space. This reduces noise caused by semantic inconsistency during inductive subgraph reasoning.
- **Core assumption:** Relations with similar semantics can be effectively identified and mapped to consistent representations without losing task-relevant information.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "we introduce a semantic smoothing module over the enclosing subgraphs to retain the universal semantic knowledge of relations."
  - [section] "Drawing inspiration from the successful application of smoothing technologies in image denoising...we have developed a semantic smoothing module to generalize similar relations with blurred semantics."
  - [corpus] Weak. No direct mention of semantic smoothing or relation consistency in neighbor papers.
- **Break condition:** If relations cannot be reliably identified as semantically similar, the smoothing process may blur distinct semantic information, leading to incorrect predictions.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Structure refining dynamically filters out unreliable interactions and incorporates additional knowledge to improve the reliability of the subgraph structure.
- **Mechanism:** The structure refining module assigns weights to edges based on learned node features and downstream task feedback. It removes low-weight edges (likely noisy) while retaining reliable connections, enhancing the quality of the subgraph for inductive reasoning.
- **Core assumption:** Nodes with similar features or structures are more likely to interact with each other, and unreliable edges can be identified and filtered out based on learned weights.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "We incorporate a structure refining module to filter out unreliable interactions and offer additional knowledge, retaining robust structure surrounding target links."
  - [section] "To improve the precise estimation of noisy interactions within KGs, we propose a structure refining module...This module dynamically adapts the reliable subgraph structure based on both node features and feedback from downstream tasks."
  - [corpus] Weak. No direct mention of structure refining or edge reliability in neighbor papers.
- **Break condition:** If the reliability estimation function fails to accurately identify noisy edges, the refined subgraph may still contain irrelevant or misleading information.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** The semantic smoothing and structure refining modules work synergistically to preserve semantic consistency and enhance structural reliability, leading to improved inductive KGC performance.
- **Mechanism:** The semantic smoothing module ensures consistent relation representations, while the structure refining module provides a reliable subgraph structure. These modules work together to denoise unconvincing knowledge and improve the quality of the enclosing subgraph for inductive reasoning.
- **Core assumption:** The combination of semantic consistency and structural reliability is more effective for inductive KGC than either approach alone.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "By integrating general semantics and reliable structure, S 2DN denoise unconvincing knowledge from a semantic-structure synergy perspective."
  - [section] "To address these challenges, we introduce S 2DN, a semantic structure-aware denoising network designed to maintain consistent semantics and filter out noisy interactions, thereby enhancing robustness in inductive KGC."
  - [corpus] Weak. No direct mention of synergy between semantic smoothing and structure refining in neighbor papers.
- **Break condition:** If one module's output negatively impacts the other, the synergy may break down, leading to suboptimal performance.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
  - Why needed here: GNNs are used to model the enclosing subgraphs and capture the global semantic and structural representations of the knowledge graph.
  - Quick check question: What is the key advantage of using GNNs for modeling graph-structured data in the context of knowledge graph completion?

- **Concept:** Information Bottleneck Principle
  - Why needed here: The information bottleneck principle is used to justify the semantic smoothing process, ensuring that the smoothed relation embeddings preserve task-relevant information while minimizing task-independent noise.
  - Quick check question: How does the information bottleneck principle guide the design of the semantic smoothing module in S2DN?

- **Concept:** Subgraph Extraction
  - Why needed here: Enclosing subgraphs are extracted to capture the local context around the target link, providing the necessary information for inductive reasoning on emerging entities.
  - Quick check question: Why is extracting enclosing subgraphs crucial for inductive knowledge graph completion, and how does it differ from transductive approaches?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Knowledge graph (G) -> Enclosing subgraph extraction -> Semantic smoothing -> Structure refining -> RGNN modeling -> GNN modeling -> MLP classifier -> Interaction probability

- **Critical path:**
  1. Extract enclosing subgraph g surrounding target link (u, r, v)
  2. Apply semantic smoothing to relations within g
  3. Refine structure of g to remove unreliable edges
  4. Model smoothed and refined subgraphs using RGNN and GNN
  5. Combine representations and classify using MLP
  6. Output interaction probability

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Subgraph size (k): Larger subgraphs provide more context but may introduce noise; smaller subgraphs are faster but may lack information
  - Embedding dimension: Higher dimensions capture more information but increase computational cost
  - Reliability estimation function: Different functions (e.g., Attention, MLP) have varying effectiveness in identifying reliable edges

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Performance degradation on noisy KGs: Indicates structure refining module may not be effectively filtering out noise
  - Inconsistent performance across datasets: Suggests semantic smoothing may not be generalizing well to different relation semantics
  - High computational cost: May indicate need to optimize subgraph size or embedding dimension

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Ablation study:** Remove semantic smoothing module and evaluate performance drop to assess its contribution
  2. **Noise robustness test:** Evaluate performance on KGs with varying levels of semantic and structural noise
  3. **Hyperparameter sensitivity:** Vary learning rate, batch size, and subgraph size to identify optimal configurations for different datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does S2DN's performance scale with increasingly large knowledge graphs that have higher average node degrees?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses computational efficiency, noting that S2DN's efficiency depends mainly on subgraph size, average degree of KGs, and embedding dimension. It mentions that S2DN can be scaled to large-scale KGs with small node degrees.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide empirical evidence or experiments on KGs with high average node degrees, leaving the question of scalability open.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments on KGs with varying average node degrees and reporting performance metrics would provide insights into S2DN's scalability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can S2DN's semantic smoothing module be adapted to handle multi-modal knowledge graphs that include images, text, and other data types?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper focuses on semantic inconsistencies in KGs, suggesting that the semantic smoothing module is designed to handle semantic inconsistencies of similar relations.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the application of S2DN to multi-modal knowledge graphs, leaving the adaptability of the semantic smoothing module to other data types untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extending S2DN to incorporate multi-modal data and evaluating its performance on such datasets would determine its adaptability.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of reliability estimation function (e.g., Attention, MLP, Weighted Cosine, Cosine) impact S2DN's performance on different types of knowledge graphs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper conducts experiments to investigate the impact of different reliability estimation functions, showing that Attention achieves the best performance across all datasets.
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides insights into the impact of reliability estimation functions, it does not explore how these functions perform on various types of knowledge graphs beyond the tested datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments on diverse types of knowledge graphs with different reliability estimation functions would clarify their impact on performance.

## Limitations
- The semantic smoothing module relies on the assumption that semantically similar relations can be reliably identified and mapped to consistent representations.
- The structure refining module's effectiveness depends on the accuracy of the reliability estimation function.
- The synergy between semantic smoothing and structure refining is claimed to improve performance, but the exact nature of their interaction is not fully explored.
