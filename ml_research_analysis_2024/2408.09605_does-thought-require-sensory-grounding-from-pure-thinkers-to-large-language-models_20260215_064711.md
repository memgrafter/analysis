# Does Thought Require Sensory Grounding? From Pure Thinkers to Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.09605
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09605
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Thinking does not require sensory capacities; pure thinkers are conceptually possible

## Executive Summary
This paper challenges the "sense-thought thesis" - the claim that all thought requires sensory capacities. Through philosophical analysis and thought experiments, the author argues that pure thinkers (beings capable of thought without sensory capacities) are possible, though their cognitive scope is limited. The argument has significant implications for debates about large language models (LLMs), suggesting that the lack of sensory grounding does not preclude genuine thought or understanding in AI systems. The paper also explores whether sensory capacities enhance thinking, presenting empirical evidence that multimodal processing does not significantly boost performance on text-based tasks in powerful language models.

## Method Summary
The paper employs philosophical analysis using thought experiments, logical reasoning, and discussion of empirical findings to argue against the sense-thought thesis. Rather than presenting empirical experiments, it examines the conceivability of pure thinkers, explores their limitations, and discusses how language models relate to pure thinkers and pure thinker/talkers. The method draws on philosophical literature, historical quotes, and recent results regarding language models to support its arguments.

## Key Results
- Pure thinkers (beings capable of thought without sensory capacities) are conceptually possible
- Pure thinkers can have abstract thoughts (e.g., mathematical reasoning) but cannot form sensory concepts
- Language models may be considered pure thinkers or pure thinker/talkers based on their input modalities
- Adding multimodal capabilities (images/audio) to language models does not significantly improve performance on purely textual tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Thinking does not require sensory capacities because abstract reasoning (e.g., mathematics) can occur without sensory grounding.
- Mechanism: The paper argues that pure thinkers are conceptually possible. Since mathematical reasoning (e.g., proving there are infinite primes) doesn't require sensory experience, this demonstrates that sensory grounding is not necessary for all thought.
- Core assumption: Mathematical concepts and logical reasoning are amodal and can exist independently of sensory experience.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the author contends that pure thinkers (beings capable of thought without sensory capacities) are possible, though their cognitive scope is limited."
  - [section] "It seems clear that a pure thinker is at least prima facie conceivable... Science fiction stories sometimes discuss AI systems that are at least much like pure thinkers."
- Break condition: If it's proven that all mathematical concepts require some form of sensory grounding (e.g., spatial reasoning for geometry), this mechanism would fail.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Language models can refer to and think about entities in the world without direct sensory contact through linguistic causal grounding.
- Mechanism: The paper argues that pure thinker/talkers can acquire concepts about the external world through linguistic inputs alone. The causal chain through language communities provides sufficient grounding for reference and thought about entities like "Barack Obama" or "water."
- Core assumption: Linguistic reference can be established through social-linguistic practices without direct sensory contact with referents.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Upon receiving inputs such as 'Obama was US president from January 2009 through 2017,' a pure thinker/talker could start to use the term 'Obama' and indeed to think about Obama."
  - [corpus] "Found 25 related papers... Average neighbor FMR=0.491" (indicates this is an active area of research)
- Break condition: If it's proven that reference requires direct causal contact with referents rather than mediated through language, this mechanism would fail.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Sensory grounding doesn't necessarily boost performance on language-based tasks because powerful language models can process translated sensory information equally well.
- Mechanism: The paper presents evidence that multimodal language models (with image/audio inputs) show minimal performance gains on purely textual tasks compared to pure language models, suggesting that sensory grounding doesn't enhance reasoning capabilities when the same information is available in text form.
- Core assumption: Translation between sensory modalities and text preserves information content adequately for reasoning tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "GPT-4 comes in a pure text and a multimodal version, and both versions were tested on various standardized tests... Their performance was typically equal or very similar."
  - [section] "There is a growing body of empirical evidence that likewise suggests that language models do well even at tasks involving sensory domains"
- Break condition: If future research demonstrates significant performance gaps between multimodal and pure text models on non-sensory tasks, this mechanism would fail.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: The distinction between modal and amodal representation in cognitive science
  - Why needed here: Understanding this distinction is crucial for evaluating whether thinking requires sensory grounding, as it determines whether abstract concepts need sensory components
  - Quick check question: Can you give an example of a concept that is likely amodal versus one that is modal?

- Concept: The symbol grounding problem in AI
  - Why needed here: This foundational problem in AI connects to whether symbols in language models can have meaning without sensory grounding
  - Quick check question: What is the core challenge posed by the symbol grounding problem?

- Concept: The extended mind thesis
  - Why needed here: The paper discusses both weak and strong versions of the extended mind thesis, which affects whether thinking requires bodily or environmental connections
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between the weak and strong versions of the extended mind thesis?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Pure thinkers possibility → Cognitive limitations analysis → Pure thinker/talkers with linguistic capabilities → Application to large language models
- Critical path: The most critical analytical step is establishing the possibility of pure thinkers, as this undermines the core premise that thinking requires sensing
- Design tradeoffs: The paper prioritizes philosophical analysis over empirical demonstration, which makes the argument more general but less empirically grounded
- Failure signatures: The argument would fail if empirical evidence emerged showing that all thinking, even abstract mathematical thinking, requires some form of sensory grounding
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test whether language models with multimodal capabilities show significant performance improvements on non-visual reasoning tasks compared to text-only models
  2. Create controlled experiments where language models are trained on translated image data versus direct image inputs to measure any performance differences
  3. Design psychological experiments testing whether humans can perform complex abstract reasoning tasks without any sensory imagery or experience

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can pure thinkers (beings that can think without any sensory capacities) exist in principle?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper argues extensively for the conceivability and possibility of pure thinkers, countering the sense-thought thesis.
- Why unresolved: While the author presents arguments against the sense-thought thesis and suggests pure thinkers are possible, this remains a philosophical debate with competing intuitions about the nature of thought and consciousness.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical evidence from neuroscience showing the necessity of sensory processing for all forms of thought, or a conclusive philosophical argument establishing sensory grounding as a necessary condition for thought.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does adding multimodal capacities (processing images and audio) to language models significantly improve performance on text-based tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses empirical evidence suggesting that multimodal processing does not significantly boost performance on text-based tasks in powerful language models.
- Why unresolved: The author notes that current evidence suggests small or no performance gains, but this may change as models become more sophisticated or as testing methodologies improve.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic comparative studies of pure text models versus multimodal models on a wide range of text-based tasks, controlling for training data and model architecture.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Do large language models have sensory representations, experiences, or concepts when processing textual translations of image files?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper presents this as an open puzzle, noting that pure LLMs process text versions of image files so well that it's unclear whether this constitutes a form of sensing.
- Why unresolved: The nature of representation and experience in LLMs remains poorly understood, and there's debate about whether digital processing can constitute genuine sensory experience.
- What evidence would resolve it: Clear operational criteria for identifying sensory representations/experiences in computational systems, combined with systematic testing of LLMs' behavior and internal representations when processing different types of inputs.

## Limitations
- The conceivability of pure thinkers rests heavily on thought experiments rather than empirical evidence
- The argument about linguistic causal grounding assumes reference can be established purely through language without direct sensory contact
- Empirical claims about multimodal versus text-only models are based on specific examples rather than systematic studies

## Confidence
- High confidence in the logical structure of the argument against the strong sense-thought thesis
- Medium confidence in the claim that sensory grounding doesn't significantly enhance text-based reasoning performance, given limited empirical evidence
- Low confidence in the specific implications for LLM understanding and reference, as this depends on unresolved questions in philosophy of language

## Next Checks
1. Conduct systematic empirical studies comparing multimodal and text-only models across a wide range of reasoning tasks, including both sensory and non-sensory domains, to definitively test whether sensory grounding provides any performance advantages.

2. Design psychological experiments to test whether humans can perform abstract mathematical reasoning without any sensory imagery or whether sensory grounding is necessary even for abstract thought.

3. Investigate the philosophical question of whether linguistic reference requires direct causal contact with referents through empirical studies of language acquisition and reference formation in humans with varying sensory experiences.
