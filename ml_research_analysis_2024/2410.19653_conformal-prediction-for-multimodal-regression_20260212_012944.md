# Conformal Prediction for Multimodal Regression

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.19653
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19653
- Authors: Alexis Bose; Jonathan Ethier; Paul Guinand
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: CP can be extended to multimodal regression tasks using internal neural network features, with comparable performance to external numerical features

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a novel approach to extend conformal prediction (CP) to multimodal regression tasks by leveraging internal features from neural network architectures that process multimodal inputs. The method addresses the challenge of applying traditional CP methods to heterogeneous input features in regression problems. The approach was evaluated on two multimodal regression tasks: predicting RSRP using satellite imagery and path loss estimates, and predicting Airbnb rental prices using tabular data and text descriptions. Results demonstrate that CP can effectively use internal features to generate prediction intervals for both image-only and text-only regression tasks.

## Method Summary
The authors propose using internal features extracted from neural networks that process multimodal inputs as input features for conformal prediction. This approach leverages the learned representations within neural network layers to construct prediction intervals for regression tasks involving heterogeneous data types. The method involves training neural networks on multimodal data, extracting internal features from various layers, and then applying conformal prediction algorithms to these features to generate calibrated prediction intervals. The approach is evaluated on two multimodal regression tasks involving satellite imagery with path loss estimates and tabular data with text descriptions.

## Key Results
- CP effectively generates prediction intervals for multimodal regression tasks using internal neural network features
- Internal features provide comparable performance to external numerical features in some cases
- The approach works for both image-only and text-only regression tasks within multimodal architectures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging the learned representations within neural network architectures that process multimodal inputs. These internal features capture complex patterns and relationships in the data that are difficult to extract through traditional feature engineering. By using these representations as inputs to conformal prediction algorithms, the method can generate calibrated prediction intervals that account for the uncertainty in both the neural network's predictions and the underlying data distribution. The approach effectively bridges the gap between deep learning representations and uncertainty quantification in regression tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- **Conformal Prediction**: A framework for uncertainty quantification that generates calibrated prediction intervals; needed for quantifying uncertainty in regression tasks, quick check: verify coverage probability matches desired confidence level
- **Multimodal Learning**: Training models on heterogeneous data types (images, text, tabular data); needed to handle real-world data diversity, quick check: ensure proper alignment and fusion of different modalities
- **Neural Network Internal Features**: Learned representations from intermediate layers of neural networks; needed to capture complex patterns in multimodal data, quick check: verify feature quality through downstream task performance
- **Prediction Intervals**: Range estimates that quantify uncertainty in regression predictions; needed for risk-aware decision making, quick check: validate interval width and coverage across different data subsets
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Methods for estimating and representing uncertainty in model predictions; needed for reliable and trustworthy AI systems, quick check: compare calibration across different uncertainty quantification methods

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Neural Network (multimodal input processing) -> Internal Feature Extraction (intermediate layers) -> Conformal Prediction (interval generation) -> Prediction Output

**Critical Path**: Multimodal input → Neural network forward pass → Internal feature extraction → Conformal prediction algorithm → Prediction intervals

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Internal features vs external features: Internal features capture learned representations but may be less interpretable; external features are more interpretable but may miss complex patterns
- Feature extraction depth: Earlier layers capture more general features while deeper layers capture task-specific features
- Computational cost: Extracting internal features adds overhead to prediction time

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Undercoverage: Prediction intervals fail to contain true values at the expected rate
- Overly wide intervals: Internal features fail to capture sufficient information, leading to conservative uncertainty estimates
- Mode collapse: Internal features fail to distinguish between different data modes, leading to poor calibration

**First Experiments**:
1. Compare prediction interval coverage rates between internal and external features on validation data
2. Analyze interval width distribution across different data regions and feature types
3. Evaluate computational overhead of internal feature extraction versus traditional CP approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation was conducted on only two specific multimodal regression tasks, limiting generalizability
- Internal features did not consistently outperform external numerical features, suggesting optimal feature selection remains unclear
- Computational efficiency concerns when extracting and processing internal features from large neural networks were not addressed

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: CP can be applied to multimodal regression tasks using internal neural network features
- **Medium confidence**: Internal features provide comparable performance to external features in some cases
- **Low confidence**: Internal features will consistently outperform traditional feature engineering approaches

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the method across a broader range of multimodal regression tasks (e.g., healthcare, autonomous driving, multimodal sentiment analysis) to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing different internal feature extraction strategies (intermediate layers, attention mechanisms, multimodal fusion points) to identify optimal configurations
3. Perform computational efficiency analysis measuring the overhead of internal feature extraction versus traditional conformal prediction approaches
