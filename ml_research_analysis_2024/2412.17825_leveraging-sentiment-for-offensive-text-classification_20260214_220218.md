# Leveraging Sentiment for Offensive Text Classification

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.17825
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17825
- Reference count: 28
- Primary result: Sentiment prepending improves offensive text classification F1 by 0.28 on OLID dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether incorporating predicted sentiment improves offensive text classification performance. The authors augment the OLID dataset by prepending sentiment predictions (neutral, negative, positive) generated using DeBERTa-v3-small-ft-senti to each tweet. They compare multiple models—lexical features (TF-IDF + SVM), LSTM/Bi-LSTM, and DeBERTa/DeBERTa-v3—on both the original OLID and the augmented PPS-OLID datasets. The best baseline, DeBERTa, achieves 82.28 F1 on OLID. After augmentation, DeBERTa+PPS reaches 82.56 F1, a modest but consistent gain driven by improved precision (up 0.24) despite slightly lower recall. Error analysis shows the improvement mainly benefits non-offensive (NOT) label detection, while negative sentiment helps predict NOT instances better than neutral. The study concludes that sentiment prepending can enhance offensive text classification, though further experiments on larger datasets are needed.

## Method Summary
The study preprocesses OLID tweets (lowercasing, replacing @User, removing # symbols, removing repeated characters), predicts sentiment using DeBERTa-v3-small-ft-senti, and prepends sentiment labels to create PPS-OLID. Five models are trained and evaluated: TF-IDF+SVM, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, DeBERTa, and DeBERTa-v3 on both datasets. The best performing model (DeBERTa) is then trained on PPS-OLID and compared against its baseline performance on OLID using macro-averaged F1, precision, and recall metrics.

## Key Results
- DeBERTa+PPS achieves 82.56 F1 on OLID (up from 82.28 baseline)
- Precision improves by 0.24 while recall decreases slightly
- Negative sentiment helps predict NOT labels better than neutral sentiment
- Error analysis shows true positives increase for NOT labels with PPS augmentation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Prepending predicted sentiment helps the model focus on relevant linguistic cues for offensive language detection.
- Mechanism: The sentiment token acts as a conditioning signal, priming the model to expect certain emotional or aggressive patterns in the text, which aids in distinguishing offensive from non-offensive content.
- Core assumption: Sentiment prediction is sufficiently accurate to provide useful prior context for classification.
- Evidence anchors:
  - Results show that utilizing sentiment increases the overall performance of the model.
  - Among the transformer models, we notice an increase in score across precision, recall, and F1 on the DeBERTa model. However, with DeBERTa v3 the performance on all three metrics drops, especially of the F1-score by 1.06.
  - Weak: No direct sentiment-accuracy correlation found in neighbors.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The sentiment feature improves precision more than recall, suggesting it reduces false positives in offensive classification.
- Mechanism: Neutral sentiment prepending helps the model recognize non-offensive texts that might otherwise be misclassified as offensive, thereby improving precision.
- Core assumption: Most non-offensive texts have neutral sentiment, and this correlation is strong enough to guide classification.
- Evidence anchors:
  - Figure 3 shows which sentiment helped better identify OFF and NOT labels on DeBERTa+PPS model compared to the DeBERTa model. Notice that the Negative sentiment helps better predict the NOT instances instead of the expected Neutral sentiment.
  - We find that leveraging sentiment indeed increased the DeBERTa model by 0.28 F1-score. Even though there is a drop in recall, we also notice an increase in precision by 0.24.
  - Weak: Neighbors do not discuss precision-recall trade-offs tied to sentiment.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The augmentation of sentiment tokens improves the model's robustness by providing additional context for ambiguous tweets.
- Mechanism: Tweets with short or sarcastic language benefit from sentiment cues, which disambiguate tone and reduce reliance on lexical features alone.
- Core assumption: Sarcasm and ambiguity in tweets can be partially resolved by sentiment context.
- Evidence anchors:
  - Automatically classifying user-generated text to classify offensive text is a difficult task due to sarcasm and irony.
  - Figure 2 shows how much effect sentiment had on different OLID labels. Notice that NOT labels have higher true positives with PPS compared to that of not having PPS.
  - Weak: No neighbor explicitly addresses sarcasm resolution via sentiment.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: TF-IDF vectorization and SVM classification
  - Why needed here: Provides a strong baseline to compare against deep learning models.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the regularization parameter C in SVM when applied to TF-IDF features?

- Concept: Bidirectional LSTM and contextual embeddings
  - Why needed here: Captures sequential dependencies in tweets, important for detecting offensive patterns that depend on word order.
  - Quick check question: How does a Bi-LSTM differ from a unidirectional LSTM in modeling tweet semantics?

- Concept: Transformer-based masked language models (e.g., DeBERTa)
  - Why needed here: Leverages large-scale pretraining to understand complex tweet context and sentiment.
  - Quick check question: What is the effect of using focal loss versus cross-entropy loss in imbalanced datasets?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing -> Sentiment prediction -> Dataset augmentation (PPS-OLID) -> Model training -> Evaluation
- Critical path: Sentiment prediction -> Dataset augmentation -> DeBERTa fine-tuning -> Performance evaluation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using sentiment prepending vs. appending: Prepending gives earlier conditioning but may bias attention differently.
  - Model choice: DeBERTa+PPS shows gains over plain DeBERTa, but gains may not transfer to other datasets.
  - Focal loss usage: Helps with class imbalance but may require careful tuning of alpha and gamma.
- Failure signatures:
  - If sentiment prediction is poor, the augmented dataset may degrade performance.
  - Overfitting on sentiment cues in a small dataset (OLID) may hurt generalization.
  - High precision gain but low recall improvement suggests bias toward safe classification.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate DeBERTa baseline on OLID without sentiment to confirm F1 ≈ 82.28.
  2. Train DeBERTa on PPS-OLID and verify F1 improvement ≈ 0.28.
  3. Perform ablation: train with only neutral sentiment prepending to isolate its effect.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does prepending sentiment information improve offensive text classification performance on datasets larger than OLID?
- Basis in paper: The authors note that further experiments on larger datasets are needed to confirm their findings, and that the small sample size of positive and negative sentiment in OLID may limit the generalizability of their results.
- Why unresolved: The study only used the OLID dataset, which contains 14,100 tweets. The authors acknowledge that the dataset's limited size and sentiment distribution may not fully capture the effect of sentiment on offensive language classification.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments on significantly larger datasets with more diverse sentiment distributions (e.g., multiple social media platforms or languages) would provide stronger evidence for the generalizability of sentiment prepending.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Which method is more effective for incorporating sentiment into offensive text classification: prepending or appending the predicted sentiment to the input text?
- Basis in paper: The authors state that differentiating the performance of models between prepending or appending sentiment is beyond the scope of their research, but they chose prepending as it provides more clarity.
- Why unresolved: The study only tested prepending sentiment and did not compare it to appending. The authors acknowledge that the choice between these methods could impact performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled experiment comparing both methods (prepending vs. appending) on the same dataset and model architecture would directly answer this question.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of sentiment prediction model affect the performance of offensive text classification?
- Basis in paper: The authors used DeBERTa-v3-small-ft-senti for sentiment prediction, but they acknowledge that the performance of offensive text classification could depend on the quality and granularity of the sentiment predictions.
- Why unresolved: The study used a single sentiment prediction model, and the authors note that the small sample size of certain sentiments (e.g., positive) in OLID may limit the effectiveness of sentiment prepending.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing multiple sentiment prediction models (e.g., different architectures or fine-tuned on different datasets) and analyzing their impact on offensive text classification performance would clarify this relationship.

## Limitations
- The study is based on a single dataset (OLID) with modest performance gains (0.28 F1 improvement)
- Sentiment prediction model accuracy is not evaluated, creating uncertainty about reliability of sentiment signals
- Error analysis reveals unexpected patterns (negative sentiment helps NOT detection better than neutral)
- No cross-dataset validation to verify generalizability of findings

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The experimental methodology is sound and properly executed (comparing models on both original and augmented datasets, using appropriate metrics). The reported performance numbers appear accurate based on the described procedures.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that sentiment prepending improves offensive text classification is supported by results, but the mechanism is not fully explained (why negative sentiment helps NOT detection better than neutral). The limited dataset size and lack of cross-dataset validation reduce generalizability confidence.
- **Low confidence**: The assumption that sentiment prediction accuracy is sufficient to provide useful classification signals is not validated. The error analysis reveals patterns that contradict initial hypotheses about sentiment's role.

## Next Checks
1. **Sentiment prediction accuracy validation**: Evaluate the DeBERTa-v3-small-ft-senti model's sentiment prediction accuracy on the OLID test set to establish whether sentiment signals are reliable enough to support classification improvements.

2. **Cross-dataset replication**: Test the DeBERTa+PPS approach on at least one other offensive language dataset (e.g., HASOC, HatEval) to verify whether performance gains transfer beyond OLID and demonstrate generalizability.

3. **Controlled ablation study**: Train models with only neutral sentiment prepending (as hypothesized to help NOT detection) versus only negative sentiment prepending to systematically investigate which sentiment type drives the observed improvements and why.
