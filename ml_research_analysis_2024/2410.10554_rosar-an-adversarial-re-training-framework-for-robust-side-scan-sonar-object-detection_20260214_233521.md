# ROSAR: An Adversarial Re-Training Framework for Robust Side-Scan Sonar Object Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.10554
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10554
- Reference count: 27
- Improves YOLOX object detection model robustness by up to 1.85% using adversarial retraining on SSS-specific noise

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ROSAR, a framework that enhances deep learning object detection models for side-scan sonar (SSS) images through adversarial retraining. The method integrates knowledge distillation with adversarial retraining, defining two SSS-specific safety properties and generating adversarial datasets to improve model robustness against SSS noise. Experiments on three novel field-collected SSS datasets show that ROSAR improves model robustness by up to 1.85% compared to the baseline, with adversarial retraining providing more stable improvements than patch-based approaches.

## Method Summary
ROSAR integrates knowledge distillation with adversarial retraining to enhance both efficiency and robustness of YOLOX object detection models for SSS imagery. The framework formalizes two SSS-specific safety properties that capture robustness requirements against random L∞ noise and dark horizontal lines. These properties guide the generation of adversarial datasets using PGD and patch attacks. The retrained model is then validated using SSS-specific datasets (SWDD-Clean, SWDD-Surface, SWDD-Noisy) and robustness is measured through binary search to compute robustness bounds under adversarial attacks.

## Key Results
- ROSAR improves model robustness by up to 1.85% compared to baseline
- Adversarial retraining with PGD-generated datasets provides more stable robustness improvements than patch-based retraining
- The framework enhances detection accuracy and reduces overfitting on SSS-specific noise

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Adversarial retraining improves robustness by iteratively refining the model using counter-examples from PGD and patch attacks.
- Mechanism: The framework identifies model vulnerabilities through safety properties and uses generated adversarial examples to retrain, enhancing the model's ability to handle noisy SSS inputs.
- Core assumption: Safety properties accurately capture the conditions under which the model fails, and adversarial examples effectively represent real-world noise.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "By extending our prior work on knowledge distillation (KD), this framework integrates KD with adversarial retraining to address the dual challenges of model efficiency and robustness against SSS noises."
  - [section III] "Our proposed framework, illustrated in Fig. 1, is designed with two primary objectives: (1) leveraging KD to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the YOLOX object detection model and (2) increasing the model’s robustness against noise."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; related papers do not discuss adversarial retraining in SSS contexts.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Knowledge distillation (KD) combined with adversarial retraining results in a model that is both efficient and robust.
- Mechanism: KD transfers knowledge from a larger, more accurate model to a smaller, efficient model, while adversarial retraining enhances the model's resilience to noise.
- Core assumption: The distilled model retains sufficient accuracy while being more efficient, and the retraining process does not degrade this efficiency.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This paper introduces ROSAR, a novel framework enhancing the robustness of deep learning object detection models tailored for side-scan sonar (SSS) images."
  - [section III] "While the first objective has been covered in [10], this paper centers on the second objective, which integrates the KD-enhanced model into an adversarial retraining loop."
  - [corpus] Limited evidence; related papers focus on other aspects of SSS imagery processing but not KD with adversarial retraining.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Formal safety properties guide the generation of effective adversarial examples.
- Mechanism: Two SSS-specific safety properties are defined to capture robustness requirements, and these properties are used to generate adversarial datasets that challenge the model.
- Core assumption: The formalized safety properties are comprehensive and accurately represent the robustness requirements for SSS object detection.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section V] "Our first property P1 expresses that the network is robust against random L∞ noise in the input. This type of noise simulates the random perturbations that can be present in side-scan sonar images across the whole waterfall image."
  - [section V] "Our second property P2 expresses that the network is robust against dark horizontal lines in the input image, mimicking the noise that is present in the SWDD-Noisy dataset."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; related papers do not discuss the formalization of safety properties for SSS images.

## Foundational Learning

- **Knowledge Distillation (KD)**: Why needed here: KD allows transferring knowledge from a larger, more accurate model to a smaller, efficient model, crucial for deploying models on resource-constrained underwater vehicles. Quick check question: How does KD help in maintaining model accuracy while reducing its size?
- **Adversarial Attacks**: Why needed here: Adversarial attacks help identify vulnerabilities in the model by generating inputs that cause incorrect predictions, essential for enhancing model robustness. Quick check question: What is the difference between PGD and patch-based adversarial attacks in terms of their impact on the model?
- **Safety Properties**: Why needed here: Formal safety properties define the conditions under which the model should maintain correct predictions, guiding the generation of effective adversarial examples. Quick check question: How do the defined safety properties relate to the specific noise conditions in SSS images?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: YOLOX-ViT-L model → Knowledge Distillation → Adversarial Retraining → Safety Properties → Validation
- **Critical path**: Train original model on SWDD dataset → Apply KD to create efficient model → Define safety properties → Generate adversarial datasets using PGD and patch attacks → Retrain model using adversarial datasets → Validate using SSS-specific datasets and safety properties
- **Design tradeoffs**: Balancing model efficiency (through KD) with robustness (through adversarial retraining) may require careful tuning of the retraining process to avoid degrading efficiency
- **Failure signatures**: If model performance on clean data significantly drops after retraining, it may indicate overfitting to adversarial examples. If robustness does not improve, the safety properties or adversarial examples may not be effective.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Train the original model on the SWDD dataset and evaluate its performance on the SWDD-Validation datasets
  2. Apply KD to the trained model and compare the efficiency and accuracy of the distilled model
  3. Generate adversarial datasets using PGD and patch attacks and evaluate their impact on the model's robustness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of ROSAR compare when applied to other object detection models beyond YOLOX and YOLOv5?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on YOLOX and YOLOv5 models, but does not explore the framework's applicability to other models.
- Why unresolved: The study is limited to specific models, and broader testing across various object detection architectures is needed.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies applying ROSAR to multiple object detection models, measuring robustness and accuracy improvements.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can ROSAR be effectively extended to handle safety properties beyond noise and adversarial attacks, such as data transmission interference in SSS data collection?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that ROSAR can be adapted to address additional safety properties like interference caused by data transmission during SSS data collection.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide experimental validation for these additional safety properties.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results demonstrating ROSAR's effectiveness in mitigating interference from data transmission in SSS environments.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the computational trade-offs of using ROSAR in real-time embedded systems for underwater robotics?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses model efficiency through knowledge distillation but does not address the computational impact of adversarial retraining on real-time applications.
- Why unresolved: The computational overhead of adversarial retraining in resource-constrained environments is not explored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance benchmarks comparing ROSAR's computational requirements with baseline models in real-time underwater robotics scenarios.

## Limitations

- Claims about robustness improvements rely heavily on synthetic adversarial datasets that may not fully capture real-world SSS noise distributions
- Evaluation focuses on controlled PGD and patch attacks, with uncertain transferability to actual field conditions
- Study does not report computational overhead metrics for the adversarial retraining process

## Confidence

- **High confidence** in the methodology for integrating knowledge distillation with adversarial retraining, as this follows established ML practices and the framework is well-specified
- **Medium confidence** in the SSS-specific safety properties, as while the formalization is reasonable, there is limited validation that these properties comprehensively capture all relevant noise scenarios
- **Medium confidence** in the reported robustness improvements, as the evaluation is conducted on the authors' own datasets with controlled conditions, lacking external validation

## Next Checks

1. **Real-world noise validation**: Test the retrained model on independently collected SSS datasets with authentic noise conditions (not synthetically generated) to verify robustness claims under practical scenarios.

2. **Cross-architecture evaluation**: Apply the ROSAR framework to different backbone architectures (e.g., ResNet-based YOLO variants) to assess whether the improvements generalize beyond the specific ViT implementation used in the paper.

3. **Long-term stability assessment**: Evaluate model performance after extended deployment periods and under varying environmental conditions to determine if the robustness gains persist over time and across different operational contexts.
