# Applying Attribution Explanations in Truth-Discovery Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.05831
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05831
- Reference count: 22
- This paper investigates applying AAEs and RAEs to TD-QBAFs, showing they can provide intuitive explanations identifying key influential arguments and relations, with RAEs offering more fine-grained insights than AAEs.

## Executive Summary
This paper explores the application of Argument Attribution Explanations (AAEs) and Relation Attribution Explanations (RAEs) to Truth-Discovery Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (TD-QBAFs). TD-QBAFs are complex structures used to assess the trustworthiness of sources and claims, often featuring intricate cycles. The authors demonstrate that both AAEs and RAEs can effectively explain the strength of target arguments by identifying key influential elements. While both methods produce similar rankings of influential arguments and relations, RAEs offer more detailed insights by analyzing individual edges rather than whole arguments. The findings suggest these attribution methods can enhance understanding of complex QBAFs, particularly in cyclic structures where influence paths may not be immediately obvious.

## Method Summary
The study applies QE gradual semantics to compute dialectical strengths of arguments in a TD-QBAF with 17 arguments (11 sources, 6 claims) and 32 edges. Base scores are set to 0.5 for sources and 0 for claims. The authors then compute both removal-based and Shapley-based AAEs and RAEs for a target argument (c5). For Shapley-based methods, an approximation algorithm with 1000 samples is used due to computational constraints. The effectiveness of these explanations is evaluated by comparing the rankings of influential arguments and relations, and by examining how well they reveal non-obvious influence paths in the cyclic graph structure.

## Key Results
- Both AAEs and RAEs can provide intuitive explanations identifying key influential arguments and relations in TD-QBAFs
- RAEs offer more fine-grained explanations than AAEs by analyzing individual edges rather than whole arguments
- Both methods reveal non-trivial and surprising insights, such as indirect influence paths through cyclic structures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Removal-based and Shapley-based AAEs/RAEs capture the influence of individual arguments/edges on a target argument's strength in TD-QBAFs.
- Mechanism: AAEs compute how much the target argument's strength changes when an argument is removed or averaged over all possible removal orders (Shapley). RAEs perform the same computation but on edges instead of arguments.
- Core assumption: The QE gradual semantics produces convergent strength values for the given TD-QBAFs, enabling meaningful attribution scores.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "both AAEs and RAEs can provide interesting explanations and can give non-trivial and surprising insights"
  - [section] "we observe some connections between AAEs and RAEs. For example, in both AAEs, the top-4 influential arguments are s7 to s10, while in both RAEs, the outgoing edges from these arguments also rank in the top-4"
  - [corpus] Weak: no direct evidence found in neighbors about attribution mechanisms in cyclic QBAFs.
- Break condition: If the QE semantics fails to converge (e.g., oscillations in cyclic graphs), the attribution scores become meaningless.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: RAEs provide more fine-grained explanations than AAEs because they operate on edges rather than arguments.
- Mechanism: When an argument is removed, all its incoming and outgoing edges are removed simultaneously. RAEs measure the impact of each edge individually, capturing partial effects.
- Core assumption: Edge-level effects are not simply the sum of their argument's overall influence.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "RAEs offer more fine-grained explanations than AAEs by analyzing individual edges"
  - [section] "when computing AAEs, such as removal-based AAEs, removing an argument means removing all the incoming and outgoing edges associated with that argument, whereas RAEs offer a more detailed insight by processing every incoming and outgoing edge individually"
  - [corpus] Weak: no direct evidence in neighbors about edge-level vs argument-level granularity.
- Break condition: If edge effects are purely additive, the fine-grained advantage disappears.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Both AAEs and RAEs can reveal non-obvious influence paths in cyclic TD-QBAFs, such as indirect support through chains of arguments.
- Mechanism: The attribution scores capture both direct and indirect effects through the graph structure, revealing influence paths that are not immediately visible from the graph topology alone.
- Core assumption: The attribution computation correctly propagates influence through cycles.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "one might overlook the influence between claim arguments c1 and c5 because they are in different topics (Year=1962 and Theme=Art), but AEs demonstrate that c1 can contribute to c5 through s7"
  - [abstract] "both AAEs and RAEs can provide interesting explanations and can give non-trivial and surprising insights"
  - [corpus] Weak: no direct evidence in neighbors about influence path discovery.
- Break condition: If attribution computation fails to handle cycles properly, indirect paths may be missed or misrepresented.

## Foundational Learning

- QE Gradual Semantics:
  - Why needed here: Understanding how argument strengths are computed is essential to interpreting AAEs/RAEs.
  - Quick check question: How does the QE update function treat attackers vs supporters when computing the next iteration's strength?

- Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks:
  - Why needed here: TD-QBAFs are built on this foundation, and understanding attack/support relations is crucial.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a standard AF and a bipolar AF?

- Shapley Value:
  - Why needed here: Shapley-based AAEs/RAEs use this concept from cooperative game theory.
  - Quick check question: What does the Shapley value measure in the context of attribution explanations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: QBAF representation -> QE gradual semantics engine -> Attribution explanation module -> Sampling approximation -> Results visualization
- Critical path: Load QBAF → Compute QE strengths → Select target argument → Compute AAEs/RAEs → Rank and visualize results
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Exact Shapley vs approximate sampling (accuracy vs computation time)
  - Edge-level vs argument-level explanations (granularity vs simplicity)
  - Convergence handling in cyclic graphs (robustness vs complexity)
- Failure signatures:
  - Non-convergent QE strengths → Attribution scores meaningless
  - Sampling variance in Shapley approximations → Inconsistent rankings
  - Zero attribution scores for all elements → Target argument isolated or no meaningful influences
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify QE convergence on the provided TD-QBAF example with different random seeds
  2. Compare exact vs sampled Shapley AAEs on a small acyclic QBAF to measure approximation error
  3. Test AAE vs RAE consistency on a simple cyclic QBAF with known influence structure

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different gradual semantics influence the results of Argument Attribution Explanations (AAEs) and Relation Attribution Explanations (RAEs)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest investigating this in future work, noting that the property satisfaction of semantics has an influence on the property satisfaction of explanations.
- Why unresolved: The paper only applies the Quadratic Energy (QE) gradual semantics and does not explore other semantics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies applying AAEs and RAEs with different gradual semantics (e.g., other than QE) to the same TD-QBAFs, analyzing the consistency and differences in attribution scores.

### Open Question 2
- What is the formal relationship between Argument Attribution Explanations (AAEs) and Relation Attribution Explanations (RAEs)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors observe a connection between AAEs and RAEs but note that the formal relationship requires further exploration.
- Why unresolved: While the paper notes that RAEs for outgoing edges of important arguments are relatively high and there is consistency across different sets of arguments and edges, it does not provide a formal mathematical relationship.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical framework or mathematical proofs establishing how AAEs and RAEs are related, possibly showing that the AAE of an argument is a function of the RAEs of its incoming and outgoing edges.

### Open Question 3
- How does the approximation algorithm for Shapley-based AAEs and RAEs affect the stability and reliability of the explanations?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors mention using an approximation algorithm for Shapley-based explanations due to computational constraints and note that the qualitative influence (the sign) of Shapley-based AAEs close to zero is sensitive when applying the approximation algorithm.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not analyze the sensitivity of the approximation algorithm or compare results with exact Shapley values where feasible.
- What evidence would resolve it: An analysis of the variance in Shapley-based attributions across multiple runs of the approximation algorithm, or a comparison between approximate and exact Shapley values on smaller QBAFs to assess accuracy and stability.

## Limitations
- The analysis focuses on a single TD-QBAF instance with 17 arguments and 32 edges, limiting generalizability
- The comparison between AAEs and RAEs is primarily empirical, with the formal relationship between these explanation types remaining unexplored
- The QE gradual semantics' behavior in highly cyclic or oscillating networks requires further validation

## Confidence

**High**: AAEs and RAEs can compute meaningful influence scores in TD-QBAFs
**Medium**: RAEs provide more fine-grained explanations than AAEs
**Low**: AEs reveal non-obvious influence paths that would be overlooked from graph topology alone

## Next Checks

1. Test attribution explanation consistency across multiple TD-QBAF instances with varying cyclic structures and edge densities
2. Derive and validate the mathematical relationship between AAE and RAE scores for arguments with multiple incoming/outgoing edges
3. Implement exact Shapley value computation for small TD-QBAFs to measure sampling approximation error and establish confidence intervals
