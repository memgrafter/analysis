# Generating Piano Practice Policy with a Gaussian Process

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.04812
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04812
- Reference count: 13
- Primary result: GP achieved 75% accuracy in predicting teacher practice mode choices vs 70% for logistic regression

## Executive Summary
This study develops a computational scaffolding framework using Gaussian Processes to guide piano practice by dynamically selecting optimal practice modes based on learner performance errors. The method predicts the utility of different practice modes (timing or pitch) and achieved 75% accuracy in predicting expert teacher choices, compared to 70% for logistic regression. The framework incorporates learner state, practice mode selection, performance evaluation, and expert knowledge, with hyperparameters optimized via Bayesian optimization.

## Method Summary
The method uses Gaussian Processes trained to approximate expert-learner interactions in piano practice. MIDI recordings from 6 novice piano players are used to extract performance errors (pitch and timing), which are then used to predict the utility of different practice modes. The GP model is optimized using Bayesian optimization to maximize alignment with expert teacher choices. The framework includes data collection from learner performances, feature extraction of error metrics, GP training with optimized hyperparameters, and practice mode selection based on predicted utility.

## Key Results
- GP model achieved 75% accuracy in predicting teacher practice mode choices
- Logistic regression baseline achieved 70% accuracy
- GP's ability to handle non-linear relationships and quantify uncertainty offers advantages for future extensions
- Hyperparameters optimized via Bayesian optimization after 50 iterations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Gaussian Processes can model non-linear relationships between learner performance errors and optimal practice mode selection better than linear regression.
- Mechanism: GPs use kernel functions to capture complex patterns in data and provide uncertainty estimates for predictions.
- Core assumption: The relationship between performance errors (timing and pitch) and utility of practice modes is non-linear.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "While both models performed similarly, the GP's ability to handle non-linear relationships and quantify uncertainty offers advantages for future extensions."
  - [section] "The GP produced a mapping between errors and desired practice modes that makes sense (see Figure 3), while the accuracy of both techniques was similar (approximately 70% for the baseline model and 75% as the best result achieved by the GP model)."
  - [corpus] "Found 25 related papers (using 8). Average neighbor FMR=0.471, average citations=0.0."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Bayesian optimization effectively tunes GP hyperparameters to align the model's predictions with expert teacher choices.
- Mechanism: Bayesian optimization searches the hyperparameter space to maximize the probability that the GP's highest predicted utility matches the teacher's selected practice mode.
- Core assumption: The utility function can be parameterized by a weighted sum that the GP can learn to predict.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The kernels examined here were the rational quadratic kernel (RatQuad), radial basis function (RBF), and Matérn with ν = 5/2... The hyperparameters we optimized explicitly with Bayesian optimization were a and uµ."
  - [section] "After 50 iterations of Bayesian optimization of a and uµ, the scaffolding algorithm on average correctly predicts 70% of the practice modes on test data."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The GP's ability to quantify uncertainty can be leveraged in future work to improve practice scheduling and decision-making.
- Mechanism: The GP provides variance estimates alongside mean predictions, which can be used in acquisition functions to balance exploration and exploitation in practice mode selection.
- Core assumption: Uncertainty estimates from the GP can meaningfully inform which practice modes to try next.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "In our future work, we will test different Bayesian optimization techniques, e.g., different acquisition functions, and evaluate their effect on the learning progress."
  - [section] "It is an open research question, how to integrate the practice context into a computational practice policy generator."
  - [corpus] "The multimodal nature of music performance has driven increasing interest in data beyond the audio domain within the music information retrieval (MIR) community."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Gaussian Processes
  - Why needed here: GPs provide a probabilistic framework for modeling the relationship between learner errors and practice mode utility, capturing non-linear patterns and providing uncertainty estimates.
  - Quick check question: What is the main difference between a GP and a standard regression model in terms of how they represent uncertainty?

- Concept: Bayesian Optimization
  - Why needed here: Bayesian optimization is used to find the optimal hyperparameters for the GP that maximize alignment with expert teacher choices, without requiring exhaustive grid search.
  - Quick check question: How does Bayesian optimization differ from grid search in terms of hyperparameter exploration strategy?

- Concept: Kernel Functions
  - Why needed here: Kernel functions define the covariance structure in GPs, determining how the model captures relationships between different input features (error types, practice modes).
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the kernel function in a Gaussian Process, and how does it affect the model's predictions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data Collection -> Feature Extraction -> GP Training -> Bayesian Optimization -> Practice Mode Selection
- Critical path: Data Collection → Feature Extraction → GP Training → Bayesian Optimization → Practice Mode Selection
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Simplicity vs. expressiveness: Using only two practice modes and two error types simplifies the model but may miss important factors affecting utility.
  - Computational cost: GPs are computationally intensive, especially with large datasets, but provide valuable uncertainty estimates.
  - Expert knowledge integration: The model relies on expert teacher data for training, which may limit scalability and introduce bias.
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor accuracy in predicting teacher choices (below ~60%)
  - GP predictions show high uncertainty across all inputs
  - Bayesian optimization fails to converge or gets stuck in local optima
  - Feature extraction introduces significant noise or bias
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate feature extraction: Compare manually calculated error metrics with automated calculations on a subset of data.
  2. Test GP kernel sensitivity: Train GPs with different kernel functions (RBF, Matérn, RatQuad) and compare prediction accuracy and uncertainty estimates.
  3. Evaluate Bayesian optimization: Compare Bayesian optimization with grid search for hyperparameter tuning in terms of accuracy and computational cost.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How does incorporating more error measures (beyond pitch and timing) affect the performance gap between Gaussian Process and linear regression models in predicting practice utility?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that using more error measures may reveal a larger difference between techniques because the relationship between predictor variables and utility is likely non-linear (Schulz et al., 2018).
  - Why unresolved: The current study only uses pitch and timing errors, so the effect of additional error measures on model performance comparison remains untested.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Conduct experiments using additional error measures (e.g., articulation, dynamics) and compare the accuracy of GP and linear regression models in predicting practice utility and teacher selection.

- Question: What is the optimal way to integrate practice context (e.g., previous practice modes, learner history) into a computational practice policy generator?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that the current implementation assumes the teacher maximizes utility based on current state only, without considering practice history, and mentions this as an open research question.
  - Why unresolved: The current model does not account for the sequence or history of practice modes, which may be crucial for effective scaffolding.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Develop and test models that incorporate practice history (e.g., Markov decision processes, recurrent neural networks) and evaluate their effectiveness in generating practice policies compared to context-free models.

- Question: How do different Bayesian optimization acquisition functions affect the similarity between teacher-generated and model-generated practice schedules?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions future work will test different acquisition functions and investigate their effect on learning progress and schedule similarity to teacher choices.
  - Why unresolved: The study only mentions testing different acquisition functions but does not report results on how they affect schedule similarity or learning outcomes.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Implement and compare multiple acquisition functions (e.g., Expected Improvement, Upper Confidence Bound) in the GP model and measure both the accuracy of matching teacher choices and the impact on learning progress.

## Limitations

- The relatively small dataset (121 tuples from 6 learners) may limit generalizability to diverse learner populations
- Similar performance between GP and logistic regression suggests non-linear advantages may not be fully realized with current features
- Reliance on expert teacher data for training introduces potential bias and scalability challenges

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The GP's ability to provide uncertainty estimates and the effectiveness of Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning.
- **Medium Confidence**: The 75% accuracy in predicting teacher choices and the claim that GPs can handle non-linear relationships better than linear models.
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability of results to diverse learner populations and the practical impact on learning outcomes beyond prediction accuracy.

## Next Checks

1. Test the GP model on a larger, more diverse dataset with varying skill levels and additional practice modes to assess scalability and robustness.
2. Conduct a controlled study comparing learning outcomes between GP-guided practice and traditional teacher instruction to validate practical benefits.
3. Implement an online learning variant of the GP that updates in real-time based on learner performance, evaluating its effectiveness in adaptive practice scheduling.
