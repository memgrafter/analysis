# Navigating Trade-offs: Policy Summarization for Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Clustering MORL policies by both objective values and behavior using PAN algorithm achieves better interpretability than objective-only clustering

## Executive Summary
Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) produces sets of policies representing different trade-offs among objectives, but these large solution sets are difficult for decision makers to comprehend. This paper addresses the interpretability challenge by clustering policies based on both their objective values and behavioral characteristics. The method uses Highlights states to represent policy behavior and employs Pareto-Set Analysis (PAN), a bi-objective clustering algorithm that balances clustering quality in both objective and behavior spaces. Experiments across four MORL environments demonstrate that this approach produces more meaningful policy clusters than traditional k-medoids clustering, with MO-Highway showing a hypervolume improvement from 1.66 to 1.73.

## Method Summary
The method clusters MORL policies using PAN, which treats clustering quality in objective space and behavior space as separate objectives to be optimized simultaneously. Policies are represented by their objective values (computed through rollout episodes) and their behavior, captured through Highlights states - the five most significant states encountered during execution. The clustering process optimizes both the spread of clusters in objective space and the similarity of behaviors within clusters. This dual-space approach allows decision makers to choose different trade-offs between clustering qualities in each space. The method was evaluated against k-medoids clustering on four MORL environments: MO-Highway, objectworld, maze, and taxi.

## Key Results
- PAN clustering achieved a hypervolume of 1.73 in MO-Highway compared to k-medoids' 1.66
- Behavioral clustering revealed meaningful differences between policies not apparent from objective values alone
- The method produced interpretable policy clusters that helped decision makers understand trade-offs
- PAN's flexibility allows decision makers to balance clustering quality between objective and behavior spaces

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by recognizing that policies with similar objective values may exhibit different behaviors, and clustering should account for both aspects. PAN's bi-objective optimization ensures that clusters are well-separated in objective space while maintaining behavioral similarity within clusters. By representing behavior through Highlights states, the method captures the most significant aspects of policy execution without requiring full trajectory analysis. The approach leverages the fact that decision makers often need to understand not just what trade-offs policies make, but how they achieve those trade-offs through their behavior.

## Foundational Learning
- **MORL and Pareto Fronts**: Multi-objective reinforcement learning produces sets of policies representing different trade-offs among objectives, forming a Pareto front where no policy dominates another in all objectives. Why needed: Understanding MORL output is essential for grasping the problem being addressed.
- **Highlights States**: A method for representing policy behavior by identifying the most significant states encountered during execution. Why needed: Provides a compact behavioral representation for clustering without full trajectory analysis. Quick check: Verify that Highlights captures meaningful behavioral differences between policies.
- **Pareto-Set Analysis (PAN)**: A bi-objective clustering algorithm that optimizes clustering quality in two separate spaces simultaneously. Why needed: The core algorithm enabling dual-space clustering. Quick check: Confirm PAN can balance trade-offs between objective and behavior space clustering quality.
- **Hypervolume Metric**: A performance measure for comparing sets of solutions in multi-objective optimization, representing the volume dominated by the solution set. Why needed: The primary quantitative metric for evaluating clustering quality. Quick check: Calculate hypervolume for simple example sets to understand the metric.
- **k-Medoids Clustering**: A partitioning clustering method that clusters data around actual data points (medoids) rather than centroids. Why needed: The baseline method being compared against. Quick check: Implement k-medoids on simple data to understand its behavior.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Highlights state extraction -> Objective value computation -> PAN bi-objective clustering -> Cluster evaluation -> Policy summarization

### Critical Path
The critical path involves extracting Highlights states from policy trajectories, computing objective values through rollouts, and running PAN clustering to produce final clusters. Each component depends on the previous one, with Highlights extraction being the foundation for behavioral representation.

### Design Tradeoffs
The method trades computational complexity for interpretability by adding behavior space clustering to traditional objective-only approaches. The choice of Highlights for behavioral representation balances expressiveness with computational efficiency. PAN's flexibility in balancing clustering quality across spaces provides user control but requires careful parameter selection.

### Failure Signatures
If clustering fails to produce meaningful groups, possible causes include poor Highlights representation that doesn't capture behavioral differences, insufficient diversity in objective values, or inappropriate choice of k clusters. Failure in PAN optimization may result from conflicting objectives that cannot be simultaneously optimized well.

### First 3 Experiments to Run
1. Implement Highlights extraction on sample policies and visualize the most significant states to verify behavioral capture
2. Run PAN clustering on synthetic bi-objective data with known clusters to validate the algorithm
3. Compare PAN clustering results with k-medoids on simple MORL problems to observe differences in cluster formation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the choice of policy representation method (e.g., Highlights) affect the clustering quality and interpretability of MORL solution sets?
- Basis in paper: The paper uses Highlights to represent policy behavior as five most significant states, but acknowledges this is just one possible approach and mentions other methods exist.
- Why unresolved: The paper only uses one policy representation method (Highlights) and doesn't compare it with alternatives or explore how different representations might affect clustering outcomes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic comparison of clustering results using different policy representation methods (e.g., computational models, state abstraction approaches) on the same MORL solution sets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between objective space and behavior space clustering quality for different types of decision makers?
- Basis in paper: The paper shows that PAN clustering allows decision makers to choose different trade-offs between clustering qualities in objective and behavior spaces, but doesn't empirically determine what constitutes optimal balance for different user types.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates the flexibility of the approach but doesn't conduct user studies to determine how different DMs (non-technical, technical, developers) prefer to balance these trade-offs.
- What evidence would resolve it: User studies with different decision maker types evaluating various clustering configurations and their decision-making effectiveness.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the analysis of highlight videos be automated to improve cluster descriptions, especially as the number of policies grows?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions this as future work, noting that while highlight videos were analyzed manually in their case study, an automated method is feasible through assessment of feature importance.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the potential for automation but doesn't implement or test any automated analysis methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation and evaluation of automated feature importance analysis methods for policy behavior description that scale with solution set size.

## Limitations
- Evaluation focuses on relatively simple benchmark environments, raising scalability questions to complex real-world domains
- PAN's reliance on bi-objective optimization may limit applicability to higher-dimensional objective spaces common in practical MORL
- Computational overhead of behavior space clustering is not quantified against traditional objective-only methods
- Choice of k=5 clusters appears arbitrary without sensitivity analysis or justification

## Confidence
- Claim: PAN outperforms k-medoids in clustering quality - Medium
- Claim: Behavioral clustering reveals meaningful differences not apparent from objectives - Medium
- Claim: The method improves interpretability for decision makers - Low (lacks user study evidence)

## Next Checks
1. Test the method on higher-dimensional MORL problems with 3+ objectives to assess scalability
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of behavior space clustering versus objective space clustering alone
3. Implement a user study with domain experts to evaluate whether the summarized policy sets actually improve decision-making compared to raw Pareto fronts
