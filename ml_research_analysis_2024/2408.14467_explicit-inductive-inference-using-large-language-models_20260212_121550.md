core_contribution: This paper introduces an explicit inductive inference pipeline
  that exploits the attestation bias of large language models (LLMs) to improve performance
  on directional predicate entailment tasks. The method works by transforming a premise
  into a set of attested alternatives and aggregating the LLM's predictions on these

# Explicit Inductive Inference using Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.14467
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14467
- Authors: Tianyang Liu; Tianyi Li; Liang Cheng; Mark Steedman
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: Reduces negative effects of attestation bias by over 20% from type-based baseline and over 35% from entity-based baseline on directional predicate entailment tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces an explicit inductive inference pipeline that exploits the attestation bias of large language models (LLMs) to improve performance on directional predicate entailment tasks. The method transforms premises into attested alternatives and aggregates LLM predictions on these derived inquiries to support the original inference. Tested on the Levy/Holt dataset with GPT-3.5 and Llama3, the approach shows significant improvements in overall performance and robustness against attestation bias compared to baselines.

## Method Summary
The EIDI pipeline works by first extracting entity types from premise triples using an LLM-based typing module, then generating attested alternative premises through a transformation module, and finally using a prediction module to evaluate entailment for each alternative. The results are aggregated to produce the final prediction. The pipeline uses zero-shot prompts to avoid introducing additional bias and employs greedy decoding throughout. The approach specifically targets directional entailment problems where predicate relationships depend on entity arguments.

## Key Results
- Achieves over 20% reduction in attestation bias effects compared to type-based baseline
- Improves performance by over 35% compared to entity-based baseline
- Demonstrates robust performance on both attestation-consistent and attestation-adversarial subsets of the Levy/Holt dataset

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The pipeline improves LLM inference performance by exploiting attestation bias in a controlled way.
- Mechanism: By replacing premise arguments with attested alternatives, the transformed inquiries inherit the same truth label as the hypothesis, allowing the LLM to use its inherent bias constructively.
- Core assumption: When a premise is attested, the LLM's prediction aligns with the hypothesis' truth label due to the bias.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The method works by transforming a premise into a set of attested alternatives and aggregating the LLM's predictions on these derived inquiries to support the original inference."
  - [section]: "If we control P to always be attested, then P |= H will naturally share the same truth label with H on a distributional basis, which dissolves the negative effects of LLMs' attestation bias."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence. No directly related work found that describes this specific mechanism of exploiting attestation bias.
- Break condition: If the LLM cannot generate attested alternatives reliably, the pipeline fails to control the premise's attestation status.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Aggregating predictions from multiple attested alternative inquiries improves inference robustness.
- Mechanism: Each attested alternative inquiry provides evidence for the original entailment; averaging these predictions reduces variance and noise.
- Core assumption: Multiple attested premises that share the same predicate will yield consistent entailment predictions for the same hypothesis.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our pipeline uses an LLM to transform a premise into a set of attested alternatives, and then aggregate answers of the derived new entailment inquiries to support the original inference prediction."
  - [section]: "Therefore, we encourage the transformation module to generate a variety of different alternative premise triples, so that a more reliable conclusion can be drawn when we aggregate the predictions."
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence found in corpus. Assumption based on aggregation principles in ensemble methods.
- Break condition: If generated alternatives are too diverse semantically, aggregation may dilute the correct signal.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using zero-shot prediction with transformed inquiries avoids introducing additional bias from few-shot examples.
- Mechanism: Zero-shot prompts force the LLM to rely on its internal knowledge and bias, which is precisely what the pipeline aims to exploit.
- Core assumption: Few-shot examples introduce external bias that interferes with the controlled exploitation of attestation bias.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Our pilot studies on the development set indicate that adding few-shot examples in the prediction module may add extra bias to the model, and therefore introduce unnecessary considerations on finding proper examples under each setting."
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence found. Assumption based on pilot study observation.
- Break condition: If the zero-shot prompt is poorly constructed, the LLM may default to unhelpful reasoning patterns.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Attestation bias in LLMs
  - Why needed here: Understanding that LLMs rely on factual knowledge outside context is crucial for exploiting this bias.
  - Quick check question: What happens when an LLM predicts entailment based on hypothesis' truth label rather than premise-hypothesis relationship?
- Concept: Predicate entailment
  - Why needed here: The task involves determining if one predicate logically follows from another given entities.
  - Quick check question: Does (medicine X kills disease Y) entail (medicine X is a cure of disease Y)?
- Concept: Zero-shot vs few-shot prompting
  - Why needed here: Choosing the right prompting strategy affects whether the pipeline introduces additional bias.
  - Quick check question: How does adding few-shot examples potentially interfere with the pipeline's goal?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Premise → Typing → Transformation → Prediction → Aggregation → Output
- Critical path: Premise → Typing → Transformation → Prediction → Aggregation → Output
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Zero-shot vs few-shot prompts: Zero-shot avoids external bias but may be less guided.
  - Number of alternatives (n): More alternatives improve reliability but increase computational cost.
  - Prompt design: Must balance clarity and exploitation of bias without introducing noise.
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor typing leads to invalid alternatives.
  - Transformation fails to generate attested triples → premises remain unattested.
  - Aggregation averages conflicting signals → noisy predictions.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test typing module on sample triples to ensure correct type extraction.
  2. Validate transformation by checking if generated triples are attested and valid.
  3. Run prediction on a small set of alternatives to confirm bias exploitation direction.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the impact of using different entity type vocabularies on the performance of the EIDI pipeline, and how does this compare to using LLM-generated types?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the EIDI pipeline uses LLM-generated types, while the MCQ type baseline uses predefined FIGER types. It also states that the EIDI pipeline is designed to improve upon the MCQ type baseline.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a direct comparison between the performance of the EIDI pipeline and a baseline that uses a different entity type vocabulary.
- What evidence would resolve it: Running experiments with the EIDI pipeline using different entity type vocabularies and comparing the results to the current performance would provide insights into the impact of type vocabulary choice.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of the EIDI pipeline scale with the size of the input dataset, and are there any diminishing returns as the dataset size increases?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the EIDI pipeline on the Levy/Holt dataset, but does not explore how performance scales with dataset size.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide information on the performance of the EIDI pipeline on datasets of varying sizes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with the EIDL pipeline on datasets of different sizes and analyzing the performance trends would provide insights into scalability and potential diminishing returns.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the effect of using different decoding strategies (e.g., beam search, top-k sampling) in the transformation and prediction modules of the EIDI pipeline?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that greedy decoding is used throughout the experiments, but does not explore the impact of different decoding strategies.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comparison of the EIDI pipeline's performance using different decoding strategies.
- What evidence would resolve it: Running experiments with the EIDI pipeline using different decoding strategies in the transformation and prediction modules and comparing the results would provide insights into the impact of decoding strategy choice.

## Limitations
- The method's effectiveness depends heavily on the LLM's ability to generate attested alternatives reliably.
- Computational overhead from generating multiple attested alternatives may limit practical applicability.
- Results may not generalize beyond the specific Levy/Holt dataset used in experiments.

## Confidence

**Confidence Labels:**
- Core mechanism exploitation of attestation bias: Medium
- Performance improvement claims: Medium-High
- Generalizability to other domains: Low

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies removing the typing module or transformation module to quantify their individual contributions to performance gains.
2. Test the pipeline on at least one additional entailment dataset (e.g., SNLI or MultiNLI) to assess generalizability.
3. Measure the computational overhead of generating attested alternatives versus the performance gains to evaluate practical feasibility.
