# Machine Translation Advancements of Low-Resource Indian Languages by Transfer Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.15879
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15879
- Reference count: 12
- Key outcome: Huawei Translation Center's WMT24 submission achieved strong results across 8 Indian language pairs using transfer learning, with BLEU scores ranging from 16.1 to 47.9

## Executive Summary
This paper presents Huawei Translation Center's submission to the WMT24 Indian Languages Machine Translation Shared Task, focusing on low-resource Indian languages including Assamese, Manipuri, Khasi, and Mizo. The team employed transfer learning strategies to address data scarcity, using two distinct approaches: fine-tuning the IndicTrans2 model for Assamese and Manipuri, and training a multilingual model with additional Bengali data for Khasi and Mizo. The experiments achieved strong results across 8 language pairs, demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer learning techniques in improving machine translation for low-resource languages.

## Method Summary
The approach leveraged existing open-source models and combined various training techniques, including data diversification, forward and back translation, and transductive ensemble learning. For Assamese and Manipuri, the team fine-tuned the IndicTrans2 model, while for Khasi and Mizo, they trained a multilingual model with additional Bengali data. The methodology incorporated data augmentation techniques and ensemble methods to improve translation quality across the low-resource language pairs.

## Key Results
- Achieved 23.5 BLEU for English-Assamese and 31.8 BLEU for English-Manipuri
- Achieved 19.7 BLEU for English-Khasi and 32.8 BLEU for English-Mizo
- Overall BLEU scores ranged from 16.1 to 47.9 across all 8 language pairs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Transfer learning effectively addresses low-resource language challenges by leveraging knowledge from high-resource languages and existing models. The approach allows models to benefit from pre-learned linguistic patterns and translation capabilities, reducing the amount of task-specific training data required. By combining data diversification, forward/back translation, and ensemble learning, the system can generate more robust and diverse training examples, leading to improved translation quality.

## Foundational Learning
- **BLEU Score**: Measures translation quality by comparing n-gram overlap between machine and reference translations. Needed to quantify model performance; check by comparing against human evaluation.
- **Transfer Learning**: Leverages pre-trained models to improve performance on related tasks with limited data. Needed to address data scarcity; check by ablation studies removing transfer components.
- **Data Augmentation**: Techniques like forward/back translation generate synthetic training data. Needed to expand limited training sets; check by comparing results with and without augmentation.
- **Multilingual Models**: Single models handling multiple languages through shared representations. Needed to improve efficiency and cross-lingual transfer; check by comparing multilingual vs. bilingual approaches.
- **Ensemble Learning**: Combining multiple model predictions to improve overall performance. Needed to reduce individual model weaknesses; check by comparing ensemble vs. single model results.
- **IndicTrans2**: Specific pre-trained model for Indian languages. Needed as foundation for fine-tuning; check by comparing with other pre-trained models.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Open-source pre-trained models -> Data augmentation pipeline -> Fine-tuning/multilingual training -> Ensemble model -> BLEU evaluation

### Critical Path
Pre-trained model selection -> Data augmentation (forward/back translation) -> Model fine-tuning or multilingual training -> Ensemble prediction -> BLEU score evaluation

### Design Tradeoffs
- Single vs. multilingual models: Multilingual models save resources but may sacrifice performance on individual languages
- Fine-tuning vs. training from scratch: Fine-tuning requires less data but may be limited by pre-trained model capabilities
- Ensemble size: Larger ensembles improve performance but increase computational cost

### Failure Signatures
- Low BLEU scores on specific language pairs indicate insufficient transfer learning effectiveness
- Performance gaps between fine-tuned and multilingual approaches suggest model architecture limitations
- Inconsistent results across different augmentation techniques indicate data quality issues

### First Experiments
1. Compare fine-tuned vs. multilingual approaches for each language pair
2. Evaluate impact of different data augmentation techniques (forward/back translation)
3. Test ensemble performance against individual model variants

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Relatively low performance for Khasi-English (16.1 BLEU) and English-Khasi (19.7 BLEU) suggests significant remaining challenges
- Lack of detailed error analysis to understand specific model weaknesses
- BLEU scores alone may not fully capture translation quality across domains

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Transfer learning effectively improves low-resource Indian language MT | High |
| Results represent state-of-the-art performance | Medium |
| Approaches generalize to other low-resource language pairs | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation studies to validate BLEU scores and assess translation quality across different domains
2. Perform ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each transfer learning technique
3. Test model robustness by evaluating on out-of-domain test sets and analyzing error patterns
