# Security and Privacy Challenges of Large Language Models: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.00888
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00888
- Authors: Badhan Chandra Das; M. Hadi Amini; Yanzhao Wu
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Comprehensive survey of security and privacy challenges in Large Language Models (LLMs), analyzing attack categories and defense mechanisms.

## Executive Summary
This survey paper provides a systematic analysis of security and privacy vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs), examining both attack methodologies and defense mechanisms. The authors employ a goal-based approach to categorize attacks including prompt injection, jailbreaking, backdoor, data poisoning, gradient leakage, membership inference, and PII leakage. The paper emphasizes the significant risks LLMs pose across various domains and highlights the critical need for robust defense strategies that balance model utility with security and privacy protection.

## Method Summary
The survey synthesizes findings from 40+ research papers, articles, and resources covering LLM vulnerabilities, attacks, and defenses. The authors employ a literature review methodology to systematically analyze and categorize LLM security and privacy issues, evaluate existing defense mechanisms, and identify research gaps and future directions. The approach focuses on understanding vulnerabilities from both security and privacy perspectives using a goal-based classification system.

## Key Results
- LLMs face significant security and privacy risks across multiple domains including healthcare, education, transportation, and governance
- Current defense mechanisms often sacrifice model utility, highlighting the need for balanced protection strategies
- Many existing attack methods designed for smaller NLP models require evaluation and adaptation for LLM contexts
- Cross-domain attack transferability presents both opportunities for threat anticipation and challenges for defense development

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Comprehensive Threat Classification with Goal-Based Approach
- By organizing vulnerabilities according to attacker goals rather than just technical methods, the survey enables systematic identification of overlapping attack objectives and potential cross-domain defense strategies.
- Core assumption: Different attack categories share common underlying goals that can be addressed through unified defense approaches.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract], [section], [corpus]
- Break condition: If attack methods evolve beyond the current goal-based categorization or if new attack categories emerge that don't fit existing goal frameworks

### Mechanism 2: Cross-Domain Attack Transferability Analysis
- By explicitly noting that many existing attack methods are designed for smaller NLP models and require evaluation on LLMs, the survey highlights the transferability gap and need for domain-specific adaptation.
- Core assumption: Attack methodologies developed for other domains retain core principles that can be adapted to LLM contexts with appropriate modifications.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract], [section], [corpus]
- Break condition: If LLM architecture differences prove too fundamental for successful attack transfer, or if new attack vectors emerge that are unique to LLMs

### Mechanism 3: Defense-Utility Trade-off Framework
- By documenting that existing defenses like DP-SGD, noise perturbation, and fine-pruning may impair model utility, the survey establishes the need for evaluating trade-offs and developing more nuanced protection strategies.
- Core assumption: Security and privacy defenses inherently involve performance costs that must be quantified and optimized.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract], [section], [corpus]
- Break condition: If new defense mechanisms are developed that provide security without utility degradation, or if utility costs become negligible relative to security benefits

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Goal-based vs. method-based attack classification
  - Why needed here: Understanding why the survey chose goal-based classification over method-based helps grasp the systematic approach to vulnerability analysis
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between classifying attacks by their technical methods versus their underlying goals?

- Concept: Cross-domain attack transferability principles
  - Why needed here: Recognizing how attacks from other domains (computer vision, traditional ML) can be adapted to LLMs is crucial for anticipating emerging threats
  - Quick check question: Why might an attack that works on traditional ML models not work directly on LLMs without modification?

- Concept: Defense-utility trade-off optimization
  - Why needed here: Understanding the fundamental tension between security/privacy protection and model performance is essential for evaluating defense strategies
  - Quick check question: What are the primary ways that privacy-preserving techniques like differential privacy typically impact model performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Threat classification system -> Cross-domain attack analysis framework -> Defense mechanism evaluation matrix -> Utility trade-off assessment tools -> Research gap identification system
- Critical path: Understanding LLM vulnerabilities → Analyzing attack methods → Evaluating defense mechanisms → Identifying research gaps → Proposing future directions
- Design tradeoffs: Comprehensive coverage vs. depth in specific areas, Technical detail vs. accessibility for different audiences, Current state analysis vs. forward-looking research directions, Attack focus vs. defense focus
- Failure signatures: Incomplete threat classification leading to overlooked vulnerabilities, Overestimation of defense effectiveness without proper utility analysis, Failure to account for cross-domain attack transferability, Insufficient consideration of real-world deployment constraints
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Map existing LLM attack papers to the survey's goal-based classification system to identify coverage gaps
  2. Select one attack method from computer vision and attempt to adapt it to an LLM context, documenting necessary modifications
  3. Evaluate a privacy-preserving defense technique on both utility and security metrics using a small-scale LLM implementation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the effectiveness of adversarial attacks on LLMs be evaluated using standardized metrics that account for different model architectures and task types?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the lack of standardized evaluation metrics for LLM vulnerabilities and mentions that current metrics like perplexity are insufficient for comprehensive assessment.
- Why unresolved: Existing metrics are limited in scope and do not account for the diverse architectures and tasks LLMs handle, making it difficult to compare attack effectiveness across models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of comprehensive evaluation metrics that capture attack impact across various LLM architectures and tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the trade-off between model utility and privacy protection be optimized in LLMs when using differential privacy techniques?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses that DP-based defenses may impair model utility and highlights the need for effective techniques that balance privacy and utility.
- Why unresolved: Current DP techniques often sacrifice model performance to achieve privacy, and there is a lack of methods that optimize this balance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies demonstrating techniques that maintain high model performance while ensuring robust privacy protection.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Are there novel defense mechanisms that can effectively protect LLMs from advanced backdoor attacks, such as BadPrompt and BToP, which exploit continuous prompts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that existing defense techniques are insufficient for advanced backdoor attacks and highlights the need for dynamic and flexible defense methods.
- Why unresolved: Current defenses are primarily designed for simpler attack types and have not been evaluated against advanced attacks targeting continuous prompts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and testing of new defense mechanisms specifically designed to counter advanced backdoor attacks in LLMs.

## Limitations

- Limited empirical validation of many claimed attack effectiveness rates across different LLM architectures
- Insufficient long-term studies on defense mechanism durability against adaptive attackers
- Incomplete coverage of cross-domain attack transferability mechanisms due to the novelty of this research direction

## Confidence

- Overall threat landscape analysis: Medium confidence due to rapidly evolving nature of LLM attacks and defenses
- Utility trade-off framework analysis: High confidence based on well-documented performance degradation patterns
- Goal-based attack classification system: Medium confidence as new attack categories may emerge that don't fit current frameworks

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-domain attack adaptation validation**: Select 3 attack methods from computer vision literature and systematically test their adaptation to LLM contexts, documenting success rates and necessary architectural modifications.

2. **Defense-utility trade-off quantification**: Implement a controlled experiment comparing multiple privacy-preserving defenses (DP-SGD, noise perturbation, fine-pruning) on the same LLM architecture, measuring both security improvement and performance degradation across standard benchmarks.

3. **Goal-based classification coverage analysis**: Map all recent LLM attack papers (last 12 months) to the survey's goal-based categories to identify any emerging attack types that don't fit existing frameworks, validating the completeness of the classification system.
