# Factorized Learning Assisted with Large Language Model for Gloss-free Sign Language Translation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2403.12556
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12556
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: FLa-LLM achieves 23.09 BLEU-4 on PHOENIX14T, 14.20 on CSL-Daily, and 9.66 on How2Sign

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces FLa-LLM, a novel approach for translating sign language videos into spoken sentences without requiring gloss annotations. The method employs a two-stage training process: first pre-training a visual encoder using video-grounded text generation, then fine-tuning with a pre-trained LLM while freezing the visual encoder. The approach addresses the labor-intensive challenge of obtaining gloss annotations while achieving state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets.

## Method Summary
FLa-LLM uses factorized learning with a two-stage training process. In the first stage, a lightweight translation model pre-trains the visual encoder through video-grounded text generation without gloss annotations. In the second stage, this pre-trained visual encoder is frozen and integrated with a pre-trained LLM to enhance translation performance. This approach enables effective gloss-free sign language translation by leveraging large-scale pre-trained language models while avoiding the need for expensive gloss labeling.

## Key Results
- Achieves 23.09 BLEU-4 on PHOENIX14T dataset
- Achieves 14.20 BLEU-4 on CSL-Daily dataset
- Achieves 9.66 BLEU-4 on How2Sign dataset
- All results show significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The factorized learning approach works by separating the visual feature extraction from the language modeling tasks. By pre-training the visual encoder independently on video-grounded text generation, it learns robust visual representations without needing gloss annotations. The frozen visual encoder then provides stable input features to the LLM during fine-tuning, allowing the language model to focus on translation quality while benefiting from pre-trained visual understanding.

## Foundational Learning
- **Video-grounded text generation**: Why needed - provides supervision signal without glosses; Quick check - can generate coherent text from video input
- **Pre-trained LLMs**: Why needed - provides strong language understanding and generation capabilities; Quick check - achieves high performance on general language tasks
- **Factorized learning**: Why needed - enables separation of visual and language learning tasks; Quick check - improves training stability and performance
- **Visual encoder pre-training**: Why needed - builds robust visual feature representations; Quick check - captures meaningful sign language patterns
- **Model freezing**: Why needed - maintains stable visual features during LLM fine-tuning; Quick check - prevents catastrophic forgetting of visual knowledge
- **Gloss-free training**: Why needed - eliminates expensive annotation requirements; Quick check - achieves competitive performance without glosses

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Video input → Visual encoder → Frozen features → LLM → Text output

**Critical path**: The critical path runs from video input through the visual encoder to the LLM, with the visual encoder being frozen during LLM fine-tuning to maintain stable feature representations.

**Design tradeoffs**: The main tradeoff is between freezing the visual encoder (ensuring stable features but limiting adaptation) versus fine-tuning it (allowing adaptation but risking stability). The authors chose freezing to leverage pre-trained visual knowledge while letting the LLM focus on translation quality.

**Failure signatures**: Performance degradation when video-grounded text data is insufficient for pre-training, or when the frozen visual features are incompatible with the LLM's expected input format.

**First experiments**: 
1. Validate visual encoder pre-training on video-grounded text generation task
2. Test frozen visual encoder integration with pre-trained LLM
3. Compare performance with and without the two-stage training process

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance varies significantly across different sign language datasets
- Depends on availability and quality of video-grounded text datasets for pre-training
- Freezing visual encoder may limit adaptation to complex linguistic patterns

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in methodology's core innovation and two-stage training process
- **Medium confidence** in generalizability across different sign language datasets
- **Medium confidence** in scalability to resource-poor sign languages

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the approach on additional sign language datasets with varying resource availability to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies to determine the impact of freezing the visual encoder during LLM fine-tuning
3. Test the model's performance with different pre-trained LLM variants to understand the dependency on specific language models
