# Manifold-based Shapley for SAR Recognization Network Explanation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.03128
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03128
- Authors: Xuran Hu; Mingzhe Zhu; Yuanjing Liu; Zhenpeng Feng; LJubisa Stankovic
- Reference count: 21
- Key outcome: This paper proposes a manifold-based Shapley method that projects high-dimensional SAR features into low-dimensional manifolds using StyleGAN2, combining with traditional Shapley to obtain Fusion-Shap, achieving superior infidelity, sensitivity, and subjective evaluation metrics.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical limitation of traditional Shapley values for explaining high-dimensional SAR recognition networks - the assumption of feature independence. The authors propose a novel manifold-based Shapley approach that uses StyleGAN2 to transform high-dimensional SAR features into low-dimensional manifold representations, then calculates Shapley values on these manifolds. By combining manifold-based and traditional Shapley values through a weighted fusion approach, the method achieves superior explanation quality while satisfying all Shapley axioms. The Fusion-Shap method demonstrates significant improvements over existing explanation techniques in both quantitative metrics and subjective evaluations.

## Method Summary
The method consists of three main components: (1) A StyleGAN2-based transformation that maps high-dimensional SAR features I to low-dimensional manifold features U using Image2StyleGAN reconstruction, (2) Calculation of both traditional Shapley values for high-dimensional features and manifold-based Shapley values for low-dimensional manifolds, and (3) A weighted fusion approach that combines both Shapley value sets using an optimized coefficient α to minimize average drop in confidence. The final Fusion-Shap output provides improved explanations that address the feature independence violation inherent in traditional Shapley while maintaining computational feasibility.

## Key Results
- Fusion-Shap meets all Shapley axiom verification criteria (efficiency, symmetry, dummy player, additivity)
- Achieves best performance in infidelity, sensitivity, and subjective evaluation metrics compared to other methods
- Effectively resolves erroneous explanations encountered by traditional Shapley methods
- Successfully addresses interpretability challenges in complex SAR scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The manifold-based approach resolves the feature independence assumption violation in traditional Shapley values.
- Mechanism: By projecting high-dimensional features into low-dimensional manifolds using StyleGAN2, the method captures the true feature dependencies that traditional Shapley ignores. The low-dimensional manifold better represents the intrinsic structure of the data.
- Core assumption: The data distribution lies on a lower-dimensional manifold that can be learned by a generative network.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Shapley assumes that model's features are independent, rendering Shapley explanation invalid for high dimensional models. This study introduces a manifold-based Shapley method by projecting high-dimensional features into low-dimensional manifold features"
  - [section] "When calculating the marginal contribution of a feature coalition, shapley method often provides feature coalition that do not conform to the manifold, rendering the calculated shapley value without practical significance"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus doesn't contain specific studies validating manifold-based Shapley for SAR data

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Fusion-Shap approach combines manifold-based and traditional Shapley values to balance accuracy and computational efficiency.
- Mechanism: The method creates a weighted combination of manifold Shapley values and traditional Shapley values, with the weight α determined by minimizing average drop in confidence. This allows the method to capture both the global feature importance (traditional) and local manifold structure.
- Core assumption: The combination of traditional and manifold Shapley can be linearly weighted to optimize explanation quality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This study introduces a manifold-based Shapley method by projecting high-dimensional features into low-dimensional manifold features and subsequently obtaining Fusion-Shap"
  - [section] "To tackle this problem, we propose a hybrid approach by reintegrating the feature-independent traditional shapley method into the manifold shapley method"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus doesn't contain validation of the specific Fusion-Shap weighting approach

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The Shapley mapping function γ enables transformation of importance from manifold space to high-dimensional feature space.
- Mechanism: Using gradient-based approach, the method maps the Shapley importance values from the low-dimensional manifold to the corresponding features in the original high-dimensional space, preserving the relative importance relationships.
- Core assumption: The gradient of high-dimensional features with respect to manifold features can be used to weight the importance transfer.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We adopt a gradient-based approach to assess this importance mapping. First, define Up as an element within the position-encoded p-index manifold... We define this mapping as γ, unit-importance-mapping"
  - [section] "Combining Formulas (4) and (5): ϕv(I p c,w,h) = ∂Ic,w,h/∂Up · ϕv(Up) C × W × H"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus doesn't contain validation of this specific gradient-based mapping approach

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Shapley value theory and axioms (efficiency, symmetry, dummy player, additivity)
  - Why needed here: The paper relies on these axioms to validate that the manifold-based and fusion approaches still satisfy the mathematical properties of Shapley values
  - Quick check question: What happens to the efficiency axiom if we don't properly redistribute Shapley values when mapping between manifold and feature spaces?

- Concept: Generative adversarial networks and StyleGAN2 architecture
  - Why needed here: The method uses StyleGAN2 to learn the manifold representation of SAR data, which is critical for the approach to work
  - Quick check question: Why is StyleGAN2 specifically mentioned rather than other GAN architectures? What properties make it suitable for this application?

- Concept: Taylor interactions and axiomatic validation criteria (LAE, NUA, CA)
  - Why needed here: The paper uses these criteria to evaluate whether the explanation method is reliable and trustworthy
  - Quick check question: How would you design an experiment to test whether a method satisfies the "No Unrelated Allocation" criterion?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: SAR image → Image2StyleGAN (R) → Latent code → StyleGAN2 (G) → Manifold → Shapley calculation → Gradient-based mapping → Fusion with traditional Shapley → Output saliency map
- Critical path: SAR image → Manifold generation → Shapley value calculation → Fusion → Output
- Design tradeoffs: Computational cost vs. accuracy (higher manifold dimensions improve fidelity but increase computation), complexity of dual Shapley calculation vs. improved explanation quality
- Failure signatures: Poor manifold reconstruction quality, gradient instability during importance mapping, convergence issues in finding optimal α, violation of Shapley axioms in the final output
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test manifold reconstruction quality on a held-out SAR image set to verify Image2StyleGAN and StyleGAN2 are working properly
  2. Compare traditional Shapley vs. manifold Shapley vs. Fusion-Shap on a simple SAR dataset to validate improvements
  3. Vary manifold dimension (256, 512, 1024) and measure infidelity and sensitivity to find optimal tradeoff point

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on SAR images and mentions the method's potential application to other high-dimensional data types.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests the method on SAR images, and does not explore its performance on other data types.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments on other high-dimensional data types and comparing the results to those obtained from SAR images.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the choice of GAN architecture (e.g., StyleGAN2) affect the quality of the manifold and, consequently, the performance of the Fusion-Shap method?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses StyleGAN2 to transform high-dimensional features into manifolds.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the impact of different GAN architectures on the quality of the manifold and the performance of the Fusion-Shap method.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the Fusion-Shap method handle feature interactions in high-dimensional data with complex dependencies, such as those found in natural language processing tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper addresses feature interactions in high-dimensional data but focuses on SAR images.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the method's performance on data with complex dependencies, such as natural language processing tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the Fusion-Shap method to natural language processing tasks and analyzing its ability to handle complex feature interactions.

## Limitations
- The method relies heavily on the assumption that SAR data distributions lie on learnable low-dimensional manifolds
- Extensive validation of StyleGAN2 manifold learning quality across diverse SAR datasets is limited
- Computational complexity of calculating Shapley values in both high-dimensional and manifold spaces could limit practical deployment

## Confidence

- **Mechanism 1 (Feature independence resolution)**: Medium confidence - The theoretical justification is sound, but empirical validation across multiple SAR datasets is limited
- **Mechanism 2 (Fusion-Shap weighting)**: Low confidence - The linear combination approach lacks theoretical grounding and optimization methodology is not fully specified
- **Mechanism 3 (Gradient-based mapping)**: Medium confidence - The mathematical formulation is clear, but practical implementation challenges and stability issues are not addressed

## Next Checks

1. **Manifold quality validation**: Test StyleGAN2 reconstruction quality on a held-out SAR image set with quantitative metrics (PSNR, SSIM) and qualitative visualization to verify manifold representations capture essential SAR features

2. **Axiomatic compliance testing**: Systematically verify that Fusion-Shap satisfies all four Shapley axioms (efficiency, symmetry, dummy player, additivity) across different SAR recognition models and datasets

3. **Computational complexity analysis**: Benchmark the computational cost of Fusion-Shap against traditional Shapley methods on realistic SAR recognition pipelines, measuring runtime, memory usage, and scalability with increasing image resolution
