# FAST: Factorizable Attention for Speeding up Transformers

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.07901
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07901

- Key outcome: FAST reduces transformer computational complexity from O(N²) to O(N) while maintaining accuracy on Long Range Arena benchmark

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces FAST, a factorizable attention mechanism that dramatically reduces the computational and memory complexity of transformers from quadratic to linear scaling with sequence length. The method uses a Taylor series approximation of the exponential function (Fastmax) combined with factorization techniques inspired by the fast multipole method and improved fast Gauss transform. This enables efficient processing of long sequences while preserving the representational power of standard softmax attention. Experiments show that FAST achieves comparable accuracy to vanilla transformers on the Long Range Arena benchmark while significantly improving training speed, with approximately 7x speedup observed at head dimension D=32.

## Method Summary
FAST employs a factorizable attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention through a Taylor series expansion of the exponential function, termed Fastmax. The approach factorizes the attention computation by decomposing the softmax operation into components that can be computed more efficiently. Drawing inspiration from computational physics methods like the fast multipole method and improved fast Gauss transform, FAST reorganizes the attention calculation to achieve linear complexity. The factorization allows the method to maintain the full representational capabilities of standard attention while dramatically reducing computational requirements, enabling transformers to scale to much longer sequences without the quadratic memory bottleneck.

## Key Results
- Achieves comparable accuracy to vanilla transformers on Long Range Arena benchmark
- Reduces computational and memory complexity from O(N²) to O(N)
- Demonstrates approximately 7x faster training speed at head dimension D=32
- Maintains stable gradient behavior and produces attention maps similar to softmax attention

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FAST works by factorizing the attention computation through a Taylor series approximation of the exponential function. Traditional softmax attention computes pairwise interactions between all tokens, resulting in O(N²) complexity. FAST instead decomposes this operation into factorizable components that can be computed more efficiently. The Taylor series approximation (Fastmax) provides a computationally cheaper alternative to the exponential function while maintaining sufficient accuracy for attention calculations. The factorization approach reorganizes the computation to avoid redundant calculations, similar to how fast multipole methods accelerate particle simulations in computational physics. This allows the method to capture the essential properties of softmax attention while scaling linearly with sequence length.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Input embeddings -> Linear projections -> Fastmax approximation -> Factorized attention computation -> Output projection

**Critical Path:**
Token embeddings → Query/Key/Value projections → Fastmax computation → Factorized attention matrix → Weighted value aggregation → Output

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Accuracy vs. computational efficiency through Taylor approximation order
- Memory vs. speed through factorization granularity
- Numerical stability vs. approximation accuracy

**Failure Signatures:**
- Degraded performance on tasks requiring precise attention distributions
- Numerical instability with extreme input values
- Suboptimal scaling when factorization assumptions break down

**First Experiments:**
1. Compare attention weight distributions between FAST and standard softmax
2. Measure training stability across different Taylor approximation orders
3. Benchmark memory usage scaling with sequence length

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to Long Range Arena benchmark, not validated on diverse real-world tasks
- Taylor series approximation may introduce numerical stability concerns for extreme value ranges
- Performance gains at higher head dimensions and production-scale settings remain unclear

## Confidence

**Computational Complexity Claims** (High): Theoretical reduction from O(N²) to O(N) is mathematically sound and well-explained

**Long Range Arena Results** (Medium): Promising results but limited to single benchmark; needs validation across more diverse tasks

**Scalability and Training Speed** (Medium): 7x speedup claim based on specific conditions (D=32); may not generalize to all settings

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate FAST on additional benchmarks beyond Long Range Arena, including text generation, multimodal data, and real-world production datasets to verify "full representation capabilities" across diverse applications.

2. Conduct ablation studies varying head dimensions beyond D=32 and test with sequences of varying lengths (10K-100K tokens) to establish performance scaling properties and identify breaking points in approximation quality.

3. Perform stress testing of numerical stability by evaluating Fastmax under extreme conditions (very large/small attention weights, temperature scaling variations) and compare gradient distributions and variance with standard softmax across multiple training runs.
