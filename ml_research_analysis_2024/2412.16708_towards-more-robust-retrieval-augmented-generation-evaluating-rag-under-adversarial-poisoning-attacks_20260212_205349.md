# Towards More Robust Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Evaluating RAG Under Adversarial Poisoning Attacks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2412.16708
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16708
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: This study examines how retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems can be poisoned by adversarial passages and how to defend against them. Researchers introduce a taxonomy of context types—adversarial, untouched, and guiding—and test their effects on model robustness. They find that skeptical prompting enables models to detect and resist adversarial contexts, with greater effectiveness for models with stronger reasoning capacity. Retrieval analysis shows that certain retrievers like DPR are less likely to surface adversarial passages, while Contriever-based models are more vulnerable. When retrieval and generation are combined, using skeptical prompting with robust retrievers improves F1 scores by over 10% under attack. The findings highlight the need for context-aware prompting and retriever design to strengthen RAG system resilience.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the vulnerability of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to adversarial poisoning attacks, where malicious contexts are injected to mislead the model's output. The authors introduce a taxonomy of context types—adversarial, untouched, and guiding—to systematically evaluate how different retrievers and generation strategies respond to such attacks. They find that skeptical prompting significantly improves model resistance to adversarial contexts, particularly for models with stronger reasoning capabilities. The study also highlights the importance of selecting robust retrievers, as some models like DPR are less susceptible to surfacing adversarial passages compared to others like Contriever. Overall, the research underscores the need for context-aware prompting and retriever design to enhance the resilience of RAG systems.

## Method Summary
The authors evaluate RAG system robustness by introducing adversarial contexts into retrieval pipelines and measuring the impact on model performance. They create a taxonomy of context types—adversarial, untouched, and guiding—and test their effects on various retrievers and generation models. Skeptical prompting is introduced as a defense mechanism, encouraging models to critically evaluate retrieved contexts. The experiments involve comparing F1 scores across different configurations, analyzing retriever behavior, and assessing the combined impact of retrieval and generation strategies under adversarial conditions.

## Key Results
- Skeptical prompting significantly improves model resistance to adversarial contexts, especially for models with stronger reasoning capabilities.
- DPR retrievers are less likely to surface adversarial passages, while Contriever-based models are more vulnerable.
- Combining skeptical prompting with robust retrievers improves F1 scores by over 10% under adversarial attack conditions.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Skeptical prompting works by encouraging models to critically evaluate the relevance and reliability of retrieved contexts, reducing the likelihood of being misled by adversarial passages. This approach leverages the model's reasoning capacity to detect inconsistencies or contradictions in the context, thereby improving robustness. The effectiveness of this mechanism is further enhanced when paired with retrievers that are less prone to surfacing adversarial content, such as DPR.

## Foundational Learning
- **Adversarial contexts**: Manipulated passages designed to mislead models; needed to simulate real-world poisoning attacks.
- **Context types taxonomy**: Categorization of contexts (adversarial, untouched, guiding) to systematically evaluate model responses.
- **Skeptical prompting**: A prompting strategy that encourages critical evaluation of contexts; improves model resistance to adversarial attacks.
- **Retriever robustness**: The ability of retrievers to avoid surfacing adversarial passages; critical for RAG system resilience.
- **Reasoning capacity**: The model's ability to analyze and evaluate contexts; stronger reasoning improves resistance to adversarial attacks.
- **F1 score**: A metric combining precision and recall; used to evaluate model performance under adversarial conditions.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component map**: Retriever -> Context filtering -> Generator -> Output
**Critical path**: Retriever retrieves contexts → Context filtering applies skeptical prompting → Generator produces output
**Design tradeoffs**: Balancing retriever robustness with generation quality; skeptical prompting may reduce output fluency but improves resilience.
**Failure signatures**: Increased error rates when adversarial contexts are present; reduced performance with weaker retrievers.
**First experiments**:
1. Test skeptical prompting with a single retriever and model to validate its effectiveness.
2. Compare F1 scores of different retrievers under adversarial conditions.
3. Evaluate the combined impact of skeptical prompting and robust retrievers on model performance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper highlights the need for further research into automated methods for generating adversarial contexts to better simulate real-world poisoning attacks. It also calls for expanding the evaluation to include a broader range of retrievers and RAG system configurations to assess the scalability of proposed defenses. Additionally, the authors suggest conducting user studies to evaluate the impact of adversarial contexts on user trust and system usability in real-world scenarios.

## Limitations
- The experimental scope is constrained to a relatively small set of models and retrievers, which may not generalize to all RAG system configurations.
- The adversarial contexts are manually crafted based on a specific taxonomy, raising questions about their representativeness of real-world poisoning attacks.
- The evaluation metrics focus primarily on F1 scores and do not account for other potential failure modes such as user trust erosion or long-term system degradation.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The effectiveness of skeptical prompting in improving model resistance to adversarial contexts is well-supported by the experimental results.
- **Medium confidence**: The comparative analysis of retriever robustness is based on a limited set of retrievers and may not capture the full landscape of potential vulnerabilities.
- **Low confidence**: The generalizability of the findings to other domains or larger-scale RAG systems remains uncertain due to the narrow experimental scope.

## Next Checks
1. Expand the evaluation to include a broader range of retrievers and RAG system configurations to assess the scalability of the proposed defenses.
2. Conduct user studies to evaluate the impact of adversarial contexts on user trust and system usability in real-world scenarios.
3. Develop and test automated methods for generating adversarial contexts to better simulate realistic poisoning attacks and validate the robustness of the proposed defenses.
