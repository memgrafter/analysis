# Artificial Expert Intelligence through PAC-reasoning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2412.02441
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02441
- **Reference count**: 4
- **Primary result**: Introduces Artificial Expert Intelligence (AEI) with PAC-reasoning framework providing theoretical guarantees for precise decomposition of complex problems

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Artificial Expert Intelligence (AEI) as a new AI paradigm that combines domain-specific expertise with precise reasoning capabilities. Unlike current AI systems that struggle with adaptability and precision in novel problem-solving, AEI implements "Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) Reasoning" - a framework providing theoretical guarantees for reliably decomposing complex problems while controlling reasoning precision. The key innovation is System 3 reasoning, inspired by the scientific method, which guarantees precision at each reasoning step through empirical validation.

The paper formalizes two reasoning approaches: bottom-up reasoning that builds computation graphs from simpler subproblems, and top-down reasoning that allows forward references to unimplemented functions. Both methods use Example Validators (EV) and critics to ensure approximately correct solutions, with sample complexity bounds derived from PAC-learning theory. The theoretical analysis shows that with sufficient examples (sample complexity logarithmic in hypothesis class size), the reasoning process can guarantee that the final output is ǫ-approximate correct with probability at least 1-δ.

## Method Summary
The method introduces Artificial Expert Intelligence through PAC-reasoning, which combines domain-specific expertise with precise reasoning capabilities. The framework uses two main approaches: bottom-up reasoning that builds computation graphs by iteratively adding validated functions, and top-down reasoning that allows forward references to unimplemented functions with empirical validation. The system employs Example Validators (EV) and critics to ensure approximately correct solutions, with theoretical guarantees derived from PAC-learning theory. The key innovation is System 3 reasoning that guarantees precision at each step through empirical validation, enabling arbitrarily long reasoning chains by controlling error accumulation.

## Key Results
- Introduces Artificial Expert Intelligence (AEI) as a new AI paradigm combining domain expertise with precise reasoning
- Proposes System 3 reasoning inspired by the scientific method with empirical validation at each step
- Provides theoretical guarantees through PAC-reasoning with sample complexity bounds logarithmic in hypothesis class size
- Formalizes bottom-up and top-down reasoning approaches with Example Validators and critics for validation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Bottom-up reasoning builds computation graphs by iteratively adding vertices with empirical validation
- Mechanism: Actor proposes new functions to add to graph, critic validates using EV on sampled inputs, decomposition oracle approves final graph
- Core assumption: Proposal class P is finite and critic can identify ǫ-accurate proposals
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "The critic receives the proposal class, P, and should output a subset Pg ⊂ P that contains only proposals which are ǫi-approximately correct"
  - [section]: "Based on the above lemma, we can give guarantees on the entire bottom-up reasoning process"
  - [corpus]: Weak corpus coverage for bottom-up reasoning specifics
- Break condition: Infinite proposal class or critic cannot identify ǫ-accurate proposals

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Top-down reasoning allows forward references to unimplemented functions with empirical validation
- Mechanism: Actor proposes implementations of unimplemented functions, critic validates using EV on logged inputs from execution traces
- Core assumption: RI exists for each helper function and inputs can be logged from execution traces
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "The actor should produce a Reference Implementation (RI), potentially a non-efﬁcient one, of each helper function it relies on"
  - [section]: "We require that an implementation of each helper function would come after its usage"
  - [corpus]: Weak corpus coverage for top-down reasoning specifics
- Break condition: No RI available or input logging fails

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: PAC-reasoning controls error accumulation through sample complexity bounds
- Mechanism: With m ≥ log(|P|kmax/δ)2kmax/ǫ samples, probability of ǫ-approximate correctness ≥ 1-δ
- Core assumption: Sample complexity grows logarithmically with hypothesis class size
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "For finite H, the required number of examples (sample complexity) grows logarithmically with |H|"
  - [section]: "Lemma 1 Fix ǫ, δ ∈ (0, 1). Suppose that |P| < ∞, and let m ≥ log(|P|/δ)/ǫ"
  - [corpus]: Weak corpus coverage for PAC-learning theory specifics
- Break condition: Insufficient samples or hypothesis class too large

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: PAC-learning theory
  - Why needed here: Provides theoretical foundation for error bounds and sample complexity
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between VC-dimension and sample complexity in PAC-learning?

- Concept: Computation graphs
  - Why needed here: Formalizes the structure imposed by reasoning at inference time
  - Quick check question: How does a computation graph differ from a neural network architecture?

- Concept: Example Validators (EV)
  - Why needed here: Provides empirical validation mechanism for proposed functions
  - Quick check question: How does an EV differ from traditional unit tests?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Actor (proposes functions) → Critic (validates proposals) → Validation → Decomposition Oracle (approves final graph) → Final Answer
- Critical path: Actor proposes decomposition functions and Example Validators → Critic filters proposals using sampled examples → Decomposition oracle validates final graph
- Design tradeoffs: Bottom-up (build dependencies first) vs Top-down (allow forward references)
- Failure signatures: Critic rejects all proposals, Decomposition Oracle never approves, Sample complexity too high
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement bottom-up reasoning for simple arithmetic problems
  2. Implement top-down reasoning for sorting algorithms
  3. Compare error accumulation between intuitive and PAC-reasoning approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: What is the practical computational overhead of implementing PAC-reasoning compared to standard Chain-of-Thought reasoning in large language models?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses that AEI requires "inference-time compute on generating sufficient examples to learn from" and mentions sample complexity bounds, but doesn't provide empirical runtime comparisons
  - Why unresolved: The theoretical analysis provides sample complexity bounds but doesn't address the actual computational cost of running Example Validators and critics during inference
  - What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking studies comparing inference time and resource usage of AEI versus standard reasoning approaches on common problem sets

- **Open Question 2**: How can AEI be extended to domains where constructing decomposition oracles and example validators is challenging or impossible?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges that "Constructing an EV is domain-dependent" and "Constructing an RI is domain-dependent," suggesting this as a limitation
  - Why unresolved: The paper relies on domain-specific components but doesn't provide a general framework for automatically generating these components in new or poorly understood domains
  - What evidence would resolve it: Development of meta-learning approaches or automated discovery methods for generating decomposition oracles and example validators

## Limitations
- Domain-dependent nature of Example Validators (EVs) and decomposition oracles creates significant practical implementation challenges
- Assumes finite proposal classes and efficient critics, which may not hold for neural network-based actors
- Lacks empirical validation on real-world problems to demonstrate practical feasibility
- Theoretical analysis doesn't address computational overhead or runtime efficiency compared to existing approaches

## Confidence
- High confidence: PAC-learning theory foundations and sample complexity bounds
- Medium confidence: Bottom-up reasoning mechanics
- Low confidence: Top-down reasoning with forward references
- Low confidence: Overall practical feasibility

## Next Checks
1. **EV Construction Validation**: Implement Example Validators for a simple domain (e.g., arithmetic operations) and test whether they correctly identify correct vs incorrect function outputs with varying numbers of validation examples.

2. **Sample Complexity Empirical Test**: Implement the bottom-up reasoning framework and empirically measure whether the actual number of samples needed to achieve ǫ-accuracy matches the theoretical bound m ≥ log(|P|/δ)/ǫ across different proposal class sizes.

3. **Error Accumulation Analysis**: Test the top-down reasoning approach on a chain of 3-5 dependent functions and measure actual error accumulation compared to theoretical predictions, particularly examining whether the forward-reference mechanism introduces additional error sources.
