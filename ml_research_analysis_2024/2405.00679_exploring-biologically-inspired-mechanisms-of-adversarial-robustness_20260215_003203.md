# Exploring Biologically Inspired Mechanisms of Adversarial Robustness

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.00679
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00679
- Reference count: 30
- Key outcome: This paper explores mechanisms underlying adversarial robustness in neural networks, comparing biologically-inspired models to standard backpropagation-trained networks. The authors propose that robustness correlates with the smoothness of neural representations and that optimal encodings follow power law spectra in their principal component decomposition. They show that a local learning model based on winner-take-all dynamics (Krotov and Hopfield's rule) produces representations with these characteristics. The model achieves superior robustness against both random perturbations and targeted adversarial attacks compared to standard and regularized networks, while also exhibiting smooth decision boundaries and power law spectra. The results suggest that local learning mechanisms may provide insights into how biological neural networks achieve robustness, and could inform the development of more stable artificial systems.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the mechanisms underlying adversarial robustness in neural networks by comparing biologically-inspired models to standard backpropagation-trained networks. The authors propose that robustness correlates with the smoothness of neural representations and that optimal encodings follow power law spectra in their principal component decomposition. They demonstrate that a local learning model based on winner-take-all dynamics (Krotov and Hopfield's rule) produces representations with these characteristics, achieving superior robustness against both random perturbations and targeted adversarial attacks compared to standard and regularized networks.

The study reveals that local learning mechanisms may provide insights into how biological neural networks achieve robustness, and could inform the development of more stable artificial systems. By analyzing the spectral properties of neural representations and their relationship to adversarial robustness, the authors identify key architectural features that contribute to network stability, suggesting potential pathways for improving the reliability of deep learning models.

## Method Summary
The paper compares biologically-inspired local learning models to standard backpropagation-trained networks on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The primary approach uses Krotov and Hopfield's winner-take-all learning rule for unsupervised training of latent representations, followed by supervised backpropagation for the decoder. The authors measure robustness against random perturbations, FGSM, and PGD attacks, while analyzing the covariance spectra of hidden activations to identify power law profiles. They also implement various regularization techniques (L2, Jacobian, spectral) to compare their effects on smoothness, spectral properties, and robustness.

## Key Results
- Local learning via winner-take-all dynamics produces smoother feature maps and superior robustness against black box attacks compared to standard backpropagation
- Representations following power law spectra in their principal component decomposition achieve optimal balance between accuracy and robustness
- Pruning high-variance synapses improves spectral properties without harming performance, suggesting these connections are artifacts of finite training
- Spectral regularization enforces power law spectra but fails to generalize this property to arbitrary inputs like white noise

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Smooth neural representations improve adversarial robustness.
- Mechanism: Local learning via winner-take-all dynamics produces smoother manifolds by limiting drastic changes in output for small input perturbations.
- Core assumption: The norm of the Jacobian of hidden activations is a valid local measure of smoothness and correlates with robustness.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Robustness in neural representations is hypothesized to correlate with the smoothness of the encoding manifold."
  - [section] "In that sense, BNNs learn locally... robustness against black box attacks... find that local learning yields smoother feature maps..."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence; corpus focuses on broader biologically inspired models, not this specific smoothness/robustness link.
- Break condition: If Jacobian norm is not a valid smoothness measure (e.g., in non-differentiable regimes), or if the link between smoothness and robustness is disproven.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Power law covariance spectra indicate an optimal balance between accuracy and robustness.
- Mechanism: Representations following a power law in their principal component spectrum inherently balance expressivity and smoothness, making them robust.
- Core assumption: Power law spectra in biological systems (e.g., V1 cortex) are indicative of optimal robustness, and this property generalizes to artificial networks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Recent work suggests power law covariance spectra... to be indicative of a balanced trade-off between accuracy and robustness in representations."
  - [section] "optimal balance between accuracy and robustness is characterized by a close ton−α power law decay... observed in the primary visual cortex of mice."
  - [corpus] Weak; corpus neighbors discuss biologically inspired models but do not specifically address power law spectra in adversarial robustness.
- Break condition: If power law spectra are shown not to correlate with robustness in controlled experiments, or if other spectrum profiles yield better performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Pruning high-variance synapses improves spectral properties without harming performance.
- Mechanism: High-variance synapses introduce noise into the covariance spectrum, degrading smoothness and robustness; removing them yields cleaner power law behavior.
- Core assumption: Noisy synapses are artifacts of finite training and not informative; their removal improves spectral properties.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "we also notice that some synapses do not converge... we therefore decided to go with the ablated synapses."
  - [section] "we prune the distribution by ablating all synaptic connections that account for variances above0.0015... model performance remains unaffected."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence; pruning is specific to this study's methodology.
- Break condition: If ablation harms performance in broader settings, or if high-variance synapses carry meaningful information in other architectures.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Local vs global learning rules.
  - Why needed here: The paper contrasts biologically plausible local learning (Krotov-Hopfield) with backpropagation to explain robustness differences.
  - Quick check question: Does a local learning rule update weights based only on local neuron activity, or does it require global error signals?

- Concept: Covariance (PCA) spectrum analysis.
  - Why needed here: Understanding how ordered eigenvalues of hidden activations relate to smoothness and robustness.
  - Quick check question: In a double logarithmic plot, what shape does a power law spectrum exhibit?

- Concept: Jacobian regularization for smoothness.
  - Why needed here: The paper uses Jacobian norm as a measure and regularizer to enforce smoother representations.
  - Quick check question: If the Jacobian of a hidden layer is bounded, what effect does that have on small input perturbations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input -> (Krotov-Hopfield or BP) encoder -> ReLU hidden activations -> (BP) decoder -> Output
- Critical path: Input → (Krotov-Hopfield or BP) encoder → ReLU hidden activations → (BP) decoder → output
- Design tradeoffs: Local learning yields robustness and power law spectra but lower accuracy; weight regularization improves smoothness/robustness but not power law spectra; spectral regularization enforces power law but not smoothness or robustness
- Failure signatures: If ablation harms performance, spectra not scaling as power laws, or robustness not improving despite smoothness regularization
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train Krotov-Hopfield hybrid model on CIFAR10, plot hidden activation covariance spectrum to confirm power law
  2. Apply L2 regularization to BP model, measure Jacobian norm and decision boundary smoothness, compare to hybrid
  3. Test robustness of hybrid vs BP under FGSM attack, record accuracy drop and critical distance distribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does Krotov and Hopfield's local learning rule achieve power law spectra in neural representations compared to backpropagation-trained networks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows that Krotov and Hopfield's model produces representations with power law spectra while backpropagation-trained models do not, but the underlying mechanism is not explained
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the phenomenon but doesn't explain the mechanistic reason why local learning specifically produces power law spectra while backpropagation does not
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis of the weight updates in both learning rules, particularly focusing on how winner-take-all dynamics in Krotov-Hopfield rule affects spectral properties differently than gradient descent

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the relationship between the exponent α in power law spectra and the intrinsic dimension of the input data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that Stringer's theory predicts optimal representations have specific exponents based on input dimension, and observes that estimated exponents in their models are consistently larger than data exponents
- Why unresolved: While the paper observes correlations between exponents and model performance, it doesn't establish a quantitative relationship between the spectral exponent and intrinsic data dimension
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying the intrinsic dimensionality of training data and measuring corresponding changes in spectral exponents across different models

### Open Question 3
- Question: Why does spectral regularization fail to generalize power law spectra to arbitrary inputs like white noise, unlike the hybrid model?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper observes that while spectral regularization produces power law spectra for CIFAR10 data, it fails to maintain this property for white noise input, unlike Krotov-Hopfield's model
- Why unresolved: The paper notes this difference but doesn't explain why the explicitly enforced spectral property in the regularized model doesn't generalize while the implicit property in the hybrid model does
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of the learned weight matrices and activation patterns in both models to identify structural differences that affect spectral generalization

### Open Question 4
- Question: What is the optimal balance between smoothness and expressivity in neural representations for maximizing robustness?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper observes that weight regularization produces smoother representations than the naive model but doesn't achieve power law spectra, suggesting there's a trade-off between smoothness and optimal spectral properties
- Why unresolved: While the paper compares different regularization approaches, it doesn't identify the specific combination of smoothness and spectral properties that maximizes robustness
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic exploration of the parameter space combining different regularization strengths to identify the optimal trade-off point

### Open Question 5
- Question: How do the geometric properties of decision boundaries relate to the spectral properties of hidden representations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper observes that smoother representations lead to smoother decision boundaries, but doesn't establish a quantitative relationship between spectral properties and boundary geometry
- Why unresolved: The paper qualitatively relates Jacobian norms to decision landscape smoothness but doesn't connect this to spectral properties like the power law exponent
- What evidence would resolve it: Quantitative analysis measuring both spectral properties and decision boundary complexity across multiple models to establish a mathematical relationship

## Limitations

- Power law spectra as robustness indicator: While the paper claims power law covariance spectra indicate optimal robustness, this relationship is primarily observed in biological systems and needs more rigorous validation in artificial networks.
- Local learning generalization: The Krotov-Hopfield model shows superior robustness, but its performance on complex tasks beyond CIFAR-10 (e.g., ImageNet) is untested.
- Mechanistic interpretation of smoothness: The use of Jacobian norm as a smoothness measure assumes differentiability and may not capture all relevant aspects of representation robustness.

## Confidence

- High confidence: The observation that biologically-inspired local learning produces smoother representations and improved robustness against black box attacks.
- Medium confidence: The link between power law spectra and optimal robustness, based on biological observations but requiring more rigorous validation in artificial systems.
- Medium confidence: The effectiveness of pruning high-variance synapses to improve spectral properties, though this may be architecture-specific.

## Next Checks

1. **Scale-up validation**: Test the Krotov-Hopfield model on ImageNet to verify if power law spectra and robustness generalize to more complex datasets and architectures.

2. **Alternative smoothness metrics**: Compare robustness outcomes when using different smoothness measures (e.g., Lipschitz constant, spectral norm) versus Jacobian regularization to validate the mechanistic interpretation.

3. **Ablation study generalization**: Apply the high-variance synapse pruning method to other architectures (e.g., convolutional networks) to determine if the improvement in spectral properties and robustness is architecture-independent.
