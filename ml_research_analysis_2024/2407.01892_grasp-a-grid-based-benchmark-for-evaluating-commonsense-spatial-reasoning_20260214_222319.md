core_contribution: This paper introduces GRASP, a novel grid-based benchmark designed
  to evaluate commonsense spatial reasoning (CSR) abilities of large language models
  (LLMs) in practical navigation and resource collection tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks
  that focus on interpreting spatial descriptions, GRASP directly assesses LLMs' ability
  to use spatial information for planning and navigation by presenting text-rendered
  grid environments where agents must collect energy while avoiding obstacles and

# GRASP: A Grid-Based Benchmark for Evaluating Commonsense Spatial Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.01892
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01892
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces GRASP benchmark to evaluate LLMs' spatial reasoning through text-rendered grid navigation tasks

## Executive Summary
GRASP is a novel benchmark designed to evaluate commonsense spatial reasoning (CSR) capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through text-rendered grid environments. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on interpreting spatial descriptions, GRASP directly tests LLMs' ability to use spatial information for planning and navigation by requiring agents to collect energy while avoiding obstacles and constraints. The benchmark features 16,000 diverse environments with varying energy distributions, obstacle configurations, starting positions, and agent constraints.

The paper presents comprehensive experiments comparing classic baseline approaches (random walk and greedy search) with advanced LLMs including GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4o, and GPT-o1-mini. Results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to consistently achieve satisfactory solutions in these spatial reasoning tasks, highlighting the ongoing challenges in developing robust CSR capabilities. The benchmark aims to fill a critical gap in evaluating practical spatial reasoning skills beyond mere description interpretation.

## Method Summary
GRASP introduces a grid-based environment where LLMs must navigate text-rendered grids to collect energy while avoiding obstacles and adhering to specific constraints. The benchmark consists of 16,000 diverse environments systematically generated with varying parameters including energy distributions, obstacle placements, starting positions, and agent-specific constraints. Each environment is presented as a textual description of the grid state, and LLMs must output a sequence of actions to navigate the grid successfully. The benchmark evaluates both the correctness of the navigation path and the efficiency of the solution in terms of energy collection. Performance is measured across multiple dimensions including success rate, path optimality, and constraint adherence.

## Key Results
- Advanced LLMs (GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4o, GPT-o1-mini) struggle to consistently achieve satisfactory solutions in grid-based spatial reasoning tasks
- Classic baselines (random walk and greedy search) provide reference performance but are outperformed by LLMs in some scenarios
- The benchmark reveals significant gaps in LLMs' practical spatial reasoning abilities beyond description interpretation
- 16,000 diverse environments demonstrate the breadth and complexity of spatial reasoning challenges

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark works by creating a controlled environment where spatial reasoning must be applied to achieve concrete objectives. By using text-rendered grids with specific constraints and objectives, the benchmark isolates spatial reasoning capabilities from other cognitive functions. The systematic generation of diverse environments ensures that models cannot rely on memorization or pattern matching alone, forcing genuine spatial reasoning. The combination of energy collection goals with obstacle avoidance and constraints creates a realistic navigation scenario that tests multiple aspects of spatial reasoning simultaneously.

## Foundational Learning

**Grid-based spatial reasoning**: Understanding how to represent and navigate 2D spaces using textual descriptions. Needed because most spatial tasks require mapping between abstract representations and concrete spatial relationships. Quick check: Can the model correctly identify adjacent cells and navigate between them.

**Path planning algorithms**: Knowledge of basic navigation strategies including greedy approaches and systematic exploration. Needed to evaluate whether LLMs can implement or approximate common pathfinding strategies. Quick check: Does the model generate paths that avoid dead ends and backtracking.

**Constraint satisfaction**: Ability to reason about multiple simultaneous constraints while pursuing objectives. Needed because real-world navigation often involves conflicting requirements. Quick check: Can the model balance energy collection with obstacle avoidance and other constraints.

**Sequential decision making**: Understanding how to plan and execute multi-step actions based on spatial information. Needed for tasks requiring planning ahead rather than reactive responses. Quick check: Does the model generate coherent action sequences rather than isolated moves.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Grid environment -> Textual description -> LLM prompt -> Action sequence -> Execution validation -> Performance evaluation

**Critical path**: The benchmark's effectiveness depends on the accurate translation of grid states into textual descriptions that preserve spatial relationships, and the LLM's ability to interpret these descriptions and generate valid action sequences.

**Design tradeoffs**: Text-based representation vs. visual input (simplicity vs. realism), systematic generation vs. handcrafted scenarios (coverage vs. realism), simple grid navigation vs. complex 3D environments (tractability vs. real-world applicability).

**Failure signatures**: Models may fail by generating invalid moves (hitting obstacles), inefficient paths (excessive steps), constraint violations (ignoring restrictions), or incorrect spatial reasoning (misinterpreting grid relationships).

**3 first experiments**: 1) Test basic navigation without constraints to establish baseline performance. 2) Introduce simple obstacles to evaluate obstacle avoidance capabilities. 3) Add multiple constraints to test complex reasoning under restrictions.
