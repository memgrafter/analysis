# CoSTA: Code-Switched Speech Translation using Aligned Speech-Text Interleaving

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.10993
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10993
- Reference count: 35
- Primary result: CoSTA achieves up to 3.5 BLEU points higher than strong baselines on code-switched Telugu, Hindi, Marathi, and Bengali to English translation.

## Executive Summary
This work introduces COSTA, a model for code-switched speech translation that interleaves aligned speech and ASR text embeddings before feeding them into a pretrained MT model. It significantly improves translation accuracy, achieving up to 3.5 BLEU points higher than strong end-to-end and cascaded baselines on newly released evaluation sets for Telugu, Hindi, Marathi, and Bengali code-switched to English. The approach shows robustness to varying amounts of code-switching and performs comparably to cascaded systems on monolingual inputs.

## Method Summary
COSTA uses a scaffolded approach with pretrained IndicWav2Vec (speech encoder) and IndicTrans2 (MT encoder-decoder). Speech and ASR text representations are fused using aligned interleaving: forced alignment determines speech frames per text token, these frames are averaged, and the resulting representation is interleaved with the corresponding text embedding. The model is trained end-to-end on 30 hours of synthetic speech-translation pairs with three losses: ST (cross-entropy), ASR (CTC), and MT (cross-entropy). This architecture enables handling of code-switched input by effectively combining speech and text information.

## Key Results
- COSTA achieves up to 3.5 BLEU points improvement over strong baselines on code-switched evaluation sets
- Model shows robustness to varying degrees of code-switching with low correlation (R² = 0.006-0.016) between English word count and BLEU scores
- Performs comparably to cascaded systems on monolingual inputs while significantly outperforming them on code-switched speech

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Aligned interleaving of speech and text embeddings improves translation accuracy for code-switched speech.
- Mechanism: Force-alignment between speech and text determines the number of speech frames aligned to each text token. These aligned speech frames are averaged to create a combined representation that is then interleaved with the corresponding text embedding. This fused representation is fed to the MT model.
- Core assumption: The alignment between speech and text is reliable and captures the correspondence between spoken words and their transcriptions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Speech and ASR text representations are fused using an aligned interleaving scheme and are fed further as input to a pretrained MT module"
  - [section]: "A forced alignment between s and x determines the number of speech frames aligned to each xj ∈ x. The representations of these aligned speech frames are averaged to compute ¯sj."
- Break condition: If the forced alignment is noisy or inaccurate, the averaged speech representations will be incorrect, leading to degraded performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Using a combination of ST, ASR, and MT losses improves the overall model performance.
- Mechanism: The model is trained with three losses: ST loss (cross entropy for translation), ASR loss (CTC for transcription), and MT loss (cross entropy for translation given text). These losses are combined with scaling factors λ1 and λ2.
- Core assumption: All three tasks (ST, ASR, MT) are related and improving performance on one task will help the others.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Our training loss is a combination of three objectives: L = LST + λ1LASR + λ2LMT"
  - [section]: "Our findings in Table 9 indicate that interleaving consistently outperforms appending, with statistically significant improvements"
- Break condition: If the tasks are not related or if the losses conflict with each other, the combined training could degrade performance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The model is robust to varying degrees of code-switching in the input speech.
- Mechanism: The model can handle different amounts of English words in the input speech without significant degradation in performance. This is evidenced by the low correlation between the number of English words and the BLEU score.
- Core assumption: The model's architecture and training procedure allow it to generalize well to different levels of code-switching.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Our findings indicate nearly no correlation between the number of English words (indicating degree of code-switching) and the model's score (R2 = 0.006 for Telugu and R2 = 0.016 for Hindi)"
  - [section]: "COSTA achieves the highest exact match among the three (highlighted in bold), thus indicating that it is most successful in accurately retaining English words from the ASR transcriptions in the predicted translations"
- Break condition: If the model is overtrained on a specific level of code-switching, it may not generalize well to different levels.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Force alignment
  - Why needed here: To determine the correspondence between speech frames and text tokens for the aligned interleaving.
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of force alignment in the context of speech-text interleaving?

- Concept: Multi-task learning
  - Why needed here: To leverage the relatedness of ST, ASR, and MT tasks and improve overall model performance.
  - Quick check question: How does multi-task learning help in improving the performance of speech translation models?

- Concept: Code-switching
  - Why needed here: To understand the challenges of translating speech that contains words from multiple languages.
  - Quick check question: What is code-switching and why is it challenging for speech translation models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Speech encoder (IndicWav2Vec) -> Aligned interleaving module -> IndicTrans2 encoder -> IndicTrans2 decoder -> Translation
- Critical path: Speech -> Speech encoder -> Aligned interleaving -> IndicTrans2 encoder -> IndicTrans2 decoder -> Translation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Aligned interleaving vs. simple concatenation: Aligned interleaving provides better performance but requires reliable force alignment.
  - Multi-task learning vs. single-task learning: Multi-task learning can improve performance but may also introduce interference between tasks.
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor force alignment leading to incorrect speech-text correspondence
  - Degradation in ASR performance due to the additional ST and MT losses
  - Overfitting to the training data, especially if it's limited
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare aligned interleaving with simple concatenation to verify the importance of alignment.
  2. Train with only ST loss vs. all three losses to verify the effectiveness of multi-task learning.
  3. Evaluate the model's performance on different levels of code-switching to verify its robustness.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the interleaving strategy affect performance compared to other fusion methods?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares interleaving with appending strategies and shows interleaving outperforms them. However, it does not explore other potential fusion methods like attention-based or gated mechanisms.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on interleaving as the primary fusion method and does not extensively compare it with other sophisticated fusion techniques.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing COSTA's interleaving strategy with other fusion methods like attention-based fusion or gated mechanisms on the same datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of the amount of synthetic training data on the model's performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses 30 hours of synthetic training data and shows that the model performs well with this amount. However, it does not explore how varying the amount of synthetic data affects performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests one specific amount of synthetic data and does not provide insights into how the model scales with more or less data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments varying the amount of synthetic training data and evaluating the model's performance on the same datasets.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the model perform on code-switched speech with a higher degree of mixing?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper evaluates the model on code-switched speech with varying degrees of mixing but does not explore extremely high levels of code-switching.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not test the model's limits with very high degrees of code-switching, which could be more challenging.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating the model on datasets with very high degrees of code-switching to assess its robustness and performance degradation.

### Open Question 4
- Question: How does the model handle code-switching between languages other than the ones tested?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper tests the model on four Indian languages code-switched with English. It does not explore the model's performance on code-switching between other language pairs.
- Why unresolved: The paper is limited to a specific set of languages and does not generalize its findings to other language pairs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the model on code-switched speech datasets involving different language pairs to assess its generalization capabilities.

## Limitations
- Limited training data: The model is trained on only 30 hours of synthetic speech-translation pairs per language, which may limit its ability to generalize to diverse real-world scenarios.
- Synthetic data reliance: The use of synthetic data (translated ASR transcripts) for training may not capture the full complexity and variability of natural code-switched speech.
- Evaluation set limitations: While the paper introduces new evaluation sets, their size and diversity may not be sufficient to fully assess the model's performance across all possible code-switched scenarios.

## Confidence
- High confidence: The aligned interleaving mechanism improves translation accuracy compared to baselines. The experimental results consistently show significant improvements in BLEU scores.
- Medium confidence: The model's robustness to varying degrees of code-switching. While the results show low correlation between the number of English words and BLEU scores, the evaluation sets may not cover the full spectrum of code-switching scenarios.
- Medium confidence: The effectiveness of the multi-task learning approach with ST, ASR, and MT losses. The improvements over single-task baselines are significant, but the specific contributions of each loss may vary depending on the task and dataset.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate on larger, more diverse code-switched datasets: Test the model on datasets with a wider range of code-switching scenarios, including different language pairs, code-switching ratios, and domain-specific vocabulary.
2. Ablation study on multi-task learning: Conduct a detailed ablation study to quantify the individual contributions of the ST, ASR, and MT losses to the overall performance. This could involve training models with different combinations of losses and comparing their performance.
3. Human evaluation of translation quality: Complement the automatic BLEU scores with human evaluation of translation quality, focusing on aspects such as fluency, adequacy, and handling of code-switched spans.
