# Morse Code-Enabled Speech Recognition for Individuals with Visual and Hearing Impairments

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2407.14525
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14525
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: WER of 10.18%, accuracy of 89.82% using Google STT + Morse conversion

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a speech recognition system that converts spoken language into Morse code to improve accessibility for individuals with hearing, speech, or cognitive impairments. The system uses Google's speech-to-text technology as the first layer, followed by a Morse code conversion layer that delivers output through tactile vibrations on the user's arm. The model was tested with recorded audio files, achieving a Word Error Rate (WER) of 10.18% and an accuracy of 89.82%, outperforming other speech recognition engines like Bing Speech API and IBM Watson STT. This technology offers a unique solution for people with disabilities to communicate effectively using Morse code through tactile sensations.

## Method Summary
The proposed model employs a two-layer architecture where Google's speech-to-text engine processes audio input using a deep neural network acoustic model and recurrent neural network language model. The resulting text is then converted to Morse code using a dictionary lookup and delivered to users through tactile actuators on their arms. The system was evaluated using recorded audio files with artificially added noise, measuring performance using Word Error Rate and accuracy metrics against ground truth transcriptions.

## Key Results
- Achieved WER of 10.18% and accuracy of 89.82% on recorded audio test dataset
- Outperformed Bing Speech API and IBM Watson STT in accuracy and correctly recognized sentences
- Demonstrated effective conversion of speech to Morse code for potential use by individuals with disabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Speech recognition layer is the bottleneck; its accuracy determines overall system accuracy.
- Mechanism: The model uses Google's speech-to-text as the first layer; all downstream accuracy depends on its WER.
- Core assumption: Google's STT achieves WER ≈ 10.18% on the test dataset, and Morse conversion is lossless.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] states "accuracy of the model is completely dependent on speech recognition, as the morse code conversion is a process."
  - [section II-A] describes Google's STT, DNN-based acoustic model, and RNN-based language model, with WER = 10.18% from Table I.
  - [corpus] shows related works on STT for disabilities but no direct performance validation of Google's model in those studies.
- Break condition: If Google's STT WER rises above ~15% or if input audio quality degrades significantly.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Morse code acts as a universally accessible output medium for users with hearing/speech/cognitive impairments.
- Mechanism: Text output from STT is mapped to Morse via a dictionary, then delivered through tactile vibrations on the arm.
- Core assumption: Users can perceive and decode Morse code via touch; dictionary lookup is exact.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] and [section II-B] describe conversion of text to Morse and tactile delivery on arm surface.
  - [corpus] lists related assistive tools but none use Morse + tactile delivery; gap suggests novelty but no comparative efficacy data.
- Break condition: If users cannot learn or perceive Morse via touch, or if tactile actuator resolution is insufficient.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Dual-layer neural network (acoustic + language) in Google's STT improves robustness over single models.
- Mechanism: Acoustic DNN converts audio spectrogram to phonemes; language RNN refines phoneme sequence into words considering context.
- Core assumption: Both models are pre-trained on large datasets and generalize well to the test speakers.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section II-A1] and [section II-A2] describe the acoustic DNN (TDNN/LSTM) and language RNN (LSTM/Transformer) architecture.
  - [corpus] lacks direct evidence that this dual-layer approach outperforms others in accessibility contexts; only general speech recognition papers are cited.
- Break condition: If acoustic or language model performance drops for accented or impaired speech.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Spectrogram representation of audio signals.
  - Why needed here: Acoustic model input requires time-frequency decomposition of speech.
  - Quick check question: What frequency range is typically captured in a 16 kHz audio spectrogram used for speech recognition?

- Concept: Levenshtein distance / WER calculation.
  - Why needed here: Model accuracy is quantified using WER, which relies on edit distance between reference and hypothesis.
  - Quick check question: If a 20-word transcript has 2 insertions, 1 deletion, and 1 substitution, what is the WER?

- Concept: Morse code encoding rules.
  - Why needed here: Text-to-Morse mapping uses dot/dash timing and inter-character spacing.
  - Quick check question: How many time units separate letters in Morse code timing?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Microphone → Google STT (acoustic DNN + language RNN) → Text → Morse code dictionary lookup → Tactile actuator on arm
- Critical path: Audio capture → STT transcription → Morse conversion → Tactile feedback
- Design tradeoffs: Accuracy vs. real-time latency; tactile resolution vs. actuator complexity; reliance on cloud STT vs. local processing
- Failure signatures: High WER → garbled Morse; actuator malfunction → no tactile output; dictionary mismatch → incorrect symbols
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Record clean speech, run through STT, measure WER vs. ground truth.
  2. Feed STT output to Morse converter, verify dictionary mapping accuracy.
  3. Deliver Morse via actuator, test user perception with known sequences.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal configuration of acoustic and language models to maximize accuracy for individuals with hearing, speech, or cognitive impairments?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the accuracy of the model depends on the speech recognition layer and discusses the general architecture of acoustic and language models, but does not explore optimal configurations for different impairments.
- Why unresolved: The paper uses a general speech recognition system without customizing it for specific impairments, and does not test different model configurations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies testing various acoustic and language model configurations on different impairment groups to determine optimal settings.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does background noise impact the performance of the Morse code-enabled speech recognition system for users with disabilities?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper briefly mentions that recording conditions affect performance but does not specifically test the system under varying noise conditions or with users who have disabilities.
- Why unresolved: The evaluation uses recorded audio files with artificially added noise, but does not test real-world noisy environments or the system's

## Limitations
- Performance tested only on recorded audio files rather than live speech, limiting real-world applicability
- No user studies conducted to validate Morse code comprehension via tactile feedback for target population
- System's performance on impaired speech patterns (slurred, stuttered, or non-standard pronunciation) remains untested

## Confidence

- **High confidence** in the technical implementation of the speech-to-Morse conversion pipeline (audio → STT → text → Morse dictionary lookup).
- **Medium confidence** in the claimed WER of 10.18% based on Google's STT performance, but uncertainty about generalizability to live, varied speech conditions.
- **Low confidence** in the practical accessibility benefits without user studies validating Morse code comprehension via tactile feedback for the target population.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct live user testing with individuals having hearing, speech, or cognitive impairments to measure actual comprehension rates of Morse code delivered through tactile vibrations, comparing against baseline communication methods.
2. Test the system's robustness across diverse speech patterns including impaired speech, accented speech, and background noise conditions to verify WER claims hold outside controlled audio files.
3. Perform comparative usability studies measuring task completion time and accuracy between the Morse-tactile system and existing assistive communication technologies (text-to-speech, sign language translation, etc.) for the target user population.
