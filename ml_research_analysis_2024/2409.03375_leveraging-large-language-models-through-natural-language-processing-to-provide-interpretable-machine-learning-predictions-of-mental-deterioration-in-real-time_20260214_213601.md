# Leveraging Large Language Models through Natural Language Processing to provide interpretable Machine Learning predictions of mental deterioration in real time

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.03375
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03375
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: AI-driven chatbot achieves >80% classification accuracy with ~85% recall for mental deterioration detection in elderly users

## Executive Summary
This study presents an AI-driven chatbot leveraging large language models (LLMs) to provide interpretable, real-time predictions of cognitive decline in elderly users. The system uses prompt engineering to extract linguistic-conceptual features from spontaneous speech, followed by streaming-based machine learning classification and an explainability dashboard for transparent diagnosis. Evaluated on a real-world dataset, the model achieves classification accuracy exceeding 80%, with recall for the mental deterioration class around 85%. The approach offers a non-invasive, affordable, and personalized diagnostic alternative, democratizing access to advanced NLP technologies in public health. Future work includes longitudinal bias measurement and federated learning to enhance privacy and equity.

## Method Summary
The method involves a pipeline where spontaneous speech from elderly users is processed through prompt engineering to extract 22 linguistic-conceptual features (e.g., Amnesia, Fluency, Polarity) using a structured JSON schema with GPT-3.5-turbo. These features undergo stream-based feature engineering (averages, quartiles), selection via variance or correlation thresholding, and incremental learning using algorithms like ALMA, HATC, and ARFC. Predictions are delivered in real-time with an explainability dashboard highlighting the top 5 features driving each decision. The system is evaluated on a dataset of 44 users with an average of 13.66±7.86 conversations per user.

## Key Results
- Classification accuracy exceeding 80% on real-world elderly user dataset
- Recall for mental deterioration class around 85%
- Stream-based ARFC model outperforms batch methods in adaptive feature selection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The system leverages LLM semantic reasoning via prompt engineering to extract clinically relevant linguistic-conceptual features from spontaneous speech.
- Mechanism: Prompt engineering with a structured JSON output schema is used to elicit 22 specific feature values (e.g., "Amnesia", "Fluency", "Polarity") from the LLM, ensuring consistent semantic knowledge extraction across user sessions.
- Core assumption: The LLM's training corpus includes sufficient real-world clinical-linguistic patterns to produce accurate, bounded (0.0-1.0) feature values for cognitive decline indicators.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "linguistic-conceptual features are exploited for appropriate natural language analysis"
  - [section] Listing 1 shows the exact prompt structure and expected JSON schema
  - [corpus] Weak: No corpus evidence directly validates the feature extraction accuracy; all neighbors are different clinical domains
- Break condition: If the LLM lacks training on conversational speech patterns of cognitively impaired individuals, feature extraction will degrade, leading to poor classification performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Stream-based incremental learning with adaptive models maintains real-time prediction performance without expensive retraining.
- Mechanism: The pipeline uses online classifiers (ALMA, HATC, ARFC) that update incrementally with each new conversation, selecting features via variance or correlation thresholding to adapt to changing feature importance over time.
- Core assumption: The feature distribution and class boundaries remain stable enough for online learning to track, while the thresholding dynamically removes irrelevant features.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "stream-based data processing including feature engineering, analysis, and selection; (iii) real-time classification"
  - [section] Algorithm 3 and 4 describe the variance thresholding and incremental training logic
  - [corpus] Missing: No corpus evidence shows how feature stability or drift is measured
- Break concept drift: If the cognitive decline feature space shifts significantly over time (e.g., due to population changes), online models may fail to adapt quickly enough without periodic full retraining.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Explainability through feature importance ranking builds trust and aids clinical decision-making.
- Mechanism: After each prediction, the system identifies the top 5 features with highest absolute values or variance relative to user history, displays them visually with a color-coded scheme, and provides a natural language summary.
- Core assumption: Clinicians and users can interpret and act on the ranked feature list to understand the prediction rationale and detect potential model bias.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Through explainability, we aim to fight potential biases of the models and improve their potential to help clinical workers in their diagnosis decisions"
  - [section] Figure 4 and accompanying text describe the dashboard layout and color scheme
  - [corpus] Missing: No corpus evidence validates clinical acceptance or bias mitigation effectiveness
- Break condition: If feature importance rankings are unstable or misleading, users may lose trust and reject the system, undermining adoption.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Prompt engineering for structured JSON output
  - Why needed here: Ensures consistent, parseable extraction of 22 linguistic-conceptual features from the LLM, avoiding ambiguous or hallucinated responses
  - Quick check question: What JSON schema must the prompt enforce to guarantee all 22 features are returned for each session?

- Concept: Feature selection via variance and correlation thresholding
  - Why needed here: Dynamically removes irrelevant or noisy features in the streaming context, maintaining classifier efficiency and accuracy
  - Quick check question: How is the variance cutoff point computed from the cold-start data?

- Concept: Online incremental learning algorithms (ALMA, HATC, ARFC)
  - Why needed here: Enables real-time classification without full retraining, adapting to evolving feature importance over user sessions
  - Quick check question: Which algorithm among ALMA, HATC, and ARFC showed the best performance in variance-based feature selection?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Chatbot frontend -> Conversation stream -> Prompt engineering -> LLM (gpt-3.5-turbo) -> JSON feature extraction -> Feature engineering (averages, quartiles) -> Feature selection (variance/correlation) -> Stream-based classifier (ALMA/hatc/arfc) -> Prediction output -> Explainability dashboard
- Critical path: Prompt engineering -> LLM inference -> Feature extraction -> Classification -> Explainability display
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Use of GPT-3.5-turbo balances cost and capability vs. GPT-4's higher accuracy but greater expense
  - Variance-based feature selection adapts dynamically but may discard features that become relevant later; correlation-based is more stable but less adaptive
  - Stream-based learning avoids retraining cost but may lag behind batch methods in accuracy
- Failure signatures:
  - LLM returns malformed JSON or missing fields -> Feature extraction fails
  - All features fall below variance threshold -> No features selected for classification
  - Classifier accuracy drops below 80% -> Prompt engineering or feature relevance degraded
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify JSON schema compliance by feeding a known good prompt and checking all 22 features are returned
  2. Test variance thresholding by injecting synthetic sessions with controlled feature variance and confirming selection behavior
  3. Benchmark stream-based ARFC vs. batch Random Forest on a held-out test set to quantify accuracy trade-off

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the development and evaluation of the AI-driven chatbot but does not provide a direct comparison with traditional clinical assessments.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting a study comparing the AI-driven chatbot's performance with traditional clinical assessments like the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) would provide insights into the effectiveness of the linguistic-conceptual features.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of the proposed system on the diagnostic accuracy and efficiency of clinical workers in real-world settings?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions the system's potential to help clinical workers in their diagnosis decisions but does not provide evidence of its impact in real-world settings.
- Why unresolved: The paper evaluates the system's performance using a controlled dataset but does not assess its impact on clinical workers' diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in real-world settings.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting a study involving clinical workers using the system in real-world settings and comparing their diagnostic accuracy and efficiency with traditional methods would provide insights into the system's impact.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed system address potential biases related to gender, race, and socioeconomic status in cognitive decline detection?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions the need to measure bias in future work, particularly related to algorithm design, training data, and ground truth.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the potential for bias but does not provide a detailed plan or evidence of how the system addresses these biases.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting a longitudinal study to measure and mitigate biases related to gender, race, and socioeconomic status in the system's performance would provide insights into its fairness and equity.

## Limitations
- Dataset accessibility: The core experimental dataset (44 users, 13.66±7.86 conversations each) is not publicly available, requiring direct author access for faithful reproduction
- Feature extraction validation: No corpus evidence directly validates the accuracy of LLM-extracted linguistic-conceptual features against clinical ground truth
- Clinical adoption: Missing evidence on whether clinicians actually accept or find useful the explainability dashboard's feature importance rankings for diagnostic decisions

## Confidence

- Mechanism 1 (LLM feature extraction): Medium - Prompt engineering approach is well-specified, but feature accuracy depends entirely on LLM's unseen training corpus coverage
- Mechanism 2 (Stream-based learning): Medium - Algorithm descriptions are complete, but feature stability assumptions lack empirical validation in the paper
- Mechanism 3 (Explainability for trust): Low - Dashboard design is detailed, but no user study or clinical validation demonstrates effectiveness for bias detection or trust-building

## Next Checks

1. **JSON schema compliance test**: Feed the exact prompt template to GPT-3.5-turbo with controlled input text and verify all 22 expected features are returned in proper JSON format with valid value ranges
2. **Feature selection threshold calibration**: Create synthetic sessions with known feature variance patterns and confirm the variance thresholding algorithm selects features as expected across different cutoff values
3. **Clinical relevance pilot**: Conduct a small user study with clinicians reviewing dashboard explanations for sample predictions to assess interpretability and potential bias detection capability
