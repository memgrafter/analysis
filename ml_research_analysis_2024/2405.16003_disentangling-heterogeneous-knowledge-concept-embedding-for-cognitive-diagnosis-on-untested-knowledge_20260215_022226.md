# Disentangling Heterogeneous Knowledge Concept Embedding for Cognitive Diagnosis on Untested Knowledge

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.16003
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16003
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: DisKCD framework improves cognitive diagnosis on untested knowledge concepts with ACC improvements of 5.7-10.8%, RMSE reductions of 0.03-0.09, and AUC improvements of 6.5-15.3% compared to baselines across three real-world datasets.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of cognitive diagnosis on untested knowledge concepts (UKCs) where traditional methods only diagnose tested knowledge concepts (TKCs). The proposed DisKCD framework disentangles knowledge concepts into TKCs and UKCs, learns entity embeddings using course grades, exercise questions, and learning resources, and constructs a heterogeneous relation graph network via students, exercises, TKCs, and UKCs. Through a hierarchical heterogeneous message-passing mechanism, fine-grained relations are incorporated into entity embeddings. The framework demonstrates significant improvements in diagnostic performance on UKCs while enhancing interpretability of results.

## Method Summary
The DisKCD framework tackles cognitive diagnosis on untested knowledge concepts by first disentangling all knowledge concepts into TKCs (covered by exercises) and UKCs (untested). It constructs a heterogeneous relation graph network using students, exercises, TKCs, and UKCs, then employs a hierarchical heterogeneous message-passing mechanism to incorporate fine-grained relations into entity embeddings. The framework uses multimodal inputs including course grades, exercise text (via BiLSTM), and learning resources to generate rich semantic representations. These embeddings are then applied to existing cognitive diagnosis models to infer students' proficiency on UKCs, addressing the gap where standard methods cannot diagnose knowledge areas without direct testing.

## Key Results
- DisKCD achieves ACC improvements of 5.7-10.8% on UKC diagnosis across three real-world datasets
- RMSE reductions of 0.03-0.09 demonstrate improved prediction accuracy for UKCs
- AUC improvements of 6.5-15.3% show enhanced discrimination between proficient and non-proficient students on untested knowledge concepts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Disentangling TKCs from UKCs enables accurate UKC diagnosis with sparse UKC data.
- Mechanism: The framework splits all knowledge concepts into TKCs (covered by exercises) and UKCs (untested). It uses TKCs' embeddings and their relations with UKCs to infer UKC proficiency.
- Core assumption: TKCs and UKCs are semantically related, so TKCs' mastery informs UKC mastery.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "knowledge concepts are disentangled into tested and untested based on the limiting actual exercises."
  - [section 4.2] "In Guu for UKCs there are prerequisite and similarity relations among them."
- Break condition: If TKCs and UKCs are unrelated or if UKCs are completely isolated in the knowledge graph, disentangling will fail.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Hierarchical heterogeneous message-passing propagates fine-grained relations to refine entity embeddings.
- Mechanism: A heterogeneous relation-aware network uses attention to aggregate information from neighbor nodes across multiple relation subgraphs (student-exercise, exercise-TKC, TKC-TKC, TKC-UKC, UKC-UKC).
- Core assumption: Information from different relation types is complementary and improves embeddings.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "through a hierarchical heterogeneous message-passing mechanism, the fine-grained relations are incorporated into the entity embeddings."
  - [section 4.2] "For example, in Guu for UKCs there are prerequisite and similarity relations among them."
- Break condition: If relations are noisy or uninformative, attention aggregation may degrade embedding quality.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Incorporating course grades, exercise text, and learning resources into embeddings provides richer semantic signals.
- Mechanism: Student embeddings use normalized grades; exercise embeddings use BiLSTM on exercise text; concept embeddings use pedagogical resource text.
- Core assumption: Text and grades capture latent knowledge structure that improves diagnosis.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.1] "we gather the text from the final exam exercises to construct embeddings for the exercises based on textual content."
  - [section 4.1] "The content-relevant pedagogical resources...is employed to enhance the semantic representation of knowledge concepts."
- Break condition: If text is irrelevant or grades are noisy, embeddings may be misleading.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph Neural Networks and heterogeneous message-passing
  - Why needed here: The framework uses a heterogeneous graph with multiple relation types; understanding GNNs is essential for grasping the embedding refinement process.
  - Quick check question: In a heterogeneous graph, how does attention weight differ for neighbor nodes under different relations?

- Concept: Cognitive Diagnosis Models (CDMs)
  - Why needed here: The paper builds on and extends multiple CDMs (DINA, IRT, MIRT, NeuralCD, RCD); understanding their structure and assumptions is key to interpreting results.
  - Quick check question: What is the monotonicity assumption in CDMs, and why is it important for interpretability?

- Concept: Knowledge Graph Embeddings
  - Why needed here: The framework learns embeddings for students, exercises, TKCs, and UKCs; understanding embedding methods and their limitations is important for evaluating the approach.
  - Quick check question: How do similarity and prerequisite relations influence embedding learning in a knowledge graph?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Embedding Layer -> Heterogeneous Relation-aware Layer -> Diagnosis Layer
- Critical path: Embedding Layer → Heterogeneous Relation-aware Layer → Diagnosis Layer
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Pros: Addresses UKC diagnosis with limited data, improves interpretability, leverages rich multimodal signals
  - Cons: Computationally expensive (e.g., "Training a CDM on a server with two 48G GPUs takes about six days on average"), relies on accurate relation definitions
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor UKC diagnosis performance: Check if TKCs and UKCs are truly related or if UKC relations are sparse
  - Degraded TKC diagnosis: Verify attention aggregation isn't diluting important TKC signals
  - Overfitting: Monitor if model memorizes training data rather than generalizing to unseen exercises
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline ablation: Run DisKCD with one-hot embeddings instead of learned embeddings to confirm embedding importance
  2. Relation ablation: Remove either similarity or prerequisite relations and measure impact on UKC diagnosis
  3. Cross-dataset validation: Train on JAD/SDP and test on Junyi (or vice versa) to check generalization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would incorporating additional types of knowledge concept relations beyond similarity and prerequisite affect the performance of DisKCD on untested knowledge concepts?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper states that "similarity and prerequisite relations" are used in their work and acknowledges limitations in using only these two types of relations, suggesting future work could explore more diverse knowledge relations.
- Why unresolved: The paper only experiments with similarity and prerequisite relations, not testing other potential relation types like temporal order, alternative representations, or conditional dependencies.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments testing DisKCD with various additional relation types (e.g., temporal, alternative, conditional) on the same datasets to measure performance improvements or degradations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can DisKCD be effectively adapted for zero-shot or few-shot scenarios where there is minimal or no training data for certain knowledge concepts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses limited homework and test practice data as a challenge, and mentions that "Restricted tests lead to undiscovered knowledge deficits," suggesting the need for approaches that work with limited data.
- Why unresolved: While DisKCD addresses untested knowledge concepts, it still requires some training data. The paper doesn't explore scenarios with extremely sparse data or completely new concepts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying DisKCD to datasets with artificially reduced training data, or to entirely new knowledge concepts not present in the training set, measuring diagnostic accuracy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the interpretability of DisKCD's diagnostic results compare to other explainable AI methods specifically designed for educational settings?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions interpretability as a key goal and uses Degree of Agreement (DOA) based on Monotonicity Assumption to assess interpretability, but doesn't compare to other interpretability methods.
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates interpretability using one metric (DOA) without comparing to other interpretability approaches or explainable AI frameworks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies using multiple interpretability metrics and methods (e.g., SHAP values, attention visualization, concept activation vectors) to evaluate DisKCD's explanations against other models in educational contexts.

## Limitations
- The framework's effectiveness depends on the assumption that TKCs and UKCs share meaningful semantic relationships, which may not hold across all educational domains
- The hierarchical heterogeneous message-passing mechanism is computationally expensive, requiring two 48G GPUs for six days of training
- The approach relies heavily on accurate relation definitions and quality multimodal inputs, which may be noisy or incomplete in real-world settings

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The mechanism of disentangling TKCs from UKCs to address the UKC diagnosis problem is well-founded and directly addresses a recognized gap in cognitive diagnosis research.
- **Medium confidence**: The heterogeneous message-passing approach for incorporating fine-grained relations into embeddings is theoretically sound, but its practical effectiveness depends on the quality and relevance of defined relations.
- **Medium confidence**: The multimodal embedding approach (grades, exercise text, learning resources) should improve semantic representation, but its impact may vary significantly based on input quality and domain specificity.

## Next Checks

1. **Generalization test**: Train DisKCD on one dataset (e.g., JAD) and evaluate on another (e.g., SDP) to verify cross-domain applicability and identify potential overfitting to specific educational contexts.

2. **Relation sensitivity analysis**: Systematically remove either similarity or prerequisite relations from the heterogeneous graph and measure the impact on UKC diagnosis performance to quantify each relation type's contribution.

3. **Scalability benchmark**: Measure training time and memory usage on progressively larger subsets of the Junyi dataset to establish computational requirements and identify potential bottlenecks for real-world deployment.
