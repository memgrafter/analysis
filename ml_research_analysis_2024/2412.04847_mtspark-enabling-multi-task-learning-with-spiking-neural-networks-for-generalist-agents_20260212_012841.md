# MTSpark: Enabling Multi-Task Learning with Spiking Neural Networks for Generalist Agents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.04847
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04847
- Authors: Avaneesh Devkota; Rachmad Vidya Wicaksana Putra; Muhammad Shafique
- Reference count: 35
- One-line primary result: MTSpark achieves human-level performance across three Atari games (Pong: -5.4, Breakout: 0.6, and Enduro: 371.2) while significantly outperforming existing methods

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MTSpark, a novel methodology that addresses the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in multi-task reinforcement learning by leveraging spiking neural networks (SNNs) with active dendrites and dueling structures. The approach uses task-specific context signals to modulate neuronal activity, enabling the network to differentiate between tasks while minimizing interference. MTSpark demonstrates competitive performance across three Atari games and three image classification datasets, showing promise for developing generalist agents capable of learning multiple tasks efficiently.

## Method Summary
MTSpark combines spiking neural networks with reinforcement learning, utilizing active dendrites and dueling structures to create specialized sub-networks for each task. The key innovation lies in using task-specific context signals to modulate neuronal activity, allowing the network to adapt to different tasks while minimizing interference. This approach effectively addresses the challenge of catastrophic forgetting when learning multiple tasks sequentially, enabling the network to maintain performance across diverse applications.

## Key Results
- Achieves human-level performance across three Atari games (Pong: -5.4, Breakout: 0.6, and Enduro: 371.2)
- Outperforms existing methods like DQN and DSQN in multi-task learning scenarios
- Demonstrates superior performance in image classification tasks across MNIST (97.5%), Fashion MNIST (86.4%), and CIFAR-10 (56%) datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
MTSpark's effectiveness stems from its ability to leverage task-specific context signals to modulate neuronal activity in spiking neural networks. This mechanism allows the network to differentiate between tasks while minimizing interference, effectively addressing the challenge of catastrophic forgetting. The combination of active dendrites and dueling structures creates specialized sub-networks for each task, enabling efficient multi-task learning without compromising performance.

## Foundational Learning
1. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs): Biological-inspired neural networks that use discrete spikes for information processing. Why needed: To enable more efficient and biologically plausible learning mechanisms. Quick check: SNNs can process temporal information more effectively than traditional ANNs.

2. Active Dendrites: Dendritic structures that can perform non-linear computations. Why needed: To enable complex feature extraction and task-specific adaptations. Quick check: Active dendrites can implement XOR-like functions locally.

3. Dueling Network Architecture: Separates state value and advantage streams in reinforcement learning. Why needed: To enable better value estimation and action selection. Quick check: Dueling architectures improve performance in value-based RL methods.

4. Catastrophic Forgetting: Phenomenon where neural networks forget previously learned tasks when learning new ones. Why needed: Understanding this challenge is crucial for developing effective multi-task learning approaches. Quick check: Standard neural networks show significant performance degradation when learning tasks sequentially.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Task-specific context signals -> SNN with active dendrites -> Dueling network structure -> Task-specific sub-networks

Critical Path:
Context signals → Active dendrites → Value/Advantage streams → Action selection

Design Tradeoffs:
- Computational complexity vs. performance: SNNs with active dendrites are more computationally intensive but offer better multi-task learning capabilities
- Model size vs. specialization: More sub-networks enable better task specialization but increase model complexity
- Context signal granularity vs. interference: More specific context signals reduce interference but may limit generalization

Failure Signatures:
- Performance degradation across tasks when context signals are not properly modulated
- Catastrophic forgetting when task boundaries are not clearly defined
- Suboptimal performance if active dendrites are not properly configured for specific tasks

First Experiments:
1. Evaluate MTSpark's performance on a single task to establish baseline performance
2. Test the impact of context signal granularity on task differentiation and interference
3. Compare performance with and without active dendrites to quantify their contribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation scope remains relatively narrow, focusing on three Atari games and three image classification datasets
- Limited comparison with other state-of-the-art multi-task learning approaches beyond DQN and DSQN
- Lack of detailed analysis on computational efficiency and scalability to larger, more complex task sets

## Confidence
- High confidence: The methodology's ability to reduce catastrophic forgetting in sequential task learning, supported by reported performance improvements over DQN and DSQN
- Medium confidence: The generalizability of the approach to diverse task domains, based on current evaluation scope
- Medium confidence: The effectiveness of task-specific context signals in modulating neuronal activity, as the paper provides limited insight into the mechanism's robustness

## Next Checks
1. Conduct extensive evaluations on a broader range of Atari games and real-world multi-task scenarios to assess generalizability and robustness
2. Perform ablation studies to quantify individual contributions of SNNs, active dendrites, and dueling structures to overall performance gains
3. Investigate computational efficiency and scalability of MTSpark when applied to larger, more complex task sets, comparing resource requirements with other state-of-the-art multi-task learning approaches
