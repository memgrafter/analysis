# Neural Architecture Search of Hybrid Models for NPU-CIM Heterogeneous AR/VR Devices

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.08326
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08326
- Reference count: 40
- This paper presents H4H-NAS, a neural architecture search (NAS) framework for designing efficient hybrid CNN/ViT models for heterogeneous edge AI systems featuring NPU and CIM.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces H4H-NAS, a neural architecture search framework designed to optimize hybrid CNN/ViT models for heterogeneous edge AI systems that combine NPU and CIM (Compute-in-Memory) architectures. The framework addresses the challenge of efficiently executing diverse vision models on resource-constrained AR/VR devices by leveraging architectural heterogeneity and system-level improvements. Through Algo/HW co-design, H4H-NAS achieves significant performance gains while maintaining or improving accuracy on benchmark datasets.

## Method Summary
The H4H-NAS framework employs a systematic approach to neural architecture search by incorporating architectural heterogeneity and system-level optimization. The method utilizes a performance estimator that integrates real silicon NPU results with CIM IP-based performance data to guide the model development process. This performance-driven search space design enables the framework to identify optimal hybrid CNN/ViT architectures that balance accuracy, latency, and energy efficiency. The framework's Algo/HW co-design methodology ensures that the discovered architectures are well-suited for the specific characteristics of NPU-CIM heterogeneous systems.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 1.34% top-1 accuracy improvement on ImageNet compared to baseline solutions
- Reduces latency by up to 56.08% through optimized hybrid model architectures
- Saves up to 41.72% energy consumption while maintaining competitive accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its ability to leverage the complementary strengths of CNN and ViT architectures while optimizing for the specific characteristics of NPU-CIM heterogeneous systems. By incorporating real hardware performance data into the search process, H4H-NAS can identify architectures that are not only accurate but also efficient in terms of latency and energy consumption on the target hardware platform.

## Foundational Learning
- Neural Architecture Search (NAS) - why needed: Automated architecture discovery for optimal performance; quick check: Can reproduce basic NAS search process
- Compute-in-Memory (CIM) - why needed: Enables energy-efficient computation by reducing data movement; quick check: Understand CIM vs traditional Von Neumann architecture
- Heterogeneous Computing - why needed: Leverages different processing units for optimal task execution; quick check: Can identify advantages of NPU vs CIM for different operations
- Algo/HW Co-design - why needed: Ensures software algorithms are optimized for specific hardware characteristics; quick check: Understand how hardware constraints influence algorithm design

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component Map: Search Space -> Performance Estimator -> Architecture Selection -> Validation
- Critical Path: The performance estimator evaluation determines which architectures are selected for further exploration
- Design Tradeoffs: Balancing accuracy gains against latency and energy consumption constraints
- Failure Signatures: Architectures that fail to optimize for hardware-specific characteristics show poor performance on target platform
- First Experiments:
  1. Validate performance estimator accuracy against real hardware measurements
  2. Compare hybrid model performance against pure CNN and pure ViT baselines
  3. Test framework's ability to discover architectures for different vision tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results are primarily validated in simulated environments rather than comprehensive real-world testing
- Limited evaluation to ImageNet classification task, raising questions about generalizability to other vision tasks
- Lack of statistical significance testing for reported performance improvements

## Confidence
- Performance claims: Medium - based on simulated results with real hardware data integration
- Generalization claims: Low - limited to single benchmark task
- Hardware validation: Medium - uses real silicon data but limited real-world testing

## Next Checks
1. Conduct hardware-in-the-loop validation on actual NPU-CIM hardware to verify simulated performance gains
2. Perform ablation studies to isolate contributions of CNN vs. ViT components and determine optimal hybridization ratios for different task types
3. Test framework's effectiveness on diverse vision tasks beyond ImageNet classification to assess generalizability across application domains
