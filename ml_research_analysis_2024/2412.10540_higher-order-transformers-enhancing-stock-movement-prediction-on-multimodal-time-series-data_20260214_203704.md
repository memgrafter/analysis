# Higher Order Transformers: Enhancing Stock Movement Prediction On Multimodal Time-Series Data

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2412.10540
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10540
- **Authors:** Soroush Omranpour; Guillaume Rabusseau; Reihaneh Rabbany
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Achieves 72.9% accuracy, 72.2% F1 score, and 0.516 MCC on Stocknet dataset for stock movement prediction

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Higher Order Transformers, a novel architecture designed to process multivariate time-series data for stock movement prediction. The key innovation extends self-attention to higher orders using tensor decomposition and kernel attention mechanisms to manage computational complexity. The model demonstrates strong performance on the Stocknet dataset, outperforming most baselines while effectively integrating multimodal inputs across both stock and time dimensions.

## Method Summary
The Higher Order Transformer extends standard self-attention by incorporating higher-order interactions through tensor decomposition. The architecture uses CP decomposition to reduce computational complexity from O(L^K d^2) to O(K L d^2), where L is sequence length, K is the order, and d is dimensionality. Kernel attention is employed to further approximate the higher-order attention mechanism while preserving essential relationships. The model processes multimodal inputs (price, volume, sentiment, etc.) and captures dependencies across both temporal and stock dimensions, making it particularly suitable for financial time-series prediction tasks.

## Key Results
- Achieves 72.9% accuracy, 72.2% F1 score, and 0.516 MCC on Stocknet dataset
- Outperforms most baseline models in stock movement prediction
- Ablation studies confirm effectiveness of multimodal inputs and attention across stock and time dimensions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The Higher Order Transformer works by capturing complex interactions in multivariate time-series data that standard transformers miss. By extending self-attention to higher orders, the model can represent multi-way relationships between different stocks and time points simultaneously. The tensor decomposition technique makes these higher-order computations tractable by factorizing the attention tensors into lower-rank components. Kernel attention further reduces computational burden while maintaining the essential higher-order relationships. This combination allows the model to capture richer patterns in financial data, including cross-stock correlations and temporal dependencies that are crucial for accurate stock movement prediction.

## Foundational Learning

**Tensor Decomposition** - Why needed: Reduces computational complexity of higher-order attention from exponential to linear in sequence length. Quick check: Verify CP decomposition preserves essential attention patterns through reconstruction error analysis.

**Kernel Attention** - Why needed: Approximates higher-order attention matrices without explicit computation of all pairwise interactions. Quick check: Compare kernel attention approximation quality against exact higher-order attention on small sequences.

**Multimodal Integration** - Why needed: Financial markets involve multiple data sources (prices, volumes, sentiment) that influence stock movements. Quick check: Measure contribution of each modality through systematic ablation studies.

**Stock-Time Attention** - Why needed: Captures both temporal dependencies and cross-stock relationships simultaneously. Quick check: Visualize attention patterns to verify model focuses on relevant stock pairs and time windows.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input -> Feature Extraction -> Higher Order Attention (via Tensor Decomposition + Kernel Attention) -> Cross-Stock Attention -> Temporal Attention -> Output

**Critical Path:** The core innovation lies in the Higher Order Attention layer, which uses tensor decomposition to manage computational complexity while preserving multi-way interactions. This layer processes the decomposed attention tensors through kernel approximation before combining with standard temporal and cross-stock attention mechanisms.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The model trades some approximation accuracy in higher-order attention for significant computational efficiency gains. The choice of tensor rank and kernel parameters becomes crucial for balancing performance and efficiency.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor performance may indicate: 1) Insufficient tensor rank leading to information loss, 2) Kernel attention parameters not well-tuned for the specific data distribution, 3) Multimodal inputs not properly aligned or normalized.

**Three First Experiments:**
1. Baseline comparison: Test standard transformer vs higher order transformer on small financial dataset
2. Tensor rank ablation: Vary CP decomposition rank to measure impact on accuracy and runtime
3. Multimodal ablation: Remove individual data modalities to quantify their contribution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Computational complexity claims require further validation through practical runtime analysis
- Limited evaluation to single dataset (Stocknet) with no testing across different market conditions
- Missing statistical significance testing and confidence intervals for reported performance metrics

## Confidence

**Architectural innovations:** High confidence - The mathematical formulations are sound and the decomposition approach is well-established

**Experimental results:** Medium confidence - Results show improvement but limited scope and lack of statistical validation reduce generalizability

**Multimodal integration effectiveness:** Medium confidence - Demonstrates improved performance but lacks detailed analysis of individual modality contributions

## Next Checks

1. Conduct experiments on multiple financial datasets across different market conditions with statistical significance testing for all metrics.

2. Perform extensive ablation studies quantifying contributions of higher-order attention, tensor decomposition, and kernel attention approximation, comparing against state-of-the-art time-series transformers.

3. Implement comprehensive runtime analysis measuring memory usage, training time, and inference time across different sequence lengths and dimensionalities, comparing against both standard transformers and efficient attention mechanisms.
