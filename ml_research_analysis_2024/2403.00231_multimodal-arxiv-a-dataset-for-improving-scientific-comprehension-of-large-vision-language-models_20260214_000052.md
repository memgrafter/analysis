# Multimodal ArXiv: A Dataset for Improving Scientific Comprehension of Large Vision-Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2403.00231
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00231
- **Reference count:** 34
- **Primary result:** ArXivQA dataset improves LVLM mathematical reasoning by 10.4% absolute accuracy on MathVista benchmark

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Multimodal ArXiv, a comprehensive dataset designed to enhance large vision-language models' (LVLMs) ability to comprehend scientific figures. The dataset consists of ArXivCap, a large-scale figure-caption collection from 572K arXiv papers, and ArXivQA, a challenging question-answering dataset with 100K questions generated by GPT-4V. The authors demonstrate that fine-tuning LVLMs on ArXivQA significantly improves mathematical reasoning capabilities, achieving a 10.4% absolute accuracy gain on the MathVista benchmark. Additionally, in-domain training on ArXivCap substantially improves performance across four novel vision-to-text tasks, addressing the challenge of understanding abstract scientific figures like plots and geometric shapes.

## Method Summary
The authors constructed ArXivCap by extracting 6.4M figures and 3.9M captions from 572K arXiv papers, applying quality filtering based on caption length and figure count. ArXivQA was generated using GPT-4V to create challenging questions about these figures. They fine-tuned Qwen-VL-Chat-7B on both datasets for 3 epochs with a learning rate of 1e-5. The evaluation included four vision-to-text tasks (single-figure captioning, multiple-figure captioning, contextualized captioning, and title generation) using BLEU-2, ROUGE-L, and BERT-Score metrics, plus mathematical reasoning assessment on MathVista benchmark.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuning on ArXivQA achieved a 10.4% absolute accuracy gain on the MathVista mathematical reasoning benchmark
- In-domain training on ArXivCap led to substantial performance improvements across all four vision-to-text tasks
- BLEU-2 score increased from 4.4 to 8.9 on contextualized captioning after fine-tuning
- Current LVLMs struggle with nuanced academic figures, with only 16% of generated captions deemed acceptable by human evaluation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Fine-tuning LVLMs on ArXivQA improves mathematical reasoning by exposing the model to complex scientific figures with challenging questions. The model learns to interpret abstract figures (plots, diagrams, geometric shapes) and extract relevant information to answer domain-specific questions, improving reasoning skills. This works because ArXivQA contains diverse, high-quality scientific figures and questions that require compositional reasoning.

### Mechanism 2
In-domain training on ArXivCap improves caption generation for scientific figures by providing domain-specific vocabulary and context. The model learns scientific terminology, notation, and conventions from ArXivCap, enabling more accurate and detailed captions. This mechanism assumes ArXivCap covers diverse scientific domains with accurate figure-caption pairs.

### Mechanism 3
The contextualized captioning task evaluates the model's in-context learning ability by requiring it to generate captions based on previous figure-caption pairs. The model leverages contextual information from previous pairs to generate more accurate and coherent captions for new figures, assuming the model can effectively use context to improve caption generation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Multimodal learning
  - Why needed here: The paper deals with LVLMs that process both images and text, requiring an understanding of how to integrate visual and linguistic information.
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of a typical LVLM architecture?

- **Concept:** Scientific figure comprehension
  - Why needed here: The paper focuses on improving LVLMs' ability to understand and interpret scientific figures, which requires domain-specific knowledge and reasoning skills.
  - Quick check question: What are some common challenges in understanding scientific figures?

- **Concept:** Data augmentation
  - Why needed here: The paper uses data augmentation techniques to improve the model's performance on scientific figure understanding tasks.
  - Quick check question: How can data augmentation help improve model performance on specific tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Vision encoder → Modality alignment → LLM backbone → Output
- **Critical path:** Vision encoder → Modality alignment → LLM backbone → Output
- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Single-image vs. interleaved text-image inputs: Different LVLMs have different input formats, affecting their ability to handle contextualized tasks
  - Model scale: Larger models may have better reasoning abilities but require more computational resources
  - Training data: In-domain data (ArXivCap) vs. general data: In-domain data improves scientific figure understanding but may limit generalization
- **Failure signatures:**
  - Recognition errors: The model misidentifies elements in the figure
  - Contextual misinterpretation: The model generates captions relevant to the figure but not accurate for the specific context
  - Oversimplification: The model generates overly generic captions that lack specific details
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Evaluate the model's performance on the single-figure captioning task using BLEU-2, ROUGE-L, and BERT-Score metrics
  2. Fine-tune the model on ArXivCap and evaluate the performance improvement on the same task
  3. Test the model's ability to handle contextualized captioning by providing previous figure-caption pairs as context

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the domain of scientific figures impact the effectiveness of ArXivQA for improving mathematical reasoning in LVLMs? The paper identifies that QA pairs from the Computer Science domain are highly effective, but the relative effectiveness of QA pairs from other domains (e.g., physics, mathematics, condensed matter) on specific tasks is not fully explored.

### Open Question 2
Can the performance of LVLMs on ArXivCap tasks be further improved by incorporating additional context information, such as paper metadata or external knowledge sources? The paper only explores paper title and abstract, leaving uncertainty about whether other context types could enhance performance.

### Open Question 3
How can the limitations of current LVLMs in understanding scientific figures, such as contextual misinterpretation and recognition errors, be addressed through architectural improvements or training strategies? The paper identifies these limitations but doesn't provide specific solutions or approaches to address them.

## Limitations
- Dataset quality depends on GPT-4V's ability to generate meaningful, challenging questions without quantitative evaluation of question quality
- Results are based on fine-tuning Qwen-VL-Chat-7B, with unclear generalizability to other LVLM architectures
- Limited evaluation scope focusing on generation metrics without human evaluation of caption quality or conceptual understanding

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** Dataset construction methodology is clearly specified and reproducible; performance improvements on four vision-to-text tasks are well-documented
- **Medium Confidence:** 10.4% absolute accuracy gain on MathVista is supported but may represent dataset-specific memorization versus genuine reasoning improvement
- **Low Confidence:** Assertion that contextualized captioning effectively evaluates in-context learning lacks strong empirical support

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation of generated captions on ArXivCap test set to assess whether improvements represent genuine scientific understanding versus superficial metric optimization
2. Test fine-tuned models on scientific figure understanding tasks from different domains (biology papers, medical imaging) to evaluate generalizability beyond arXiv corpus
3. Perform systematic analysis of ArXivQA question diversity and difficulty by having domain experts categorize questions by reasoning type and evaluate compositional reasoning requirements
