# Speak It Out: Solving Symbol-Related Problems with Symbol-to-Language Conversion for Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.11725
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11725
- Reference count: 31
- Key outcome: Symbol-to-language (S2L) method consistently improves LLM reasoning on symbol-related tasks by converting symbols to natural language representations, achieving +21.9% accuracy improvement on 1D-ARC and +9.5% on Dyck language subtasks.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the limitation of large language models in reasoning with symbols (numbers, brackets, molecular formulas) compared to natural language. The authors propose symbol-to-language (S2L), a tuning-free method that converts symbol-based representations into language-based ones before passing them to LLMs. S2L can be implemented by prompting LLMs or using external tools like rules or dictionaries. Experiments on eight symbol-related tasks show consistent improvements across GPT-4, ChatGPT, and OpenChat models, with accuracy gains ranging from +3.1% to +21.9% depending on the task.

## Method Summary
The S2L method converts symbols involved in reasoning tasks to language-based representations using either LLM prompting or external tools (rules, translators, dictionaries). Two integration methods are evaluated: direct substitution and concatenation with original symbols. The approach is tested across eight symbol-related tasks under zero-shot and zero-shot-CoT settings, comparing performance to baseline models without S2L conversion.

## Key Results
- GPT-4 accuracy improves by +21.9% and +9.5% on 1D-ARC and Dyck language subtasks, respectively
- S2L consistently leads to superior performance compared to zero-shot and zero-shot-CoT settings across all tasks
- OpenChat-3.5-7B achieves up to +17.2% improvement on 1D-ARC with S2L implementation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Symbol-to-language conversion reduces reasoning errors by replacing low-frequency symbolic representations with high-frequency natural language equivalents that LLMs are better trained to process.
- Mechanism: LLMs have seen vastly more natural language tokens than symbol tokens during pretraining. By converting symbols to natural language descriptions, the model leverages its stronger language understanding capabilities.
- Core assumption: Natural language descriptions are semantically equivalent to original symbol representations.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states effectiveness of language-based representations; section describes S2L conversion process.
- Break condition: If generated descriptions contain errors, hallucinations, or lose critical information.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: S2L provides alignment information that helps LLMs understand relationships between symbols.
- Mechanism: Natural language conversion explicitly represents relationships (e.g., "open" and "close" bracket pairs) that may be implicit in symbol representations.
- Core assumption: LLMs can effectively use additional alignment information from natural language descriptions.
- Evidence anchors: Section mentions aligned information is difficult to extract from symbol-based representations; example of bracket alignment.
- Break condition: If alignment information is incorrect or incomplete.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: S2L provides co-occurrence information between symbols and task-level labels.
- Mechanism: Natural language descriptions include contextual information that co-occurs with task labels (e.g., emoji descriptions co-occurring with emotional dimensions).
- Core assumption: Co-occurrence patterns in natural language descriptions are consistent and meaningful for learning symbol-to-semantics mapping.
- Evidence anchors: Section describes co-occurrence information between contexts and task-level labels; example of emoji descriptions.
- Break condition: If co-occurrence patterns are inconsistent or LLM cannot effectively learn from them.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Semantic equivalence between symbols and their natural language descriptions
  - Why needed here: S2L effectiveness depends on converted descriptions accurately representing original symbol meaning
  - Quick check question: If the symbol "CCCO" represents a molecular structure, what would be an appropriate natural language description that preserves the chemical meaning?

- Concept: Chain-of-thought prompting and its limitations
  - Why needed here: Paper compares S2L against zero-shot-CoT baseline
  - Quick check question: In which scenarios did the paper find that zero-shot-CoT actually decreased performance compared to zero-shot?

- Concept: Data distribution and frequency effects in LLM training
  - Why needed here: Paper's explanation for why LLMs struggle with symbols relates to their underrepresentation in training data
  - Quick check question: Why would a symbol like "U+1F62D" (crying face emoji) be less likely to appear in LLM training data compared to natural language descriptions of emotions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Symbol input → S2L conversion module → Natural language representation → LLM reasoning → Output generation
- Two conversion approaches: LLM-based prompting and rule/tool-based conversion
- Two integration methods: direct substitution and concatenation with original symbols
- Critical path: S2L conversion step, as errors here propagate to final output
- Design tradeoffs:
  - LLM-based vs rule-based conversion: LLM-based is more flexible but potentially hallucinatory and expensive; rule-based is deterministic but limited to known symbol types
  - Direct substitution vs concatenation: Substitution is cleaner but may lose information; concatenation preserves original symbols but adds complexity
- Failure signatures:
  - Inaccurate symbol descriptions from LLM-based conversion
  - Loss of critical information during conversion
  - Inconsistent co-occurrence patterns
  - LLM inability to effectively use alignment information
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement S2L conversion for Dyck language task using rule-based conversion, then test with both substitution and concatenation approaches
  2. Compare GPT-4 performance on 1D-ARC with and without S2L using counting rule-based conversion
  3. Test S2L on emoji emotion analysis using both LLM-based and dictionary-based conversion approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the effectiveness of S2L vary across different types of symbols (numerical sequences, molecular formulas, emojis, table delimiters, abbreviations)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses effectiveness across various symbol-related tasks including abstract reasoning, Dyck language, property prediction, emoji emotion analysis, table QA, and social media sentiment/stance detection.
- Why unresolved: Paper provides overall performance improvements but doesn't delve into relative effectiveness for each symbol type.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis comparing performance gains of S2L across different symbol types with statistical significance testing.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the limitations of S2L when dealing with complex symbol-based problems difficult to convert into natural language descriptions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Paper mentions not all non-natural language representations can be easily converted, and S2L might struggle with original 2D visual problems from ARC dataset.
- Why unresolved: Paper acknowledges limitations but doesn't explore them in depth or provide potential solutions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies of complex symbol-based problems that S2L struggles with, along with proposed strategies to address these limitations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does S2L performance compare to other methods for improving LLM reasoning on symbol-related problems (fine-tuning, symbolic module integration)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper mentions S2L consistently leads to superior performance compared to zero-shot and zero-shot-CoT settings but doesn't compare to other methods like fine-tuning.
- Why unresolved: Paper focuses on S2L effectiveness but doesn't provide comprehensive comparison with other approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing S2L performance to other methods on same symbol-related tasks using standardized evaluation metrics.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What potential biases or errors are introduced by S2L conversion process, especially when using LLMs for conversion, and how can these be mitigated?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper mentions responses during S2L conversion may not be the same among different LLMs and LLM-generated descriptions might contain hallucinations or misleading information.
- Why unresolved: Paper acknowledges potential for errors but doesn't explore types of biases or propose mitigation strategies.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of types of errors and biases introduced by S2L conversion, along with proposed techniques to improve accuracy and reliability.

### Open Question 5
- Question: How does S2L performance scale with size and complexity of symbol-related problems, and are there diminishing returns or thresholds where method becomes less effective?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Paper shows S2L improves performance on various tasks but doesn't explore how effectiveness scales with problem size or complexity.
- Why unresolved: Paper provides performance results for individual tasks but doesn't investigate scalability or potential limitations as problem complexity increases.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments evaluating S2L performance on increasingly complex symbol-related problems, focusing on identifying thresholds or patterns in effectiveness.

## Limitations
- Exact prompt templates and conversion rules for each task are not fully specified, making exact replication challenging
- Evaluation metrics for some tasks lack detail, particularly Pearson correlation calculation for emoji emotion analysis
- Paper does not investigate when S2L might fail or produce incorrect conversions, especially for complex or ambiguous symbols

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Experimental results showing consistent improvements across multiple models (GPT-4, ChatGPT, OpenChat) and diverse tasks are well-supported by reported metrics
- **Medium Confidence**: Proposed mechanisms (alignment information, co-occurrence patterns, frequency effects) are plausible given results but lack direct empirical evidence
- **Low Confidence**: Generalizability of S2L to unseen symbol types or more complex reasoning tasks is not demonstrated

## Next Checks
1. **Semantic Equivalence Validation**: Conduct human evaluation study where annotators rate semantic accuracy of S2L-generated natural language descriptions against original symbol representations across all task types
2. **Failure Mode Analysis**: Systematically test S2L on edge cases and ambiguous symbols (context-dependent abbreviations, polysemous emojis, complex molecular structures) to identify where conversion fails and quantify impact on downstream reasoning performance
3. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Measure computational overhead of LLM-based vs rule-based S2L conversion methods across tasks, and determine performance trade-off threshold where rule-based methods become preferable to LLM-based approaches for practical deployment
