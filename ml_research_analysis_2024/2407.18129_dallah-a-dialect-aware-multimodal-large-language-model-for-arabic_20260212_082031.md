# Dallah: A Dialect-Aware Multimodal Large Language Model for Arabic

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.18129
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18129
- Authors: Fakhraddin Alwajih; Gagan Bhatia; Muhammad Abdul-Mageed
- Reference count: 11
- Key outcome: Dallah is a multimodal large language model designed to handle Arabic dialects in image-to-text tasks. It integrates LLaVA with AraLLaMA and fine-tunes six Arabic dialects using translated and filtered datasets. Dallah achieves state-of-the-art performance on Arabic benchmarks, outperforming models like Peacock and PALO. Human evaluations confirm its effectiveness in dialect authenticity and content accuracy, highlighting its potential for Arabic NLP applications.

## Executive Summary
Dallah is a dialect-aware multimodal large language model that processes both visual and textual Arabic content across six major Arabic dialects. The model builds upon LLaVA architecture by integrating AraLLaMA as its language backbone and fine-tuning on carefully curated dialectal datasets. Through a three-stage training process involving pretraining, instruction tuning, and dialect fine-tuning, Dallah achieves state-of-the-art performance on Arabic benchmarks while maintaining strong dialect authenticity and content accuracy.

## Method Summary
Dallah follows a three-stage training approach: (1) Pretraining with a projector fine-tuning stage using 800k samples from the LLaVA-Pretrain dataset, (2) Instruction tuning with LoRA on the LLM using 289k samples combining LLaVA-Instruct datasets in English and Arabic, and (3) Dialect fine-tuning with LoRA on LLM using 1.1M samples across six Arabic dialects. The model uses CLIP-ViT-L/14 for vision encoding, a two-layer MLP projector, and AraLLaMA as the language model. Training data undergoes translation and filtering with an 80% similarity threshold to ensure quality.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Arabic benchmarks, outperforming models like Peacock and PALO
- Demonstrates strong dialect authenticity and content accuracy in human evaluations across six Arabic dialects
- Successfully handles complex dialectal interactions incorporating both textual and visual elements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Dallah's dialect-aware fine-tuning with human-translated dialectal data improves dialect authenticity and content accuracy compared to models using generic multilingual LLMs.
- Mechanism: Fine-tuning the base LLaVA model with high-quality, human-translated dialectal data from six Arabic-speaking regions enables the model to capture linguistic nuances and idiomatic expressions specific to each dialect.
- Core assumption: Human translators can accurately convey the meaning and style of the original MSA text in their respective dialects.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Through fine-tuning six Arabic dialects, Dallah showcases its capability to handle complex dialectal interactions incorporating both textual and visual elements."
  - [section]: "Dallah is trained on high-quality human-translated dialectal data."
- Break condition: If human translators introduce errors or inconsistencies in the dialectal translations, or if the dialectal data does not cover a wide enough range of linguistic features, the model's performance may suffer.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Dallah's careful data filtering process ensures the quality of the Arabic dataset used for training, leading to improved model performance.
- Mechanism: The translation and filtering pipeline removes examples with low similarity scores between the original English text and back-translated English text, ensuring that only high-quality translations are retained for training.
- Core assumption: The similarity threshold of 80% is sufficient to filter out low-quality translations while retaining accurate ones.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "During the filtering stage, we ensure the quality of our translations by employing a sentence embedding model... retaining only those translations that meet our quality standards."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; corpus does not provide direct evidence of the filtering process's effectiveness.
- Break condition: If the similarity threshold is too strict or too lenient, or if the embedding model used for filtering is not accurate enough, the filtering process may not effectively remove low-quality translations.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Dallah's use of AraLLaMA as the underlying language model gives it an advantage over models using other multilingual LLMs, such as Vicuna.
- Mechanism: AraLLaMA is specifically designed for Arabic language processing, providing better support for Arabic dialects and linguistic features compared to more general multilingual LLMs.
- Core assumption: AraLLaMA's architecture and training are optimized for Arabic, making it more suitable for handling Arabic dialects than other multilingual LLMs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Both models share the same LLaVA architecture but differ in their LLMs; Dallah uses AraLLaMA, an Arabic LLM, giving it an advantage, whereas PALO utilizes Vicuna, a multilingual LLM based on LLaMa-2."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; corpus does not provide direct evidence of AraLLaMA's superiority over other multilingual LLMs.
- Break condition: If AraLLaMA's performance on Arabic dialects is not significantly better than other multilingual LLMs, or if the difference in LLM choice does not significantly impact the model's overall performance, this mechanism may not hold.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Arabic dialects and their linguistic features
  - Why needed here: Understanding the differences between MSA and various Arabic dialects is crucial for developing a dialect-aware multimodal language model like Dallah.
  - Quick check question: Can you name at least three major Arabic dialects and describe their key linguistic features?

- Concept: Multimodal language models and their components
  - Why needed here: Familiarity with the architecture and functioning of multimodal language models is essential for understanding how Dallah processes both textual and visual information.
  - Quick check question: What are the main components of a multimodal language model, and how do they interact to process multimodal inputs?

- Concept: Data filtering and quality control in machine learning
  - Why needed here: The quality of the training data directly impacts the performance of the model, making data filtering and quality control crucial steps in the development process.
  - Quick check question: What are some common techniques for filtering and ensuring the quality of training data in machine learning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Image → Vision encoder (CLIP-ViT-L/14) → Projector (two-layer MLP) → Language model (AraLLaMA) → Output text
- Critical path: Image → Vision encoder → Projector → Language model → Output text
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using a frozen vision encoder vs. fine-tuning it for specific tasks
  - Employing a two-layer MLP as the projector vs. more complex architectures
  - Using AraLLaMA vs. other multilingual LLMs
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor image understanding: Incorrect or irrelevant visual tokens generated by the vision encoder
  - Inconsistent dialect handling: Responses mixing MSA and dialectal features inappropriately
  - Hallucinations: Generating inaccurate or fabricated information
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the model's ability to describe images in MSA and compare its performance to baseline models.
  2. Evaluate the model's dialect authenticity and content accuracy on the Dallah-Bench dataset.
  3. Assess the model's performance on dialectal tasks compared to its performance on MSA tasks.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the choice of dialect translation strategy (human vs. automated) impact Dallah's performance across different Arabic dialects?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper describes using human translators for dialect translation, but does not compare this approach to automated methods or analyze the impact of translation strategy on model performance.
- Why unresolved: The authors only mention using human translators for dialect translation without exploring or comparing alternative approaches. There is no analysis of how different translation strategies might affect model accuracy or dialect authenticity.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study testing Dallah with dialect data translated using different methods (human, automated, hybrid) while measuring performance across dialect benchmarks would clarify the impact of translation strategy.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between dialect-specific and MSA data for achieving maximum performance across all Arabic dialects?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions fine-tuning on both dialectal and MSA data but does not explore the optimal ratio or balance between these two types of data for training.
- Why unresolved: The authors use dialectal data alongside MSA data but do not investigate how varying the proportion of each type affects overall model performance across different dialects.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying the ratio of dialect-specific to MSA data in training while measuring performance across all dialect benchmarks would identify the optimal balance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does Dallah's performance on dialect authenticity compare to its performance on content accuracy across different dialects?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors report separate scores for dialect authenticity and content accuracy in Table 3, but do not analyze the relationship between these two metrics or identify patterns across dialects.
- Why unresolved: While the paper presents both dialect authenticity and content accuracy scores, it does not analyze potential trade-offs or correlations between these metrics, nor does it identify which dialects show particular strengths or weaknesses in each area.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis correlating dialect authenticity and content accuracy scores across all dialects, identifying patterns of strength and weakness, would clarify the relationship between these two aspects of performance.

## Limitations

- Data quality validation remains uncertain as the paper lacks detailed verification of translation accuracy beyond the 80% similarity threshold
- Generalization beyond benchmarks is unclear as the model may be overfitted to benchmark-specific patterns rather than real-world dialect complexity
- Comparison fairness is questionable as differences in model size, training data, and evaluation methodologies may influence the claimed superiority

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Claims about the technical architecture (CLIP-ViT-L/14 encoder, AraLLaMA backbone, LoRA fine-tuning) are well-specified and reproducible.
- **Medium Confidence**: Performance improvements over baselines are documented but may be influenced by benchmark-specific optimizations rather than general dialect understanding.
- **Low Confidence**: Claims about human evaluation superiority lack detailed methodology and statistical validation of evaluation consistency.

## Next Checks

1. Cross-Dialect Generalization: Test Dallah on dialect pairs not present in the training data (e.g., Moroccan → Yemeni) to verify it learns dialect patterns rather than memorizing specific examples.

2. Human Evaluation Replication: Conduct independent human evaluations using a different evaluator pool to verify the claimed superiority in dialect authenticity and content accuracy.

3. Adversarial Testing: Create test cases with ambiguous dialectal features or code-switching to assess whether the model maintains consistent dialect authenticity under challenging conditions.
