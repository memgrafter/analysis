## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive, task-centric overview of mechanistic interpretability (MI) for transformer-based language models. It organizes MI research around three fundamental objects of study—features, circuits, and universality—and offers actionable workflows for each. The survey covers major MI techniques (e.g., vocabulary projection, intervention, SAEs) and their technical advancements, along with detailed case studies and evaluations. It bridges theory and practice by mapping prior research to the proposed roadmap, aiding newcomers in quickly grasping the field and helping practitioners select appropriate methods. The survey also discusses findings on LM capabilities (e.g., reasoning, knowledge mechanisms), practical applications (e.g., model enhancement, AI safety), and future research directions. It highlights current challenges like scalability and the need for standardized benchmarks, while emphasizing the importance of practical utility and automated hypothesis generation.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a task-centric organization framework that categorizes MI research questions into three fundamental objects of study: features, circuits, and universality. For each object, it provides actionable workflows that map specific research questions to appropriate techniques and evaluation methods. The survey systematically reviews MI techniques including vocabulary projection, intervention-based methods, sparse autoencoders, and more, presenting each with basic concepts, interpretation methods, and recent technical advancements. Case studies are used to demonstrate practical applications of the workflows, while the evaluation section discusses both human and automated assessment approaches.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The survey's task-centric roadmap helps beginners quickly identify impactful MI problems aligned with their interests.
- Mechanism: By organizing MI research around three fundamental objects (features, circuits, universality) and providing actionable workflows for each, the roadmap bridges theory and practice.
- Core assumption: Beginners benefit from structured, problem-focused guidance rather than technique-centric approaches.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "organizing the taxonomy of MI research around specific research questions or tasks" and "actionable workflows for each"
  - [section 4.2]: "enables readers new to the field to quickly identify problems of their interest"
  - [corpus]: Weak corpus evidence (average neighbor FMR=0.456) suggests this mechanism isn't widely validated in related literature

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The survey bridges the gap between MI and other interpretability sub-fields by clarifying definitions and connections.
- Mechanism: Explicitly addresses how MI differs from related fields like probing and attention analysis, while adopting a broad technical definition of MI.
- Core assumption: Confusion about MI's distinctiveness from other interpretability approaches creates barriers to entry and integration.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.3]: "in practice, the boundaries between the two approaches often blur" and "lack of clarity has led to confusion within the community"
  - [abstract]: "There has not been work that comprehensively reviews these insights and challenges, particularly as a guide for newcomers"
  - [corpus]: Missing explicit corpus evidence for this bridging mechanism

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The survey's comprehensive coverage of MI techniques and their technical advancements helps practitioners select appropriate methods.
- Mechanism: For each technique, the survey presents basic concepts, technique-specific interpretation, and recent advancements including limitations and solutions.
- Core assumption: Practitioners need detailed technical understanding to make informed method selection decisions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "organizes our survey in a task-centric format, which is enabled by beginner's roadmap to MI" and "bridges the workflow concepts and practices through case studies"
  - [section 5]: Each technique section follows the structure of "basic concepts, technique-specific interpretation, and recent advancements"
  - [corpus]: Weak corpus evidence suggests this comprehensive approach isn't well-represented in related surveys

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Mechanistic Interpretability (MI)
  - Why needed here: MI is the core field being surveyed, and understanding its definition and goals is essential for navigating the rest of the content
  - Quick check question: What is the primary goal of mechanistic interpretability according to the survey?
  - Answer: To reverse-engineer the detailed computations performed by a model into human-understandable algorithms

- Concept: Transformer-based Language Models (LMs)
  - Why needed here: The survey focuses specifically on MI for transformer-based LMs, so understanding their architecture is crucial
  - Quick check question: What are the three main components of a transformer layer according to the survey?
  - Answer: Multi-head attention (MHA) sublayer, feed-forward (FF) sublayer, and residual connections

- Concept: Features, Circuits, and Universality
  - Why needed here: These are the three fundamental objects of study in MI that structure the entire survey
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a feature and a circuit in MI?
  - Answer: Features are human-interpretable input properties encoded in LM activations, while circuits are meaningful computational pathways connecting features and facilitating specific LM behaviors

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Survey structure: Introduction → Related Work → Background → What is MI? → Techniques and Evaluation → Beginner's Roadmap → Case Studies → Findings and Applications → Discussion and Future Work
  Key sections for new engineers: Section 4 (fundamental objects), Section 5 (techniques), Section 6 (roadmap with workflows)

- Critical path:
  1. Read Section 4 to understand the three fundamental objects of MI study
  2. Review Section 5 to learn available techniques and their capabilities/limitations
  3. Study Section 6 to understand the task-centric workflows and how techniques apply to different research questions
  4. Examine Section 7 case studies to see practical applications of the roadmap

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Task-centric vs. technique-centric organization: Task-centric helps beginners identify problems but may obscure technique relationships
  - Comprehensive coverage vs. focused depth: Broad coverage helps practitioners choose methods but may sacrifice detailed technical depth on individual techniques
  - Human vs. automated evaluation: Human evaluation provides gold standard but is time-consuming; automated methods scale but may miss nuances

- Failure signatures:
  - If beginners still feel overwhelmed after reading the roadmap section
  - If practitioners cannot find appropriate techniques for their specific research questions
  - If the survey's definitions of MI don't align with community usage

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate a simple feature study using probing on a small LM to verify understanding of the workflow
  2. Apply vocabulary projection to intermediate activations of a toy LM to practice interpretation techniques
  3. Use intervention-based methods to localize important components in a simple circuit discovery task

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How universal are SAE-extracted features across transformer architectures and scales?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the need for further research on feature universality and mentions that only 1-5% of neurons in randomly initialized GPT-2 models exhibit universality.
- Why unresolved: Current SAE studies show high similarity across models, but the degree of universality remains unexplored, particularly regarding initialization, model size, and training regimes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic studies comparing SAE-extracted features across diverse transformer architectures (different sizes, initialization methods, and training datasets) using standardized metrics like pairwise Pearson correlation.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can automated hypothesis generation methods effectively replace human intuition in mechanistic interpretability?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies the laborious and non-scalable process of human hypothesis generation as a bottleneck, suggesting the need for automated methods.
- Why unresolved: While some automated methods exist, the paper notes that human intuition is still crucial for formulating plausible hypotheses, particularly in circuit studies.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies demonstrating the effectiveness of automated hypothesis generation methods against human-generated hypotheses in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability across various LM behaviors.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do higher-level propositional representations emerge from lower-level feature combinations in language models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the need for decoding higher-level propositions from activations, citing Feng & Steinhardt (2023) as an example of investigating how individual features combine to form higher-level concepts.
- Why unresolved: Current feature studies focus on decoding low-level input properties, while the emergence of higher-level concepts like safety-relevant propositions remains unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies demonstrating the mechanisms by which language models combine lower-level features to form higher-level propositions, potentially using techniques like binding vectors or other compositional representations.
