# You Never Know: Quantization Induces Inconsistent Biases in Vision-Language Foundation Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2410.20265
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20265
- **Reference count**: 9
- **Key outcome**: Quantization does not consistently amplify or reduce bias in vision-language models, with effects varying across models, datasets, and demographic groups.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the impact of quantization—a common model compression technique—on fairness outcomes in vision-language foundation models, specifically CLIP variants. While prior research consistently found that compression amplifies social biases in unimodal models, this study reveals a surprising inconsistency: quantization does not uniformly amplify or reduce bias across different CLIP models, datasets, and demographic groups. The authors evaluate four quantization settings (8-bit and 4-bit from HuggingFace, 8-bit from PyTorch) across three CLIP variants trained on different datasets, using three fairness benchmarks: FACET (zero-shot classification with demographic attributes), FairFace (image retrieval skew analysis), and standard accuracy metrics (ImageNet, COCO). Key results show that while individual quantized models exhibit bias, there is no consistent pattern of bias amplification or reduction across the model population. These findings challenge assumptions about compression-induced bias generalization and suggest fairness impacts in multimodal contexts may be more nuanced than previously thought.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates three CLIP variants (B/32, B/16, L/14) trained on three datasets (OpenAI WIT, LAION-2B, DataComp-XL) with four quantization methods (HuggingFace 8-bit, HuggingFace 4-bit, PyTorch 8-bit). Models are evaluated on ImageNet for accuracy, COCO for retrieval recall, FACET for classification fairness disparities across demographic groups, and FairFace for skew analysis in retrieval. Statistical significance is assessed using paired t-tests comparing original and quantized models. The evaluation covers 32 scenarios across different quantization methods, model variants, and datasets to identify patterns in bias changes.

## Key Results
- Quantization does not consistently amplify or reduce bias across CLIP variants—some models show minor bias changes while others show no significant change
- Bias effects vary by demographic group, with different subgroups showing opposite responses to the same quantization method
- The inconsistent bias patterns observed in multimodal models contrast with previous findings in unimodal models where compression consistently amplified bias
- Statistical significance of bias changes is observed but the practical magnitude of these changes remains limited

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Quantization-induced bias in vision-language models is inconsistent across demographic groups
- Mechanism: Different demographic subgroups have varying sensitivity to numerical perturbations introduced during quantization, leading to heterogeneous bias effects that don't follow a uniform pattern
- Core assumption: Demographic groups (gender, skin tone, age) have distinct feature distributions that interact differently with quantization-induced perturbations in the model's weight matrices
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "while individual models demonstrate bias, we find no consistent change in bias magnitude or direction across a population of compressed models due to quantization"
  - [section 3] "The disparities across different demographic groups vary, with some quantization methods leading to minor but somewhat statistically significant changes"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - only 1 related paper on quantization and bias directly (How Quantization Shapes Bias in Large Language Models)
- Break condition: If all demographic groups show consistent bias amplification or reduction patterns, or if quantization effects are uniform across all subgroups

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Different quantization methods produce varying bias effects in vision-language models
- Mechanism: Each quantization technique (HuggingFace 8-bit, HuggingFace 4-bit, PyTorch 8-bit) introduces different types of numerical perturbations that interact uniquely with the model's learned representations
- Core assumption: The specific quantization algorithm and bit-width affect how weight distributions are preserved or distorted during compression
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "our extensive evaluation of four quantization settings across three datasets and three CLIP variants yields a surprising result"
  - [section 2] Detailed description of different quantization methods (bitsandbytes vs PyTorch approaches)
  - [corpus] No direct evidence - this appears to be a novel finding specific to multimodal models
- Break condition: If all quantization methods produce identical bias patterns or if method differences are negligible

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multimodal models exhibit different bias patterns under compression compared to unimodal models
- Mechanism: The interaction between visual and language modalities creates complex feature representations that respond differently to quantization than single-modality models
- Core assumption: Cross-modal alignment learned during pretraining creates dependencies that make the model more or less sensitive to compression artifacts
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "In contrast to prior findings with unimodal models that compression consistently amplifies social biases"
  - [section 1] "Most work studies compression-induced bias in the unimodal setting" vs "no work to date has studied the fairness impacts of compression for multimodal ViL models"
  - [corpus] Strong evidence - multiple papers on unimodal compression bias, but this appears to be first multimodal study
- Break condition: If multimodal models show identical bias amplification patterns to unimodal models under compression

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Statistical hypothesis testing and paired t-tests
  - Why needed here: The paper uses paired t-tests to assess whether bias changes are statistically significant between original and quantized models
  - Quick check question: If a paired t-test yields p=0.08, is this result significant at the 95% confidence level?

- Concept: Disparate impact measurement and fairness metrics
  - Why needed here: Understanding how bias is quantified through metrics like disparity, MaxSkew, and MinSkew is essential for interpreting results
  - Quick check question: What does a MaxSkew value of 0.5 indicate about representation fairness in image retrieval?

- Concept: Vision-language model architecture and CLIP framework
  - Why needed here: The study focuses on CLIP models, requiring understanding of how image and text encoders are trained jointly for alignment
  - Quick check question: In CLIP, what is the role of the contrastive loss function during training?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Base CLIP model (ViT variants with different sequence lengths)
  - Quantization layer (HuggingFace 8-bit, HuggingFace 4-bit, PyTorch 8-bit)
  - Evaluation pipeline (FACET for classification bias, FairFace for retrieval bias, ImageNet/COCO for accuracy)
  - Statistical analysis module (paired t-tests for significance testing)

- Critical path:
  1. Load base CLIP model and quantized variants
  2. Run zero-shot classification on ImageNet
  3. Run image retrieval on COCO
  4. Evaluate FACET for classification fairness
  5. Evaluate FairFace for retrieval fairness
  6. Compute statistical significance of bias changes

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy preservation vs. compression efficiency
  - Comprehensive evaluation vs. computational cost (testing 32 scenarios)
  - Statistical significance vs. practical relevance (minor but significant changes)

- Failure signatures:
  - Random predictions from quantized models (trivial fairness fulfillment)
  - Extremely high p-values (>0.1) across all tests indicating no bias sensitivity to quantization
  - Complete loss of accuracy (>20% drop) suggesting quantization failure

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline: Run original CLIP model on FACET with all demographic groups to establish baseline disparities
  2. Method comparison: Apply HuggingFace 8-bit quantization to all three CLIP variants and measure bias changes
  3. Bit-width analysis: Compare HuggingFace 8-bit vs 4-bit quantization on the same model to isolate bit-width effects

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does quantization consistently amplify or reduce bias in other multimodal foundation models beyond CLIP, such as BLIP or other VQA architectures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that their evaluations are limited to CLIP models and suggest future work should examine other architectures like BLIP
- Why unresolved: The study only examines CLIP variants, leaving open whether the inconsistent bias patterns observed would generalize to other multimodal architectures
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic evaluation of quantization effects on bias across multiple multimodal model architectures using the same fairness benchmarks

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do advanced compression techniques beyond quantization (such as pruning or distillation) affect fairness outcomes in vision-language models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors identify this as a limitation, noting their study focuses specifically on quantization while advanced compression methods remain unexplored
- Why unresolved: The paper's findings cannot be generalized to other compression methods that may introduce different types of perturbations to model parameters
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of bias outcomes across multiple compression techniques applied to the same set of vision-language models

### Open Question 3
- Question: Are there specific model architecture or training dataset characteristics that predict whether quantization will amplify, reduce, or leave unchanged the bias in vision-language models?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The study finds inconsistent bias patterns across different CLIP variants trained on different datasets (OpenAI WIT, LAION-2B, DataComp-XL), suggesting potential relationships between model characteristics and quantization effects
- Why unresolved: The paper observes inconsistent patterns but does not systematically analyze which factors (architecture size, training data composition, etc.) correlate with bias outcomes
- What evidence would resolve it: Correlation analysis between model/training characteristics and bias changes, potentially identifying architectural or dataset features that predict quantization's impact on fairness

## Limitations

- The study only examines three CLIP variants and three quantization methods, limiting generalizability to other multimodal architectures and compression techniques
- Statistical significance of minor bias changes may not translate to practically meaningful fairness improvements in real-world applications
- The analysis focuses on post-quantization model behavior without examining underlying mechanisms driving bias changes in weight matrices or feature representations

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The methodology for evaluating quantization impacts on fairness metrics is rigorous and well-documented. The finding that quantization does not uniformly amplify or reduce bias represents a clear empirical result.
- **Medium Confidence**: The interpretation that multimodal models behave differently from unimodal models under compression is plausible but requires additional validation across more model families and compression techniques.
- **Low Confidence**: The specific mechanisms explaining why different demographic groups show varying sensitivity to quantization remain speculative and would benefit from more granular analysis of feature representations.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-architecture validation**: Test the same quantization methods on other multimodal models (e.g., Flamingo, BLIP) to determine if the inconsistent bias patterns generalize beyond CLIP variants.
2. **Feature-level analysis**: Conduct ablation studies examining which layers or attention heads show the most significant bias changes under quantization to identify potential causal mechanisms.
3. **Real-world deployment assessment**: Evaluate quantized models on practical fairness benchmarks with human-in-the-loop validation to assess whether statistically significant bias changes have practical implications for deployment scenarios.
