# A Deep Q-Network Based on Radial Basis Functions for Multi-Echelon Inventory Management

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.15872
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15872
- Authors: Liqiang Cheng; Jun Luo; Weiwei Fan; Yidong Zhang; Yuan Li
- Reference count: 2
- Primary result: RBF-based deep Q-network outperforms base-stock policy in multi-echelon systems with multiple retailers while matching near-optimal performance in serial systems

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel deep Q-network approach using radial basis functions (RBF) for dynamic inventory management in multi-echelon supply chains. The RBF-based architecture offers a simplified structure that eliminates the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning, making it easier to implement than traditional deep reinforcement learning approaches. Through simulation experiments, the method demonstrates superior performance in multi-echelon systems with multiple retailers, achieving lower costs than the base-stock policy while maintaining comparable efficiency to established deep reinforcement learning techniques.

## Method Summary
The approach combines deep Q-learning with radial basis function networks to manage inventory across multi-echelon supply chains. The RBF network uses a Matérn (5/2) kernel function with a smoothness parameter η=1 to approximate the Q-value function. The state space is reduced to warehouse and total retailer inventory positions, while actions are limited to warehouse and retailer order quantities. Training employs gradient descent to minimize a loss function comparing predicted Q-values with actual costs. The method is tested on multi-echelon systems with one warehouse and multiple retailers, using random demand following normal distributions and implementing a five-event simulation sequence for inventory management.

## Key Results
- RBF-based deep Q-network achieves lower costs than base-stock policy in multi-echelon systems with multiple retailers
- Performance matches near-optimal base-stock policy in serial multi-echelon systems
- Outperforms existing deep reinforcement learning approaches (neuro-dynamic programming, A3C) while requiring simpler implementation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The RBF-based deep Q-network works by creating a localized approximation of the Q-value function through radial basis functions centered at lattice states. The Matérn (5/2) kernel provides sufficient smoothness for the inventory management problem while maintaining computational efficiency. By reducing the state and action spaces to warehouse and total retailer levels, the method captures essential dynamics without excessive complexity. The simple architecture avoids the computational burden of hyperparameter tuning required by traditional deep neural networks, while still providing the flexibility needed for dynamic inventory optimization.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Warehouse Inventory State -> RBF Network -> Q-Value Prediction -> Action Selection -> Environment Simulation -> Reward/Cost Calculation -> Q-Value Update

Critical Path:
State discretization → RBF network construction → Q-learning training → Policy evaluation

Design Tradeoffs:
- Simpler architecture vs. potential loss of representational power compared to deep neural networks
- Reduced state/action space vs. potential oversimplification of complex inventory dynamics
- Fixed kernel function vs. adaptability to different problem characteristics

Failure Signatures:
- Poor performance due to coarse state discretization missing important inventory transitions
- Training instability from inappropriate kernel parameters or learning rates
- Suboptimal policies from incorrect implementation of the special delivery mechanism

First Experiments:
1. Implement basic multi-echelon inventory simulation with random demand and verify cost calculations
2. Test RBF network with different kernel parameters on simple inventory management problems
3. Compare Q-value predictions from RBF network against analytical solutions for basic cases

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

Open Question 1:
How does the choice of kernel function in the RBF network affect the performance of the deep Q-network in multi-echelon inventory management?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions using the Matérn (5/2) kernel function and discusses the impact of the hyperparameter η on the smoothness of the RBF network.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the performance of different kernel functions or provide a comparative analysis of their effects on the deep Q-network's performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with various kernel functions (e.g., radial basis, Matérn with different ν values) and analyzing their impact on the deep Q-network's performance in terms of cost reduction and inventory management efficiency.

Open Question 2:
Can the RBF-based deep Q-network be effectively scaled to larger and more complex multi-echelon inventory systems with more retailers and diverse demand patterns?
- Basis in paper: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the RBF-based deep Q-network in systems with one warehouse and multiple retailers, but does not address scalability to larger systems.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide insights into the scalability of the approach or its performance in larger, more complex systems.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing the RBF-based deep Q-network in larger systems with more retailers and diverse demand patterns, and comparing its performance to existing methods in terms of computational efficiency and inventory management outcomes.

Open Question 3:
How does the RBF-based deep Q-network handle non-stationary demand patterns and dynamic changes in the supply chain environment?
- Basis in paper: The paper assumes stationary demand patterns and does not explore the network's adaptability to dynamic changes in the supply chain.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate the network's robustness to non-stationary demand patterns or its ability to adapt to changes in the supply chain environment.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the RBF-based deep Q-network in scenarios with non-stationary demand patterns and dynamic supply chain changes, and evaluating its adaptability and performance compared to static approaches.

## Limitations
- Limited experimental scope to specific configurations (one warehouse, up to four retailers)
- Arbitrary selection of Matérn (5/2) kernel without sensitivity analysis or theoretical justification
- Lack of quantitative computational efficiency comparisons with baseline methods

## Confidence
- Method description and algorithm formulation: High
- Performance claims relative to base-stock policy: Medium (due to limited experimental scenarios)
- Comparative advantage over existing DRL approaches: Low (insufficient empirical evidence and hyperparameter details)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct sensitivity analysis on kernel function parameters (η values) and lattice discretization granularity to determine their impact on policy performance and stability
2. Test the RBF-DQN approach on serial multi-echelon systems with varying numbers of stages and demand correlation structures beyond the current scope
3. Implement comprehensive computational efficiency benchmarks comparing training time, convergence speed, and memory usage against the neuro-dynamic programming and A3C baselines under identical hardware conditions
