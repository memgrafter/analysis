# Identifying Speakers in Dialogue Transcripts: A Text-based Approach Using Pretrained Language Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2407.12094
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12094
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: Best model achieves 80.3% precision on test set for speaker identification task

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the task of identifying speaker names in dialogue transcripts, crucial for enhancing content accessibility in digital media archives. The authors propose a novel dataset derived from MediaSum corpus and introduce transformer-based models that leverage contextual cues within dialogues to accurately attribute speaker names. The approach uses pretrained language models to encode spoken sentences and captures relationships between speaker names using Graph Convolutional Networks. Through extensive experiments, the best model achieves a precision of 80.3% on the test set, setting a new benchmark for this task.

## Method Summary
The method uses MediaSum dialogue transcripts with anonymized speaker identities and detected person names via NER. Two model variants are proposed: a single-name model that pairs each detected name with three context sentences from previous/current/next speakers, and a multi-name model that uses GCN to model relationships between multiple names in the same sentence. Both models use RoBERTa-large for encoding and are trained with Adam optimizer (lr=1e-5, batch size=16) to minimize cross-entropy loss. The dataset is split into train/dev/test (160/21/19 meetings) after preprocessing with fuzzy text matching (Levenshtein distance similarity ≥0.8) to align detected names with speaker identities.

## Key Results
- Best model achieves 80.3% precision on test set
- Single-name model achieves 84.0% precision but 65.5% recall
- Multi-name model achieves 78.7% precision and 63.6% recall
- Upper bound recall is 67.0% due to some speakers never being named in transcripts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Speaker identification leverages contextual proximity of name mentions to correct speaker identities
- Mechanism: The model uses a PLM to encode sentences containing a name and its immediate neighbors (previous/current/next sentences), then applies neural networks to determine the most likely speaker among the three candidates
- Core assumption: Speakers tend to speak around the time their names are mentioned in the dialogue
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "leveraging contextual cues within dialogues to accurately attribute speaker names"
  - [section 2.3.1]: "Our key observation is that speakers are often around when their names are mentioned during a meeting, i.e., it is often the case that we can assign a person name to the previous, current, or the next speaker"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence supporting this specific proximity assumption
- Break condition: If dialogue contains third-party mentions of speakers who are not actively participating in the current exchange

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Graph Convolutional Networks capture relationships between multiple names mentioned in the same sentence
- Mechanism: Multiple names in a sentence are treated as nodes in a fully connected graph where edge weights represent cosine similarity, then GCN layers aggregate information across these relationships to refine name representations
- Core assumption: Names mentioned together in a sentence tend to belong to different speakers, and their similarity patterns can help disambiguate speaker identities
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "capture the relationships between speaker names using Graph Convolutional Networks"
  - [section 2.3.2]: "We posit that their vectors contain unique semantic signatures reflective of each speaker's communicative style or content"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no corpus evidence showing whether this assumption holds in practice
- Break condition: If multiple names in a sentence actually refer to the same speaker (e.g., "John and Sarah will present together")

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Pretrained language models provide rich contextual representations that encode speaker-specific patterns
- Mechanism: RoBERTa large is used to generate contextualized embeddings for dialogue sentences, which capture subtle linguistic patterns that distinguish different speakers
- Core assumption: Different speakers develop consistent linguistic patterns (vocabulary, syntax, style) that can be captured by PLM representations
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "leveraging pretrained language models to encode spoken sentences"
  - [section 2.3.1]: "we process it through a pretrained language model (PLM), such as RoBERTa, renowned for its ability to derive deep contextualized representations of text"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence that PLM representations capture speaker-specific patterns in this dataset
- Break condition: If speakers have very similar speaking styles or if the dialogue is too short to establish distinctive patterns

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Named Entity Recognition (NER) for person name detection
  - Why needed here: The system requires identifying person names in transcripts before it can attempt to match them to speakers
  - Quick check question: What named entity type does the system look for when detecting person names in dialogue transcripts?

- Concept: Levenshtein Distance for fuzzy string matching
  - Why needed here: Speaker names in transcripts may have variations (missing last names, different formats) compared to the reference speaker list
  - Quick check question: How does the system determine if a detected name matches a speaker's reference name when they don't match exactly?

- Concept: Graph Convolutional Networks for relational reasoning
  - Why needed here: When multiple names appear in a single sentence, the model needs to reason about relationships between these names to assign them to different speakers
  - Quick check question: What mathematical operation does the GCN use to aggregate information from neighboring nodes in the name graph?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: MediaSum corpus → Data preprocessing (NER + Levenshtein matching) → SpeakerID model (PLM encoder + GCN layers + feedforward classifier) → Evaluation metrics (precision/recall/F1)
- Critical path: Input transcript → NER for name detection → Levenshtein matching to speaker identities → PLM encoding of contextual sentences → Name-to-speaker prediction → Output speaker attributions
- Design tradeoffs: Single-name model achieves higher precision but lower recall; multi-name model handles complex cases but with slight performance degradation; GCN adds complexity but may help with name disambiguation
- Failure signatures: Low recall when speaker names aren't mentioned in transcripts; confusion between similar-sounding names; poor performance on short dialogues with limited context
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test single-name model on development set to establish baseline performance
  2. Compare single-name vs multi-name model performance on same validation data
  3. Evaluate impact of GCN layers by running multi-name model with and without GCN component

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would the proposed models perform on real-world, non-synthetic SpeakerID datasets where speaker names are not perfectly aligned with the transcript?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions using synthetic data derived from the MediaSum corpus and does not evaluate on real-world datasets where perfect alignment of speaker names with transcripts is unlikely.
- Why unresolved: The authors only test their models on synthetic data generated from MediaSum, which may not reflect the complexities of real-world dialogue transcripts where speaker names might be partially or incorrectly mentioned.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of the proposed models on real-world datasets with imperfect alignment between speaker names and transcripts, along with an analysis of model performance under varying levels of alignment accuracy.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the proposed models generalize to dialogue transcripts from diverse domains beyond news interviews, such as entertainment, sports, or technology discussions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that the MediaSum dataset includes interviews covering politics, entertainment, sports, and technologies, but does not explicitly test model generalization to other domains.
- Why unresolved: While the MediaSum dataset includes diverse topics, the authors do not test their models on datasets from entirely different domains or media types (e.g., scripted TV shows, movies, or podcasts).
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the proposed models on datasets from diverse domains and media types, and comparing their performance across these different contexts.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do the proposed models handle cases where speaker names are not mentioned at all in the dialogue transcript?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that recall scores are limited due to the fact that names of speakers are not always mentioned in the transcripts, but does not explore how the models handle such cases.
- Why unresolved: The authors acknowledge the limitation but do not investigate how their models perform when speaker names are entirely absent from the transcript or when only pronouns or descriptions are used to refer to speakers.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of model performance on transcripts where speaker names are absent, and exploration of potential strategies (e.g., using speaker diarization output or context clues) to improve performance in such cases.

## Limitations

- Core mechanisms lack direct corpus validation - no evidence that proximity assumption, GCN relationships, or PLM speaker patterns actually hold in MediaSum data
- Evaluation methodology is constrained with artificially capped recall (67.0%) and small test set (19 meetings)
- No comparison to strong baselines or alternative approaches makes it difficult to assess whether proposed methods represent actual improvements

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Overall task formulation and general approach using PLMs and GCNs is sound and well-established
- **Medium Confidence**: Implementation details for single-name model appear complete and reproducible
- **Low Confidence**: Core mechanisms driving performance improvements lack direct corpus validation; GCN implementation details are underspecified

## Next Checks

1. **Corpus Validation**: Analyze MediaSum corpus to verify that speakers are mentioned near their speaking turns and that multiple names in sentences typically refer to different speakers
2. **GCN Implementation**: Reconstruct exact graph construction and aggregation process in multi-name model, particularly how edge weights are computed and how name representations are refined through GCN layers
3. **Baseline Comparison**: Implement and compare against strong baselines including a simple nearest-neighbor approach using PLM embeddings and a sequential BiLSTM model to isolate component contributions
