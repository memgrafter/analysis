# A Multi-Source Retrieval Question Answering Framework Based on RAG

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.19207
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19207
- Authors: Ridong Wu; Shuhong Chen; Xiangbiao Su; Yuankai Zhu; Yifei Liao; Jianming Wu
- Reference count: 15
- Primary result: MSRAG achieves 0.5646 F1 score on 2WikiMultiHopQA vs 0.2652 for best baseline

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of unreliable and incorrect generated results in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems due to erroneous retrieval information. The authors propose MSRAG, a multi-source retrieval framework that combines GPT-3.5 retrieval with web retrieval to enhance the relevance and granularity of retrieved information. MSRAG utilizes GPT-3.5 for semantic segmentation of queries and generating contextual documents, while also performing web searches on the segmented sub-questions. The framework then combines results from both sources and uses a loss function to select the best answer, achieving significantly higher accuracy and F1 scores on multiple knowledge-intensive QA datasets compared to existing RAG frameworks.

## Method Summary
MSRAG is a multi-source retrieval framework that improves RAG systems by addressing unreliable retrieval information. The method uses GPT-3.5 to semantically segment complex questions into three most relevant sub-questions, conducts web searches on each sub-question, and combines results with GPT-3.5-generated contextual documents. The framework employs LLaMa2-7B-Chat for answer generation from all three sources (GPT retrieval, web retrieval, and non-retrieval), then uses a cosine similarity-based loss function to select the optimal answer. This approach mitigates hallucinations from individual sources and improves overall answer quality.

## Key Results
- MSRAG achieves 0.5646 F1 score on 2WikiMultiHopQA dataset compared to 0.2652 for best baseline
- Significant improvements in accuracy, F1 score, and exact match scores across multiple knowledge-intensive QA datasets
- Outperforms existing RAG frameworks by effectively combining multi-source retrieval information

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GPT-3.5 generates more relevant retrieval information than traditional retrievers
- Mechanism: GPT-3.5 leverages its vast corpus knowledge to produce contextual documents based on queries using Chain-of-Thought prompting
- Core assumption: GPT-3.5's pre-training knowledge is sufficiently comprehensive to replace traditional retrieval systems
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "this study proposes a method that replaces traditional retrievers with GPT-3.5, leveraging its vast corpus knowledge to generate retrieval information"
  - [section] "we replace conventional search engines with GPT-3.5, leveraging its robust semantic understanding capabilities and vast knowledge repository of linguistic contexts to generate search information pertinent to the given queries"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct citations found in neighbor papers supporting GPT-3.5 as retriever replacement
- Break condition: GPT-3.5 encounters queries outside its training distribution or when its knowledge becomes outdated

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Semantic segmentation of queries improves granularity of retrieved information
- Mechanism: GPT-3.5 semantically partitions complex questions into 3 most relevant and non-repetitive sub-questions for targeted web searches
- Core assumption: Complex multi-step questions can be effectively decomposed into semantically meaningful sub-questions
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Utilizing the powerful reasoning capability of GPT-3.5 to realize semantic partitioning of problem"
  - [section] "we semantically segment the original question into three most relevant and non-repetitive sub-questions, conducting Web searches on a per-sub-question basis"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in neighbor papers - this appears to be a novel contribution
- Break condition: Queries that are inherently sequential or require context across sub-questions, making segmentation counterproductive

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multi-source retrieval mitigates hallucinations from individual sources
- Mechanism: Combines results from GPT retrieval, web retrieval, and non-retrieval approaches, then uses cosine similarity loss function to select optimal answer
- Core assumption: Different information sources have complementary strengths and weaknesses that can balance each other
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "In order to mitigate the illusion of GPT retrieval and reduce noise in Web retrieval, we proposes a multi-source retrieval framework, named MSRAG, which combines GPT retrieval with web retrieval"
  - [section] "By computing the loss function to obtain the optimal answer, this feature achieves a balanced performance between Web retrieval and GPT retrieval"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - while multi-source approaches exist, the specific combination and loss-based selection is novel
- Break condition: All three sources provide similarly incorrect or hallucinated information

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) fundamentals
  - Why needed here: MSRAG builds upon and modifies the RAG paradigm
  - Quick check question: What are the two main components of a RAG system and how do they interact?

- Concept: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting
  - Why needed here: CoT prompting is used to guide GPT-3.5 in generating contextual documents and semantic segmentation
  - Quick check question: How does CoT prompting improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models?

- Concept: Cosine similarity and loss functions
  - Why needed here: Used to compare and select the best answer from multiple sources
  - Quick check question: What is the mathematical formula for cosine similarity and how is it interpreted?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Original question → GPT-3.5 → semantic segmentation → web searches → information merging → answer generation from all three sources → loss calculation → final answer

- Critical path: Original question → GPT-3.5 semantic segmentation → web searches on sub-questions → GPT-3.5 information merging → answer generation from all three sources → loss calculation → final answer

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Speed vs. accuracy: Multi-source approach increases accuracy but also latency
  - Cost vs. performance: Using GPT-3.5 for retrieval is more expensive than traditional retrievers
  - Complexity vs. robustness: The multi-source approach adds complexity but provides better error mitigation

- Failure signatures:
  - All three answer sources produce similar incorrect answers
  - Web searches return irrelevant results despite semantic segmentation
  - GPT-3.5 generates hallucinated contextual documents
  - Loss function consistently selects wrong answers due to bias

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement GPT-3.5 semantic segmentation and verify it produces meaningful sub-questions
  2. Compare web search results with and without semantic segmentation on a small dataset
  3. Test the loss function selection by creating controlled scenarios with known correct answers

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- No ablation study provided to isolate contributions of individual components
- Limited dataset diversity - performance on other domains or question types not addressed
- Unknown loss function implementation details critical for exact replication

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The core mechanism of using GPT-3.5 for semantic segmentation and the multi-source retrieval approach are clearly described and technically sound. The reported performance improvements on benchmark datasets are likely valid.

**Medium confidence**: The specific implementation details of the loss function and the exact CoT prompting strategy for semantic segmentation have moderate confidence due to limited specification in the paper.

**Low confidence**: The claim that GPT-3.5 can reliably replace traditional retrievers is low confidence without direct evidence of GPT-3.5's knowledge currency and coverage limitations being addressed.

## Next Checks

1. **Loss function verification**: Implement the exact loss function used for answer selection and test it on controlled scenarios with known ground truth answers to verify it consistently selects correct responses.

2. **Semantic segmentation quality**: Conduct human evaluation of GPT-3.5-generated sub-questions to verify they are semantically meaningful and improve retrieval relevance compared to using the original question.

3. **Ablation study**: Remove each component (GPT-3.5 retrieval, web retrieval, loss-based selection) individually to quantify their individual contributions to the overall performance improvement.
