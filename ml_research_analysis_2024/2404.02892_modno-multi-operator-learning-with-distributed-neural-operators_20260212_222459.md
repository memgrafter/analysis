# MODNO: Multi Operator Learning With Distributed Neural Operators

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.02892
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02892
- Authors: Zecheng Zhang
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: A distributed training approach called MODNO enables a single neural operator with significantly fewer parameters to effectively tackle multi-operator learning challenges without incurring additional average costs.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MODNO (Multi-Operator Learning with Distributed Neural Operators), a distributed training approach that enables a single neural operator with significantly fewer parameters to effectively tackle multi-operator learning challenges. The core idea is to independently learn the output basis functions for each operator using its dedicated data, while simultaneously centralizing the learning of the input function encoding shared by all operators using the entire dataset. Through systematic study of five numerical examples, the paper demonstrates enhanced efficiency and satisfactory accuracy compared to training separate neural operators for each operator independently.

## Method Summary
MODNO implements a distributed training strategy where a shared network encodes input functions common across all operators, while dedicated networks learn operator-specific output basis functions. The method uses a global loss function to update shared parameters using data from all operators, and local loss functions to update dedicated parameters using operator-specific data. This architecture allows the model to learn shared patterns in input functions while maintaining specialization for each operator's unique characteristics. The approach is applicable to various neural operators including Deep Operator Neural Networks (DON).

## Key Results
- MODNO achieves enhanced efficiency and satisfactory accuracy compared to training separate neural operators for each operator independently
- The method demonstrates that operators with limited data can be more effectively constructed with the aid of data from analogous operators through MOL learning
- MODNO maintains prediction errors that remain robust even when reducing training samples for the shared structure

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Centralizing shared input encoding while decentralizing operator-specific output basis improves efficiency without sacrificing accuracy
- Mechanism: The algorithm splits operator approximation into shared input function encoding and dedicated output basis functions, allowing the shared network to learn from all data while dedicated networks specialize per operator
- Core assumption: Input function space U is shared across all operators, making centralized input encoding effective
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "centralizing the learning of the input function encoding shared by all operators using the entire dataset"
  - [section]: "Assuming all input functions share the input function space, one can use centralized networks to learn a shared centralized input function basis"
- Break condition: If input function spaces are fundamentally different across operators, centralized encoding would fail

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-operator learning can achieve better accuracy than single-operator learning even with less data per operator
- Mechanism: Training a single model on data from multiple related operators allows the shared input encoding network to benefit from richer training data, improving its representation capability
- Core assumption: Operators are related enough that their input functions share meaningful patterns that benefit from joint learning
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "some operators with limited data can be more effectively constructed with the aid of data from analogous operators through MOL learning"
  - [section]: "we illustrate that MOL may boost the accuracy for specific operators compared to training these operators separately"
- Break condition: If operators are too dissimilar, the shared encoding would be suboptimal for all operators

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Reducing data for training shared structures while maintaining dedicated data for operator-specific components improves efficiency
- Mechanism: The shared input encoding network is trained with reduced data (controlled by parameter q), while operator-specific output basis networks use full dedicated data
- Core assumption: The shared input encoding network is less prone to overfitting due to larger effective dataset (data from all operators)
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "we propose to reduce the number of training samples for the centralized shared structure"
  - [section]: "Our numerical experiments indicate that despite reducing the training samples, prediction errors remain robust"
- Break condition: If the shared network is too complex relative to the shared patterns in input data, reducing training data would cause underfitting

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Neural operator approximation theory (Chen-Chen type)
  - Why needed here: The entire framework builds on the universal approximation theorem for operators, which shows how operators can be decomposed into input encoding functionals and output basis functions
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why the output basis functions bk(x) don't depend on the input function u?

- Concept: Distributed training and parameter sharing
  - Why needed here: MODNO uses a distributed approach where some parameters are shared across operators while others are dedicated, requiring understanding of when and how parameter sharing helps
  - Quick check question: What would happen if all parameters were shared versus all parameters were dedicated?

- Concept: Cost metrics in neural operator training
  - Why needed here: The paper uses back-propagation and forward pass counts rather than just parameter counts to evaluate efficiency, which is crucial for understanding the claimed advantages
  - Quick check question: How does the cost formula CM OL = Σ Nu,i,j(Nb,i + Na) capture the distributed nature of the training?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Shared network (α): Encodes input functions u ∈ U, trained on all data
  - Dedicated networks (βi): Encode output basis functions for operator Gi, trained on operator-specific data
  - Local loss functions Li: Update dedicated parameters βi using operator-specific data
  - Global loss function L: Update shared parameters α using all data

- Critical path: Data → Local losses update βi → Global loss updates α → Prediction

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Sharing vs. dedications: More shared parameters reduce total parameters but may hurt accuracy if operators are too different
  - Data allocation: Reducing q (data for shared structure) improves efficiency but may hurt accuracy
  - Network depth: Deeper networks may need more data for the shared structure

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor accuracy across all operators: Shared network may be underfitting
  - One operator performs much worse: That operator may be too dissimilar from others
  - High variance in predictions: Insufficient data for shared structure or poor initialization

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train MODNO with q=1.0 (full data for shared structure) and compare to single DONs
  2. Train MODNO with reduced q values (0.9, 0.8, 0.7) and measure accuracy degradation
  3. Train MODNO with operators that have very different input spaces to test the shared encoding assumption

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can MODNO be extended to handle operators with heterogeneous input function spaces without the assumption of a shared input function space?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions extending the framework to be discretization-invariant, allowing for different input functions to be discretized differently, which would eliminate the "same input function space" assumption
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any experimental results or theoretical analysis on this extension
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful application of MODNO to a dataset with heterogeneous input function spaces, demonstrating comparable accuracy and efficiency to the original MODNO framework

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of MODNO compare to other MOL foundation models, such as ICON and PROSE, in terms of accuracy and computational cost?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper states that MODNO has significantly fewer trainable parameters compared to MOL foundation models, but does not provide a direct comparison of their performance
- Why unresolved: The paper does not include any experimental results comparing MODNO to other MOL foundation models
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive comparison of MODNO, ICON, and PROSE on a set of benchmark problems, evaluating their accuracy and computational cost

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can MODNO be applied to solve parametric PDEs with free parameters, and how does its performance compare to traditional numerical methods?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions integrating physics-informed loss to tackle parametric PDEs with free parameters as a potential future research direction
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any experimental results or theoretical analysis on this application of MODNO
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful application of MODNO to a set of parametric PDEs, demonstrating improved accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional numerical methods

## Limitations

- The paper does not provide extensive hyperparameter sensitivity analysis, leaving questions about robustness to architectural choices and learning rates
- Computational cost analysis focuses on back-propagation counts but doesn't fully account for memory constraints or wall-clock time
- Numerical experiments are limited in scale and don't explore edge cases where operators might be poorly correlated

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The distributed training architecture (shared input encoding + dedicated output basis) is technically sound and the cost efficiency improvements are well-supported by the mathematical framework
- **Medium confidence**: The accuracy claims hold for the tested numerical examples, but generalization to more complex or less correlated operators requires further validation
- **Medium confidence**: The data efficiency claims (using reduced data for shared structure) are supported by experiments but need broader testing across different operator relationships

## Next Checks

1. **Operator Correlation Analysis**: Systematically test MODNO on operators with varying degrees of correlation (from highly related to completely independent) to quantify the threshold where shared encoding becomes detrimental

2. **Memory and Wall-clock Benchmarking**: Compare MODNO against single-operator training not just in computational complexity but in actual memory usage and training time on hardware with realistic constraints

3. **Scalability Testing**: Evaluate MODNO performance with increasing numbers of operators (beyond the 3-4 tested) and with high-dimensional input/output spaces to assess real-world applicability
