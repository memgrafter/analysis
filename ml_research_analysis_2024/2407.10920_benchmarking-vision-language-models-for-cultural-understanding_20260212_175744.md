# Benchmarking Vision Language Models for Cultural Understanding

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.10920
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10920
- Reference count: 19
- Primary result: Proprietary models show 61% average accuracy on CulturalVQA, while open-source models achieve only 46%

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CulturalVQA, a visual question-answering benchmark designed to evaluate vision-language models (VLMs) on their ability to understand cultural concepts across diverse regions. The dataset consists of 2,378 image-question pairs representing cultures from 11 countries across 5 continents, focusing on clothing, food, drinks, rituals, and traditions. When evaluated on CulturalVQA, proprietary models like GPT-4 and Gemini showed significant performance disparities across regions, with strong performance on North American cultures (67-72% accuracy) but notably lower performance on African cultures (43-56% accuracy). The benchmark reveals that VLMs struggle particularly with cultural understanding of food and drink concepts while performing better on rituals and traditions.

## Method Summary
The authors constructed CulturalVQA by collecting culturally relevant images from the CANDLE dataset and having annotators from different countries write culturally specific questions and answers. The benchmark uses the LA VE metric, which employs GPT-4 as an LLM evaluator to assess open-ended model responses. The dataset was deliberately designed to include 11 countries across 5 continents, with intentional overrepresentation of African-Islamic countries to address their typical scarcity in geo-diverse datasets. Models were evaluated using both zero-shot and few-shot prompting approaches, with questions probing various cultural facets including clothing, food, drinks, rituals, and traditions.

## Key Results
- Proprietary models (GPT-4, Gemini) achieved 61% average accuracy, while open-source models (BLIP2, LLaVA, Intern-VL) achieved only 46%
- Performance disparities across regions: 67-72% accuracy on North American cultures vs 43-56% on African cultures
- Models performed better on questions about rituals and traditions (66% accuracy) compared to clothing, food, and drink concepts (55-60% accuracy)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: VLMs struggle particularly with cultural understanding of food and drink concepts while performing better on rituals and traditions.
- Mechanism: The dataset construction process involved collecting culturally relevant images and having annotators from different cultures write culturally specific questions and answers, ensuring the questions probe cultural common sense rather than just visual recognition.
- Core assumption: Annotators from different cultures can accurately identify and articulate the cultural nuances that would be challenging for outsiders to recognize.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "VLMs also show varying degrees of proficiency across cultural facets, with closed-source VLMs performing better on questions about rituals and traditions while scoring worse on those related to clothing, food, and drink."
  - [section 3] "Our work assumes common ground within a cultural group by probing culturally relevant concepts that are collectively understood, as well as shared cultural common sense employed in reasoning"
- Break condition: If annotators' cultural knowledge is not sufficiently deep or if the questions fail to capture the essential cultural nuances that distinguish insiders from outsiders.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: There is a significant disparity in model performance across countries, with strong performance on North American cultures (67-72% accuracy) but notably lower performance on African cultures (43-56% accuracy).
- Mechanism: The dataset deliberately overrepresents African-Islamic countries to address their typical scarcity in geo-diverse datasets, creating a more rigorous test of cultural understanding across diverse regions.
- Core assumption: By including more challenging cultural contexts in the dataset, the benchmark can better expose the limitations of VLMs in handling diverse cultural concepts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "proprietary models like GPT-4 and Gemini showed significant performance disparities across regions, with strong performance on North American cultures (67-72% accuracy) but notably lower performance on African cultures (43-56% accuracy)"
  - [section 3] "Our final dataset spans 11 countries and 5 continents. These countries were specifically selected to cover different cultural categories from the World Values Survey... We opt for an intentional overrepresentation of African-Islamic countries to address their typical scarcity in geo-diverse datasets."
- Break condition: If the performance disparity is primarily due to factors other than cultural understanding (e.g., data quality, question difficulty, or representation in training data).

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Open-source models performed substantially worse than proprietary models, with the best open-source model achieving 46% average accuracy compared to 61% for GPT-4.
- Mechanism: The evaluation reveals a considerable performance gap between closed-source and open-source models, particularly pronounced in countries within the African-Islamic culture.
- Core assumption: Proprietary models have access to more diverse and culturally rich training data compared to open-source models, leading to better cultural understanding.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Open-source models performed substantially worse than proprietary models, with the best open-source model achieving 46% average accuracy compared to 61% for GPT-4"
  - [section 5] "We see substantial disparity in cultural understanding across different VLMs, with the best-performing open-source model (INTERN-VL for most countries) achieving an average LA VE accuracy of only 46%, and performance ranging across countries from 26% to 71%"
- Break condition: If the performance gap is due to differences in model architecture, evaluation methodology, or other factors unrelated to cultural understanding.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cultural common sense
  - Why needed here: Understanding the difference between visual recognition and cultural understanding is crucial for interpreting the benchmark results
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes cultural common sense from general visual understanding in the context of VQA?

- Concept: Geo-diverse datasets
  - Why needed here: Recognizing the importance of representing diverse cultures in evaluation benchmarks helps explain the dataset construction choices
  - Quick check question: Why did the authors intentionally overrepresent African-Islamic countries in the dataset?

- Concept: Open-ended vs multiple-choice evaluation
  - Why needed here: Understanding the evaluation methodology is essential for interpreting the reported performance metrics
  - Quick check question: How does the open-ended evaluation format used in CulturalVQA differ from the multiple-choice format used in other cultural understanding benchmarks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Dataset (2,378 image-question pairs with 1-5 answers per question) -> LA VE evaluation metric (GPT-4 as LLM) -> VLMs (proprietary and open-source) -> Performance analysis

- Critical path: Collect culturally relevant images -> Have annotators write questions and answers -> Benchmark VLMs using LA VE metric -> Analyze performance disparities across regions and cultural facets

- Design tradeoffs: The authors chose an open-ended evaluation format over multiple-choice to better assess cultural understanding, though this makes evaluation more challenging. They also opted for English-only data to disentangle multicultural understanding from multilingual comprehension, despite the limitation of potentially missing key cultural nuances available only in native languages.

- Failure signatures: Poor performance on food and drink concepts, significant disparities across countries (especially between North American and African cultures), and a large performance gap between proprietary and open-source models all indicate limitations in current VLMs' cultural understanding capabilities.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate baseline models (LLM-only, LLM + Country, LLM + Lens) to determine the degree of visual understanding required for the benchmark questions
  2. Compare performance of open-source vs proprietary models across different countries to identify performance disparities
  3. Analyze model performance across cultural facets (clothing, food, drinks, rituals, traditions) to understand which aspects of culture are better understood

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Data Collection and Representation
1. How can we build more inclusive datasets that capture the full spectrum of global cultural diversity beyond the 11 countries currently represented?
2. How can we effectively represent cultural concepts that lack local terms that can be effectively represented in English letters?
3. What methods could bridge the gap between automated image filtering and human refinement to reduce the 19.64% of images discarded by human evaluators?

### Cultural Understanding Challenges
4. What factors beyond the occurrence of concepts in pre-training data contribute to the disparity in model performance across different cultural facets?
5. How can we develop VLMs that can recognize and interpret the symbolic connections between cultural entities (like cows and planet Earth in Indian culture) rather than treating them as merely decorative objects?
6. How can VLMs be improved to distinguish between visually similar but culturally distinct entities and objects (like traditional Iranian storyteller vs Dervish, or Turkish tea glass vs tulip glass)?

### Model Performance and Evaluation
7. What advanced methods beyond few-shot prompting could enhance model performance on culturally nuanced tasks?
8. How can we develop evaluation metrics that better capture the precision and cultural specificity of model responses, given that human raters tend to score higher than LA VE metric?
9. What is the optimal balance between open-ended and multiple-choice evaluation formats for assessing cultural understanding?

### Multilingual and Cross-Cultural Understanding
10. How can we develop multilingual VLMs that don't just translate cultural concepts but truly understand them across languages?
11. How can we account for subcultures within countries where the same cultural concept holds different meanings (like drums in Yoruba vs Igbo cultures)?
12. What methods can help VLMs recognize geographical variations within countries (like different crop-growing regions in Rwanda)?

### Technical and Methodological Improvements
13. How can we leverage multilingual segments of Common Crawl to uncover more rare cultural concepts and corresponding images?
14. What scalable platforms or methods could improve the efficiency of collecting culturally diverse annotations across different time zones?
15. How can we develop better automated methods for filtering culturally relevant images that reduce the need for extensive human filtering?

### Theoretical and Conceptual Questions
16. How should we define and operationalize "cultural understanding" in VLMs beyond visual recognition to include symbolic meanings and shared common sense?
17. What is the relationship between cultural understanding and language understanding in VLMs, and how can we disentangle these factors?
18. How can we measure and model "culture" in LLMs and VLMs in a way that captures both tangible and intangible cultural elements?

## Limitations
- The evaluation methodology relies heavily on GPT-4 as both a model under test and the LLM evaluator for LA VE, introducing potential circularity
- The benchmark's focus on English-only data may miss culturally important nuances that exist only in native languages
- Performance disparities across countries could be influenced by factors beyond cultural understanding, such as data quality or representation in training sets

## Confidence
- Performance disparities across countries: Medium
- Comparative performance between proprietary and open-source models: High
- Specific cultural facets being more challenging: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluations on a subset of CulturalVQA questions to verify the correlation between LA VE scores and human judgment, particularly for questions where models show significant performance disparities across countries.
2. Create a small multilingual subset of CulturalVQA with questions and answers in native languages to assess whether the English-only limitation significantly impacts the benchmark's ability to capture cultural understanding.
3. Analyze the pre-training data of both proprietary and open-source models to quantify cultural representation across different regions, particularly focusing on the African-Islamic countries that showed lower performance, to determine whether data scarcity explains the observed disparities.
