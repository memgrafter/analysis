# VHAKG: A Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Based on Synchronized Multi-view Videos of Daily Activities

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.14895
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14895
- Reference count: 33
- Key outcome: VHAKG integrates event sequences and frame-by-frame knowledge from synchronized multi-view videos of daily activities, embedding videos as base64 literals and representing both temporal event sequences and fine-grained visual changes

## Executive Summary
VHAKG introduces a novel multi-modal knowledge graph that combines event sequences and frame-by-frame visual data from synchronized multi-view videos of daily activities. The authors generated diverse synthetic videos using an extended VirtualHome simulator, which outputs both event-centric knowledge and frame-by-frame visual data including bounding boxes. VHAKG embeds video data as base64 literals and represents both temporal event sequences and fine-grained visual changes. To enable practical distribution, they compressed videos and removed redundant triples, reducing data size by over 75%. The authors also provide support tools for querying VHAKG and demonstrate its utility by creating a benchmark dataset for visual question answering tasks, showing improved performance with few-shot learning compared to zero-shot approaches. VHAKG is publicly available and represents a significant advancement in multi-modal knowledge graph construction for video data.

## Method Summary
The VHAKG construction process involves generating synthetic daily activity videos using the VirtualHome-AIST simulator, which provides frame-by-frame images with bounding box annotations from a 5-camera setup. The authors extend existing ontologies (MSSN-Onto and VirtualHome2KG) to create a schema capable of representing synchronized multi-view video data with temporal event sequences and visual changes. Videos are compressed using MPEG, redundant triples are removed by identifying unchanged bounding boxes between frames, and the remaining data is embedded as base64 literals in the knowledge graph. Support tools are provided for querying the KG, and the dataset is demonstrated through a visual question answering benchmark that shows improved performance with few-shot learning.

## Key Results
- Successfully integrated event sequences and frame-by-frame visual changes from synchronized multi-view videos into a single knowledge graph
- Achieved over 75% reduction in data size through video compression and redundant triple removal while maintaining essential information
- Demonstrated improved VQA performance using VHAKG-extracted datasets with few-shot learning compared to zero-shot approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Embedding video data as base64 literals within the KG ensures permanent availability and eliminates broken links
- Mechanism: By storing video content directly as base64 literals in the knowledge graph, the videos are not dependent on external file paths or URLs that might change or become unavailable over time
- Core assumption: The storage overhead of base64-encoded videos is manageable and the compression techniques are effective enough to make the dataset practically distributable
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "VHAKG embeds video data as base64 literals and represents both temporal event sequences and fine-grained visual changes"
  - [section 3.2] "The video data is embedded as a literal value encoded in base64. Consequently, video files are free of broken links and reference errors, ensuring their permanent availability and sharing"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence in neighboring papers about base64 embedding for video permanence
- Break condition: If the compression ratio is insufficient to reduce data size to practical distribution levels, or if base64 encoding significantly degrades video quality or query performance

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The integration of frame-by-frame knowledge with event sequences enables more sophisticated downstream tasks like visual question answering
- Mechanism: By representing both the temporal sequence of events and the fine-grained visual changes (including bounding boxes) in each frame, the KG captures richer contextual information that can be queried to generate customized datasets for specific tasks
- Core assumption: The synthetic video generation is diverse enough to cover meaningful daily activity scenarios that generalize to real-world applications
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "VHAKG embeds video data as base64 literals and represents both temporal event sequences and fine-grained visual changes"
  - [section 4.2.2] "We then created short sentences based on the extracted actions and objects... We extracted 100 pairs of data as the test set"
  - [corpus] Weak - neighboring papers focus on multimodal KG completion rather than synthetic video generation for downstream tasks
- Break condition: If the synthetic data lacks diversity or realism, leading to poor generalization when evaluated on real-world data or models

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Removing redundant triples and compressing videos reduces data size by over 75% while preserving essential information
- Mechanism: By identifying and eliminating redundant bounding box information when objects haven't changed between frames, and by compressing video data using MPEG, the storage requirements are significantly reduced without losing the temporal and visual information needed for queries
- Core assumption: The redundancy detection algorithm correctly identifies when bounding box information is truly redundant versus when it represents meaningful state changes
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3.2] "We reduced the number of entities and triples by referring to the previous entities if the current 2D bounding boxes have not changed since the previous frame"
  - [section 3.3.3] "Table 1 shows the number of triples and data size of VHAKG... made it possible to share them securely in a research data repository"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence in neighboring papers about redundancy removal in video-embedded KGs
- Break condition: If the redundancy detection is too aggressive and removes information that appears static but is contextually important, or if compression artifacts interfere with downstream task performance

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge Graph (KG) structure and RDF representation
  - Why needed here: Understanding how entities, relations, and literals form triples in a graph structure is essential for comprehending how VHAKG represents both symbolic knowledge and multimodal data
  - Quick check question: What are the three components of an RDF triple, and how does VHAKG use literal values to embed video data?

- Concept: Ontology design and schema development
  - Why needed here: The paper extends existing ontologies (MSSN-Onto, Semantic Sensor Network Ontology) to create a schema that can represent synchronized multi-view video data with frame-by-frame changes
  - Quick check question: How does extending MSSN-Onto enable VHAKG to represent sensor data from multiple synchronized cameras?

- Concept: Video compression techniques and base64 encoding
  - Why needed here: Understanding how MPEG compression and base64 encoding work together to reduce storage requirements while maintaining data accessibility is crucial for the MMKG compression approach
  - Quick check question: Why does the paper use both MPEG compression and base64 encoding rather than just one of these techniques?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: VirtualHome-AIST simulator -> Bounding box annotation -> KG construction with extended ontology -> Redundancy removal -> Video compression -> Base64 embedding -> Distribution via repository
- Critical path: Video generation → Bounding box annotation → KG construction with ontology → Redundancy removal → Video compression → Base64 embedding → Distribution via repository
- Design tradeoffs: The choice to embed videos as base64 literals ensures permanence but increases storage requirements; synthetic data generation provides control and diversity but may lack real-world complexity; the redundancy removal algorithm reduces size but requires careful design to avoid information loss
- Failure signatures: Excessive data size despite compression attempts, broken video links in the final KG, poor performance on downstream tasks indicating missing information, or slow query response times due to large base64 literals
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Query the KG using the provided support tools to verify that videos can be successfully extracted and played back from base64 literals
  2. Test the redundancy removal algorithm by comparing the number of triples and data size before and after compression on a small sample dataset
  3. Replicate the VQA benchmark experiment using a different LLM to verify that the extracted test datasets are usable for evaluating vision-language models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does VHAKG's performance compare to real-world video datasets when linked to existing knowledge graphs? The authors mention plans to link VHAKG to real visual dataset KGs for sim2real tasks in their conclusion.
- What is the optimal compression strategy for balancing data size reduction with information preservation in multi-modal knowledge graphs? The authors discuss video compression and triple reduction but note these were necessary compromises for practical distribution.
- How does the diversity of generated daily activities in VHAKG affect downstream task performance? The authors generated over 700 scenarios but acknowledge this is synthetic data, and mention plans to increase video variety.

## Limitations
- The synthetic nature of the video data may not fully capture the complexity and variability of real-world daily activities, potentially limiting generalization to practical applications
- The base64 embedding approach creates significant storage overhead that may become prohibitive as video resolution or duration increases
- The redundancy removal algorithm assumes that unchanged bounding boxes represent truly redundant information, which may not account for contextual changes that don't affect object positions

## Confidence
- High confidence in the MMKG construction methodology and ontology design, as these follow established KG principles and extend existing frameworks (MSSN-Onto, VirtualHome2KG)
- Medium confidence in the practical utility for downstream tasks, as demonstrated by VQA benchmark results, though limited to synthetic data evaluation
- Low confidence in long-term scalability and performance with larger, more complex video datasets due to compression and storage challenges

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate VHAKG's performance on a real-world video dataset with manual annotations to assess generalization beyond synthetic data
2. Benchmark query response times with varying video resolutions and durations to identify performance bottlenecks with base64-encoded media
3. Conduct ablation studies removing different components (video embeddings, bounding boxes, event sequences) to quantify their individual contributions to downstream task performance
