# WxC-Bench: A Novel Dataset for Weather and Climate Downstream Tasks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.02780
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02780
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Multi-modal dataset spanning multiple spatial and temporal scales for developing generalizable AI models in weather and climate applications

## Executive Summary
WxC-Bench is a comprehensive multi-modal dataset designed to support the development of AI models for weather and climate downstream tasks. The dataset addresses the challenge of heterogeneous data modalities by providing pre-processed, ML-ready data spanning multiple atmospheric processes from meso-β to synoptic scales. It includes six key tasks: aviation turbulence detection, gravity wave parameterization, hurricane intensity and track monitoring, weather analog search, long-term precipitation forecasting, and natural language report generation. The dataset is publicly available on Hugging Face and includes baseline experiments demonstrating its capability for training and evaluating AI models in weather and climate applications.

## Method Summary
WxC-Bench is constructed by curating data from multiple sources including satellite observations, reanalysis data (MERRA-2, ERA5), high-resolution forecasting models, hurricane databases, pilot reports, and weather reports. The dataset spans spatial scales from local (aviation turbulence) to synoptic (hurricane prediction) and temporal scales from seconds to seasonal. Each task has its own preprocessing pipeline with standardized normalization approaches (e.g., scaling winds by 3σ, cube-root scaling for GW fluxes). The dataset is formatted for machine learning applications with consistent longitude/latitude/time coordinates and normalized variables concatenated as input and output features. Technical validation includes baseline experiments for each downstream task using appropriate architectures and evaluation metrics.

## Key Results
- Multi-modal dataset spanning multiple spatial (micro to synoptic) and temporal scales (seconds to seasonal)
- Pre-processed ML-ready data for six atmospheric tasks: aviation turbulence, GW parameterization, hurricane prediction, weather analog search, precipitation forecasting, and natural language generation
- Technical validation through baseline experiments demonstrating dataset capability for training and evaluating AI models
- Publicly available on Hugging Face with code for data access and preprocessing pipelines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Multi-scale and multi-modal data curation enables broader generalization across atmospheric phenomena
- **Mechanism:** The dataset spans multiple spatial scales and temporal scales, combining raw satellite, reanalysis, forecast, and observational sources into ML-ready formats. This diversity forces models to learn representations that transfer across different atmospheric regimes and modalities
- **Core assumption:** Generalization benefits from exposure to heterogeneous data sources and scales during training
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract]: "WxC-Bench is designed as a dataset of datasets for developing ML-models for a complex weather and climate system"; [section]: "The dataset can be used for tasks spanning multiple spatio-temporal scales"; [corpus]: Weak corpus evidence - no direct citations about multi-scale generalization
- **Break condition:** If training tasks are too narrow or source diversity is insufficient, the model will overfit to specific conditions

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Providing curated, pre-processed ML-ready datasets reduces the barrier to entry for developing AI models in weather and climate
- **Mechanism:** Raw data from heterogeneous sources is transformed into standardized, normalized formats (e.g., scaling winds by 3σ, cube-root scaling for GW fluxes). This standardization ensures models can be trained without extensive custom preprocessing
- **Core assumption:** Standardization and normalization of diverse data inputs are necessary for efficient model training
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract]: "Curating such high-quality datasets for developing new models is challenging particularly because the modality of the input data varies significantly"; [section]: "Each quantity is a function of longitude, latitude, pressure (height), and time... The normalized variables are then concatenated"; [corpus]: Weak corpus evidence - no direct citations about dataset standardization benefits
- **Break condition:** If preprocessing pipelines are inconsistent or missing critical normalization steps, model performance will degrade

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Multi-task learning on diverse atmospheric phenomena improves model robustness and applicability
- **Mechanism:** By including tasks like aviation turbulence classification, GW parameterization, hurricane prediction, and natural language forecasting, the dataset enables models to learn shared representations across different prediction types and modalities
- **Core assumption:** Training on multiple, diverse tasks leads to better generalization than single-task training
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract]: "WxC-Bench encompasses several atmospheric processes from meso-β (20 - 200 km) scale to synoptic scales (2500 km), such as aviation turbulence, hurricane intensity and track monitoring, weather analog search, gravity wave parameterization, and natural language report generation"; [section]: "The proposed WxC-Bench, thus, contains pre-processed ML-ready data for a range of atmospheric processes ranging from local scale (aviation turbulence) to synoptic scales (natural language forecasting)"; [corpus]: Weak corpus evidence - no direct citations about multi-task learning in weather and climate
- **Break condition:** If tasks are too dissimilar or training signals conflict, model performance on individual tasks may suffer

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Multi-modal data integration**
  - **Why needed here:** The dataset combines satellite imagery, reanalysis data, and textual reports, requiring models to process and fuse different data types
  - **Quick check question:** Can you explain how to normalize and concatenate heterogeneous data sources for model input?

- **Concept: Spatial and temporal scaling in atmospheric data**
  - **Why needed here:** Atmospheric processes occur at different scales, requiring models to handle data ranging from microscale turbulence to synoptic-scale weather systems
  - **Quick check question:** How would you design a model architecture to handle both high-resolution local data and coarse global data?

- **Concept: Machine learning task formulation for scientific domains**
  - **Why needed here:** Weather and climate tasks are formulated as classification, regression, search, and generation problems, requiring understanding of both ML and domain science
  - **Quick check question:** What are the key differences between formulating a weather prediction task as regression vs. classification?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data sources (satellite, reanalysis, forecast models, databases) → Preprocessing pipelines (normalization, scaling) → ML-ready datasets → Model architectures (CNNs, transformers) → Evaluation metrics
- **Critical path:** For a new task: (1) understand scientific problem and data sources, (2) implement preprocessing pipeline, (3) design model architecture, (4) train and validate, (5) evaluate using appropriate metrics
- **Design tradeoffs:** Choosing between high-resolution vs. coarse data affects model complexity and training time. Multi-task learning can improve generalization but may reduce performance on individual tasks. Balancing data diversity with task relevance is crucial
- **Failure signatures:** Poor performance may indicate: (1) inadequate preprocessing or normalization, (2) model architecture mismatch with data characteristics, (3) insufficient data diversity or quantity, (4) improper evaluation metrics
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Train a simple CNN on the aviation turbulence classification task using MERRA-2 data and PIREP labels to establish baseline performance
  2. Implement the GW parameterization regression task using the Attention-Unet architecture on ERA5 data to test learning of subgrid-scale processes
  3. Fine-tune a pre-trained vision-language model on the natural language weather forecast generation task to evaluate multi-modal learning capabilities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How does the WxC-Bench dataset handle the trade-off between spatial resolution and computational efficiency for different downstream tasks, and what are the optimal resolutions for each task?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper discusses the use of different spatial resolutions for various tasks, such as using a 0.625°x0.5° grid for aviation turbulence and a 2.8°x2.8° grid for gravity wave parameterization. However, it does not explicitly address the optimal resolutions for each task or the computational implications
- **Why unresolved:** The paper provides information on the resolutions used but does not delve into the trade-offs or optimal choices for each task, leaving room for further investigation into the balance between resolution and computational efficiency
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Detailed computational cost analysis for each task at different resolutions, along with performance metrics to determine the optimal balance

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What are the potential biases introduced by using MERRA-2 reanalysis data for aviation turbulence detection, and how can these biases be mitigated in future studies?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper mentions that MERRA-2 resolves synoptic scale features but not fine-scaled processes such as boundary layer growth, which are relevant for aviation turbulence. It also notes that turbulence is a microscale feature that defies direct prediction by numerical weather prediction models
- **Why unresolved:** While the paper acknowledges the limitations of MERRA-2 for turbulence detection, it does not explore the potential biases introduced by these limitations or suggest methods to mitigate them
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A detailed analysis of the biases in MERRA-2 data for turbulence detection, along with proposed methods to correct or mitigate these biases in future studies

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can the WxC-Bench dataset be extended to include more diverse atmospheric phenomena and tasks, and what are the challenges in curating such an extension?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] The paper discusses the current tasks included in WxC-Bench but does not provide a roadmap for future extensions or the challenges involved in curating additional tasks
- **Why unresolved:** The paper focuses on the current state of the dataset but does not address the potential for expansion or the challenges that may arise in curating a more comprehensive dataset
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A proposal for extending the dataset with new tasks, along with a discussion of the challenges and potential solutions for curating these extensions

## Limitations

- Multi-task learning benefits remain theoretically plausible but lack direct experimental validation within this work
- The dataset's generalizability claims rely on scale diversity, but the selection of tasks may still represent a narrow slice of atmospheric phenomena
- Some preprocessing pipelines (particularly for weather analog search and natural language generation tasks) lack sufficient technical detail for exact reproduction

## Confidence

- **Mechanism 1 (multi-scale generalization): Medium** - Theoretically sound but lacks ablation studies showing scale diversity specifically drives generalization gains
- **Mechanism 2 (preprocessing standardization): High** - Well-documented with clear examples of normalization approaches for each data type
- **Mechanism 3 (multi-task learning benefits): Low** - Dataset enables this approach but paper doesn't demonstrate it experimentally

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study on scale diversity**: Train models using only single-scale subsets of the data (e.g., only synoptic-scale hurricane data) versus the full multi-scale dataset to quantify generalization improvements
2. **Cross-task transfer evaluation**: Implement a multi-task training framework and measure performance changes when tasks are trained jointly versus individually, particularly focusing on shared representations between turbulence detection and GW parameterization
3. **Reproducibility audit**: Independently implement the preprocessing pipeline for one underrepresented task (e.g., weather analog search) to verify completeness of technical specifications and identify gaps in documentation
