# Whole-Graph Representation Learning For the Classification of Signed Networks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2409.20073
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20073
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Proposed whole-graph methods for signed networks outperform vertex aggregation baseline with F-measures of 73.01 (SG2V) and 81.20 (WSGCN) versus 58.57

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the gap in whole-graph representation learning for signed networks, where relationships have both positive and negative values. While existing methods can handle unsigned graphs or vertex-level representations of signed graphs, there is a lack of approaches for whole-graph signed networks. The authors propose two main methods: SG2V, a signed adaptation of Graph2vec using modified Weisfeiler-Lehman relabeling, and WSGCN, a whole-graph extension of SGCN that introduces master nodes to aggregate signed vertex representations. They construct a benchmark dataset of three collections of signed graphs annotated for classification tasks across different domains. Experimental results demonstrate that the signed whole-graph methods significantly outperform a baseline approach based on aggregating signed vertex embeddings.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces two novel methods for whole-graph representation learning in signed networks. SG2V adapts Graph2vec by incorporating signed Weisfeiler-Lehman relabeling to capture structural balance information. The method generates subgraphs for each graph, applies signed vertex relabeling based on edge signs, and uses a skip-gram model to learn embeddings. WSGCN extends SGCN by introducing master nodes that aggregate signed vertex representations through a master layer, creating graph-level embeddings that preserve signed structural information. Both methods are designed to handle the unique challenges of signed networks where positive and negative relationships create complex structural patterns that standard unsigned methods cannot adequately capture.

## Key Results
- SG2V achieves F-measure of 73.01 on the benchmark dataset, outperforming the baseline of 58.57
- WSGCN reaches F-measure of 81.20, the highest among all tested methods
- Both signed whole-graph methods significantly outperform the baseline that aggregates signed vertex embeddings
- The methods demonstrate effectiveness across three diverse domains: online conversation moderation, correlation clustering solutions, and European Parliament voting patterns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Signed networks contain rich structural information through the interplay of positive and negative relationships, creating patterns of structural balance that unsigned methods cannot capture. The proposed methods explicitly incorporate this signed information through modified relabeling schemes and master node architectures that preserve the polarity of relationships during the aggregation process. By treating the entire graph as the fundamental unit rather than aggregating individual node representations, these methods can capture global structural properties that are crucial for classification tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- **Signed Graph Theory**: Understanding how positive and negative edges create structural balance patterns is essential for designing appropriate representations. Quick check: Verify that the representation method preserves balance properties through neighborhood aggregation.
- **Graph Neural Networks**: Knowledge of how message passing works in standard GNNs provides the foundation for understanding signed variants. Quick check: Ensure signed edge information is properly propagated through layers.
- **Weisfeiler-Lehman Relabeling**: This graph isomorphism test forms the basis for subgraph-based embedding methods. Quick check: Confirm that relabeling captures both local structure and signed relationships.
- **Skip-gram Models**: Understanding word2vec-style embeddings helps explain how subgraph patterns are learned. Quick check: Verify that subgraph co-occurrence patterns are properly captured.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** Graph Collection → SG2V/WSGCN → Embedding Layer → Classification Layer → Performance Metrics
**Critical Path:** Input graphs → Subgraph generation (SG2V) or Master layer (WSGCN) → Signed embedding computation → Graph-level representation → Classifier → Evaluation
**Design Tradeoffs:** SG2V trades computational efficiency for expressiveness through subgraph enumeration, while WSGCN balances expressivity with scalability through master nodes but requires careful tuning of aggregation parameters.
**Failure Signatures:** Poor performance on structurally balanced graphs may indicate insufficient signed information propagation; degradation on large graphs suggests scalability issues in subgraph generation or master node aggregation.
**First Experiments:** 1) Test on small synthetic signed graphs with known balance properties, 2) Compare signed vs unsigned variants on balanced/unbalanced graphs, 3) Evaluate sensitivity to master node initialization in WSGCN.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Benchmark datasets are relatively small (13-36 graphs per collection), limiting generalizability
- Evaluation focuses primarily on classification tasks without exploring other potential applications
- Comparison is limited to one baseline method, lacking broader method comparison
- Computational complexity analysis is insufficient for assessing real-world scalability

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Core claims about superiority of whole-graph methods over vertex aggregation
- **Medium confidence**: Implementation details of signed adaptations and their effectiveness
- **Medium confidence**: Claim that structural balance information improves performance

## Next Checks
1. Conduct experiments on larger signed network datasets to verify scalability and performance consistency
2. Perform ablation studies to quantify the contribution of structural balance information versus other design choices
3. Test the methods on additional graph-level tasks beyond classification to evaluate broader applicability
