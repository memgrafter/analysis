# A Resolution Independent Neural Operator

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.13010
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13010
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces a resolution-independent DeepONet (RI-DeepONet) and a more general Resolution Independent Neural Operator (RINO) that learn continuous, differentiable basis functions to project arbitrary point clouds onto a fixed embedding space, enabling robust operator learning on unstructured meshes.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of applying neural operators like DeepONet to input functions sampled at arbitrary, non-uniform locations. The core method introduces a resolution-independent DeepONet (RI-DeepONet) by learning continuous, differentiable basis functions via implicit neural representations (INRs) to project arbitrary point clouds onto a fixed embedding space. This embedding serves as the input to DeepONet, eliminating the need for consistent sensor placement. Building on this, a more general Resolution Independent Neural Operator (RINO) is proposed, where both input and output functions are embedded into such spaces, and the operator learning reduces to a mapping between these compact embeddings. The approach is validated across several PDE examples, including nonlinear Darcy and Burgers equations, and solid mechanics, demonstrating robust performance on unstructured meshes and achieving accuracy comparable to or better than standard DeepONet while using fewer parameters. The learned bases are shown to be compact and generalizable, outperforming methods like GPOD and random projection in accuracy and interpretability.

## Method Summary
The method introduces two dictionary learning algorithms to adaptively learn a set of appropriate continuous basis functions, parameterized as implicit neural representations (INRs), from correlated signals on arbitrary point cloud data. These basis functions are then used to project input and output function data onto a fixed-dimensional embedding space, enabling the use of standard neural operator architectures like DeepONet on data sampled at arbitrary locations. In the RINO variant, the operator learning task simplifies to learning a mapping from the coefficients of input basis functions to the coefficients of output basis functions, further reducing the complexity and improving interpretability.

## Key Results
- RI-DeepONet achieves comparable accuracy to standard DeepONet on nonlinear Darcy and Burgers equations while being robust to arbitrary sensor placements.
- RINO outperforms RI-DeepONet in accuracy and interpretability by learning both input and output bases, reducing the operator learning task to a single mapping between coefficient spaces.
- The learned basis functions are compact (e.g., 10 bases for 100-dimensional data) and generalize well, outperforming GPOD and random projection in reconstruction and operator learning tasks.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The proposed dictionary learning method finds continuous, differentiable basis functions that span the function space of the input or output data, allowing projection onto a finite-dimensional embedding without loss of information.
- Mechanism: A batch-wise or sample-wise algorithm iteratively adds new neural network basis functions that capture the residual error across realizations. By projecting signals onto these basis functions and minimizing reconstruction error with an L2 regularizer, the method produces (weakly) orthogonal basis functions that can be evaluated at arbitrary points.
- Core assumption: The signals are bandwidth-limited and sampled sufficiently densely (above the Nyquist rate), ensuring no aliasing and that the residual can be modeled by additional basis functions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We propose two dictionary learning algorithms to adaptively learn a set of appropriate continuous basis functions, parameterized as implicit neural representations (INRs), from correlated signals on arbitrary point cloud data."
  - [section]: "The introduced dictionary learning algorithms are then used in a similar way to learn an appropriate dictionary of basis functions for the output function data, which defines a new neural operator architecture..."
  - [corpus]: Missing explicit experimental comparison with other INR-based operator learning methods; weak support for claim that learned bases are always "appropriate".
- Break condition: If the input signals are undersampled or contain high-frequency components beyond the basis function capacity, reconstruction error will grow and the embedding will no longer be faithful.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Resolution Independent Neural Operator (RINO) maps between coefficient spaces of input and output function bases, avoiding the need to learn a trunk network that approximates output functions directly.
- Mechanism: Once separate dictionaries for input and output functions are learned, operator learning reduces to training a single neural network that maps input basis coefficients to output basis coefficients. This is more compact and interpretable than learning both branch and trunk networks.
- Core assumption: The learned output basis functions are sufficiently expressive to span the output function space, so a simple mapping between coefficients suffices.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "In the RINO, the operator learning task simplifies to learning a mapping from the coefficients of input basis functions to the coefficients of output basis functions."
  - [section]: "In the RINO, we develop dictionary learning algorithms that adaptively learn basis functions to approximate signals defined on arbitrary point clouds."
  - [corpus]: No direct comparison of RINO vs DeepONet on identical problems with fixed sensors; weak evidence for claimed compactness advantage.
- Break condition: If the output basis set is not sufficiently expressive or the mapping between coefficients is highly nonlinear, the single network may fail to capture the operator accurately.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The learned basis functions are compact and generalizable, reducing the dimensionality of the input/output data and improving downstream operator learning.
- Mechanism: The dictionary learning algorithm enforces orthogonality (weakly) and adds basis functions only as needed to reduce reconstruction error. This yields a minimal set of basis functions that capture the essential structure of the data.
- Core assumption: The data lies on or near a low-dimensional manifold in function space, so a small number of orthogonal basis functions suffice.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The learned bases are shown to be compact and generalizable, outperforming methods like GPOD and random projection in accuracy and interpretability."
  - [section]: "In one example, the data dimensionality was 100, and we achieved a relatively low reconstruction error using only 10 basis functions."
  - [corpus]: No quantitative comparison with random projection or GPOD on the same datasets; weak evidence for interpretability claims.
- Break condition: If the data is truly high-dimensional or lacks low-dimensional structure, many basis functions will be required, negating the compactness benefit.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Orthogonal basis functions in function spaces and their role in projection/reconstruction.
  - Why needed here: The algorithm relies on projecting arbitrary point clouds onto a set of orthogonal basis functions to obtain a consistent embedding regardless of sensor locations.
  - Quick check question: If two basis functions ψ₁(x) and ψ₂(x) are orthogonal, what is the value of their inner product ∫ψ₁(x)ψ₂(x)dx over the domain?

- Concept: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) and their parameterization via SIRENs.
  - Why needed here: The basis functions are implemented as continuous, differentiable neural networks (SIRENs) so they can be evaluated at any point and differentiated automatically.
  - Quick check question: What activation function does a SIREN use, and why is it beneficial for modeling high-frequency signals?

- Concept: Dictionary learning in finite-dimensional vector spaces (e.g., PCA, sparse coding) as a precursor to function-space dictionary learning.
  - Why needed here: The proposed method extends classical dictionary learning ideas to continuous function spaces, so understanding the vector-space case clarifies the motivation and mechanics.
  - Quick check question: In standard dictionary learning, what is the goal when representing a signal as a linear combination of basis vectors?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Data → Random subsampling → Point cloud D(i) → Dictionary Learning (Algorithm 1 or 2) → Basis functions Ψ(x;θ) and coefficients α(i) → Embedding → α(i) fed to DeepONet branch (RI-DeepONet) or single network (RINO) → Operator learning → Train branch/trunk (RI-DeepONet) or single mapping (RINO)

- Critical path:
  1. Generate or load dataset with variable sensor locations.
  2. Learn input dictionary (offline) → obtain basis functions and projection operator.
  3. For RI-DeepONet: Use embeddings in branch net; train branch+trunk jointly.
     For RINO: Also learn output dictionary; train single network mapping input→output coefficients.
  4. Validate on test set with new random sensor locations.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Orthogonality vs. overcomplete dictionary: Enforcing orthogonality reduces redundancy but may require more basis functions; overcomplete dictionaries can be sparser but risk ill-conditioning.
  - Batch-wise vs. sample-wise learning: Batch-wise is more stable and leverages all data; sample-wise can be more adaptive but sensitive to data order.
  - Fixed vs. learned output basis: Using learned output bases (RINO) simplifies the network but adds a preprocessing step; fixed bases (RI-POD-DeepONet) are faster but less flexible.

- Failure signatures:
  - High reconstruction error after dictionary learning → insufficient basis functions or poor sampling.
  - Large gap between training and test errors → overfitting or poor generalization of the learned bases.
  - Unstable training of the operator network → redundant or poorly conditioned embeddings.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the antiderivative example: generate Gaussian random input fields, learn 9 basis functions, train RI-DeepONet, and verify output prediction accuracy on randomly subsampled test inputs.
  2. Apply the method to a simple 1D Darcy problem with unstructured meshes: learn input and output dictionaries, train RINO, and compare prediction error to RI-DeepONet with fixed sensors.
  3. Perform an ablation: replace learned input basis with random ReLU or cosine bases (as in Appendix F) and measure reconstruction and operator learning accuracy to confirm the benefit of learned bases.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do the learned basis functions in RINO compare in terms of generalization and interpretability to traditional basis function methods like POD or Fourier bases?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses that the learned basis functions in RINO are continuous, differentiable, and (weakly) orthogonal, which may improve generalization and interpretability compared to traditional methods.
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions these potential advantages but does not provide a detailed quantitative or qualitative comparison with traditional basis function methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study showing the performance of RINO against traditional methods on a set of benchmark problems, with metrics for generalization (e.g., test error on unseen data) and interpretability (e.g., sparsity of coefficients, similarity to known basis functions).

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the computational complexity of the proposed dictionary learning algorithms, and how does it scale with the number of realizations and the dimensionality of the function space?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the computational complexity of the dictionary learning algorithms but does not provide a detailed analysis of how it scales with the number of realizations and the dimensionality of the function space.
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions that the computational cost may differ between the batch-wise and sample-wise learning algorithms, but it does not provide a detailed analysis of the scaling behavior.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical analysis of the computational complexity of the dictionary learning algorithms, along with empirical results showing how the computational time scales with the number of realizations and the dimensionality of the function space.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How sensitive are the learned basis functions to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, regularization parameter, and frequency parameter in SIREN?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the hyperparameters are chosen through manual trial and error and that their performance may improve with rigorous hyperparameter optimization methods.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the sensitivity of the learned basis functions to the choice of hyperparameters.
- What evidence would resolve it: A sensitivity analysis showing how the learned basis functions and the performance of RINO change with different choices of hyperparameters, along with recommendations for hyperparameter selection.

## Limitations

- The method assumes input/output signals are bandwidth-limited and sufficiently sampled; performance on highly oscillatory or high-dimensional functions is not fully characterized.
- Dictionary learning algorithms are unsupervised and may be sensitive to initialization and data order, especially the sample-wise variant.
- Orthogonality is enforced weakly, so numerical instability could arise if the basis set becomes overcomplete.

## Confidence

- **High** for claims regarding the feasibility of using learned continuous bases to enable resolution-independent operator learning.
- **Medium** for claims about the compactness and generalizability of learned bases, as these are supported by experiments but not rigorously compared to alternatives.
- **Low** for claims about interpretability and superiority over GPOD/random projection, due to lack of direct quantitative comparisons.

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate the method on a benchmark PDE with known analytical solution and known Nyquist rate, explicitly measuring reconstruction error as a function of sensor density.
2. Compare the learned basis functions to random or PCA bases on the same dataset to quantify the benefit of dictionary learning.
3. Test the robustness of the method when the sensor locations are not just randomly subsampled but also include clustering or gaps.
