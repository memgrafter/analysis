# Probing Omissions and Distortions in Transformer-based RDF-to-Text Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.16707
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16707
- Reference count: 25
- Key outcome: Parametric probing detects omissions/distortions in encoder representations with F1 scores up to 0.85

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how transformer-based RDF-to-text models handle omissions and distortions when generating text from structured data. The authors develop two probing methods to detect whether information is missing or misrepresented in generated text by analyzing encoder embeddings. Their findings show that encoder representations contain detectable signals about both omissions and distortions, with parametric probing achieving strong performance. The study provides insights into the relationship between encoder representations and generation quality, suggesting that the encoder plays a crucial role in these types of errors.

## Method Summary
The authors introduce two probing approaches to detect omissions and distortions in transformer-based RDF-to-text generation. The first is a parameter-free method that computes cosine similarity between encoder embeddings of original and modified RDF graphs, using the similarity score to determine if entities are mentioned, omitted, or distorted. The second approach trains a binary classifier (parametric probing) to distinguish between original and modified RDF triples based on encoder representations. The study uses two datasets (WebNLG, E2E) and evaluates on BART and T5 models, comparing parametric and parameter-free probing performance with logistic regression baselines that predict omissions/distortions from dataset features.

## Key Results
- Parametric probing achieves F1 scores up to 0.85 for detecting distortions and 0.82 for omissions
- Parameter-free probing achieves 66-68% success rate in identifying mentioned entities
- Encoder representations contain detectable signals for both omissions and distortions
- Logistic regression on dataset features poorly predicts omissions but moderately predicts distortions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The encoder's attention mechanisms and contextual embeddings capture relationships between RDF triples and their corresponding textual representations. When generating text, the encoder maintains information about which entities should be mentioned and their semantic relationships. Distortions occur when these relationships are incorrectly mapped, while omissions happen when certain entities are not properly attended to during generation. The parametric probing method learns to distinguish between original and modified triples by leveraging these encoded relationships, while parameter-free methods exploit the similarity patterns in embeddings to detect changes.

## Foundational Learning

**Transformer Architecture**: Why needed - Understanding attention mechanisms and self-attention layers that enable the model to capture relationships between input elements. Quick check - Verify that self-attention computes weighted combinations of value vectors based on query-key compatibility scores.

**Encoder-Decoder Framework**: Why needed - Recognizing how encoder representations inform decoder generation decisions. Quick check - Confirm that decoder attends to encoder outputs through cross-attention layers during generation.

**Cosine Similarity**: Why needed - Measuring semantic similarity between embeddings to detect changes in RDF representations. Quick check - Ensure cosine similarity values range between -1 and 1, with higher values indicating greater similarity.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: RDF triples -> Encoder -> Encoder embeddings -> (Parameter-free probing OR Parametric classifier) -> Omission/Distortion detection

Critical path: The encoder processes RDF triples into contextual embeddings, which are then analyzed by probing methods to detect generation errors. The quality of encoder representations directly determines probing accuracy.

Design tradeoffs: Parameter-free probing offers interpretability and no training overhead but lower accuracy, while parametric probing achieves higher performance at the cost of requiring labeled training data and reduced interpretability.

Failure signatures: Low cosine similarity between original and modified embeddings suggests potential omissions/distortions. Poor classifier performance may indicate insufficient encoder representation quality or inadequate training data.

First experiments:
1. Compute baseline cosine similarity between original and randomly modified RDF embeddings
2. Train parametric classifier on a small subset of annotated omission/distortion cases
3. Compare probing results across different encoder layers to identify optimal probing depth

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Parameter-free probing shows lower accuracy (66-68%) compared to parametric methods
- Experiments limited to two specific models (BART, T5) and one RDF dataset (WebNLG)
- Binary classification probing requires expensive manual annotation for training
- Study does not examine correlation between detected errors and downstream quality metrics

## Confidence

**Major claims and confidence:**
- Encoder representations contain detectable signals of omissions and distortions: High confidence
- Parametric probing outperforms parameter-free methods: High confidence
- Encoder plays key role in omissions/distortions: Medium confidence
- Probing methods generalize across models: Medium confidence

## Next Checks
1. Test probing methods on additional RDF-to-text datasets (e.g., E2E, Cleaned E2E) and model architectures (e.g., GPT variants) to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies removing encoder components to determine causal relationship between encoder representations and generation errors
3. Evaluate correlation between probing-detected omissions/distortions and human judgments of generation quality or downstream task performance
