# Conditional Image Synthesis with Diffusion Models: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.19365
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19365
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Systematic survey categorizing conditional image synthesis methods by how conditions integrate into denoising networks and sampling processes

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive framework for understanding conditional image synthesis with diffusion models by organizing existing works based on how conditions are integrated into the denoising network and sampling process. The paper introduces a three-stage taxonomy (training, re-purposing, specialization) for condition integration in the denoising network and identifies six mainstream in-sampling conditioning mechanisms. It covers seven major conditional synthesis tasks including text-to-image, image restoration, and editing, while highlighting key challenges such as sampling acceleration, artifact mitigation, training data limitations, and robustness.

## Method Summary
The survey systematically categorizes conditional image synthesis approaches by examining how conditional information is incorporated at different stages of the diffusion process. The methodology involves analyzing the two fundamental components of diffusion-based modeling - the denoising network and the sampling process - and organizing condition integration methods accordingly. The survey examines various conditional synthesis tasks and identifies common patterns in how conditions are encoded, injected, and strengthened throughout the generation process. The framework provides a structured approach to understanding the trade-offs between different conditioning strategies and their impact on synthesis quality.

## Key Results
- Three-stage taxonomy (training, re-purposing, specialization) provides systematic framework for condition integration
- Six mainstream in-sampling conditioning mechanisms identified for flexible generation control
- Classifier-free guidance effectively balances quality and diversity through conditional strengthening
- Comprehensive coverage of seven major conditional synthesis tasks with task-specific encoder strategies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The survey's three-stage taxonomy enables systematic condition integration across diverse tasks
- Mechanism: The framework organizes condition integration methods by their deployment stage, allowing researchers to select appropriate strategies based on task requirements and resource constraints
- Core assumption: Different conditional synthesis tasks have varying requirements for model fidelity, computational resources, and generalization capabilities
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "categorize existing works based on how conditions are integrated into the two fundamental components of diffusion-based modeling, i.e., the denoising network and the sampling process"
  - [section]: "We divide the condition integration in denoising network into three stages: (a)training stage: training a denoising network on paired conditional input and target image from scratch"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus focuses on different applications of diffusion models rather than condition integration strategies
- Break condition: When conditional inputs are too complex or diverse for any single stage's conditioning approach, requiring hybrid strategies

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Six in-sampling conditioning mechanisms provide flexible control during generation without expensive fine-tuning
- Mechanism: These mechanisms inject conditional information during sampling steps through attention manipulation, noise blending, and guidance strategies
- Core assumption: Diffusion models' iterative sampling process can accommodate additional conditioning signals without disrupting the fundamental denoising operation
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We also summarize six mainstream conditioning mechanisms in the sampling process"
  - [section]: "Based on how the conditional control signals are incorporated into the sampling process, we divide mainstream in-sampling conditioning mechanisms into six categories"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus examples focus on specific applications rather than the general mechanism taxonomy
- Break condition: When in-sampling modifications cause artifacts or distribution shifts that cannot be corrected through existing mitigation strategies

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Condition strengthening via classifier-free guidance balances quality and diversity in conditional synthesis
- Mechanism: The guidance formula (1+w)ϵθ(xt, c)−wϵθ(xt) interpolates between conditional and unconditional predictions to strengthen conditioning influence
- Core assumption: The conditional and unconditional noise predictions capture complementary aspects of the target distribution
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Finally, in Sec. 2.4, we introduced the classic condition strengthening approaches widely employed across various DCIS works"
  - [section]: "Classifier-free guidance (Ho & Salimans, 2022) paves a training-free pathway to approximate p(c|xt)∝p(xt|c)/p(xt)"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus contains related work but not specifically about classifier-free guidance mechanics
- Break condition: When guidance scaling causes excessive mode collapse or when conditional inputs are incompatible with unconditional predictions

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Diffusion process fundamentals (forward and reverse processes)
  - Why needed here: Understanding the basic diffusion framework is essential for grasping how conditional information integrates at different stages
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between the forward diffusion process and the learned denoising network?

- Concept: Cross-attention mechanisms in diffusion models
  - Why needed here: Cross-attention layers are the primary mechanism for injecting conditional information into the denoising network
  - Quick check question: How do cross-attention layers differ from self-attention layers in the context of conditional diffusion models?

- Concept: Variational inference and score matching
  - Why needed here: These mathematical foundations explain why diffusion models can learn to reverse the noising process and how conditional information is incorporated
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between score matching and the denoising objective in diffusion models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: U-Net backbone with self-attention and cross-attention layers -> Time embedding network for timestep conditioning -> Conditional encoder modules (text, image, or other modalities) -> Sampling process controller with DDIM or other solvers -> Optional guidance modules for condition strengthening

- Critical path: Input → Conditional encoder → Cross-attention injection → U-Net denoising → Output generation
  - Most critical: Cross-attention integration quality
  - Second: Conditioning encoder design
  - Third: Guidance parameter tuning

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Training from scratch vs. fine-tuning existing models (computational cost vs. task specificity)
  - Condition injection during training vs. sampling (model capacity vs. flexibility)
  - Guidance strength vs. sample diversity (quality vs. variety)

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor conditioning → Loss of semantic alignment with inputs
  - Excessive guidance → Mode collapse and lack of diversity
  - Improper cross-attention → Structural artifacts in outputs
  - Training instability → Poor convergence or mode collapse

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement basic conditional diffusion model with text conditioning using cross-attention layers
  2. Add classifier-free guidance and experiment with different guidance scales
  3. Implement one in-sampling conditioning mechanism (e.g., attention manipulation) and compare to baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can sampling acceleration techniques be generalized across different conditional synthesis tasks beyond text-to-image?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that most diffusion model compression approaches are tailored for text-to-image models and questions whether parameter redundancy exists in other conditional synthesis tasks.
- Why unresolved: Current compression methods are task-specific, and it's unclear if similar redundancies exist in more complex conditional tasks like image editing or composition.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies showing successful compression of diffusion models for non-text-to-image conditional tasks, or analysis revealing common architectural redundancies across different conditional synthesis domains.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the most effective unified framework for conditional synthesis that can handle diverse user intents and control signals?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies this as a future direction, suggesting the development of a unified framework built on powerful multimodal large language models.
- Why unresolved: Current frameworks are task-specific and formalize complex user intents into strict categories, limiting flexibility. While MLLMs show promise, their image generation quality and control for complex scenes remain limited.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and demonstration of a unified conditional synthesis framework capable of handling diverse tasks and control signals with high quality and flexibility.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the trade-off between sampling speed and synthesis quality be optimized for real-world deployment of diffusion models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies sampling acceleration as a key challenge and notes that too few denoising steps may compromise the effectiveness of in-sampling condition integration.
- Why unresolved: Existing acceleration methods often sacrifice quality, and there's a need for techniques that maintain condition integration effectiveness while reducing sampling steps.
- What evidence would resolve it: Techniques that achieve significant sampling speed improvements without compromising the quality of condition integration or overall synthesis quality.

## Limitations

- The categorization framework may not capture all possible variations or hybrid approaches combining multiple conditioning strategies
- Focus on mainstream mechanisms might overlook emerging techniques that could become significant
- Analysis of challenges is forward-looking but may not fully account for future technological developments in training efficiency and model scaling

## Confidence

- **High**: The basic taxonomy of conditioning stages (training, re-purposing, specialization) and the six in-sampling conditioning mechanisms are well-established and widely used in the literature
- **Medium**: The survey's framework for organizing conditional synthesis tasks is comprehensive but may not encompass all possible task variations or novel applications
- **Medium**: The identified challenges and future directions are based on current limitations but may evolve with technological advances

## Next Checks

1. Implement and compare at least three different conditioning mechanisms from the survey on a standardized conditional image synthesis task to validate the framework's practical utility
2. Conduct ablation studies on classifier-free guidance scaling to empirically determine optimal guidance strengths for different conditional tasks
3. Evaluate the robustness of various in-sampling conditioning mechanisms to corrupted or noisy conditional inputs to assess their practical reliability
