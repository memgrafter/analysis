# AI Safety in Practice: Enhancing Adversarial Robustness in Multimodal Image Captioning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2407.21174
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21174
- **Reference count**: 17
- **Primary result**: Selective adversarial training of only the text decoder in multimodal image captioning models achieves comparable BLEU scores to full adversarial training while reducing computational costs

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses adversarial robustness in multimodal image captioning systems that combine Vision Transformer (ViT) encoders with GPT-2 decoders. The authors propose a targeted adversarial training approach where only the text decoder is trained with adversarial examples, while the image encoder remains frozen. Experiments on Flickr8k and COCO datasets demonstrate that this selective training achieves BLEU scores comparable to full adversarial training (e.g., 0.181 vs 0.215 on Flickr8k test set) while offering significant computational efficiency. The study reveals that training only the image encoder leads to substantially degraded performance, highlighting the importance of decoder-focused adversarial training in multimodal systems.

## Method Summary
The proposed method involves generating adversarial examples using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and applying them exclusively during training of the text decoder component. The image encoder (ViT) remains frozen throughout the training process, preserving its learned visual representations. This selective adversarial training approach aims to balance robustness against adversarial attacks with computational efficiency. The model architecture combines a frozen Vision Transformer for image encoding with a GPT-2 decoder for caption generation, trained end-to-end with the selective adversarial component. The approach is evaluated on two standard image captioning datasets: Flickr8k and COCO.

## Key Results
- Selective decoder training achieves BLEU score of 0.181 on Flickr8k test set versus 0.215 for full adversarial training
- Encoder-only adversarial training results in significantly degraded performance compared to baseline models
- Computational efficiency is improved through selective training while maintaining comparable robustness to full adversarial training
- The approach demonstrates practical viability for deployment scenarios where training resources are constrained

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism behind selective adversarial training success lies in the complementary nature of visual and textual representations in multimodal systems. By freezing the image encoder, the model preserves robust visual features learned from large-scale pretraining, while the decoder learns to generate captions that are resistant to adversarial perturbations in the text space. The FGSM-generated adversarial examples during decoder training help the model learn to produce stable captions even when facing subtle image perturbations. This approach leverages the fact that caption generation is primarily a language modeling task conditioned on visual features, making the decoder the critical component for adversarial robustness in the output space.

## Foundational Learning

**Vision Transformer (ViT)**: A transformer-based architecture for image processing that treats images as sequences of patches, applying self-attention mechanisms to capture spatial relationships. Why needed: ViT provides robust visual feature extraction that forms the foundation for multimodal understanding. Quick check: Verify that patch embeddings capture relevant visual information through attention visualization.

**Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)**: A one-step gradient-based attack that generates adversarial examples by adding noise in the direction of the gradient of the loss function. Why needed: FGSM provides computationally efficient adversarial examples for training robust models. Quick check: Confirm that generated adversarial examples cause misclassification in unprotected models.

**GPT-2 Decoder**: A transformer-based language model architecture that generates sequential text outputs based on learned patterns. Why needed: GPT-2 provides the language generation capability necessary for producing coherent image captions. Quick check: Validate that the decoder can generate fluent captions from clean visual inputs.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Vision Transformer (frozen) -> Text Decoder (GPT-2 with adversarial training) -> Caption Output

**Critical path**: Input image → ViT patches → Transformer encoder → Frozen visual features → Text decoder → Generated caption

**Design tradeoffs**: The frozen encoder approach trades fine-tuning capability for computational efficiency and preservation of pretrained visual knowledge. This creates a dependency where visual robustness must be established during pretraining rather than through task-specific fine-tuning.

**Failure signatures**: Performance degradation when facing attacks that exploit the frozen encoder's inability to adapt to adversarial perturbations in visual space. Limited generalization when visual features from pretraining don't align with target domain distributions.

**3 first experiments**:
1. Evaluate baseline model performance with clean images on both Flickr8k and COCO datasets
2. Test model robustness against FGSM attacks on the decoder while keeping encoder frozen
3. Compare BLEU scores between selective training, full adversarial training, and encoder-only training approaches

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Exclusive focus on FGSM-based attacks limits generalizability to more sophisticated adversarial methodologies
- Computational efficiency claims lack comparison with alternative efficiency-focused approaches like feature denoising
- Experimental scope restricted to two standard datasets, limiting domain generalizability
- BLEU metric alone may not capture comprehensive semantic robustness or quality dimensions

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Computational efficiency gains from selective decoder training are well-established through controlled experiments

**Medium confidence**: Comparative performance between selective and full adversarial training is reliable within FGSM attack scenarios

**Medium confidence**: Finding that encoder-only adversarial training degrades performance is supported, though mechanisms warrant deeper investigation

**Low confidence**: Generalizability of robustness to non-FGSM attacks and real-world deployment scenarios

## Next Checks

1. Test the selective training approach against iterative adversarial attacks (PGD) and adaptive attacks designed to exploit frozen encoder architectures

2. Evaluate model performance across additional multimodal tasks beyond image captioning (e.g., visual question answering, image-text matching) to assess generalizability

3. Conduct ablation studies on different freezing strategies (e.g., freezing attention layers vs. full encoder) and analyze impact on both adversarial robustness and caption quality across multiple evaluation metrics (METEOR, CIDEr, semantic similarity measures)
