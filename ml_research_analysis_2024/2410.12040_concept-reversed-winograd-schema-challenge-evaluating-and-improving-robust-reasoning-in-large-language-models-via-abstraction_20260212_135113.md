# Concept-Reversed Winograd Schema Challenge: Evaluating and Improving Robust Reasoning in Large Language Models via Abstraction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.12040
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12040
- Authors: Kaiqiao Han; Tianqing Fang; Zhaowei Wang; Yangqiu Song; Mark Steedman
- Reference count: 32
- Key outcome: CR-WSC significantly reduces LLM performance by reversing concept associations, while AoT prompting improves robustness and consistency through conceptual abstraction

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Concept-Reversed Winograd Schema Challenge (CR-WSC), an adversarial dataset derived from the Winograd Schema Challenge by reversing concept associations to confuse language models. While the underlying reasoning logic remains unchanged, CR-WSC causes significant performance drops in LLMs, revealing their reliance on superficial semantic associations rather than robust reasoning. To address this, the authors propose Abstraction-of-Thought (AoT), a prompting method that abstracts adversarial entities into conceptual types to normalize reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that AoT improves both accuracy and consistency across multiple LLMs on CR-WSC, suggesting that abstraction-based reasoning enhances model robustness and reduces vulnerability to misleading semantic cues.

## Method Summary
The CR-WSC dataset is constructed by reversing concept associations in original WSC examples, creating adversarial entity pairs that are semantically associated with wrong answers. The AoT method operates in two stages: first abstracting queries to transform them into generalized forms by conceptualizing specific entities into conceptual types, then applying deductive reasoning to derive answers. The method is evaluated on CR-WSC using zero-shot, one-shot, and AoT prompting methods, measuring single accuracy, pair accuracy, and consistency metrics. Dataset construction involves expert annotation followed by LLM generation and manual verification, resulting in approximately 500 examples.

## Key Results
- CR-WSC causes significant performance drops in LLMs despite unchanged reasoning logic, demonstrating reliance on superficial associations
- AoT prompting improves both accuracy and consistency across multiple LLMs on CR-WSC adversarial examples
- Consistency evaluation reveals whether models truly understand reasoning versus memorizing patterns, with AoT showing better consistency scores
- The abstraction mechanism successfully normalizes adversarial cases when appropriate abstraction levels are used

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Reversing concept associations in WSC examples causes LLMs to rely on superficial associations rather than robust reasoning
- Mechanism: When entities are replaced with those more associated with wrong answers (e.g., "frail senior" vs "weak"), LLMs follow incorrect semantic associations rather than logical reasoning path
- Core assumption: LLMs rely on word associations and co-occurrence patterns rather than understanding underlying reasoning structure
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "By simply reversing the concepts to those that are more associated with the wrong answer, we find that the performance of LLMs drops significantly despite the rationale of reasoning remaining the same"
  - [section] "we try our best to develop adversarial entity pairs that are semantically associated with wrong answers by replacing the original entities with confusing ones"
  - [corpus] FMR scores suggest related work focuses on adversarial modifications to WSC, supporting mechanism of using concept reversal to challenge LLMs
- Break condition: If LLMs develop true reasoning capabilities that can abstract away from surface-level associations, concept reversal would no longer cause performance drops

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Abstraction-of-Thought (AoT) helps LLMs recover from adversarial cases by normalizing reasoning through conceptual abstraction
- Mechanism: By abstracting adversarial entities into conceptual types (e.g., "bodybuilder" → "strong individual"), LLMs can avoid being distracted by confusing word associations and focus on underlying reasoning structure
- Core assumption: LLMs have strong conceptualization abilities that can be leveraged to improve reasoning robustness
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "AoT, a novel prompt method for recovering adversarial cases to normal cases using conceptual abstraction to improve LLMs' robustness and consistency in reasoning"
  - [section] "by conceptualizing 'bodybuilder' to a PersonX and 'frail senior' to a PersonY, LLMs will not be distracted by the adversarial word association and thus make the correct prediction"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related work on abstraction (e.g., "Take a step back" by Zheng et al.) supports general concept but doesn't directly validate this specific mechanism
- Break condition: If LLMs cannot effectively perform required level of abstraction, or if abstraction level is inappropriate for reasoning task

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Consistency evaluation reveals whether LLMs truly understand reasoning versus memorizing patterns
- Mechanism: By grouping questions with similar reasoning paths and measuring consistency across them, we can determine if LLMs have mastered underlying reasoning or just memorized specific patterns
- Core assumption: True reasoning mastery should result in consistent correct answers across similar reasoning scenarios
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Consistency here refers to the ability of a QA system to answer questions consistently using similar reasoning paths"
  - [section] "If the LM consistently answers questions with similar reasoning paths correctly, it demonstrates mastery of the underlying reasoning in the given context"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related work on consistency evaluation exists but doesn't specifically address this mechanism for WSC-style reasoning
- Break condition: If LLMs can achieve high consistency through pattern matching rather than genuine reasoning understanding

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) coreference resolution
  - Why needed here: Entire paper builds on WSC as base reasoning task that gets modified into CR-WSC
  - Quick check question: In "The father cannot lift the son, because he was weak," who does "he" refer to and why?

- Concept: Adversarial example generation
  - Why needed here: CR-WSC is constructed by creating adversarial entity pairs that confuse LLMs
  - Quick check question: How would replacing "father" with "bodybuilder" and "son" with "frail senior" change difficulty of WSC example?

- Concept: Conceptual abstraction in LLMs
  - Why needed here: AoT relies on ability to abstract specific entities into conceptual types to normalize reasoning
  - Quick check question: What conceptual type would both "bodybuilder" and "strong man" map to in context of lifting capability?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Dataset construction pipeline: Expert annotation → LLM generation → Manual verification; Evaluation framework: Zero-shot, one-shot, and AoT prompting methods; Abstraction mechanism: Conceptualization step followed by reasoning step

- Critical path: 1. Create CR-WSC dataset by reversing concept associations in WSC; 2. Implement AoT prompting with two-stage process (abstraction → reasoning); 3. Evaluate performance on CR-WSC vs original WSC; 4. Measure consistency across reasoning paths

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Dataset size vs quality: Limited to ~500 examples due to manual verification requirements
  - Abstraction level: Too specific loses benefit, too abstract loses context
  - Prompt complexity: More detailed prompts may improve performance but reduce generalizability

- Failure signatures:
  - AoT fails when abstraction level is inappropriate (as shown in case studies)
  - Concept reversal fails if LLMs develop true reasoning rather than pattern matching
  - Consistency metrics may be misleading if LLMs learn to be consistently wrong

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare performance on original WSC vs CR-WSC using zero-shot prompting to establish baseline difficulty increase
  2. Test AoT effectiveness on CR-WSC-H and CR-WSC-M datasets across different model sizes
  3. Measure consistency improvements when using AoT versus standard prompting methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can we scale up the Concept-Reversed Winograd Schema Challenge dataset without relying heavily on human annotation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges that human labor is a limitation in dataset construction, noting that "the scale of CR-WSC is still limited to around 500 examples" and that "this approach requires significant human judgment and evaluation."
- Why unresolved: The paper attempted to scale up using data from WinoGrande but found that the non-Google-proof constraint was not always satisfied, preventing derivation of more confusing cases. The authors suggest future work could focus on data distillation from LLMs using test-time scaling.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results demonstrating successful scaling of CR-WSC through automated methods (e.g., test-time scaling or data distillation) while maintaining the non-LLM-proof quality and preserving the reasoning rationale.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we determine the optimal level of abstraction in the Abstraction-of-Thought method to ensure it effectively eliminates adversarial influences without losing essential reasoning information?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper provides an AoT failure case where conceptualization did not eliminate adversarial issues because it did not abstract to the appropriate level ("conceptualized 'The bodybuilder' as a strong individual and 'the frail senior' as a physically weaker individual"). The authors note this as "a future research direction worth exploring."
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments comparing different levels of abstraction in AoT, showing how abstraction granularity affects performance on CR-WSC, and identifying abstraction strategies that consistently eliminate adversarial influences while preserving reasoning accuracy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the limitations of using consistency as a metric for evaluating reasoning quality in language models, and how can we develop more comprehensive evaluation frameworks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces consistency evaluation and notes that "Methods with higher single accuracy and pair accuracy in Table 2 may exhibit lower consistency" and that "incorporating consistency evaluation into the assessment of QA systems" is significant.
- Why unresolved: The paper only provides a consistency metric and demonstrates its importance, but does not explore its limitations or how it compares to other reasoning quality metrics. The relationship between consistency, accuracy, and genuine reasoning understanding remains unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies evaluating multiple reasoning quality metrics (including consistency, accuracy, robustness to adversarial examples, and generalization to novel reasoning scenarios) to determine which combinations best capture genuine reasoning ability versus superficial pattern matching.

## Limitations
- Dataset scale limitations: CR-WSC contains only 410 examples, limiting statistical power and generalizability of results
- Prompt engineering opacity: AoT method relies on carefully crafted prompt templates not fully specified in main paper
- Abstraction level tuning: Method requires appropriate abstraction levels that are not clearly specified for new domains or question types

## Confidence
- High confidence: Core observation that reversing concept associations in WSC examples causes LLMs to perform worse (from abstract evidence and corpus support for adversarial modifications to WSC)
- Medium confidence: Claim that AoT improves both accuracy and consistency across multiple LLMs (supported by experimental results but limited by dataset size and prompt specification issues)
- Low confidence: Assertion that AoT's improvements stem specifically from conceptual abstraction rather than other prompt engineering effects or memorization patterns

## Next Checks
1. Obtain and test the exact AoT prompt templates from the GitHub repository to verify whether reported improvements replicate with specified prompts
2. Evaluate whether performance improvements scale with dataset size by testing AoT on progressively larger subsets of CR-WSC (50, 100, 200 examples)
3. Apply the AoT method to a different reasoning task (e.g., logical puzzles or mathematical word problems) to test whether abstraction approach generalizes beyond Winograd Schema-style reasoning
