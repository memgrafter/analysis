# Exploring Large Language Models for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis: Challenges, Benchmarks, and Future Directions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.15408
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15408
- Authors: Shezheng Song
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: LLMs underperform traditional supervised methods for MABSA tasks, with F1 scores of 54.29-55.62 vs 62.90-71.90

## Executive Summary
This study investigates the performance of large language models (LLMs) for Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (MABSA), which extracts aspect terms and their sentiment polarities from text-image pairs. The authors develop LLM4SA, a framework that uses in-context learning with visual and textual features processed by LLMs including Llama2, LLaVA, and ChatGPT. Their experiments compare these LLM-based methods against traditional supervised learning approaches (RoBERTa and DTCA) on Twitter MABSA datasets. Results show LLMs significantly underperform supervised methods, achieving lower F1 scores and much higher inference times. The authors attribute this performance gap to LLMs' insufficient familiarity with MABSA task formats, limited learning from in-context examples, and high computational costs.

## Method Summary
The study develops LLM4SA, a framework that uses in-context learning with visual and textual features processed by LLMs. The approach processes multimodal inputs through three LLM variants: Llama2, LLaVA, and ChatGPT. The framework extracts aspect terms and sentiment polarities from text-image pairs by providing in-context examples to the LLMs. Performance is benchmarked against traditional supervised learning methods (RoBERTa and DTCA) on Twitter MABSA datasets. The evaluation compares F1 scores and inference times across all methods to assess LLM capabilities for fine-grained multimodal sentiment analysis.

## Key Results
- LLMs achieved significantly lower F1 scores (54.29-55.62) compared to supervised methods (62.90-71.90)
- LLM inference times were substantially higher (888-5644 seconds) versus supervised methods (3-67 seconds)
- Performance gap attributed to insufficient LLM familiarity with MABSA task formats and limited in-context learning capacity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study demonstrates that current LLMs struggle with fine-grained multimodal sentiment analysis tasks due to their limited ability to learn from in-context examples and unfamiliarity with specialized task formats. The framework's reliance on in-context learning without task-specific fine-tuning appears insufficient for capturing the nuanced relationships between text and image features required for accurate aspect-based sentiment extraction. The high computational costs further compound the practical limitations of using LLMs for this application.

## Foundational Learning
- Multimodal sentiment analysis: Understanding sentiment across multiple data modalities (text, image)
  - Why needed: Core capability for modern sentiment analysis systems
  - Quick check: Can the system process and integrate text-image pairs effectively?
- Aspect-based sentiment analysis: Identifying specific aspects/entities and their associated sentiments
  - Why needed: Enables granular sentiment understanding beyond document-level polarity
  - Quick check: Does the system extract aspect terms accurately?
- In-context learning: Teaching models through demonstration examples within prompts
  - Why needed: Primary learning mechanism for LLMs without fine-tuning
  - Quick check: Can the model generalize from provided examples to new inputs?
- Computational efficiency metrics: Measuring inference time and resource usage
  - Why needed: Critical for practical deployment considerations
  - Quick check: Does the model meet real-time processing requirements?

## Architecture Onboarding
- Component map: Input (text-image pairs) -> Feature Extraction (LLM/Supervised models) -> Sentiment Analysis (Aspect extraction + Polarity classification) -> Output
- Critical path: Text and image processing -> Feature fusion -> Aspect term identification -> Sentiment polarity determination
- Design tradeoffs: General-purpose LLM flexibility vs. task-specific supervised model accuracy and speed
- Failure signatures: High inference times, low F1 scores on aspect extraction, poor generalization from in-context examples
- First experiments: 1) Baseline supervised method comparison, 2) In-context learning effectiveness testing, 3) Cross-domain dataset evaluation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Performance gap may not generalize across different domains beyond Twitter
- Limited evaluation to three specific LLM variants restricts broader applicability
- Qualitative attribution of performance issues lacks controlled experimental validation

## Confidence
- Core empirical finding (LLM vs supervised performance): High
- Attributed causes of performance gap: Medium
- Domain transferability of results: Low

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies testing whether performance improves when using domain-specific fine-tuning rather than relying solely on in-context learning for the LLMs
2. Evaluate the same methodology on non-Twitter datasets with different multimodal characteristics to assess domain transferability of findings
3. Test whether smaller, task-specialized multimodal models can achieve better MABSA performance than general-purpose LLMs while maintaining reasonable inference speeds
