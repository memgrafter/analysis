# Post-hoc and manifold explanations analysis of facial expression data based on deep learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.18352
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18352
- Authors: Yang Xiao
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: Study uses VGG16, Grad-CAM, t-SNE, and UMAP to predict 40 psychological attributes from facial expressions with superior performance to human annotations

## Executive Summary
This study investigates how deep neural networks process facial expression data and associate it with psychological attributes. Using VGG16, the research demonstrates that neural networks can learn and reproduce key facial features that map to psychological traits. The work employs post-hoc explainable algorithms like Grad-CAM to visualize feature importance and manifold learning techniques (t-SNE, UMAP) to reveal intrinsic relationships between facial images and psychological data, providing new insights into AI explainability in psychological applications.

## Method Summary
The methodology involves training a VGG16 model on 2,222 labeled facial images from the Wilma Bainbridge 10k US Adult Faces Database to predict 40 psychological attributes. The model uses random horizontal flipping and rotations for data augmentation, with training configured for batch size 24 and learning rate 5e-4. Post-hoc explanations are generated using Grad-CAM to highlight important image regions for predictions, while t-SNE and UMAP are applied to visualize the manifold structure of psychological attribute relationships in lower-dimensional space.

## Key Results
- VGG16 achieves superior predictive power compared to human annotations and manual feature extraction methods across 40 psychological attributes
- Grad-CAM effectively attributes connections between psychological variables and facial features by highlighting influential image regions
- Manifold learning algorithms reveal intrinsic relationships between facial expression image data and psychological variable data
- Neural networks demonstrate capability to learn and reproduce key features of facial data, effectively storing image memories

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Neural networks can learn and reproduce key facial features that map to psychological attributes.
- Mechanism: VGG16 uses hierarchical convolutional layers to extract increasingly abstract facial features. Grad-CAM highlights the regions in the image most influential for predicting psychological traits by computing gradients from the output layer back to the convolutional feature maps.
- Core assumption: The internal representations learned by the network encode meaningful psychological information, and these representations are aligned with human-perceived facial cues.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Researchers utilized deep learning model VGG16, demonstrating that neural networks can learn and reproduce key features of facial data, thereby storing image memories."
  - [section 4.3] Grad-CAM mathematically highlights important regions in the image for predicting a psychological concept.
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence, but related papers on FER and deception detection suggest gradient-based visual explanations are commonly used.
- Break condition: If Grad-CAM highlights non-facial or irrelevant regions, or if VGG16 performance is no better than random on psychological attributes, the mechanism fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Manifold learning reveals intrinsic relationships between facial images and psychological attributes.
- Mechanism: t-SNE and UMAP project high-dimensional psychological data into lower-dimensional spaces while preserving local and/or global structure, allowing visualization of clusters that correspond to psychological trait categories.
- Core assumption: Psychological attributes lie on a lower-dimensional manifold embedded in the high-dimensional space, and this structure can be uncovered by non-linear dimensionality reduction.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "manifold learning algorithms such as t-SNE and UMAP are used to reveal the intrinsic relationships between facial expression image data and psychological variable data"
  - [section 4.2, 4.3] Mathematical formulation of t-SNE and UMAP objective functions for preserving distances/probabilities.
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence; the cited papers focus on FER or other domains, not psychological manifold visualization.
- Break condition: If t-SNE/UMAP plots show no discernible clusters or if the 2D/3D embeddings do not preserve the relationships between attributes, the mechanism fails.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Post-hoc explanations align feature attributions with the data manifold, improving interpretability.
- Mechanism: Grad-CAM produces gradient-based feature importance maps, and these maps are expected to align with the tangent space of the data manifold, as suggested by prior work (Bordt et al., 2023).
- Core assumption: The feature attributions from Grad-CAM are not arbitrary but correspond to directions in the data manifold relevant to the prediction.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The criterion of good explainable: the feature attributions need to be aligned with the tangent space of the data manifold"
  - [section 2.1] Reference to Bordt et al. linking explanation alignment with the data manifold.
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence; the cited papers do not explicitly test this alignment in the context of facial psychology.
- Break condition: If Grad-CAM attributions do not correlate with meaningful facial features or if they do not align with the structure revealed by t-SNE/UMAP, the mechanism fails.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
  - Why needed here: VGG16 is a CNN architecture used to extract facial features.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of convolutional layers in a CNN, and how do they differ from fully connected layers?

- Concept: Manifold Learning
  - Why needed here: t-SNE and UMAP are manifold learning techniques used to visualize high-dimensional psychological data.
  - Quick check question: How does t-SNE differ from PCA in terms of preserving local vs. global structure?

- Concept: Explainable AI (XAI)
  - Why needed here: Post-hoc explanation methods like Grad-CAM are used to interpret the model's decisions.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between intrinsic and post-hoc explainability?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: VGG16 backbone -> Grad-CAM layer -> t-SNE/UMAP manifold projection
- Critical path: Input image -> CNN feature extraction -> Psychological attribute prediction -> Grad-CAM visualization -> Manifold embedding of predictions
- Design tradeoffs: VGG16 offers strong performance but is computationally heavy; simpler models might be faster but less accurate.
- Failure signatures: Grad-CAM highlights irrelevant image regions; t-SNE/UMAP show no clusters; model performance is no better than chance.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train VGG16 on a subset of psychological attributes and evaluate Pearson correlation vs. human annotations.
  2. Apply Grad-CAM to visualize feature importance for a chosen attribute (e.g., "happy").
  3. Use t-SNE to embed the predicted psychological scores and check for clustering.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different post-hoc explanation methods (e.g., LIME, SHAP, Grad-CAM) compare in terms of their ability to accurately attribute the connection between psychological variables and facial features?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions several post-hoc explanation methods (LIME, SHAP, Grad-CAM) but does not provide a comparative analysis of their performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper only uses Grad-CAM for post-hoc explanation and does not explore the effectiveness of other methods in explaining the neural network's decisions.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study using multiple post-hoc explanation methods on the same dataset and neural network architecture, evaluating their accuracy and interpretability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: To what extent do neural networks learn and replicate human-like biases when trained on datasets created by human annotators, and how can these biases be mitigated?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the potential for neural networks to inherit and perpetuate societal biases present in the training data, using manifold learning to visualize these biases.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the presence of biases but does not provide a detailed analysis of their sources or propose specific methods to mitigate them.
- What evidence would resolve it: An investigation into the sources of biases in the dataset, including annotator demographics and potential confounding variables, along with experiments testing different bias mitigation techniques.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the incorporation of additional variables, such as hormone levels, personality traits, and visual experience, improve the neural network's understanding of psychological attributes like attractiveness that do not form clear clusters in manifold explanations?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper suggests that facial image data and 20 pairs of psychological attributes are insufficient for a comprehensive explanation of certain psychological traits, implying the need for additional variables.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the impact of incorporating additional variables on the neural network's performance and the interpretability of its decisions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments incorporating additional variables into the dataset and neural network training process, evaluating the improvement in predictive power and the clarity of manifold explanations.

## Limitations

- The correlation between model predictions and human annotations is reported but the statistical significance and error margins are not provided
- The dataset size (2,222 images) is relatively small for deep learning applications, raising concerns about generalizability
- The paper does not address potential biases in the facial expression database or how they might affect psychological attribute predictions

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The technical methodology for using VGG16, Grad-CAM, t-SNE, and UMAP is well-established and correctly described
- **Medium confidence**: The claimed superior predictive power compared to human annotations needs more rigorous statistical validation
- **Low confidence**: The theoretical claims about how these findings advance psychological understanding of AI information processing are speculative

## Next Checks

1. Conduct statistical significance testing on Pearson correlation results between model predictions and human annotations, including confidence intervals
2. Test the same methodology on a larger, more diverse facial expression dataset to assess generalizability
3. Compare VGG16 performance against more modern architectures (e.g., EfficientNet, Vision Transformers) specifically designed for facial analysis tasks
