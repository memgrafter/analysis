- First automatic voice assistant in Wolof language

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the proof-of-concept of the first automatic voice assistant in Wolof, the main vehicular language spoken in Senegal. The voicebot provides information about Orange's Sargal loyalty program through speech, addressing the digital divide where French (spoken by less than 25% of the population) is the official language but Wolof is spoken by 90% of the population. The system processes oral requests using a SLU system and responds with pre-recorded audio messages. The project represents a collaboration between Orange Innovation in France, Orange Senegal, and ADNCorp, a small IT company in Dakar.

## Method Summary
The voicebot uses a speech language understanding (SLU) system to process customer oral requests and reply with pre-recorded audio messages. The system architecture involves automatic speech recognition (ASR) to convert spoken Wolof to text, followed by natural language understanding (NLU) to interpret the intent and extract relevant information. The system then selects appropriate pre-recorded responses to provide information about the Sargal loyalty program. The collaborative development involved multiple organizations across France and Senegal, combining expertise in voice technology and local language knowledge.

## Key Results
- 22% Word Error Rate (WER) for the ASR task
- 78% F1-score on the NLU task
- First implementation of automatic voice assistant in Wolof language

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The voicebot leverages speech as the most natural means of communication to provide digital information access to populations with low literacy rates or limited French proficiency. By using the vehicular language (Wolof) that 90% of the Senegalese population speaks, the system removes language barriers that prevent access to digital services. The SLU architecture allows for natural conversational interaction, while pre-recorded responses ensure high-quality audio output in a language with limited text-to-speech resources.

## Foundational Learning
- Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR): Converts spoken Wolof to text; needed because computers cannot directly process human speech; quick check: measure WER on test dataset
- Natural Language Understanding (NLU): Interprets user intent from text; needed to understand what users want; quick check: evaluate F1-score on intent classification
- Speech Language Understanding (SLU): Combines ASR and NLU in one pipeline; needed for efficient voicebot operation; quick check: measure end-to-end accuracy
- Pre-recorded audio responses: Uses stored audio clips instead of TTS; needed due to limited Wolof TTS resources; quick check: verify audio quality and relevance

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: User Speech -> ASR -> NLU -> Response Selection -> Pre-recorded Audio -> User

Critical path: User Speech -> ASR (22% WER) -> NLU (78% F1) -> Pre-recorded Audio

Design tradeoffs:
1. Pre-recorded vs synthesized speech: Pre-recorded chosen due to limited Wolof TTS resources, but limits scalability
2. SLU vs separate ASR/NLU: Integrated approach chosen for efficiency, but may limit modularity
3. Specific domain vs general purpose: Focused on loyalty program for proof-of-concept, but limits generalization

Failure signatures:
- High WER (22%) indicates recognition errors, especially for proper nouns or rare words
- F1-score of 78% suggests some intent misclassifications, particularly for ambiguous queries
- System may fail with out-of-domain questions or complex multi-turn conversations

First experiments:
1. Test ASR performance with diverse speakers across different age groups and dialects
2. Evaluate NLU performance with edge cases and ambiguous user requests
3. Conduct A/B testing comparing user satisfaction with pre-recorded vs synthesized responses

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- 22% WER may impact user experience in real-world deployment
- System relies on pre-recorded messages rather than synthesized speech, limiting scalability
- Performance metrics don't reveal potential biases in handling diverse user expressions
- Unclear how well the system generalizes beyond the specific loyalty program domain

## Confidence

High confidence:
- Claims about being first Wolof voice assistant are well-supported by literature review

Medium confidence:
- Performance metrics (22% WER, 78% F1) appear reliable but cannot be fully verified without test data
- Claims about addressing digital divide are plausible but need user studies

Low confidence:
- Scalability and long-term viability claims are not well-supported by proof-of-concept nature

## Next Checks

1. Conduct field testing with diverse user groups in Senegal to evaluate real-world performance, including testing with users who have varying levels of literacy and familiarity with voice technology.

2. Perform cross-domain evaluation to assess how well the NLU system generalizes beyond the loyalty program domain to other conversational scenarios in Wolof.

3. Implement and evaluate a prototype using text-to-speech synthesis instead of pre-recorded messages to assess scalability and flexibility trade-offs for expanding the system's capabilities.
