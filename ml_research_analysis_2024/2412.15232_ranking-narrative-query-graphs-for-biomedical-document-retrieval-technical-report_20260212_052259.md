# Ranking Narrative Query Graphs for Biomedical Document Retrieval (Technical Report)

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.15232
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15232
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: GraphRank achieves comparable precision to BM25 while improving recall@1000 to 0.86 on PM2020 benchmark

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of ranking documents retrieved by graph-based queries in biomedical digital libraries. Traditional exact-match approaches make it difficult to rank results by relevance. The authors propose GraphRank, an unsupervised method that scores document fragments based on extraction confidence, tf-idf statistics, coverage, relational similarity, and translation scores. They also introduce partial matching (relaxing full-match constraints) and ontological query expansion (using hierarchical relationships). Evaluated on five TREC benchmarks, their method achieves comparable or slightly better precision than BM25 reranking while improving recall—e.g., on PM2020, recall@1000 reaches 0.86 vs 0.79 for BM25.

## Method Summary
The authors extend their graph-based discovery system with three key contributions: (1) GraphRank, an unsupervised ranking method that scores document fragments using extraction confidence, tf-idf statistics, coverage, relational similarity, and translation scores; (2) a partial matching paradigm that ranks full matches first while still including relevant partial matches; and (3) ontological query expansion that adds superclasses to queries based on MeSH hierarchy. The system processes user queries into graph patterns, matches them against document graphs, extracts matching fragments, scores them using GraphRank, and ranks documents accordingly. The approach is evaluated on five TREC benchmarks using recall@1000, nDCG@k, and precision@k metrics.

## Key Results
- GraphRank achieves comparable precision to BM25 while improving recall@1000 to 0.86 on PM2020 (vs 0.79 for BM25)
- Partial Match + GraphRank yields precision@20 of 0.47 compared to 0.42 for BM25 on PM2020
- The method shows clear limitations on non-biomedical queries, with only 25/50 TREC-COVID topics successfully translated

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GraphRank improves ranking by exploiting the internal structure of document graphs, not just term frequencies.
- Mechanism: For each matching fragment between query and document graph, GraphRank computes a score based on extraction confidence, tf-idf statistics, coverage, relational similarity, and translation score, then selects the highest-scoring fragment to rank the document.
- Core assumption: The structure of the document graph (edges, their confidences, and how concepts are distributed in the text) is more informative for relevance than flat term statistics alone.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "This paper extends our existing discovery system and contributes effective graph-based unsupervised ranking methods..."; [section 3.2] "We score a fragment 𝑓 to be only as strong as its weakest edge, i.e., only as good as the less confident statement extraction"
- Break condition: If the document graph structure is sparse or if extraction confidences are unreliable, the ranking signal degrades rapidly.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Partial matching increases recall by relaxing the exact-match constraint while still prioritizing full matches.
- Mechanism: Documents that match the full query are ranked first; documents matching only a subset of fact patterns are ranked afterward, ensuring no partial match outranks a full match.
- Core assumption: Users value precision for full matches but benefit from seeing relevant partial matches without being overwhelmed by them.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "effective graph-based unsupervised ranking methods, a new query relaxation paradigm, and ontological rewriting..."; [section 3.3] "The retrieval system enforces that relevant documents must match the full graph query (Full Match). However, relaxing the query paradigm for more extensive and comprehensive result lists can be beneficial."
- Break condition: If partial matches are numerous and noisy, the tail of the ranking list may become irrelevant, hurting overall user experience.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Ontological query rewriting improves recall by expanding specific concepts to more general ones while controlling for semantic drift.
- Mechanism: For each query concept, superclasses are added to the search with a similarity score inversely proportional to the number of ontology steps taken.
- Core assumption: More general concepts in the ontology capture documents that are relevant but missed by exact term matching, and the ontology hierarchy is sufficiently reliable.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "...and ontological rewriting... due to partial matching and ontological rewriting."; [section 3.3] "Concepts in queries are by default expanded by their subclasses... However, going upwards in an ontology might also be helpful..."
- Break condition: If the ontology is shallow, noisy, or contains circular references, expansion may add irrelevant concepts and dilute precision.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph isomorphism and subgraph matching
  - Why needed here: The core retrieval mechanism relies on finding exact subgraph matches between query and document graphs.
  - Quick check question: What is the computational complexity of finding all subgraph isomorphisms between a query graph and a document graph?

- Concept: Information extraction confidence modeling
  - Why needed here: Edge confidence scores derived from PathIE are central to the ranking function.
  - Quick check question: How does PathIE compute confidence for an extracted relation, and what factors influence it?

- Concept: tf-idf weighting for non-textual elements
  - Why needed here: The method adapts tf-idf to edges (subject-predicate-object triples) rather than plain terms.
  - Quick check question: How is tf defined for a concept within a document graph, and why is idf still useful in a biomedical domain?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Query Translator -> Graph Matcher -> Fragment Extractor -> GraphRank Scorer -> Result Ranker
- Critical path: User query → Translation → Graph Matching → Fragment Scoring → Final Ranking → Display
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Exact match vs. partial match: Precision vs. recall
  - On-the-fly scoring vs. pre-computed indexes: Memory vs. latency
  - Concept expansion breadth vs. ranking noise: Coverage vs. relevance
- Failure signatures:
  - Very low recall: Likely missing concept vocabulary or overly strict matching
  - Very low precision: Possible noisy extraction or over-expansion
  - Slow queries: Graph matching complexity or missing indexes
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run a query with known good translation; verify GraphRank produces different order than BM25
  2. Disable ontology expansion; confirm recall drops on cancer subtype queries
  3. Force a partial match; check that full matches always appear before partials

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would different string similarity measures (e.g., vector space distances) compare to Jaccard similarity for translating user input to concept IDs in graph-based retrieval systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states they used Jaccard string similarity for translation scores but suggests exploring alternatives could be worth further investigation.
- Why unresolved: The paper chose Jaccard similarity based on their system's focus on biomedical concepts where users are expected to search for known concept names. No comparative evaluation of alternative similarity measures was conducted.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments measuring retrieval precision and recall using different string similarity measures (cosine similarity, edit distance, learned embeddings) across various query types and biomedical domains.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Would a hybrid approach combining graph-based ranking with learned relevance models outperform purely unsupervised graph-based methods?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper compares GraphRank to BM25 but acknowledges that neural methods can boost retrieval performance. They chose unsupervised methods to avoid training data costs and maintain explainability.
- Why unresolved: The paper deliberately avoided supervised learning due to training data requirements and explainability concerns, but did not evaluate hybrid approaches that might combine graph structure with learned relevance signals.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments measuring retrieval performance of hybrid models (graph-based features + neural reranking) against purely unsupervised methods across multiple biomedical benchmarks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can graph-based retrieval systems handle information needs that cannot be translated into precise concept-centric queries?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper demonstrates clear limitations on TREC-COVID where only 25/50 topics could be translated, and explicitly states that topics like "school closings during coronavirus" cannot be represented in their graph-based system.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges this limitation but proposes no solution, stating that future work could tackle a fallback mode for switching between graph-based and traditional text-based ranking.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation and evaluation of a fallback mechanism that automatically detects when queries cannot be adequately represented as graph patterns and switches to appropriate text-based retrieval methods.

## Limitations
- Limited evaluation scope: Only five TREC benchmarks tested, with clear performance degradation on non-biomedical queries
- Unknown implementation details: Exact PathIE confidence modeling and predicate taxonomy implementation remain unspecified
- No user preference validation: The partial matching tradeoff (full matches first, then partials) lacks user study confirmation

## Confidence

- GraphRank improves ranking (High): Supported by benchmark results showing improved recall@1000 and competitive precision@k
- Partial matching increases recall without hurting precision (Medium): Evidenced by PM2020 results, but no user studies validate preference
- Ontological expansion improves coverage (Medium): Supported by benchmark gains, but no quantification of semantic drift risk

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation experiment**: Disable each GraphRank component individually to measure individual contribution to final ranking performance.
2. **Query generalization test**: Run the method on non-biomedical queries (e.g., general news or legal topics) to verify cross-domain robustness.
3. **Partial match analysis**: Manually inspect the tail of partial match rankings to confirm relevance and absence of noise.
