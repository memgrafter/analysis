# Towards a general framework for improving the performance of classifiers using XAI methods

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.10373
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10373
- Reference count: 28
- One-line primary result: Proposes a conceptual framework for enhancing pre-trained classifier performance using XAI-derived explanations without retraining.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a general framework for improving the performance of pre-trained deep learning classifiers using eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods. The approach leverages XAI explanations to enhance classification without the computational overhead of retraining the original model. The framework offers two learning strategies—auto-encoder-based and encoder-decoder-based—that integrate explanation encodings with classifier outputs to improve decision-making. While the concept is theoretically sound, the paper is primarily conceptual and lacks empirical validation of the proposed mechanisms.

## Method Summary
The framework improves pre-trained classifiers by integrating XAI-derived explanations with their outputs. Two learning strategies are outlined: an auto-encoder-based approach where explanations are encoded and used to train a simple classifier, and an encoder-decoder-based approach where inputs and explanations are jointly mapped. The encoded explanations, combined with the original classifier's output, are used to train an additional classifier that aims to outperform the original model. The approach avoids full retraining by leveraging the interpretability of XAI methods to guide the learning process.

## Key Results
- Proposes a general framework integrating XAI explanations with pre-trained classifiers to improve performance.
- Outlines two learning strategies: auto-encoder-based and encoder-decoder-based.
- Conceptual framework aims to bridge XAI and model performance enhancement without extensive retraining.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The framework can enhance pre-trained classifier performance by integrating XAI-derived attribution encodings without full retraining.
- Mechanism: XAI explanations (ex) are generated for each input x using the pre-trained model M. These explanations are then encoded into a compressed representation zx via an auto-encoder. The encoded explanations zx are combined with M's outputs m(j) to train a simple classifier C, which improves classification by focusing on relevant features identified by the explanations.
- Core assumption: The auto-encoder can learn a meaningful and compact representation of XAI explanations that preserves critical feature attribution information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "By integrating XAI-derived explanations with the output of pre-trained classifiers, our framework want to improve model performance, furthermore without computationally intensive model retraining processes."
  - [section] "The first one can be outlined by the following four consecutive main steps: 1) Each input data x belonging to the training set is sent to the pre-trained classifier M and a corresponding explanation ex of the classifier’s behaviour is generated; 2) All the explanations ex are sent to an auto-encoder, thus generating an encoded explanation zx; 3) the F module is trained on the pair (x, zx); 4) at the end of this training phase, the simple classifier C is trained using zx and the M output."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence: No direct citations in the corpus section support this specific auto-encoder mechanism.
- Break condition: If the auto-encoder fails to capture relevant attribution information, zx will not improve classification and C will not outperform M alone.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: An encoder-decoder architecture can directly learn to map inputs to their explanations, providing feature relevance information for classification enhancement.
- Mechanism: The encoder-decoder is trained on pairs (x, ex) to produce zx, the encoded explanation. This zx is fed into a classifier C along with M's output to improve classification. Training C happens simultaneously during encoder-decoder training.
- Core assumption: The encoder-decoder can learn a robust mapping from inputs to explanations that generalizes beyond the training set.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The encoder-decoder based strategy can be described as follows: an encoder-decoder is trained directly using the pairs ( x, ex) as a training set. During training, the hidden values zx of the encoder-decoder are sent as input to the simple classifier C together with the M output, thus training the classifier C at the same time."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence: No direct citations in the corpus section support this specific encoder-decoder mechanism.
- Break condition: If the encoder-decoder overfits to the training explanations or fails to generalize, zx will not provide useful feature relevance information for new inputs.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using XAI methods to identify and mask irrelevant features during classification can improve model focus and performance.
- Mechanism: XAI methods (e.g., SHAP, LRP) generate feature importance scores. These scores are used to create masks that remove or downweight irrelevant features before classification, effectively guiding the model to focus on important features.
- Core assumption: Feature importance scores generated by XAI methods are accurate and generalize to unseen data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "By integrating XAI-derived explanations with the output of pre-trained classifiers, our framework want to improve model performance..."
  - [section] "Using XAI methods to automatically improve the performance of AI systems themselves. This paper proposes a general framework for automatically improving the performance of pre-trained DL classifiers using XAI methods, avoiding the computational overhead associated with retraining complex models from scratch."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence: The corpus section lists related works but none directly cite this specific masking mechanism.
- Break condition: If XAI-generated feature importance is noisy or incorrect, masking will degrade rather than improve performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Auto-encoders and encoder-decoder architectures
  - Why needed here: The framework relies on these architectures to compress and represent XAI explanations (zx) in a form usable by the classifier C.
  - Quick check question: Can you describe how an auto-encoder learns a compressed representation of its input, and how this differs from an encoder-decoder?

- Concept: eXplainable AI (XAI) methods and feature attribution
  - Why needed here: XAI methods generate the explanations (ex) that are the core input to the proposed framework; understanding feature attribution is essential for interpreting zx.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between SHAP values and LRP in terms of how they attribute feature importance?

- Concept: Transfer learning and model fine-tuning
  - Why needed here: The framework improves pre-trained models without full retraining, analogous to transfer learning concepts; understanding this helps in grasping how zx augments M's outputs.
  - Quick check question: How does adding a simple classifier C on top of a pre-trained model differ from fine-tuning the entire model?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Pre-trained classifier M -> XAI method -> Auto-encoder or encoder-decoder -> Module F -> Simple classifier C -> Final predictions

- Critical path:
  1. Generate explanations ex for all training inputs x using M.
  2. Train auto-encoder or encoder-decoder on (x, ex) to produce zx.
  3. Train F on (x, zx).
  4. Train C on (zx, m(j)) to produce final improved predictions.
  5. Apply C to unlabeled data U.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Auto-encoder vs encoder-decoder: Auto-encoders may be simpler but may not learn as robust a mapping as encoder-decoders; encoder-decoders may overfit if training data is limited.
  - Choice of XAI method: Different XAI methods (SHAP, LRP, etc.) may produce explanations with different quality and computational costs.
  - Complexity of C: A more complex C may capture more information but risks overfitting; a simpler C is more robust but may miss nuances.

- Failure signatures:
  - If C does not outperform M, the encoded explanations zx are likely not informative or the training process is flawed.
  - If F fails to learn the mapping from x to zx, the auto-encoder or encoder-decoder is not capturing relevant information.
  - If explanations ex are noisy or incorrect, all downstream components will be negatively affected.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train C using only m(j) (no zx) as a baseline to measure improvement from the framework.
  2. Train F and C using a simple auto-encoder and a single XAI method (e.g., SHAP) on a small dataset to validate the pipeline.
  3. Compare the performance of the auto-encoder-based and encoder-decoder-based strategies on the same dataset and XAI method to determine which is more effective.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How effective are the auto-encoder-based and encoder-decoder-based learning strategies in improving classifier performance when using different XAI methods?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper proposes two learning strategies (auto-encoder-based and encoder-decoder-based) and states that a careful experimental analysis should be carried out.
- Why unresolved: The paper is conceptual and does not present experimental results comparing these strategies or their performance with different XAI methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing classifier performance improvements using both strategies with multiple XAI methods (e.g., LRP, SHAP, DTD) across various datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How robust is the framework when the original training dataset used for the pre-trained model is partially available or replaced with a similar dataset?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests investigating the framework's robustness with respect to modifications of the original dataset used to train the model M.
- Why unresolved: No experiments have been conducted to test the framework's performance under these conditions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments showing performance metrics when using the full original dataset, a subset of it, and a similar but different dataset for training the F module.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of gradually integrating the F module's contribution during the learning phase while retraining the entire architecture alongside M from scratch?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper proposes investigating the potential of this approach by gradually integrating F's contribution during retraining.
- Why unresolved: This integration strategy has not been implemented or tested in the paper.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing classification performance improvements when gradually increasing F's contribution during the retraining process, compared to standard retraining and the proposed framework without gradual integration.

## Limitations
- No empirical validation: The paper lacks experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
- Unproven core assumption: The claim that XAI-derived explanations can effectively improve classification without retraining is not tested.
- Missing performance metrics: No quantitative comparison with baseline models or alternative approaches is provided.

## Confidence
- Conceptual framework validity: High - The architectural components are standard and theoretically sound.
- Performance improvement claims: Low - No experimental results to support the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms.
- Overall confidence: Medium - The framework is plausible but unverified.

## Next Checks
1. Implement a baseline experiment comparing the pre-trained classifier M's performance against the enhanced classifier C on a standard dataset to quantify improvement.
2. Conduct ablation studies testing different XAI methods (SHAP, LRP, etc.) to determine which produces explanations that best improve classification when encoded.
3. Evaluate the generalization capability of the framework by testing on out-of-distribution data to ensure the encoded explanations zx remain effective beyond the training distribution.
