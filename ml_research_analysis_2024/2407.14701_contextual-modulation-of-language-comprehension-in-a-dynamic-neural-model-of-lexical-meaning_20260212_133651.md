- Models lexical polysemy as dynamics of neural activation on continuous semantic dimensions, generating discrete interpretations through nonlinear dynamics

## Executive Summary
This study proposes a Dynamic Field Theory model of lexical meaning that represents the English word "have" as a stable coupling pattern between a lexical node and two continuous semantic dimensions: connectedness and control asymmetry. The model captures how contextual information modulates interpretation of polysemous words through the dynamics of neural activation patterns, generating discrete semantic interpretations from continuous underlying dimensions. Empirical results from an acceptability judgment and self-paced reading experiment partially confirm the model's novel prediction about the relationship between reading time and acceptability judgments.

## Method Summary
The model uses Dynamic Neural Fields to represent semantic dimensions of connectedness and control asymmetry, with a lexical node representing "have" coupled to both fields through Gaussian distributions. Simulations proceed through three phases: Phase 1 establishes an initial activation state based on context sentences, Phase 2 creates a stable coupling pattern between the lexical node and fields, and Phase 3 measures the target sentence's interpretation under the influence of the previous context. An empirical study combined self-paced reading with acceptability judgments using sentences designed to prime either "adjacency" or "possession" interpretations of "have," with participants also completing the Autism-Spectrum Quotient questionnaire to index individual differences.

## Key Results
- The model successfully captures contextual modulation of lexical semantic interpretation
- Individual variation in contextual modulation magnitude is captured through variation in field-field coupling strength (c_DNF)
- The model generates a novel prediction about by-trial relationships between reading time and acceptability judgments
- Empirical results partially confirm this prediction while replicating previous findings on contextual modulation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Apparent discreteness of lexical meanings (e.g., "adjacency" vs. "possession") emerges from nonlinear dynamics of continuous semantic dimensions.
- Mechanism: Dynamic neural fields (DNFs) governed by point attractor dynamics; peaks in activation correspond to discrete semantic interpretations, while the underlying dimensions (connectedness and control asymmetry) are continuous.
- Core assumption: The coupling between DNFs and the lexical node, plus lateral interaction within DNFs, imposes structure that forces selection of a single peak (interpretation) at a time.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the many related meanings of a word are not categorically distinct representations; rather, they are transiently stable neural activation states that arise from the nonlinear dynamics of neural populations"
  - [section 2.2.2] "the behavior of the model can be qualitatively described as corresponding to discrete outcomes, despite the underlyingly continuous state space"
  - [corpus] Weak signal; neighbor papers focus on LLM coherence, not continuous semantic spaces.
- Break condition: If lateral inhibition is weakened or coupling is removed, multiple peaks could stabilize simultaneously, breaking the discreteness illusion.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Contextual modulation of lexical interpretation occurs because prior neural activation states persist and bias subsequent interpretation.
- Mechanism: Activation states from processing the context sentence (Phase 1) linger into target sentence processing (Phase 3), biasing the location of the activation peak in the connectedness DNF toward the contextually primed interpretation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "contextual modulation of lexical semantic interpretation"
  - [section 2.2.2] "the evolution of activation in Phase 3 is shaped by the preceding state of the system from Phase 1"
  - [corpus] Weak signal; neighbor papers do not model contextual persistence in semantic interpretation.
- Break condition: If the time constant τ is set to zero (instantaneous decay), contextual bias would vanish.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Individual variation in contextual modulation is indexed by the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) through differences in DNF coupling strength.
- Mechanism: Higher AQ scores correspond to stronger field-field coupling (c_DNF), which increases system-level expectations and reduces sensitivity to immediate contextual information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "individual variation in the magnitude of this modulation"
  - [section 2.4] "we varied c_DNF from 0.25 to 0.45... higher values of c_DNF corresponded with a reduction in the difference in acceptability between conditions"
  - [corpus] Weak signal; neighbor papers do not link AQ to neural coupling parameters.
- Break condition: If c_DNF is fixed across individuals, model cannot capture AQ-related variation.

## Foundational Learning

- Dynamic Field Theory (DFT)
  - Why needed here: Provides the mathematical framework (differential equations) for modeling continuous cognitive dimensions and their nonlinear dynamics.
  - Quick check question: What is a "point attractor" in the context of a dynamic neural field?
- Semantic dimensions (connectedness, control asymmetry)
  - Why needed here: Define the continuous meaning space over which lexical interpretations vary; allow modeling of gradable polysemy.
  - Quick check question: How does "connectedness" differ from "control asymmetry" in characterizing lexical meanings?
- Coupling patterns (node-field, field-field)
  - Why needed here: Implement the dependencies between semantic dimensions and link the lexical node to the semantic space.
  - Quick check question: What role does field-field coupling play in generating the downward parabola pattern in Figure 2?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Lexical node (representing "have") -> Connectedness DNF (range 1-99, low to high) -> Control asymmetry DNF (range 1-99, low to high)
- Critical path:
  1. External inputs drive initial activation (context sentence).
  2. Node-field coupling spreads activation from "have" to both DNFs.
  3. Field-field coupling imposes dimensional dependencies.
  4. Lateral interaction within DNFs selects a single peak (interpretation).
  5. Activation states persist across phases, enabling contextual modulation.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Simplicity vs. biological plausibility: Using linear node dynamics instead of sigmoidal gating for node-to-field input.
  - Interpretability vs. flexibility: Fixing coupling patterns based on empirical evidence rather than learning them.
  - Single-peak selection vs. multiple interpretations: Parameterizing lateral interaction to enforce one peak per field.
- Failure signatures:
  - Multiple peaks forming simultaneously in a DNF (lateral inhibition too weak).
  - No peak forming (external input too weak or resting level too high).
  - Contextual modulation disappearing (c_DNF too high or τ too low).
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Vary the amplitude of the weak low conn input in Phase 3; observe effect on adjacency vs. possession interpretation likelihood.
  2. Set c_DNF to zero; test if contextual modulation effect disappears.
  3. Increase τ; measure how long contextual bias persists into Phase 3.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The specific choice of semantic dimensions (connectedness, control asymmetry) is theoretically motivated but not definitively validated across multiple lexical items
- The linear approximation for node-field coupling may oversimplify neural implementation
- The fixed coupling patterns may not generalize to other words or contexts
- Individual differences in AQ are modeled through a single parameter (c_DNF), which may be reductive

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The model successfully captures contextual modulation effects and generates testable predictions about the relationship between reading time and acceptability
- **Medium confidence**: The mechanism by which continuous dimensions generate discrete interpretations is plausible but requires further validation with additional lexical items
- **Low confidence**: The specific AQ-related parameter variation and its relationship to coupling strength needs broader empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. Test the model's prediction about contextually modulated by-trial relationships between reading time and acceptability with a larger sample size and additional contextual manipulations
2. Apply the model architecture to other polysemous words (e.g., "run," "break") to test generalizability of the semantic dimension approach
3. Conduct parameter recovery analysis to determine whether the model can accurately estimate c_DNF values from behavioral data alone
