# PreNeT: Leveraging Computational Features to Predict Deep Neural Network Training Time

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.15519
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15519
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: PreNeT achieves up to 72% improvement in prediction accuracy compared to contemporary state-of-the-art frameworks

## Executive Summary
PreNeT is a novel predictive framework designed to accurately estimate training times for deep learning models, including Transformer-based architectures like LLMs. The framework addresses the critical challenge of optimizing resource allocation and reducing training costs by predicting how different model architectures, hyperparameters, and hardware configurations affect training time. PreNeT integrates comprehensive computational metrics including layer-specific parameters, arithmetic operations, and memory utilization to create a more accurate prediction model.

The framework captures the distinct characteristics of various neural network layers and employs machine learning techniques to predict training duration on previously unexamined hardware infrastructures, including novel accelerator architectures. Experimental results demonstrate that PreNeT can determine optimal configurations, parameter settings, and hardware specifications for maximizing cost-efficiency and minimizing training duration.

## Method Summary
PreNeT operates by integrating comprehensive computational metrics that capture the unique characteristics of different neural network layers. The framework analyzes layer-specific parameters, arithmetic operations, and memory utilization patterns to build predictive models. Machine learning techniques are then applied to these computational features to estimate training durations across various hardware configurations. The approach is designed to generalize across previously unseen hardware infrastructures, including emerging accelerator architectures, by focusing on fundamental computational characteristics rather than hardware-specific optimizations.

## Key Results
- Achieves up to 72% improvement in prediction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art frameworks
- Successfully predicts training times for Transformer-based architectures including LLMs
- Enables optimization of configurations and hardware specifications for cost-efficiency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
PreNeT works by capturing the fundamental computational characteristics of neural network layers through comprehensive metrics analysis. By focusing on layer-specific parameters, arithmetic operations, and memory utilization patterns, the framework can identify the core computational bottlenecks that determine training time. The machine learning models then generalize these patterns across different hardware configurations by learning the relationships between computational features and execution time, rather than relying on hardware-specific optimizations. This approach allows the framework to predict training times on previously unseen hardware by understanding the underlying computational principles that govern neural network execution.

## Foundational Learning
- Computational complexity analysis: Why needed - to understand the fundamental relationships between model architecture and execution time; Quick check - verify that layer-wise FLOPs and memory requirements are accurately computed
- Hardware performance modeling: Why needed - to map computational features to actual execution time across different hardware; Quick check - confirm that hardware-specific performance characteristics are properly captured
- Machine learning for regression tasks: Why needed - to learn the complex non-linear relationships between computational features and training time; Quick check - validate that prediction errors are within acceptable bounds on held-out data

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Data preprocessing -> Feature extraction -> Model training -> Prediction generation

Critical path: The framework processes computational features through feature extraction, trains machine learning models on these features, and generates predictions. The most time-sensitive component is the feature extraction phase, as it directly impacts the quality of subsequent predictions.

Design tradeoffs: The framework balances between computational feature comprehensiveness and prediction speed. More detailed feature extraction improves accuracy but increases preprocessing time. The choice of machine learning model affects both prediction accuracy and inference speed, requiring careful optimization for practical deployment scenarios.

Failure signatures: Poor prediction accuracy typically manifests as systematic underestimation or overestimation of training times, particularly for models with novel architectures or when deployed on hardware significantly different from training data. Feature extraction failures may result in missing or incorrect computational metrics, leading to unreliable predictions.

First experiments:
1. Verify computational feature extraction accuracy on a small set of known models and hardware configurations
2. Test prediction accuracy on a held-out dataset with similar hardware to training data
3. Evaluate generalization performance on a different hardware configuration not seen during training
