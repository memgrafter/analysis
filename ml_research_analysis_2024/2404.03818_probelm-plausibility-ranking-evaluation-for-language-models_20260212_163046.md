# PRobELM: Plausibility Ranking Evaluation for Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.03818
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03818
- Reference count: 20
- Models' factual accuracy does not correlate with their plausibility performance

## Executive Summary
PRobELM is a benchmark designed to evaluate language models' ability to rank plausible scenarios using their parametric knowledge. It addresses the gap between factual accuracy and plausibility inference by assessing models on scenarios that are not yet facts but are likely given existing world knowledge. The benchmark uses scenarios derived from Wikidata edit histories, with each scenario having one most plausible and ten less plausible alternatives. Models are evaluated using three prompt types—statement, text completion, and question answering—based on their perplexity rankings.

The benchmark's key innovation lies in its temporal alignment strategy, leveraging Bayesian inference principles to identify the most plausible scenarios as those closest in time to the model's training cutoff. Quality control measures ensure diverse, real-world data while controlling for overfitting and bias. Across 10 models of varying sizes and architectures, results show that factual accuracy does not correlate with plausibility performance, larger models do not always outperform smaller ones, and up-to-date training data improves plausibility assessment. Performance varied widely, with best models achieving plausibility scores around 58-60%, while random guessing yields only ~9%.

## Method Summary
PRobELM evaluates language models' plausibility inference by ranking scenarios derived from Wikidata edit histories. The benchmark uses zero-shot evaluation, calculating perplexity scores for each scenario under three prompt types: statement, text completion, and question answering. Models rank scenarios from most to least plausible based on these perplexity scores. The dataset is curated from Wikidata revisions immediately following each model's training cutoff, capturing scenarios that were unknown facts at training time but became facts shortly after. Quality control measures include paraphrase discrimination using FuzzyWuzzy, manual filtering of non-event edits via a whitelist of relations, and template design for natural language conversion.

## Key Results
- Factual accuracy does not correlate with plausibility performance across evaluated models
- Larger models do not always outperform smaller ones in plausibility ranking tasks
- Up-to-date training data improves plausibility assessment, with greater temporal gaps leading to poorer performance
- Best models achieved plausibility scores around 58-60%, while random guessing yields only ~9%

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The benchmark measures plausibility by comparing perplexity rankings of factual vs. non-factual but plausible scenarios.
- Mechanism: Lower perplexity indicates higher plausibility; the model is asked to rank scenarios from most to least plausible based on their perplexity scores.
- Core assumption: The model's parametric knowledge contains sufficient world knowledge to infer plausibility of scenarios not seen during training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our benchmark is constructed from a dataset curated from Wikidata edit histories, tailored to align the temporal bounds of the training data for the evaluated models."
  - [section] "This design allows us to assess the potential of language models for downstream use cases such as literature-based discovery where the focus is on identifying information that is likely but not yet known."
  - [corpus] Found 25 related papers; average neighbor FMR=0.476, indicating moderate relevance of nearby work to plausibility evaluation.
- Break condition: If the model lacks sufficient world knowledge in its parameters or if the scenario is too far removed from its training data, it cannot infer plausibility accurately.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The benchmark leverages Bayesian inference principles to identify the most plausible scenarios as those closest in time to the model's training cutoff.
- Mechanism: By focusing on Wikidata revisions immediately following the model's training cutoff, the benchmark captures scenarios that were unknown facts at the time of training but became facts shortly after, representing the most plausible future events.
- Core assumption: The near future is inherently more predictable and grounded in the current state of the world, providing a robust benchmark for plausibility.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Accordingly, our approach assumes that the most immediate future events, as sequentially recorded in successive updates of Wikidata, represent the most plausible scenarios compared to our current knowledge base."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; only 0 citations among related papers, suggesting this Bayesian inference approach is novel.
- Break condition: If the model's training data cutoff is too far in the past relative to the evaluation set, or if world events are highly unpredictable, the temporal alignment strategy fails.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The benchmark controls for overfitting and bias by using diverse, real-world data from Wikidata and filtering out non-event edits and generic queries.
- Mechanism: Quality control measures include paraphrase discrimination using FuzzyWuzzy, manual filtering of non-event edits via a whitelist of relations, and template design for natural language conversion.
- Core assumption: The quality control steps ensure the dataset reflects diverse entities and maintains coherence, improving the validity of plausibility assessments.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "To ensure the generated scenarios are both accurate and relevant, we implement several quality control measures to address potential biases and inaccuracies in the dataset."
  - [corpus] Found 25 related papers; average citations=0.0, suggesting limited prior work on this specific quality control approach.
- Break condition: If the quality control measures are insufficient to remove all biases or if the Wikidata dataset itself is incomplete or skewed, the benchmark's validity is compromised.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Perplexity as a measure of language model performance
  - Why needed here: Perplexity is the core metric used to rank scenarios by plausibility; understanding how it works is essential to grasp the benchmark's methodology.
  - Quick check question: What does a lower perplexity score indicate about a language model's prediction?

- Concept: Bayesian inference and its application to plausibility
  - Why needed here: The benchmark uses Bayesian inference principles to identify the most plausible scenarios; understanding this concept is crucial to understanding the rationale behind the temporal alignment strategy.
  - Quick check question: How does Bayesian inference relate to the concept of plausibility in the context of this benchmark?

- Concept: Knowledge graph completion and entity co-occurrence
  - Why needed here: The benchmark generates less plausible scenarios by examining entity co-occurrences within Wikidata; understanding knowledge graph completion is essential to grasp this aspect of the methodology.
  - Quick check question: How does the benchmark use entity co-occurrences to generate less plausible scenarios?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data collection -> Scenario generation -> Quality control -> Prompt generation -> Model evaluation -> Result analysis
- Critical path: Data collection → Scenario generation → Quality control → Prompt generation → Model evaluation → Result analysis
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using Wikidata edit histories provides real-world, diverse data but may introduce temporal biases
  - Focusing on immediate future events as most plausible scenarios assumes predictability but may miss long-term plausible scenarios
  - Quality control measures ensure data validity but require manual effort and may not catch all biases
- Failure signatures:
  - Models perform at random chance level, indicating the benchmark is too difficult or the quality control measures are insufficient
  - Strong correlation between factual accuracy and plausibility performance, suggesting the benchmark is not measuring a distinct capability
  - Performance drops significantly when evaluating scenarios far from the model's training data cutoff, indicating the temporal alignment strategy is crucial
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate a small language model (e.g., GPT-2 124M) on a small subset of the benchmark (e.g., 100 scenarios) to verify the basic functionality
  2. Compare the performance of a model trained on recent data vs. an older model on the same evaluation set to test the temporal alignment hypothesis
  3. Manually inspect a sample of generated scenarios to verify the quality control measures are working as intended

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of language models on plausibility inference tasks change when incorporating real-time world knowledge updates beyond their training data?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - The paper discusses the importance of up-to-date training data and the temporal gap between a model's training data cut-off and the evaluation set, noting that greater gaps lead to poorer performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the effects of real-time updates or continuous learning on model performance in plausibility inference.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing model performance with and without real-time updates, or with models designed for continuous learning, would provide insights into the impact of ongoing knowledge acquisition.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What architectural modifications or training methodologies could enhance a model's ability to infer plausibility beyond its training data?
- Basis in paper: Inferred - The paper highlights that larger models and more recent training data improve plausibility performance, suggesting that architecture and training play a role, but does not explore specific modifications.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not propose or test architectural changes or novel training techniques aimed specifically at improving plausibility inference.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing models with different architectures or training strategies designed to enhance world knowledge integration and plausibility reasoning would clarify which approaches are most effective.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do different types of plausibility scenarios (e.g., personal events vs. scientific discoveries) affect model performance, and can models be fine-tuned to specialize in specific domains?
- Basis in paper: Inferred - The paper mentions that certain relations, like "occupation," disproportionately affect performance, indicating variability in scenario types, but does not delve into domain-specific performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not analyze the impact of different scenario types on model performance or explore domain-specific fine-tuning.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with models fine-tuned on specific domains or with varied scenario types would reveal how specialization affects plausibility inference across different contexts.

## Limitations

- The temporal alignment strategy may break down for highly unpredictable scenarios or when the model's training cutoff is too distant from the evaluation set
- Quality control measures rely on manual filtering and specific tools (FuzzyWuzzy) whose implementation details are not fully specified
- The benchmark's validity may be compromised if the Wikidata dataset itself is incomplete or skewed

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The benchmark's methodology of using perplexity rankings to evaluate plausibility is well-defined and the core evaluation metrics are clearly specified. The finding that factual accuracy does not correlate with plausibility performance is strongly supported by the experimental results across 10 diverse models.
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that larger models do not always outperform smaller ones in plausibility ranking tasks is supported by the data but may be influenced by specific model architectures and training data cutoffs.
- **Low confidence**: The specific implementation details for generating less plausible scenarios using entity co-occurrences and the precise settings for quality control measures are not fully specified, making it difficult to reproduce the exact dataset.

## Next Checks

1. **Temporal alignment stress test**: Evaluate a diverse set of models (varying sizes, architectures, and training data cutoffs) on scenarios from different time periods relative to their training data to quantify how much performance degrades with temporal distance and determine if the 2-3 year alignment window is optimal.

2. **Quality control audit**: Manually inspect a statistically significant sample of generated scenarios to assess the effectiveness of the quality control measures in removing biases and non-event edits, and identify any systematic patterns of failure.

3. **Correlation analysis expansion**: Perform a comprehensive correlation analysis between plausibility performance and other model characteristics (e.g., parameter count, training data size, architectural features) across a larger set of models to determine which factors most strongly predict plausibility ranking ability.
