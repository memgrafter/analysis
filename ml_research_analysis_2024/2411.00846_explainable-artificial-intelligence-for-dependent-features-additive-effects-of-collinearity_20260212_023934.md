# Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Dependent Features: Additive Effects of Collinearity

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.00846
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00846
- Authors: Ahmed M Salih
- Reference count: 13
- Primary result: AEC method outperforms SHAP in handling collinear features, with NMR values closer to zero (0.052 vs 0.325 in regression tasks)

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of explaining machine learning models when features are highly correlated, a common issue that can bias traditional explainable AI methods. The proposed Additive Effects of Collinearity (AEC) method provides a novel approach to decompose multivariate models into univariate components, capturing both direct and indirect effects of features on model outcomes. This method contrasts with traditional approaches like SHAP that assume feature independence, making it more suitable for real-world datasets where multicollinearity is prevalent.

## Method Summary
The Additive Effects of Collinearity (AEC) method works by decomposing multivariate machine learning models into a series of univariate models, allowing it to capture both direct and indirect effects of features on model predictions. Unlike SHAP and similar methods that assume feature independence, AEC explicitly accounts for feature dependencies by modeling how features influence each other's effects on the model outcome. The method was validated through both simulated datasets with controlled collinearity levels and real-world datasets for regression and classification tasks, demonstrating improved robustness against multicollinearity issues.

## Key Results
- AEC consistently produced more stable and accurate lists of informative features compared to SHAP
- NMR values showed AEC had significantly less sensitivity to feature removal (0.052 vs 0.325 in regression tasks)
- The method demonstrated improved robustness against collinearity in both simulated and real datasets
- AEC maintained performance across different model architectures including tree-based and linear models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
AEC works by decomposing complex multivariate relationships into simpler univariate components, allowing the method to isolate both direct feature effects and indirect effects that arise from feature correlations. This decomposition enables the method to properly attribute model outcomes when features are interdependent, avoiding the overestimation or underestimation of feature importance that occurs with independence-assuming methods like SHAP.

## Foundational Learning
- **Feature Independence Assumption**: Traditional XAI methods assume features are independent - needed to understand why these methods fail with collinear data; quick check: examine SHAP values when features are highly correlated
- **Feature Decomposition**: Breaking down multivariate models into univariate components - needed to understand how AEC captures indirect effects; quick check: verify decomposition preserves model predictive accuracy
- **Indirect Effects Modeling**: Capturing how correlated features influence each other's impact on predictions - needed to understand AEC's advantage over traditional methods; quick check: compare feature importance rankings between direct-only and total effect calculations
- **Normalized Movement Rate (NMR)**: A metric measuring feature importance stability - needed to quantify AEC's improved robustness; quick check: calculate NMR when systematically removing features from different regions of feature importance rankings

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Data -> AEC Decomposition -> Univariate Models -> Feature Effects -> Model Explanation
**Critical Path**: Feature decomposition is the core step that enables capturing both direct and indirect effects
**Design Tradeoffs**: AEC provides better handling of collinearity but requires additional computational overhead compared to traditional methods
**Failure Signatures**: If feature importance rankings remain unstable under feature removal, or if NMR values remain high despite AEC application
**First Experiments**:
1. Apply AEC to a dataset with known pairwise correlations and compare feature rankings against SHAP
2. Test AEC's performance degradation as correlation strength increases from 0.5 to 0.95
3. Measure computational overhead by timing AEC decomposition on datasets with 10, 100, and 1000 features

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly identify additional open questions beyond those addressed in the study.

## Limitations
- Performance with neural networks and complex ensemble methods beyond tree-based and linear models remains untested
- Computational overhead may limit scalability for high-dimensional datasets with thousands of features
- NMR metric measures feature importance stability but doesn't directly assess model accuracy or predictive performance

## Confidence
- High confidence in the mathematical formulation of AEC and its theoretical foundation for handling collinearity
- Medium confidence in the empirical validation results across the tested datasets
- Low confidence in the method's performance with non-tabular data types and extremely high-dimensional feature spaces

## Next Checks
1. Test AEC's performance with deep learning models and convolutional neural networks to assess cross-architecture robustness
2. Evaluate computational efficiency on datasets with 10,000+ features to determine scalability limits
3. Compare AEC's impact on downstream decision-making by conducting user studies with domain experts interpreting model explanations
