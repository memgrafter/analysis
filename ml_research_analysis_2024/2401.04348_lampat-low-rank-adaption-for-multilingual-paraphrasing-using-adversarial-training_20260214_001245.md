# LAMPAT: Low-Rank Adaption for Multilingual Paraphrasing Using Adversarial Training

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.04348
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04348
- Authors: Khoi M. Le; Trinh Pham; Tho Quan; Anh Tuan Luu
- Reference count: 4
- Key outcome: State-of-the-art performance on 13 languages, outperforming supervised baselines on metrics like BERTScore, ParaScore, and human evaluation.

## Executive Summary
LAMPAT is an unsupervised multilingual paraphrasing model that addresses the limitations of previous approaches requiring parallel corpora. The model leverages low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning and virtual adversarial training (VAT) with noise perturbation to generate lexically diverse paraphrases. By using synthetic parallel corpora created from monolingual data through word removal and shuffling, LAMPAT eliminates the need for human-annotated parallel data while achieving state-of-the-art performance across 13 languages.

## Method Summary
LAMPAT creates synthetic parallel corpora by removing stop words and randomly shuffling remaining words from monolingual sentences. The model uses LoRA to fine-tune a pre-trained mGPT model efficiently while preserving linguistic knowledge. Virtual adversarial training with noise perturbation encourages diverse paraphrase generation by minimizing similarity between input and output while maintaining semantic equivalence. The model is trained on the synthetic corpus using reconstruction loss combined with adversarial regularization.

## Key Results
- LAMPAT outperforms supervised baselines on BERTScore, ParaScore, and human evaluation metrics
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 13 languages including low-resource languages
- Maintains semantic preservation while generating lexically diverse paraphrases
- Eliminates need for parallel corpora through synthetic data generation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) reduces catastrophic forgetting while enabling efficient fine-tuning.
- Mechanism: LoRA replaces full fine-tuning with low-rank decomposition matrices (B and A) that approximate parameter updates while keeping original weights frozen.
- Core assumption: Large pre-trained models retain most linguistic knowledge when only a small subset of parameters is updated.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we adapt LoRA (Hu et al. 2021) as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method to partially update the model's prior knowledge and preserve all the linguistic knowledge on which the model has been pre-trained."
  - [section] "LoRA overcomes this by indirectly training some dense layers in a neural network by optimizing rank decomposition matrices of the dense layers' changes during adaptation while keeping the pre-trained weights frozen."
  - [corpus] Weak. Corpus does not directly address catastrophic forgetting mitigation.
- Break condition: If rank r is too large or too small relative to the task, fine-tuning may fail to capture necessary adaptations or become too computationally expensive.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Virtual adversarial training (VAT) encourages lexical diversity by minimizing similarity between input and paraphrase.
- Mechanism: VAT adds noise to input embeddings and optimizes for both reconstruction loss and adversarial regularizer, pushing the model to generate outputs that are semantically equivalent but lexically different.
- Core assumption: Perturbing embeddings during training leads the model to learn more robust and diverse paraphrase mappings.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we incorporate noise perturbation and a virtual labeling strategy into the adversarial training process, aiming to alleviate this limitation."
  - [section] "by perturbing the embedding space x + δ, rather than the input space, adversarial training may unintentionally favour on-manifold perturbations over regular perturbations, leading to improved generalization."
  - [corpus] Weak. Corpus evidence focuses on related topics but not directly on adversarial training for diversity.
- Break condition: If noise perturbation is too aggressive or too mild, the model may fail to generate coherent paraphrases or may not diversify enough.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Synthetic parallel corpora generation via keyword-based corruption removes the need for parallel data.
- Mechanism: Sentences are corrupted by removing stop words and randomly shuffling the remaining words, creating a pseudo-parallel corpus for unsupervised training.
- Core assumption: Removing stop words and shuffling preserves enough semantic structure for the model to reconstruct meaningful paraphrases.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we use the monolingual dataset and apply a series of processes (i) identify stop words (ii) remove stop words (iii) randomly shuffle the words to create the corrupted version of the original input."
  - [section] "The training of the model focuses on the objective of reconstructing the original sentence from a corrupted version, aiming to recreate the initial sentence."
  - [corpus] Weak. Corpus does not discuss synthetic corpora creation.
- Break condition: If the corruption process removes too much information or the shuffling is too random, the model may not learn meaningful paraphrase mappings.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Adversarial training
  - Why needed here: To encourage the model to generate paraphrases that are semantically similar but lexically diverse.
  - Quick check question: How does adding noise to embeddings during training improve generalization and diversity?

- Concept: Low-rank adaptation
  - Why needed here: To efficiently fine-tune large models without catastrophic forgetting.
  - Quick check question: Why is it beneficial to approximate weight updates with low-rank matrices instead of full fine-tuning?

- Concept: Unsupervised learning via synthetic corpora
  - Why needed here: To eliminate the need for parallel corpora, which are often unavailable for low-resource languages.
  - Quick check question: How does corrupting sentences by removing stop words and shuffling help in creating a useful training signal?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Pre-trained mGPT → LoRA fine-tuning layers → VAT with noise perturbation → synthetic parallel corpora generator
- Critical path: Corruption → embedding perturbation → reconstruction loss + VAT regularizer → LoRA update → inference
- Design tradeoffs:
  - LoRA rank vs. performance: Higher rank increases adaptation capacity but also parameter count.
  - Noise magnitude vs. stability: Too much noise breaks coherence; too little yields no diversity.
  - Corruption strategy vs. semantic preservation: Over-aggressive corruption loses too much meaning.
- Failure signatures:
  - Self-BLEU remains high: model is copying input.
  - BERTScore drops sharply: semantic meaning is lost.
  - Training instability: noise perturbation too large or adversarial optimization diverges.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation: Run with LoRA only, then with VAT only, then with both, to measure diversity gains.
  2. Sensitivity: Vary LoRA rank r from 8 to 64 to observe impact on ParaScore and parameter efficiency.
  3. Noise scale: Test different perturbation magnitudes (γ) to find sweet spot for lexical diversity without harming fluency.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does LAMPAT perform on idiomatic expressions compared to other multilingual paraphrasing models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that LAMPAT requires improvements in handling idiomatic expressions.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific evaluation results or analysis of LAMPAT's performance on idiomatic expressions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting a comprehensive evaluation of LAMPAT on a dataset specifically containing idiomatic expressions and comparing its performance with other models.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can LAMPAT be effectively applied to low-resource languages beyond the 13 languages evaluated in the paper?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that LAMPAT's evaluation dataset covers only 13 languages, leaving out many, especially those with limited resources.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore LAMPAT's performance on low-resource languages outside the evaluated set.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating LAMPAT on a diverse set of low-resource languages and comparing its performance with other multilingual paraphrasing models.

### Open Question 3

- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that they incorporate noise perturbation and a virtual labeling strategy into the adversarial training process to encourage diverse paraphrases.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide an ablation study or analysis of the impact of different noise perturbation and virtual labeling strategies on LAMPAT's performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting an ablation study by varying the noise perturbation and virtual labeling strategies and evaluating their impact on LAMPAT's performance.

## Limitations

- Synthetic corpus generation may not preserve semantic information across all languages, particularly those with different stop word distributions
- Lack of detailed implementation specifics for adversarial training makes reproducibility challenging
- BERT-based evaluation metrics may not be reliable for low-resource languages where pre-trained models perform poorly

## Confidence

**High Confidence (8/10):** The core architecture combining LoRA with adversarial training is sound and well-established in the literature. The parameter efficiency claims are supported by the use of LoRA, which has been validated in multiple prior works.

**Medium Confidence (5/10):** The state-of-the-art performance claims on 13 languages are based on reported metrics, but the lack of detailed implementation specifics for the adversarial training component and synthetic corpus generation creates uncertainty about reproducibility.

**Low Confidence (3/10):** The claim that LAMPAT "eliminates the need for parallel corpora" is overstated. While the model doesn't require human-annotated parallel data, it still depends on the quality of synthetic parallel corpora, which introduces its own reliability concerns.

## Next Checks

1. **Synthetic corpus quality validation**: Conduct human evaluation studies to assess whether the stop word removal and shuffling process actually preserves semantic meaning across all 13 languages. Compare the quality of synthetic pairs against gold parallel data where available.

2. **Ablation study with detailed metrics**: Run controlled experiments isolating the contributions of LoRA vs. VAT vs. synthetic corpus generation, reporting not just overall performance but also analyzing failure cases and success patterns across different language families.

3. **Cross-lingual transfer robustness test**: Evaluate whether the model can effectively transfer paraphrasing knowledge from high-resource to low-resource languages by testing zero-shot and few-shot performance across the language spectrum, with detailed analysis of where the approach succeeds or fails.
