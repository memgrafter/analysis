# FedMAC: Tackling Partial-Modality Missing in Federated Learning with Cross-Modal Aggregation and Contrastive Regularization

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Up to 26% improvement in severe missing scenarios on PTB-XL subset

## Executive Summary
FedMAC introduces a federated learning framework specifically designed to handle partial-modality missing data in multi-modal settings. The approach combines a missing-aware encoder with modality imputation embeddings and a cross-modal aggregator that reconstructs missing features by leveraging correlations among available modalities. A contrastive-based regularization ensures meaningful latent representations and prevents trivial aggregation solutions. The method demonstrates significant performance improvements over baseline approaches, particularly in severe missing scenarios, while maintaining robustness across both IID and Non-IID data distributions.

## Method Summary
The FedMAC framework addresses the challenge of partial-modality missing data in federated learning by introducing a multi-component architecture. At its core is a missing-aware encoder that incorporates modality imputation embeddings to handle incomplete input patterns. The cross-modal aggregator leverages correlations between available modalities to reconstruct missing features, while a contrastive regularization component ensures the learned representations are meaningful and non-trivial. This design enables effective learning even when clients have access to different subsets of modalities, a common scenario in real-world federated deployments where data heterogeneity is prevalent.

## Key Results
- Outperforms baseline methods by up to 26% in severe missing scenarios
- Maintains robust accuracy across various IID and Non-IID configurations
- Ablation studies confirm importance of both cross-modal aggregation and contrastive regularization components

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
FedMAC succeeds by addressing the fundamental challenge of partial-modality missing data through intelligent feature reconstruction. The cross-modal aggregation mechanism exploits inherent correlations between modalities to impute missing information, while the contrastive regularization prevents the model from learning trivial solutions that don't generalize. This dual approach ensures that the learned representations are both informative and discriminative, enabling accurate classification even with incomplete input data.

## Foundational Learning

**Federated Learning**: Distributed machine learning paradigm where multiple clients collaboratively train a model without sharing raw data. Needed because data privacy regulations and large-scale deployments require decentralized training.

**Multi-modal Learning**: Machine learning approaches that process and integrate information from multiple input modalities (e.g., audio, visual, text). Required to handle the complexity of real-world data that exists in multiple forms.

**Partial-Modality Missing**: Scenario where some modalities are unavailable for certain data samples or clients. Critical because real-world federated systems often have heterogeneous data availability across participants.

**Cross-modal Correlation**: Statistical relationships between different modalities that can be leveraged for feature reconstruction. Essential for imputing missing modality information without explicit data sharing.

**Contrastive Learning**: Self-supervised learning technique that learns representations by contrasting similar and dissimilar pairs. Needed to ensure meaningful feature representations and prevent trivial solutions in the aggregation process.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Client Modalities -> Missing-aware Encoder -> Cross-modal Aggregator -> Contrastive Regularizer -> Global Model

**Critical Path**: The most critical computational path is from the missing-aware encoder through the cross-modal aggregator, as this is where the core missing data handling occurs. The contrastive regularizer operates in parallel to ensure representation quality.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework balances between local computation (modality-specific processing) and global coordination (cross-modal aggregation). The contrastive regularization adds computational overhead but is essential for preventing trivial solutions.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance in severe missing scenarios may indicate inadequate cross-modal correlation modeling. Degradation in Non-IID settings could suggest the contrastive regularization is insufficient for handling distribution shifts.

**First 3 Experiments**:
1. Baseline comparison with standard federated averaging under varying missing rates
2. Ablation study removing the contrastive regularization component
3. Performance evaluation across different degrees of data heterogeneity (IID vs Non-IID)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided material.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to a subset of PTB-XL dataset, potentially limiting generalizability
- Performance metrics focus primarily on accuracy without extensive analysis of computational overhead
- Privacy implications of cross-modal aggregation mechanisms not fully addressed

## Confidence

**Performance improvement claims**: High confidence - supported by comparative experiments with multiple baselines

**Generalizability across different missing patterns**: Medium confidence - limited by evaluation on a single dataset

**Robustness across IID and Non-IID settings**: Medium confidence - requires validation on larger-scale federated experiments

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate FedMAC on multiple multi-modal datasets with varying degrees of modality correlation and missing patterns to assess generalizability

2. Conduct extensive ablation studies varying the number of clients and participation rates to understand scalability in practical federated settings

3. Perform privacy analysis to quantify potential information leakage through cross-modal aggregation mechanisms
