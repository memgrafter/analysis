# Transient anisotropic kernel for probabilistic learning on manifolds

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.21435
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21435
- Authors: Christian Soize; Roger Ghanem
- Reference count: 40
- The paper introduces a transient anisotropic kernel for probabilistic learning on manifolds that evolves from each training point toward the joint probability measure via coupled Fokker-Planck equations, providing improved statistical dependency representation compared to time-independent isotropic kernels.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a fundamental limitation in probabilistic learning on manifolds (PLoM) by introducing a transient anisotropic kernel that evolves in time from each training data point toward the joint probability measure. The kernel is constructed from the solution of coupled Fokker-Planck equations, providing a time-dependent geometric representation that better captures statistical dependencies in heterogeneous data. The method identifies an optimal time parameter through normalized mutual information, balancing the concentration of the learned probability measure with its statistical dependence on the training data. The approach is validated through three applications with varying levels of complexity, demonstrating superior performance compared to the traditional diffusion maps (DMAPS) basis.

## Method Summary
The method constructs a time-dependent anisotropic kernel from the solution of coupled Fokker-Planck equations that evolve from each realization in the training dataset toward the joint probability measure. The transient kernel is used to build a reduced-order basis for PLoM projection, replacing the traditional DMAPS basis. The optimal time for the transient basis is selected using normalized mutual information estimated from the training data and the learned probability measure. The approach involves generating a KDE from the training data, solving the coupled Fokker-Planck equations numerically, building the transient kernel matrix, computing eigenvalues/eigenvectors for each time step, and selecting the optimal time based on the mutual information criterion.

## Key Results
- The transient anisotropic kernel leads to better representation of statistical dependencies in the learned probability measure compared to the DMAPS basis
- The method preserves the concentration of the learned probability measure while learning the geometry of the probability measure support more accurately
- Demonstrated improvements across three applications with varying levels of complexity: a synthetic heterogeneous case, a stochastic partial differential equation, and a stochastic dynamical system with strongly nonlinear behavior

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The transient anisotropic kernel provides a time-dependent geometric representation that better captures statistical dependencies than the time-independent isotropic kernel
- Mechanism: The kernel evolves from each training point toward the joint probability measure via a coupled Fokker-Planck equation, yielding a trajectory of kernels that adapt to data heterogeneity
- Core assumption: The coupled Fokker-Planck equations admit a unique, smooth solution with the KDE-estimated probability measure as the invariant measure
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "construct a time-dependent anisotropic kernel from the solution of a coupled Fokker-Planck equation"
  - [section] "These describe the evolution of the transition probability measures... into the joint probability measure"
  - [corpus] No direct match; related concept in "Fast spectral separation method for kinetic equation with anisotropic non-stationary collision operator retaining micro-model fidelity" but weak relevance
- Break condition: If the Fokker-Planck operator's spectrum is not countable or if the KDE estimate is too noisy for high dimensions, the transient kernel construction may fail

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The optimal time for the transient basis is identified via normalized mutual information, balancing concentration and statistical dependence
- Mechanism: Mutual information is normalized by entropy to account for finite sample effects; the time yielding minimal normalized mutual information relative to the training data is selected
- Core assumption: The estimation of mutual information and entropy from finite samples is unbiased and converges as sample size increases
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The optimal instant yielding the optimal transient basis is determined using an estimation of mutual information from Information Theory"
  - [section] "We propose a methodology for identifying the optimal instant sampled, which maximizes a selection criterion... normalized by entropy estimation"
  - [corpus] Weak; no direct match, though related in "Learning What Matters: Steering Diffusion via Spectrally Anisotropic Forward Noise"
- Break condition: If entropy estimation is unstable or if mutual information saturates quickly, the selection criterion may not distinguish useful transient bases

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The transient anisotropic kernel connects to the DMAPS isotropic kernel asymptotically as time approaches zero, ensuring consistency
- Mechanism: The kernel is constructed such that at initial time it coincides with the DMAPS kernel, and the angle between subspaces spanned by the two bases quantifies their divergence over time
- Core assumption: The limit of the transient kernel as time → 0 exists and equals the DMAPS kernel
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "For times near the initial time, the DMAPS basis coincides with the transient basis"
  - [section] "We construct a time-dependent matrix of the transient anisotropic kernel... whose fundamental property is its convergence to the matrix of the DMAPS isotropic kernel as time approaches zero"
  - [corpus] No direct match; concept not present in corpus
- Break condition: If the convergence to the DMAPS kernel is too slow or numerically unstable, the transient basis may not provide a meaningful alternative

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Fokker-Planck equation and its spectral decomposition
  - Why needed here: The transient kernel is constructed from the solution of Fokker-Planck equations; understanding its spectrum is essential for kernel representation
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between the eigenvalues of the Fokker-Planck operator and the temporal decay of the transient kernel?

- Concept: Kernel methods and Hilbert-Schmidt operators
  - Why needed here: The transient kernel defines a Hilbert-Schmidt operator whose spectral properties determine the basis for PLoM
  - Quick check question: How does the condition Z∫∫kt(y,x)²pH(y)pH(x)dydx < +∞ ensure the operator is Hilbert-Schmidt?

- Concept: Mutual information and entropy estimation from finite samples
  - Why needed here: The optimal time for the transient basis is selected using normalized mutual information; accurate estimation is critical
  - Quick check question: Why is mutual information normalized by entropy when comparing learned and training distributions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Training dataset -> KDE estimation -> Fokker-Planck equations -> Transient kernel -> Hilbert-Schmidt operator -> Eigenvalue problem -> Reduced-order basis
  Parallel path: DMAPS basis construction for comparison
  Selection module: Mutual information and entropy estimation -> Optimal time selection

- Critical path:
  1. Construct KDE from training data
  2. Solve coupled Fokker-Planck equations numerically
  3. Build transient kernel matrix [ ˜K(n∆t)]
  4. Compute eigenvalues/eigenvectors for each time step
  5. Estimate mutual information and entropy for each basis
  6. Select optimal time and basis

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Kernel smoothness vs. computational cost: Finer time discretization improves accuracy but increases computation
  - Sample size for KDE: Larger nd improves KDE quality but increases memory and computation
  - Basis dimension: Higher mopt captures more structure but risks overfitting with small datasets

- Failure signatures:
  - Non-convergence of Fokker-Planck solver -> transient kernel undefined
  - Ill-conditioned eigenvalue problem -> unstable basis
  - Poor mutual information estimation -> suboptimal time selection

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify transient kernel construction on a 1D Gaussian reference case with known solution
  2. Compare angle between transient and DMAPS bases as a function of time
  3. Test mutual information-based time selection on a synthetic dataset with known statistical dependencies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the optimal time parameter (nopt∆t) scale with increasing data heterogeneity and dimensionality of the input space?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows that for more heterogeneous data (Application 1) the optimal time is higher (nopt=9) compared to less heterogeneous data (Application 2 with nopt=5 and Application 3 with nopt=9 but lower statistical complexity)
- Why unresolved: The paper only demonstrates this scaling across three specific applications with varying levels of complexity. A systematic study across a broader range of data characteristics is needed
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive empirical study varying data heterogeneity (e.g., through controlled mixture models) and dimensionality while measuring the optimal time parameter

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the transient anisotropic kernel approach be extended to handle non-stationary probability distributions or time-varying systems?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on stationary probability distributions where the transient kernel evolves from initial conditions to a steady-state solution. The framework could potentially be adapted for non-stationary cases
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore or discuss potential extensions to non-stationary systems. The mathematical formulation would need to be modified
- What evidence would resolve it: Mathematical derivation showing how the Fokker-Planck equation and associated kernel would need to be modified for time-varying systems, followed by numerical validation on a non-stationary test case

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the computational cost of the transient anisotropic kernel approach compare to other manifold learning methods like diffusion maps for large-scale problems?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the method is designed for small datasets and demonstrates it on datasets with up to 560 points. However, it does not provide a computational complexity analysis or comparison with other methods
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on accuracy improvements rather than computational efficiency. A systematic comparison with other methods on larger datasets is needed
- What evidence would resolve it: Computational complexity analysis of the algorithm, benchmark comparisons with diffusion maps and other manifold learning methods on datasets of varying sizes, and identification of scalability bottlenecks

## Limitations
- The method's effectiveness for strongly multimodal distributions remains unclear, as the Fokker-Planck equations may struggle to capture multiple attractors
- The approach relies on numerical solutions of coupled Fokker-Planck equations, which may become unstable in high dimensions or with noisy KDE estimates
- The mutual information-based time selection assumes unbiased finite-sample estimation, which may not hold for small training sets

## Confidence
- Mechanism 1 (Kernel construction): Medium confidence - the mathematical framework is sound but numerical implementation challenges are significant
- Mechanism 2 (Time selection): Low confidence - finite-sample estimation of mutual information and entropy may be unreliable for small datasets
- Mechanism 3 (Consistency with DMAPS): Low confidence - the asymptotic convergence proof is not provided, and numerical stability is uncertain

## Next Checks
1. Verify the spectral convergence of the Fokker-Planck operator for a simple multimodal distribution where analytical solutions exist
2. Perform sensitivity analysis on mutual information estimation accuracy as a function of sample size for the transient kernel selection
3. Test the method's performance on a high-dimensional synthetic dataset (ν > 50) with known statistical dependencies
