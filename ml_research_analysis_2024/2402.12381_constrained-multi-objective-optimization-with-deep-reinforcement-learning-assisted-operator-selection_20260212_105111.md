# Constrained Multi-objective Optimization with Deep Reinforcement Learning Assisted Operator Selection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.12381
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12381
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: DRL-assisted operator selection significantly improves CMOEA performance on 42 benchmark problems

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of selecting suitable evolutionary operators for constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs). The authors propose a novel framework that utilizes Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to adaptively select operators during the optimization process. By learning a policy that estimates Q-values for each operator action based on the population's convergence, diversity, and feasibility, the framework can adaptively select operators that maximize improvement in the population state. The proposed framework is embedded into four popular CMOEAs and evaluated on 42 benchmark problems, demonstrating significant performance improvements and better versatility compared to state-of-the-art CMOEAs.

## Method Summary
The method involves a DRL model that takes the population's convergence, diversity, and feasibility as the state, the candidate evolutionary operators as actions, and the improvement of the population state as the reward. The DRL model, specifically a Deep Q-Network (DQN), learns to estimate Q-values for each operator action given the current population state. The operator with the highest Q-value is selected to generate new solutions, and the process iterates until convergence. The framework is embedded into four CMOEAs (CCMO, EMCMO, MOEA/D-DAE, and PPS) using GA and DE as candidate operators. The DRL model is trained using experience replay, storing historical data of state, action, reward, and new state.

## Key Results
- The DRL-assisted operator selection framework significantly improves the performance of four CMOEAs on 42 benchmark problems
- The framework achieves better versatility compared to nine state-of-the-art CMOEAs
- The method demonstrates the potential to enhance the performance of CMOEAs by adaptively selecting operators based on the population state

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The proposed method improves performance by using Deep Reinforcement Learning to adaptively select evolutionary operators based on population state.
- Mechanism: DRL estimates Q-values for each operator action given the current population state (convergence, diversity, feasibility). The operator with the highest Q-value is selected to maximize expected reward, which is the improvement in population state.
- Core assumption: The improvement in population state (convergence, diversity, feasibility) can be accurately predicted by a trained Q-Network, and operator selection based on these predictions leads to better overall optimization performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "By using a Q-Network to learn a policy to estimate the Q-values of all actions, the proposed approach can adaptively select an operator that maximizes the improvement of the population according to the current state and thereby improve the algorithmic performance."
  - [section] "The proposed model is shown in Fig. 2. This model contains four procedures, they are: Evolution procedure, Interaction procedure, Learning procedure, and Decision procedure."
  - [corpus] Weak - the corpus papers do not discuss DRL-assisted operator selection for CMOEAs specifically, so direct evidence is missing. The closest is a paper on "Deep Learning-Based Operators for Evolutionary Algorithms" which uses deep learning but not for operator selection in CMOEAs.
- Break condition: If the Q-Network fails to accurately predict the improvement in population state, or if the reward signal (improvement in convergence, diversity, feasibility) does not correlate with actual optimization performance, the DRL model will select suboptimal operators, leading to worse performance than using a fixed operator.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The method handles the constraint satisfaction and feasibility aspect of CMOPs by including feasibility in the state representation and reward calculation.
- Mechanism: The state includes the average CV value of solutions in the population, and the reward is calculated as the improvement in this feasibility measure along with convergence and diversity. This ensures that the DRL model considers constraint satisfaction when selecting operators.
- Core assumption: Including feasibility in the state and reward allows the DRL model to learn policies that balance objective optimization with constraint satisfaction.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Since a CMOP contains constraints, it is necessary for a DRL model to consider constraint satisfaction and feasibility in the design of the state and reward."
  - [section] "The average CV value of solutions in the population is used to estimate feasibility, i.e., the distribution of the population in the feasible/infeasible regions. Specifically, it is formulated as f ea = P x∈P ϕ(x) / N , where ϕ(x) is the CV of x."
  - [corpus] Weak - the corpus papers do not discuss feasibility handling in DRL-assisted CMOEAs, so direct evidence is missing.
- Break condition: If the feasibility measure (average CV) does not accurately reflect the population's constraint satisfaction status, or if the DRL model fails to learn to balance feasibility with convergence and diversity, the method may select operators that improve objective values at the expense of violating constraints.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The method is versatile and can be easily embedded into any CMOEA because it uses a generic state representation and can handle any number of operators.
- Mechanism: The state representation (convergence, diversity, feasibility) is applicable to any CMOEA, and the DRL model can be trained with any set of candidate operators. The framework is designed to be modular and adaptable.
- Core assumption: A generic state representation and the ability to handle any number of operators are sufficient for the method to be applicable to a wide range of CMOEAs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The proposed model can contain an arbitrary number of operators and the proposed framework can be easily employed in any CMOEA."
  - [section] "It should be noted that in our proposed model, any number of operators can be used as candidates."
  - [corpus] Weak - the corpus papers do not discuss the versatility of DRL-assisted operator selection methods, so direct evidence is missing.
- Break condition: If the generic state representation is not sufficient to capture the nuances of a particular CMOEA, or if the DRL model cannot effectively learn to select from a large number of operators, the method may not be as effective when embedded in certain CMOEAs.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Constrained Multi-Objective Optimization Problems (CMOPs)
  - Why needed here: The paper addresses the challenge of solving CMOPs using evolutionary algorithms with adaptive operator selection.
  - Quick check question: What are the three key components that affect the performance of a CMOEA, and how does the proposed method address one of them?

- Concept: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
  - Why needed here: DRL is used to adaptively select evolutionary operators based on the population state during the optimization process.
  - Quick check question: How does DRL differ from traditional Reinforcement Learning in handling the continuous state space of the population in CMOPs?

- Concept: Evolutionary Operators
  - Why needed here: The method selects from a set of candidate evolutionary operators (e.g., GA, DE) to generate new solutions during the optimization process.
  - Quick check question: Why is adaptive operator selection beneficial for solving CMOPs, according to the No Free Lunch theorem?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Population state (convergence, diversity, feasibility) -> DRL model (DQN) -> Evolutionary operators (GA, DE) -> New solutions -> Environmental selection -> Updated population state

- Critical path:
  1. Initialize the CMOEA and determine the initial population state.
  2. If the experience replay is not large enough, randomly select an operator; otherwise, use the trained DRL model to select an operator based on the current population state.
  3. Generate offspring using the selected operator and perform environmental selection to determine the next generation population.
  4. Update the experience replay with the new state and reward, and periodically update the DRL model.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Versatility vs. Specificity: The generic state representation and ability to handle any number of operators make the method versatile but may not capture the nuances of specific CMOEAs.
  - Exploration vs. Exploitation: The method uses a combination of random operator selection (for exploration) and DRL-based selection (for exploitation) to balance the trade-off.

- Failure signatures:
  - If the DRL model consistently selects the same operator, it may indicate overfitting or insufficient exploration.
  - If the method performs worse than using a fixed operator, it may suggest that the DRL model is not accurately predicting the improvement in population state or that the reward signal is not well-aligned with optimization performance.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement the DRL model with a simple CMOEA (e.g., CCMO) and a small set of operators (e.g., GA and DE) on a benchmark CMOP.
  2. Compare the performance of the DRL-assisted CMOEA with the original CMOEA using a fixed operator and random operator selection.
  3. Analyze the selected operators over the course of the optimization to understand the DRL model's decision-making process and identify any potential issues (e.g., overfitting, insufficient exploration).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the DRL-assisted operator selection framework change when using operators beyond GA and DE, such as PSO or CSO?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that the framework can contain an arbitrary number of operators and suggests future work to embed other operators like CSO or enhanced operators.
- Why unresolved: The experimental studies only instantiated the framework with GA and DE as candidate operators, leaving the performance of other operators unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments using the DRL-assisted framework with various operators (e.g., PSO, CSO) and comparing their performance to GA and DE on the same benchmark problems.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of different hyperparameter settings on the performance of the DQN used in the DRL model?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that hyperparameter adaptation is necessary for future study since there are many hyperparameters that need to be adjusted. It also conducted parameter analyses on some DQN settings.
- Why unresolved: While the paper explored some DQN parameters, it did not exhaustively test all possible hyperparameter combinations or their impact on different problem types.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study varying DQN hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, decay, network architecture) across diverse CMOPs to identify optimal configurations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the DRL-assisted operator selection method perform on real-world CMOPs compared to synthetic benchmarks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper focuses on benchmark problems and mentions that increasing the maximum number of function evaluations may improve performance on real-world problems.
- Why unresolved: The experimental studies are limited to benchmark problems, and the method's effectiveness on real-world CMOPs with unknown features and constraints is not evaluated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the DRL-assisted framework to real-world CMOPs from various domains (e.g., engineering design, resource allocation) and comparing its performance to state-of-the-art methods.

## Limitations

- The method's generalizability to problems outside the tested benchmark suite is uncertain, as the experimental studies are limited to synthetic CMOPs.
- The computational overhead introduced by the DRL training process is not extensively analyzed, and its impact on the overall efficiency of the CMOEAs is unclear.
- The sensitivity of the method to hyperparameters such as the experience replay size and the epsilon-greedy exploration rate is not thoroughly investigated.

## Confidence

- Medium: The results show improvements over baseline methods, but several limitations should be noted. The generalizability, computational overhead, and hyperparameter sensitivity require further investigation.

## Next Checks

1. Test the method on a wider range of CMOPs, including problems with different characteristics (e.g., higher dimensionality, more complex constraint landscapes) to assess its generalizability.
2. Conduct an ablation study to understand the contribution of each component (state representation, reward function, DRL model) to the overall performance.
3. Analyze the computational overhead introduced by the DRL training process and compare it with the performance gains to evaluate the method's efficiency.
