# Robustness investigation of cross-validation based quality measures for model assessment

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.04391
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04391
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: k-fold cross-validation provides more conservative and reliable estimates than leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation, especially with limited training data

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the accuracy and robustness of quality measures for assessing machine learning models, focusing on model-independent measures based on cross-validation approaches. The authors introduce confidence bounds for the Coefficient of Prognosis (CoP) using bootstrapping, demonstrating that k-fold cross-validation provides more conservative and reliable estimates compared to LOO cross-validation. Local quality measures such as local RMSE and local CoP are presented for model-independent error estimation at individual points.

## Method Summary
The study implements k-fold cross-validation (5-10 folds) on surrogate models including polynomial regression, Moving Least Squares, and Kriging. Bootstrapping with 105 repetitions is applied to cross-validation residuals to estimate confidence bounds for the CoP. The method is validated through numerical examples including analytical functions, noisy benchmarks, and real-world engineering applications like front crash simulations and Cut-In scenarios for autonomous vehicles.

## Key Results
- k-fold cross-validation provides more conservative and reliable error estimates than LOO cross-validation, especially with limited training data
- Bootstrapping residuals directly yields confidence bounds for quality measures without requiring re-training models
- Local quality measures (local RMSE, local CoP) enable model-independent error estimation at individual points

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
k-fold cross-validation reduces variance in error estimates by using multiple subsets, preventing over-optimistic predictions that can occur when each fold in LOO is nearly identical to the full dataset. This provides more conservative estimates especially for limited training data.

### Mechanism 2
Bootstrapping residuals with replacement approximates the sampling distribution of the error estimator, enabling percentile-based confidence intervals. This allows confidence bounds for quality measures without re-training models.

### Mechanism 3
Local quality measures use weighted averaging of residuals around query points to capture local prediction uncertainty without assuming specific model forms. This provides model-independent error estimation at individual points.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cross-validation
  - Why needed here: Provides a model-independent way to estimate prediction error on unseen data
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between k-fold and leave-one-out cross-validation in terms of bias and variance of the error estimate?

- Concept: Bootstrapping
  - Why needed here: Enables estimation of confidence intervals for error measures without assuming a parametric distribution
  - Quick check question: Why is it important that residuals are assumed independent and identically distributed when using bootstrapping?

- Concept: Coefficient of Prognosis (CoP)
  - Why needed here: Quantifies explained variation in model prediction using cross-validation residuals, offering a model-independent quality measure
  - Quick check question: How does CoP differ from Coefficient of Determination (CoD) in terms of what residuals it uses?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing -> Cross-validation splitting -> Model training on subsets -> Residual calculation -> Quality measure computation (CoP, RMSE) -> Bootstrapping residuals -> Confidence interval estimation -> Optional: Local error mapping
- Critical path: Training -> Cross-validation -> Residual aggregation -> Quality measure calculation -> Bootstrap confidence bounds
- Design tradeoffs:
  - k-fold vs LOO: More folds → less bias, more variance; fewer folds → more bias, less variance
  - Bootstrap iterations: More iterations → tighter confidence bounds but higher computation cost
  - Local weighting: Wider kernel → smoother estimates, possible loss of detail; narrower kernel → more detail, higher variance
- Failure signatures:
  - Over-optimistic CoP → likely LOO was used with small data
  - Wide bootstrap CI → high residual variance or outliers present
  - Local RMSE spikes → sparse data or model inadequacy in that region
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare k-fold (k=5) vs LOO CoP on a small synthetic dataset with known noise level
  2. Apply bootstrapping with 1000 resamples on a dataset with clear outliers; inspect resulting CI coverage
  3. Generate a 2D grid of local RMSE estimates for a nonlinear benchmark function and visualize uncertainty hotspots

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the Coefficient of Prognosis (CoP) behave for non-stationary outputs with time-varying variance? The paper suggests using stationary CoD and CoP but does not provide empirical validation or compare performance against alternative normalization schemes.

### Open Question 2
What is the optimal number of folds for k-fold cross-validation in terms of balancing bias and variance of CoP estimates? The paper states 5-10 subsets are commonly used but does not provide systematic analysis of how the choice affects robustness, especially for small sample sizes.

### Open Question 3
How can bootstrapping confidence bounds be adapted for dependent or non-identically distributed residuals? The paper assumes independent and identically distributed residuals for bootstrapping but acknowledges this may not hold in practice.

## Limitations
- Assumes independent and identically distributed residuals, which may not hold in autocorrelated or heteroscedastic settings
- Does not address computational cost scaling with dataset size or model complexity
- Local error measures lack independent validation beyond the presented examples

## Confidence
- k-fold vs LOO conservatism: Medium
- Bootstrapping confidence bounds: Medium
- Local error measures: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test the local RMSE and local CoP measures on a 2D benchmark function with varying data densities to quantify sensitivity to sample sparsity
2. Apply the same cross-validation and bootstrapping pipeline to a time-series dataset to assess robustness under residual correlation
3. Compare the CoP with bootstrap confidence bounds against a held-out test set on a real-world regression problem to evaluate calibration accuracy
