# Many Perception Tasks are Highly Redundant Functions of their Input Data

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2407.13841
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13841
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Perception tasks are highly redundant functions of their input data, with information spread across entire spectrum of subspaces

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether perception tasks can be solved using only subsets of input data projected into different subspaces. The authors project images using PCA, Fourier, and wavelet bases into subspaces with varying variance levels and train deep networks on these projections. They find that while principal subspaces (highest variance) are most predictive, even subspaces with least variance contain significant predictive information for tasks including visual recognition, semantic segmentation, optical flow, depth estimation, and vocalization discrimination. This demonstrates that perception tasks are highly redundant functions of their input data, with information distributed across the entire input spectrum rather than concentrated in specific regions.

## Method Summary
The authors use linear subspace projections to decompose input data into orthogonal components ranked by variance (PCA), frequency content (Fourier), or wavelet coefficients. For each task and dataset, they train deep networks on projections into the first k subspaces (highest variance) and last k subspaces (lowest variance), as well as random subspaces. They evaluate performance across different k values to determine how much of the input spectrum is actually needed. The study covers multiple modalities including images and audio, and tasks including classification, segmentation, depth estimation, optical flow, and vocalization discrimination. They also analyze mutual information and partial information decomposition to understand how information is shared across subspaces.

## Key Results
- Principal subspaces (highest variance) are most predictive for all tested perception tasks
- Subspaces with lowest variance still contain significant predictive information, often achieving 40-60% of full performance
- Information is distributed across the entire spectrum rather than concentrated in specific regions
- Results hold across different bases (PCA, Fourier, wavelet), modalities (images, audio), and tasks
- Mutual information and partial information decomposition reveal high redundant and synergistic information across subspaces

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The redundancy observed in perception tasks stems from the inherent structure of natural data and the way deep networks extract features. Natural signals contain information at multiple scales and frequencies, and the tasks we solve with them don't require all this information equally. Deep networks can extract relevant features from various parts of the input spectrum because the underlying functions mapping inputs to outputs are smooth and contain redundant information. This redundancy is amplified by the overparameterized nature of deep networks, which can learn to extract task-relevant features from diverse input representations.

## Foundational Learning
- **PCA decomposition**: Linear transformation that projects data onto orthogonal axes of decreasing variance. Needed to systematically analyze information distribution across input subspaces.
- **Fourier/wavelet transforms**: Basis transformations that decompose signals into frequency or multi-scale components. Quick check: verify basis orthogonality and completeness.
- **Mutual information**: Measures shared information between random variables. Quick check: ensure proper entropy estimation in high dimensions.
- **Partial information decomposition**: Framework for quantifying redundant, unique, and synergistic information contributions. Quick check: verify decomposition axioms are satisfied.
- **Overparameterized networks**: Neural networks with more parameters than training samples. Quick check: monitor generalization gap during training.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input data -> Basis transform (PCA/Fourier/Wavelet) -> Subspace projection -> Deep network -> Task output

Critical path: The critical path involves projecting input data into subspaces, training separate networks on each subspace projection, and evaluating task performance. The bottleneck is the computational cost of training multiple networks for different subspace configurations.

Design tradeoffs: The main tradeoff is between computational efficiency (using fewer subspaces) and task performance (using more subspaces). The study shows that using only principal subspaces maximizes performance, but including other subspaces could provide robustness or efficiency benefits.

Failure signatures: Networks trained on individual subspaces may fail when the subspace lacks task-relevant information. Performance degradation is gradual rather than catastrophic, indicating distributed information.

First experiments:
1. Train networks on full data vs principal subspace only to establish baseline redundancy
2. Train networks on random subspaces to test if variance ordering matters
3. Analyze mutual information between subspaces and task labels

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Analysis limited to PCA, Fourier, and wavelet bases - other transformations might reveal different redundancy patterns
- Results don't directly translate to practical compression or efficiency gains without additional architectural modifications
- Information-theoretic analyses have known limitations in high-dimensional settings
- Study focuses on perception tasks - other types of tasks may exhibit different redundancy patterns

## Confidence
- High confidence in experimental methodology and reproducibility across tested tasks
- Medium confidence in generalizability to all perception tasks beyond those tested
- Medium confidence in interpretation of information-theoretic analyses due to known methodological limitations

## Next Checks
1. Test redundancy patterns using alternative basis functions beyond PCA, Fourier, and wavelet transforms
2. Conduct ablation studies to determine practical impact on model efficiency and compression capabilities
3. Validate information-theoretic interpretations using additional methods or theoretical bounds
