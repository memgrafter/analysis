# Low-Resource Cross-Lingual Summarization through Few-Shot Learning with Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.04630
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04630
- Reference count: 4
- Key outcome: Few-shot learning significantly improves low-resource cross-lingual summarization performance for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in many-to-one settings, while Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 struggles to adapt effectively.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the few-shot learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for low-resource cross-lingual summarization (XLS). The study compares fine-tuned mT5, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 models across various language pairs using the CrossSum dataset. Results show that few-shot learning significantly improves XLS performance, particularly for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in many-to-one settings (summarizing to English). However, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 struggles to adapt effectively to XLS with limited examples. The findings highlight the potential of few-shot learning for enhancing XLS performance and underscore the need for further research in designing LLM architectures and pre-training objectives tailored for this task.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates cross-lingual summarization performance using the CrossSum dataset, focusing on low-resource language pairs with fewer than 1,000 parallel data points. Models tested include fine-tuned mT5, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 in zero-shot, one-shot, and two-shot settings. The direct XLS method employs in-context learning with carefully selected examples from the validation set. Performance is measured using ROUGE-1/2/L metrics comparing generated summaries against reference summaries.

## Key Results
- Few-shot learning significantly improves XLS performance for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in many-to-one settings
- Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 struggles to adapt effectively to XLS with limited examples
- Many-to-one approach generally outperforms one-to-many approach for cross-lingual summarization
- All models achieved ROUGE scores of 0 for English to-Pashto language pair across all few-shot settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Few-shot learning with carefully selected examples enables LLMs to generalize cross-lingual summarization in low-resource settings. In-context learning leverages the model's pre-trained knowledge and demonstrates the expected format through example-summary pairs, allowing it to infer the mapping from source to target language summaries without full fine-tuning. The model has sufficient cross-lingual representation capacity from pre-training and can adapt with minimal in-context examples.

### Mechanism 2
Selecting shortest examples first in few-shot prompts helps manage computational constraints and improves model adaptation. By prioritizing shorter examples, the prompt remains within token limits while providing sufficient diversity, allowing the model to learn the summarization task without exceeding context window constraints. The model's attention mechanism can effectively learn from shorter examples when they are well-chosen to represent task complexity.

### Mechanism 3
The many-to-one setting (multiple source languages to one target language) is more effective than one-to-many for cross-lingual summarization with few-shot learning. LLMs may have better representation for the target language (English) across different source languages, making it easier to learn summarization patterns when the output is always in the same language. The pre-training corpus contains sufficient English text for the model to have strong generative capabilities, while individual low-resource languages may have less coverage.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cross-lingual summarization as a dual-task problem (summarization + translation)
  - Why needed here: Understanding that XLS combines information extraction and language transfer is crucial for designing appropriate few-shot examples and interpreting model behavior.
  - Quick check question: Why might a pipeline approach (summarize then translate) perform worse than direct methods in low-resource settings?

- Concept: In-context learning and few-shot prompting mechanics
  - Why needed here: The effectiveness of few-shot learning depends on proper prompt construction, example selection, and understanding how models process demonstration examples.
  - Quick check question: How does the order and selection of examples in a few-shot prompt affect model performance?

- Concept: Token limitations and context window management
  - Why needed here: Low-resource languages may have longer sentences, and managing the prompt length while including sufficient examples is critical for effective few-shot learning.
  - Quick check question: What happens when a few-shot prompt exceeds the model's context window, and how can this be mitigated?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Prompt generator (selecting and ordering examples) -> LLM inference engine (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, or Mistral) -> Summary generation -> ROUGE evaluation
- Critical path: Prompt construction → LLM inference → Summary generation → ROUGE evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Balancing the number of examples (shots) against token limitations, choosing between proprietary (GPT-3.5/4) and open-source (Mistral) models based on performance vs accessibility, and deciding between many-to-one vs one-to-many settings.
- Failure signatures: Consistently low ROUGE scores across few-shot settings, performance degradation with more shots (as seen with Mistral), or inability to generate meaningful output for certain language pairs (as with English to Pashto).
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare zero-shot vs one-shot performance for a single language pair to establish baseline few-shot impact
  2. Test different example selection strategies (shortest vs random vs most complex) for one language pair
  3. Evaluate many-to-one vs one-to-many performance for the same model to understand directional advantages

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What specific architectural modifications or pre-training objectives would be most effective for improving few-shot cross-lingual summarization performance in low-resource languages? The paper states "the need for further research in designing LLM architectures and pre-training objectives tailored for this task" and suggests exploring "more effective few-shot learning strategies and to investigate the transfer learning capabilities of LLMs for cross-lingual summarization." This remains unresolved as the paper does not provide specific recommendations or experimental results on what modifications would be most effective.

### Open Question 2
How can few-shot learning performance be improved for extremely low-resource language pairs like English-Pashto where current models fail to generate meaningful summaries? The paper notes that "all models achieved ROUGE scores of 0 for the English to-Pashto language pair across all few-shot settings" and emphasizes the need for "more effective few-shot learning strategies" for such challenging scenarios. The paper demonstrates the failure of current approaches for extremely low-resource pairs but does not propose or test solutions for this specific challenge.

### Open Question 3
What factors contribute to the observed performance gap between many-to-one and one-to-many settings in cross-lingual summarization, and how can this gap be minimized? The paper observes that "the many-to-one approach generally resulted in higher ROUGE scores than the one-to-many approach" and that this gap was "more pronounced for the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2." While the performance difference is noted, the underlying causes are not investigated, and no solutions are proposed to address this imbalance.

## Limitations

- The study's findings are based on a limited set of low-resource language pairs and may not generalize to other language combinations or domains.
- The evaluation relies solely on ROUGE metrics, which may not fully capture the quality of cross-lingual summaries, particularly in terms of factual consistency and fluency.
- The paper does not explore the impact of example selection strategies beyond token count, which could significantly influence few-shot performance.

## Confidence

- High confidence: The observation that few-shot learning improves XLS performance for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in many-to-one settings is well-supported by the experimental results and aligns with established in-context learning literature.
- Medium confidence: The finding that Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 struggles with few-shot XLS is based on the reported experiments, but the reasons for this underperformance are not thoroughly investigated.
- Medium confidence: The claim that few-shot learning has potential for enhancing XLS performance is supported by the results, but the study does not explore optimal prompt designs or example selection strategies that could further improve performance.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies on example selection strategies (e.g., random, complexity-based, diversity-based) to determine their impact on few-shot XLS performance across different language pairs.
2. Evaluate the generated summaries using additional metrics beyond ROUGE, such as faithfulness and factual consistency scores, to provide a more comprehensive assessment of summary quality.
3. Investigate the performance of few-shot XLS on a wider range of low-resource language pairs, including those with different linguistic families and scripts, to assess the generalizability of the findings.
