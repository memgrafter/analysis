# PoseBench: Benchmarking the Robustness of Pose Estimation Models under Corruptions

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2406.14367
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14367
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: State-of-the-art pose estimation models are vulnerable to common real-world corruptions, with motion blur and contrast changes having the most significant impact on model robustness

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces PoseBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the robustness of pose estimation models under real-world corruptions. The authors evaluated 60 representative models across three datasets (COCO-C, OCHuman-C, AP10K-C) under 10 types of corruptions spanning four categories: blur and noise, compression and color loss, severe lighting, and masks. The study reveals that while pose estimation models have achieved remarkable progress on clean images, they remain highly vulnerable to common real-world corruptions. The findings show that regression-based methods demonstrate higher resistance to mask corruption, and models exhibit distinct robustness patterns when tackling human versus animal pose estimation tasks.

## Method Summary
The benchmark evaluates 60 pose estimation models using mean Average Precision (mAP), mean Average Recall (mAR), and mean Relative robustness (mRR) metrics. Models are tested on three corrupted datasets (COCO-C, OCHuman-C, AP10K-C) with 10 corruption types across four categories, each with five severity levels. The evaluation includes diverse model architectures (top-down/bottom-up, heatmap-based/regression-based/classification-based) with various backbones (CNN and ViT) and input resolutions. The study systematically analyzes factors affecting robustness including input resolution, pre-training datasets, backbone capacity, post-processing, and data augmentations.

## Key Results
- Motion blur and contrast changes have the most significant impact on model robustness across all evaluated models
- Regression-based methods show higher resistance to mask corruption despite lower clean performance
- Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures consistently outperform CNN-based models in both clean performance and robustness
- Pre-training, post-processing, and large transformer-based backbones significantly enhance model robustness
- Robustness is strongly correlated with clean performance across all models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Robustness is strongly correlated with clean performance across all models
- Mechanism: Models that perform well on clean data have learned more generalizable features that transfer to corrupted data, even though performance degrades
- Core assumption: Feature representations learned on clean data contain sufficient generalizable patterns to handle corruption
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "state-of-the-art models are vulnerable to common real-world corruptions and exhibit distinct behaviors when tackling human and animal pose estimation tasks"; [section]: "The overall relative robustness of models against all corruptions is strongly correlated with their performance on original clean images, as shown in Figure 4a"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Motion blur and contrast changes have the most significant impact on model robustness
- Mechanism: These corruptions affect the global structure and visibility of keypoints most severely, making it difficult for models to locate anatomical points accurately
- Core assumption: Global image features are more critical for pose estimation than local details
- Evidence anchors: [section]: "Among all the corruptions, motion blur and contrast have the most significant impact on model robustness"; [abstract]: "motion blur and contrast changes having the most significant impact on model robustness"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Regression-based methods show higher resistance to mask corruption despite lower clean performance
- Mechanism: Regression methods predict direct coordinates, allowing them to better integrate global context information to resolve ambiguities when local regions are occluded
- Core assumption: Direct coordinate prediction inherently leverages more global context than heatmap-based approaches
- Evidence anchors: [section]: "Regression-based methods demonstrate the highest resistance to mask corruption, even though their performance on clean images is not the best"; [section]: "Table 2 provides a detailed comparison...regression-based models excel over heatmap-based ones under mask corruption across most metrics"

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Mean Average Precision (mAP) and Mean Average Recall (mAR) metrics
  - Why needed here: These are standard evaluation metrics for pose estimation that measure localization accuracy and coverage across different confidence thresholds
  - Quick check question: What threshold range is used to calculate mAP in this benchmark?

- **Concept**: Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture advantages
  - Why needed here: ViT-based models consistently outperform CNN-based models in both clean performance and robustness, suggesting architectural benefits for pose estimation
  - Quick check question: What specific architectural feature of ViTs makes them more robust than CNNs for pose estimation?

- **Concept**: Data augmentation strategies for robustness
  - Why needed here: Different augmentation sets show varying effectiveness against different corruption types, indicating the importance of targeted augmentation
  - Quick check question: Which augmentation set showed the most significant improvement in robustness against motion blur?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: 60 pose estimation models across three datasets (COCO-C, OCHuman-C, AP10K-C) evaluated under 10 corruption types across four categories, with five severity levels each. Models include top-down/bottom-up, heatmap-based/regression-based/classification-based methods, using various backbones (CNN and ViT).
- **Critical path**: 1) Load model checkpoint, 2) Apply corruption to validation images, 3) Run pose estimation, 4) Calculate mAP/mAR metrics, 5) Aggregate results across severity levels
- **Design tradeoffs**: Input resolution vs robustness (higher resolution improves clean performance but may reduce relative robustness), model capacity vs efficiency (larger models show better robustness but at computational cost), heatmap vs regression approaches (different corruption resistances)
- **Failure signatures**: Sudden performance drops at specific severity levels, inconsistent robustness across different corruption types, degradation patterns that don't correlate with clean performance
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Evaluate a simple baseline model (e.g., SimpleBaseline with ResNet-50) on COCO-C dataset with all corruption types to establish baseline performance patterns
  2. Compare heatmap-based vs regression-based models under mask corruption to verify the mechanism described in the paper
  3. Test different input resolutions (256x192 vs 384x288) on the same model to observe the resolution vs robustness tradeoff

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do ViT-based pose estimation models maintain robustness against corruptions while CNN-based models struggle with increasing depth?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that ViT backbones consistently outperform CNN-based counterparts across corruption robustness, attributing this to the scalability of vision transformer models that can be easily expanded in terms of layers, hidden units, and attention heads
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies scalability as a key factor, it doesn't explain the specific architectural or training mechanisms that enable ViTs to maintain robustness when CNNs fail at greater depths
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis of attention patterns, feature representations, and gradient flows in ViT versus CNN models of varying depths under corrupted conditions

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the relationship between pre-training dataset diversity and corruption robustness in pose estimation models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows that training on multiple datasets improves both mAP and mRR under corruptions compared to using a single COCO dataset, but notes that more datasets don't always yield better results
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't establish which types of pre-training data (e.g., crowd poses, animal poses, whole-body poses) contribute most effectively to corruption robustness versus clean performance
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments isolating the impact of different pre-training dataset types on specific corruption categories while controlling for dataset size and distribution overlap

### Open Question 3
- Question: Why do regression-based pose estimation methods show higher resistance to mask corruption despite lower clean image performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper observes that regression-based methods like PRTR and Poseur outperform heatmap-based models under mask corruption, even though their clean mAP is lower
- Why unresolved: The paper suggests this may be because regression-based methods can better integrate global context information, but doesn't provide evidence or explore alternative explanations
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies comparing context integration capabilities of regression versus heatmap methods under varying levels of occlusion and missing data scenarios

## Limitations
- The study focuses on 10 specific corruption types, but real-world scenarios may involve combinations or novel corruption patterns not covered in the benchmark
- While pre-training datasets and augmentation strategies are identified as important factors, the paper doesn't systematically isolate their individual contributions
- The robustness rankings may be influenced by specific implementation choices and hyperparameter settings that weren't fully explored

## Confidence
- **High**: Correlation between clean performance and robustness, impact of motion blur and contrast changes, advantages of ViT architectures and post-processing
- **Medium**: Specific advantages of regression-based methods for mask corruption, effectiveness of data augmentation strategies
- **Low**: Generalization of findings to completely unseen corruption types, exact mechanisms behind architecture-specific robustness advantages

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contributions of pre-training datasets versus augmentation strategies on model robustness
2. Test the top-performing models from PoseBench on a separate dataset with unseen corruption types to assess generalization
3. Analyze failure cases in detail to understand whether robustness improvements come from better feature representations or better handling of corrupted regions
