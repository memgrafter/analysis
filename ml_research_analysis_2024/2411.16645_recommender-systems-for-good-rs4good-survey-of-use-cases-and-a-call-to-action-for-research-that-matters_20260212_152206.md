# Recommender Systems for Good (RS4Good): Survey of Use Cases and a Call to Action for Research that Matters

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.16645
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16645
- Authors: Dietmar Jannach; Alan Said; Marko Tkalčič; Markus Zanker
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: The paper advocates for a shift in recommender systems research toward societal impact domains (RS4Good), presenting survey evidence and calling for interdisciplinary collaboration and impact-oriented evaluation methods.

## Executive Summary
This paper argues that current recommender systems research is overly focused on algorithm development for e-commerce and media domains, often using offline evaluations that don't translate to real-world impact. The authors propose a paradigm shift toward "Recommender Systems for Good" (RS4Good) that addresses societal challenges across health, education, individual development, societal/political development, and environmental sustainability. Through a comprehensive survey of existing RS4Good literature, they demonstrate the breadth of potential applications and highlight methodological challenges including the need for interdisciplinary collaboration, human-in-the-loop evaluation, and longitudinal studies. The paper concludes with recommendations for fostering RS4Good research, including recognition for impactful work and dedicated publication venues.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted a comprehensive survey of RS4Good literature across five major societal domains: health, education, individual development, societal/political development, and environmental sustainability. They synthesized findings from existing research to identify common themes, methodological approaches, and challenges specific to each domain. The analysis draws on both computer science literature and domain-specific research to understand the unique requirements of RS4Good applications. The methodology combines literature review with expert synthesis to develop recommendations for the research community.

## Key Results
- Current RS research is heavily concentrated on e-commerce and media domains with limited real-world impact
- RS4Good applications exist across diverse societal domains including health, education, and sustainability
- Offline accuracy metrics don't reliably translate to real-world user engagement or business value
- Interdisciplinary collaboration is essential for successful RS4Good research
- Evaluation methodologies need to shift from offline metrics to human-in-the-loop and longitudinal studies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Focusing RS research on societal good domains (RS4Good) will increase real-world impact and research meaningfulness.
- Mechanism: By shifting evaluation from offline accuracy metrics to human-in-the-loop and longitudinal studies, researchers will produce results that better translate to practical benefits and societal value.
- Core assumption: Offline accuracy improvements do not reliably translate to real-world user engagement or business value, as evidenced by industry reports (Netflix Prize).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "many of these models are never evaluated with users, let alone put into practice"
  - [section]: "gains in offline accuracy do not reliably translate to increased consumer or business value in practice"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct evidence in corpus neighbors about offline-online gap
- Break condition: If offline accuracy improvements consistently show strong correlation with real-world success metrics, or if RS4Good domains prove equally difficult to evaluate meaningfully.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Interdisciplinary collaboration is essential for RS4Good research to address domain-specific challenges effectively.
- Mechanism: Combining computer science expertise with domain experts (healthcare, education, etc.) enables creation of recommender systems that properly understand and address domain-specific needs and constraints.
- Core assumption: Domain-specific challenges require deep understanding that computer scientists alone cannot achieve without expert collaboration.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "a computer science with only layman's understanding of medicine should not be attempting to develop healthcare solutions without the guidance of experts"
  - [abstract]: "a paradigmatic shift that is needed to conduct successful RS4Good research, where the key ingredients are interdisciplinary collaborations"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct evidence in corpus neighbors about interdisciplinary collaboration needs
- Break condition: If standardized approaches can be developed that work across multiple RS4Good domains without deep domain expertise.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: A "slow science" approach to RS research will produce more meaningful and impactful results.
- Mechanism: By allowing more time for thorough evaluation, interdisciplinary collaboration, and longitudinal studies, researchers can better understand and optimize for real-world impact rather than publication speed.
- Core assumption: The current fast-paced publication culture prioritizes quantity over quality and impact, leading to research that doesn't translate to practice.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "research in RS4Good domains might often be much slower and effortful...largely incompatible with the fast-paced publication culture in computer science"
  - [abstract]: "we as a research community should more often address use cases where recommender systems contribute to societal good"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct evidence in corpus neighbors about publication culture impacts
- Break condition: If faster publication cycles can be maintained while incorporating thorough evaluation and interdisciplinary approaches.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Offline vs. Online Evaluation Gap
  - Why needed here: Understanding why offline accuracy metrics don't translate to real-world success is fundamental to the RS4Good argument
  - Quick check question: What evidence does the paper provide that offline accuracy improvements don't reliably lead to real-world impact?

- Concept: Interdisciplinary Research Frameworks
  - Why needed here: RS4Good research requires combining computer science with domain expertise, requiring understanding of how interdisciplinary collaboration works
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of successful interdisciplinary research according to the paper?

- Concept: Longitudinal Study Design
  - Why needed here: Many RS4Good applications require long-term evaluation to assess true impact, requiring knowledge of longitudinal research methods
  - Quick check question: What specific challenges does the paper identify for conducting longitudinal studies in RS4Good contexts?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Problem Selection -> Interdisciplinary Collaboration -> System Development with Human Feedback -> Longitudinal Impact Assessment
- Critical path: The critical path for RS4Good research starts with problem identification, followed by interdisciplinary team formation, then system development with continuous human feedback, and finally longitudinal impact assessment. Each stage must be completed before moving to the next.
- Design tradeoffs: The main tradeoff is between research speed and depth of impact. Traditional offline-focused research can be faster but may produce less meaningful results, while RS4Good research is slower but potentially more impactful. Another tradeoff is between generalizability and domain specificity - highly specialized systems may be more effective but harder to scale.
- Failure signatures: RS4Good research will fail if it relies too heavily on offline metrics, lacks genuine interdisciplinary collaboration, attempts to apply generic solutions to domain-specific problems, or cannot demonstrate meaningful impact over sufficient timeframes.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Conduct a comparative study between offline accuracy metrics and user satisfaction metrics in an existing RS4Good domain (e.g., educational recommendations) to demonstrate the offline-online gap
  2. Design a simple interdisciplinary research framework for a specific RS4Good domain and test its effectiveness compared to single-discipline approaches
  3. Implement a prototype RS4Good system with built-in longitudinal tracking to measure impact over time, comparing results with traditional evaluation methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific interdisciplinary collaboration frameworks have proven most effective for RS4Good research?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the need for interdisciplinary research and references general frameworks for interdisciplinary research from other fields.
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration but doesn't provide concrete examples of what has worked in practice for RS4Good specifically.
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies or systematic comparisons of interdisciplinary RS4Good projects showing which collaboration models yielded the best outcomes.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we effectively measure the long-term societal impact of RS4Good systems beyond immediate user satisfaction?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper emphasizes the need for longitudinal evaluation approaches to assess the effects of recommendations over time.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the challenge but doesn't propose specific metrics or methodologies for measuring societal-level impact.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of longitudinal impact assessment frameworks that track both individual and societal outcomes over extended periods.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What balance of algorithmic sophistication versus simplicity yields optimal results for RS4Good applications?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper criticizes the current focus on increasingly complex algorithms with limited real-world impact and suggests RS4Good may require different approaches.
- Why unresolved: The paper advocates for methodological shifts but doesn't address whether complex deep learning approaches are appropriate for RS4Good use cases.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of simple versus complex RS4Good systems across different application domains measuring both effectiveness and practical deployment success.

## Limitations

- The paper lacks concrete metrics for measuring "societal impact" and how to quantify success in RS4Good domains
- Limited evidence is provided on how to effectively integrate domain expertise into RS research beyond general recommendations
- Doesn't address potential conflicts between different societal goals (e.g., privacy vs. personalization in healthcare recommendations)

## Confidence

- Mechanism 1: Medium-High - Supported by Netflix Prize example but limited corpus evidence
- Mechanism 2: Medium-Low - General principles stated but little practical implementation evidence
- Mechanism 3: Medium-Low - Cultural critique reasonable but lacks empirical validation

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a comparative analysis of offline vs. online performance across multiple RS4Good domains to quantify the evaluation gap
2. Design and test a standardized interdisciplinary collaboration framework with measurable outcomes
3. Develop and validate impact metrics specific to different RS4Good domains (health, education, sustainability)
