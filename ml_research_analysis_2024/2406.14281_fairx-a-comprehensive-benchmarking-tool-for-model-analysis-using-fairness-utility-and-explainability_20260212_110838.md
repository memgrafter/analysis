# FairX: A comprehensive benchmarking tool for model analysis using fairness, utility, and explainability

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.14281
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14281
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: FairX is an open-source Python tool for fairness benchmarking in AI, integrating fairness, utility, and explainability, with support for tabular and image datasets.

## Executive Summary
FairX is an open-source Python tool designed to address the gap in evaluating synthetic data from fair generative models by providing a comprehensive benchmarking framework. It integrates fairness, utility, and explainability metrics within a unified framework, supporting pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing bias mitigation techniques. FairX includes fair generative models like TabFairGAN, Decaf, and FairDisco, and evaluates synthetic data quality using metrics such as α-precision, β-recall, and authenticity. The tool is applicable to both tabular and image datasets and allows for custom dataset inputs.

## Method Summary
FairX employs a modular architecture with separate components for data loading, bias mitigation, evaluation, and explainability. It uses BaseDataClass and CustomDataClass for dataset handling, supports pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing techniques, and includes evaluation metrics for fairness, data utility, and synthetic data quality. The tool integrates fair generative models to produce synthetic data and provides feature importance analysis and visualization capabilities.

## Key Results
- TabFairGAN performs best in synthetic data quality with high α-precision and β-recall scores.
- FairDisco excels in fairness and utility metrics.
- Feature importance analysis shows synthetic data reduces bias toward sensitive attributes.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: FairX integrates fairness, utility, and explainability in a unified framework, enabling comprehensive evaluation of bias-mitigation models.
- Mechanism: By combining pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing techniques with evaluation metrics for fairness (DPR, EOR), data utility (AUC, F1-score), and synthetic data quality (α-precision, β-recall, authenticity), FairX provides a holistic assessment of model performance.
- Core assumption: Users require a single tool to evaluate multiple aspects of model fairness and utility, including synthetic data quality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "FairX enables users to train benchmarking bias-mitigation models and evaluate their fairness using a wide array of fairness metrics, data utility metrics, and generate explanations for model predictions, all within a unified framework."
  - [section 3.3]: "In FairX, we aim to evaluate the performance of model or dataset using wide range of evaluation metrics. We evaluate in terms of fairness, data utility. Other existing fairness benchmarking tools, lacks the capability to measure the data quality of the synthetic data."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; corpus neighbors focus on fairness and explainability intersections but do not explicitly mention unified frameworks.
- Break condition: If the integration of multiple evaluation metrics leads to conflicting results or if the framework becomes too complex for users to interpret.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: FairX supports both tabular and image datasets, as well as custom datasets, enhancing its applicability across different data types.
- Mechanism: By providing a BaseDataClass for pre-loaded datasets and a CustomDataClass for user-provided datasets, FairX allows users to apply bias-mitigation techniques and evaluation metrics to a wide range of data formats.
- Core assumption: Users have diverse data types and need a flexible tool to handle different formats.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "This version of FairX supports both tabular and image datasets. It also allows users to provide their own custom datasets."
  - [section 3.1]: "FairX supports both tabular and image data and can plot feature importance for down-streaming task using explainable algorithms."
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence; corpus neighbors do not mention dataset flexibility.
- Break condition: If the tool fails to properly preprocess or handle certain data formats, leading to inaccurate evaluations.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: FairX includes fair generative models (TabFairGAN, Decaf, FairDisco) to generate synthetic fair data, addressing the gap in existing benchmarking tools.
- Mechanism: By integrating in-processing techniques based on generative models, FairX can produce synthetic data that adheres to fairness constraints, allowing for evaluation of both the generative models and the quality of the generated data.
- Core assumption: Synthetic data can be used to augment underrepresented groups and improve model fairness.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Existing benchmarking tools do not have the way to evaluate synthetic data generated from fair generative models, also they do not have the support for training fair generative models either. In FairX, we add fair generative models in the collection of our fair-model library (pre-processing, in-processing, post-processing) and evaluation metrics for evaluating the quality of synthetic fair data."
  - [section 3.2]: "Most recent in-processing bias mitigation techniques are based on generative models. And the fairness benchmarking tools we mentioned in this work does not contain these models. One of our contribution of FairX is that, we add several fair generative models, such as, TabFairGAN, Decaf and Fairdisco."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; corpus neighbors focus on fair latent space and synthetic data generation but do not explicitly mention generative models in benchmarking tools.
- Break condition: If the generative models fail to produce high-quality synthetic data or if the evaluation metrics for synthetic data are insufficient.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Bias mitigation techniques (pre-processing, in-processing, post-processing)
  - Why needed here: Understanding the different approaches to mitigating bias is crucial for using FairX effectively and interpreting its results.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing bias mitigation techniques?

- Concept: Fairness metrics (Demographic Parity Ratio, Equalized Odds Ratio, Fairness through Unawareness)
  - Why needed here: These metrics are used to evaluate the fairness of models and datasets in FairX.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between Demographic Parity Ratio and Equalized Odds Ratio?

- Concept: Synthetic data evaluation metrics (α-precision, β-recall, authenticity)
  - Why needed here: These metrics are used to assess the quality of synthetic data generated by fair generative models in FairX.
  - Quick check question: How do α-precision and β-recall differ in evaluating synthetic data quality?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data Loading Module: BaseDataClass, CustomDataClass
  - Bias-mitigating Techniques Module: Pre-processing (Correlation Remover), In-processing (TabFairGAN, Decaf, FairDisco), Post-processing (Threshold Optimizer)
  - Evaluation Module: FairnessUtils, DataUtilsMetrics, SyntheticEvaluation
  - Explainability Module: ExplainUtils
  - Plotting Module: Plotting utilities for fairness-accuracy trade-offs, feature importance, PCA, and t-SNE

- Critical path:
  1. Load dataset (BaseDataClass or CustomDataClass)
  2. Preprocess data
  3. Apply bias-mitigation technique
  4. Evaluate fairness, data utility, and synthetic data quality (if applicable)
  5. Generate explanations and plots

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Flexibility vs. Complexity: FairX supports multiple data types and bias-mitigation techniques, which may increase complexity for users.
  - Comprehensiveness vs. Performance: Including a wide range of evaluation metrics may impact the tool's performance.

- Failure signatures:
  - Inaccurate preprocessing leading to incorrect model evaluations
  - Poor performance of bias-mitigation techniques
  - Inconsistent results between fairness, data utility, and synthetic data quality metrics

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Load a pre-loaded dataset (e.g., Adult-Income) and apply a pre-processing technique (e.g., Correlation Remover) to observe its effect on fairness metrics.
  2. Use a fair generative model (e.g., TabFairGAN) to generate synthetic data and evaluate its quality using α-precision, β-recall, and authenticity metrics.
  3. Apply an in-processing technique (e.g., FairDisco) and compare its fairness and data utility performance against a baseline model.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How does FairX handle the trade-off between fairness, utility, and explainability when these objectives conflict?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses FairX's comprehensive approach to fairness, utility, and explainability but does not explicitly address how it resolves conflicts between these objectives.
  - Why unresolved: The paper focuses on presenting FairX's capabilities without detailing the methodology for balancing competing objectives.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Implementation details or examples showing how FairX prioritizes or balances fairness, utility, and explainability in conflicting scenarios.

- Question: What are the limitations of FairX in handling datasets with multiple sensitive attributes and their intersectional biases?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] While FairX mentions intersectional bias analysis, it does not discuss limitations or challenges in handling multiple sensitive attributes.
  - Why unresolved: The paper provides a high-level overview without delving into specific challenges or limitations of multi-attribute bias handling.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis or case studies demonstrating FairX's performance with datasets containing multiple sensitive attributes and intersectional biases.

- Question: How does FairX ensure the scalability and efficiency of its benchmarking tool when dealing with large-scale datasets?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper does not address scalability or efficiency concerns when applying FairX to large datasets.
  - Why unresolved: The focus is on FairX's features and capabilities, without discussing performance metrics or scalability considerations.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Performance benchmarks or efficiency tests showing FairX's scalability with increasing dataset sizes and complexity.

## Limitations
- Lack of detailed implementation specifications for reproducibility, particularly for hyperparameters and evaluation metrics.
- Unclear methodology for resolving conflicts between fairness, utility, and explainability objectives.
- No explicit discussion of limitations in handling datasets with multiple sensitive attributes and intersectional biases.

## Confidence
- Confidence in the core functionality claims is Medium, as the framework is well-defined but lacks complete implementation details for full replication.
- The tool's architecture and component separation are well-explained, but the effectiveness of synthetic data generation and evaluation remains to be independently verified.

## Next Checks
1. Implement and run FairX on a new dataset not used in the original evaluation to test generalization.
2. Compare FairX's synthetic data quality metrics (α-precision, β-recall) against established synthetic data benchmarks.
3. Conduct a user study to assess the tool's usability and interpretability for practitioners with varying levels of ML expertise.
