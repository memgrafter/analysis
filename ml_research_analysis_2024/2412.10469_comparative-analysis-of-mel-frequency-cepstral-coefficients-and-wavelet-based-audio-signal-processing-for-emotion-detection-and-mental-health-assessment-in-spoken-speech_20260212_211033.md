# Comparative Analysis of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients and Wavelet Based Audio Signal Processing for Emotion Detection and Mental Health Assessment in Spoken Speech

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.10469
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10469
- Reference count: 18
- CNN model achieved 61% accuracy for emotion detection from speech

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for emotion detection from spoken speech using wavelet-extracted features and Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). The CNN model achieved a best-reported accuracy of 61%, outperforming the LSTM model's accuracy of 56%. Both models performed better in classifying specific emotions like surprise and anger. The results suggest that combining advanced data augmentation techniques, diverse feature extraction methods, and integrating linguistic analysis with speech characteristics could further improve accuracy.

## Method Summary
The study used four datasets (Crema-D, Ravdess, Savee, Tess) containing audio recordings labeled for emotional states. MFCC and wavelet features were extracted from the audio data, followed by data augmentation techniques including noise injection, time stretching, and pitch modulation. CNN and LSTM models were implemented and trained on these features using categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer. The CNN architecture consisted of Conv1D layers with 256, 256, 128, and 64 filters, MaxPooling, Dropout, and Dense layers.

## Key Results
- CNN model achieved 61% accuracy, outperforming LSTM's 56% accuracy
- Both models showed better performance in classifying surprise and anger emotions
- Data augmentation techniques (noise injection, stretching, pitch variations) were implemented to improve model robustness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Wavelet and MFCC features provide complementary time-frequency representations that help CNN and LSTM models capture distinct emotional cues in speech
- Wavelets offer multi-resolution time-frequency decomposition, preserving both transient and sustained spectral patterns, while MFCCs model the spectral envelope with perceptually relevant frequency warping
- Core assumption: Emotional states in speech manifest as measurable variations in both temporal and spectral characteristics
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] mentions both feature types; [section] notes better performance on specific emotions using distinct audio features
- Break condition: If emotional cues are primarily captured by one feature type, adding the other may not improve accuracy

### Mechanism 2
- CNN models are better suited than LSTM models for extracting local spectral patterns from MFCC and wavelet features
- CNNs use convolutional filters to learn local spatial hierarchies in the frequency domain, which aligns well with the structure of MFCC and wavelet features
- Core assumption: Emotional speech cues are predominantly local in the spectral domain rather than long-term sequential patterns
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] shows CNN outperformed LSTM; [section] notes insignificant differences with other models
- Break condition: If long-term temporal dependencies in emotional speech are more important than local spectral cues, LSTMs may outperform CNNs

### Mechanism 3
- Data augmentation improves model robustness and generalization for emotion detection in speech
- Controlled perturbations simulate real-world variability in speech recordings, forcing models to learn invariant features rather than memorizing training data
- Core assumption: Emotional cues in speech are invariant to noise, time stretching, and pitch variations
- Evidence anchors: [section] recommends augmentation for better generalization
- Break condition: If emotional cues are highly sensitive to these perturbations, augmentation may degrade performance

## Foundational Learning

- **Time-frequency analysis and wavelet transforms**
  - Why needed: Wavelets decompose signals into multiple frequency bands with time localization, crucial for capturing transient emotional cues in speech
  - Quick check: What is the key advantage of wavelets over Fourier transforms for analyzing non-stationary signals like speech?

- **Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)**
  - Why needed: MFCCs model the spectral envelope in a perceptually relevant way, closely matching human auditory perception and capturing emotional cues
  - Quick check: Why do MFCCs use a Mel scale instead of a linear frequency scale?

- **Convolutional Neural Networks for 1D signal processing**
  - Why needed: CNNs extract local spatial patterns from frequency-domain features, making them well-suited for analyzing structured audio representations
  - Quick check: How do convolutional filters in a CNN learn to detect patterns in 1D audio feature sequences?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data loading → Augmentation (noise, stretching, pitch) → Feature extraction (MFCC + wavelet) → Normalization → Train/test split → Model (CNN/LSTM) → Evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)
- **Critical path**: Data augmentation → Feature extraction → Model training → Evaluation metrics
- **Design tradeoffs**: 
  - CNN vs LSTM: CNNs are faster and better for local spectral patterns; LSTMs handle longer temporal dependencies but are computationally heavier
  - Feature selection: MFCCs are standard and efficient; wavelets add complexity but capture different information
  - Augmentation intensity: More augmentation improves robustness but may distort emotional cues
- **Failure signatures**: 
  - Low accuracy with high variance: Likely overfitting or insufficient data augmentation
  - CNN outperforms LSTM: Emotional cues are more spectral than sequential
  - Both models struggle on specific emotions: Feature extraction may not capture those emotion-specific patterns
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Train CNN and LSTM models using only MFCC features to establish baseline performance
  2. Add wavelet features to the MFCC baseline and compare accuracy improvements
  3. Apply different augmentation strategies (noise only, pitch only, all three) and measure impact on generalization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- How do different noise levels in data augmentation affect the CNN and LSTM models' ability to generalize to real-world noisy environments for emotion detection?
- Basis: The paper mentions noise injection but doesn't explore varying noise levels or their effects on model performance in noisy environments
- Why unresolved: The study only applied basic noise injection without investigating the impact of different noise intensities or types on model robustness
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying noise levels (SNR ranges) during training and testing, measuring accuracy drops in different noise conditions

### Open Question 2
- What is the optimal combination of feature extraction methods (MFCCs, wavelets, and linguistic features) for improving emotion detection accuracy, particularly for anxiety and depression?
- Basis: The paper recommends exploring combined feature extraction methods and integrating linguistic analysis with speech characteristics
- Why unresolved: The study used MFCCs and wavelet features separately but did not test combinations or integrate linguistic features like word choice and sentiment analysis
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments testing various combinations of MFCCs, wavelet features, and linguistic features, measuring accuracy improvements for specific emotions

### Open Question 3
- How do different model architectures and hyperparameters affect the performance of CNN and LSTM models for emotion detection from speech, and what is the computational cost-benefit trade-off?
- Basis: The paper notes that computational cost increased significantly with epoch changes (30-50) with minimal accuracy gains
- Why unresolved: The study used a fixed CNN architecture and did not explore alternative architectures, hyperparameter tuning, or analyze the computational cost-benefit trade-off in detail
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing various CNN and LSTM architectures, hyperparameter optimization, and detailed analysis of accuracy gains versus computational costs

## Limitations
- 61% accuracy for CNN and 56% for LSTM models indicate significant room for improvement in emotion detection from speech
- Lack of direct corpus evidence for key mechanisms (feature complementarity, CNN vs LSTM performance, augmentation impact) limits confidence in proposed explanations
- Absence of linguistic feature integration and standardized dataset sharing practices represents broader limitations for advancing this research area

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The comparative accuracy results between CNN (61%) and LSTM (56%) models
- **Medium Confidence**: The suggestion that CNNs are better suited for spectral feature extraction based on observed performance differences
- **Low Confidence**: The specific mechanisms explaining why wavelet and MFCC features together improve performance, due to lack of direct evidence

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies systematically removing either MFCC or wavelet features to quantify their individual contributions to accuracy
2. Implement controlled experiments varying augmentation intensity and types to measure their direct impact on model generalization and robustness
3. Compare CNN and LSTM performance on sequential vs spectral feature representations to determine whether temporal or frequency domain processing is more critical for emotion detection
