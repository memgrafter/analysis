## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ICQ, a new benchmark for localizing events in videos using multimodal queries (MQs) that combine images and text. Unlike existing approaches that rely solely on natural language queries, ICQ evaluates how well models can localize video events when given a reference image and refinement text. The authors propose three adaptation methods—Captioning, Summarization, and Visual Query Encoding—to adapt existing video localization models to this new setting. They also create ICQ-Highlight, an evaluation dataset with 4 image styles (scribble, cartoon, cinematic, realistic) and 5 refinement text types.

Experiments with 10 state-of-the-art models show that captioning-based adaptation achieves the best performance, with newer models like UVCOM and TR-DETR performing strongest. The results demonstrate that multimodal queries are practical and effective for video event localization, achieving recall scores of 50-55% across different image styles when using the best adaptation methods. The study reveals that specialized models consistently outperform LLM-based models, and that model performance varies significantly across different reference image styles and refinement text types.

## Method Summary
The authors create ICQ by generating reference images using DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion based on natural language queries from the QVHighlight dataset. They create 4 image styles (scribble, cartoon, cinematic, realistic) and 5 refinement text types that add complementary or corrective information to the original captions. Three adaptation methods are proposed: Captioning (using MLLM to caption images and LLM to integrate refinement texts), Summarization (using MLLM to directly summarize multimodal queries), and Visual Query Encoding (using CLIP visual encoder to encode reference images). These methods are applied to 10 SOTA video localization models in a zero-shot manner, evaluating performance using Recall and mAP metrics.

## Key Results
- Captioning adaptation method achieves the best performance across all models and image styles
- Newer video localization models (UVCOM, TR-DETR) show stronger performance than older specialized models
- Models achieve 50-55% recall scores across different image styles when using the best adaptation methods
- High Spearman rank correlation (0.89-0.98) between ICQ and QVHighlight performance indicates semantic consistency

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The Captioning (CAP) adaptation method achieves the best performance because it leverages the complementary strengths of MLLMs for image captioning and LLMs for text refinement.
- Mechanism: CAP first uses an MLLM (LLaVA-mistral) to generate a detailed caption from the reference image, capturing the visual semantics. Then it uses an LLM (GPT-3.5) to modify this caption by integrating the refinement text, ensuring the final query accurately represents both visual and textual information.
- Core assumption: MLLMs can generate semantically faithful captions of reference images, and LLMs can effectively integrate refinement texts into existing captions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our results demonstrate that existing models can be effectively adapted to our new benchmark with the aid of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) despite performance decline and instability to a greater or lesser extent."
  - [section]: "For CAP and SUM, we aim to leverage the power of LLMs and MLLMs to caption reference images vref and integrate refinement texts tref : CAP uses MLLMs as a captioner to caption reference images and LLMs as a modifier to integrate refinement texts."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence for MLLM+LLM combination effectiveness in video event localization.
- Break condition: If the MLLM generates captions that are semantically misaligned with the reference image, or if the LLM fails to properly integrate the refinement text, CAP performance will degrade.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The performance correlation between multimodal query-based ICQ and natural language query-based QVHighlight indicates semantic consistency between the two query types.
- Mechanism: High Spearman rank correlation coefficients (0.89-0.98) between model performance on ICQ and QVHighlight suggest that the multimodal queries share common semantics with the original natural language queries.
- Core assumption: The reference images and refinement texts in ICQ encode similar semantic information as the original natural language queries in QVHighlight.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our findings reveal that multimodal semantic queries can successfully localize events in videos, suggesting multimodal queries have promising applications for video localization."
  - [section]: "For scribble, Spearman's rank correlation coefficients are 0.89(CAP) and 0.93(SUM)...The high correlation scores indicate a strong positive correlation across benchmarks, suggesting queries of both benchmarks share the common semantics and yield the reliability of our benchmark."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence for semantic consistency between multimodal and natural language queries in video event localization.
- Break condition: If the reference images and refinement texts encode substantially different semantic information than the original queries, the correlation would break down.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The proposed adaptation methods (CAP, SUM, VISENC) effectively bridge the gap between existing natural language query-based models and the new multimodal query setting.
- Mechanism: By converting multimodal queries into a format compatible with existing models (either text captions or visual embeddings), the adaptation methods enable zero-shot evaluation of these models on ICQ.
- Core assumption: Existing video localization models can process the adapted multimodal queries (text captions or visual embeddings) effectively enough to localize events.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We propose 3 Multimodal Query Adaptation methods and a novel Surrogate Fine-tuning on pseudo-MQs strategy."
  - [section]: "To bridge the gap between current natural language query-based models and multimodal queries, we propose 3 adaptation methods: Captioning, Summarization, and Visual Query Encoding."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence for the effectiveness of these specific adaptation methods in bridging the natural language to multimodal query gap.
- Break condition: If the adapted queries (text captions or visual embeddings) fail to capture the essential semantic information needed for accurate event localization, the adaptation methods will not work effectively.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Text-to-Image Generation
  - Why needed here: Reference images are generated using Text-to-Image models (DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion XL) based on natural language queries and refinement texts.
  - Quick check question: What are the key challenges in generating reference images that accurately represent the target event semantics?

- Concept: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
  - Why needed here: MLLMs (like LLaVA-mistral) are used for captioning reference images and summarizing multimodal queries.
  - Quick check question: How do MLLMs differ from traditional LLMs in their ability to process visual information?

- Concept: Video Event Localization Metrics
  - Why needed here: Evaluation metrics like Recall (R@1@0.5, R@1@0.7) and mean Average Precision (mAP) are used to assess model performance on ICQ.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between Recall and mAP in evaluating video event localization?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Reference Image Generation: Text-to-Image models (DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion XL)
  - Multimodal Query Adaptation: Captioning (MLLM + LLM), Summarization (MLLM), Visual Query Encoding (CLIP Visual Encoder)
  - Video Localization Models: Specialized models (Moment-DETR, QD-DETR, etc.), Unified frameworks (UMT, UniVTG, UVCOM), LLM-based models (SeViLA)
  - Evaluation: ICQ-Highlight dataset, Recall metrics, mAP metrics

- Critical path:
  1. Generate reference images from natural language queries and refinement texts
  2. Apply one of the three adaptation methods to convert multimodal queries into a compatible format
  3. Feed adapted queries into existing video localization models
  4. Evaluate model performance using ICQ-Highlight and standard metrics

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using generated reference images vs. real user-provided images
  - Relying on MLLMs and LLMs for query adaptation vs. training specialized models for multimodal queries
  - Evaluating zero-shot performance vs. fine-tuning models on multimodal query data

- Failure signatures:
  - Low performance correlation between ICQ and QVHighlight
  - High variance in model performance across different reference image styles or refinement text types
  - Significant performance drop when using only reference images without refinement texts

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate model performance on ICQ using the Captioning adaptation method with different prompts
  2. Compare model performance on ICQ vs. QVHighlight to assess semantic consistency
  3. Analyze model performance across different reference image styles and refinement text types

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different prompt formulations in captioning methods affect the performance of models across various reference image styles?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that models are sensitive to prompt formulations in SUM, with prompt 1 consistently outperforming prompts 2 and 3 across all metrics.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of why certain prompts perform better than others or how prompt formulations interact with different image styles.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting an ablation study comparing different prompt formulations across all reference image styles and analyzing the semantic differences in generated captions could provide insights.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of model architecture (e.g., specialized vs. LLM-based models) on the ability to handle multimodal queries with varying levels of abstraction in reference images?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that specialized models consistently outperform LLM-based models, and that model performance varies across different reference image styles.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of why specialized models perform better or how different model architectures handle varying levels of abstraction in reference images.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments comparing different model architectures on datasets with varying levels of abstraction in reference images and analyzing the attention mechanisms could provide insights.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the presence of refinement texts affect model performance across different reference image styles, and what types of refinement texts are most effective?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows that models have different performance drops when refinement texts are removed, with scribble images showing less pronounced drops compared to other styles.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of why refinement texts are more effective for certain image styles or what types of refinement texts are most effective.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments comparing model performance with different types of refinement texts across all reference image styles and analyzing the semantic impact of refinement texts could provide insights.

## Limitations
- Reliance on generated reference images rather than real user-provided images may limit practical applicability
- Adaptation methods depend heavily on the performance of MLLMs and LLMs, which may not generalize well to all types of reference images
- Benchmark only evaluates zero-shot performance without fine-tuning, which may not reflect real-world deployment scenarios

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The proposed adaptation methods effectively enable existing models to process multimodal queries
- **Medium Confidence**: Multimodal queries share semantic consistency with natural language queries
- **Medium Confidence**: Newer video localization models (UVCOM, TR-DETR) show stronger performance

## Next Checks
1. Test the adaptation methods with real user-provided reference images to assess practical viability
2. Evaluate the robustness of the adaptation methods across diverse video domains and event types
3. Compare zero-shot performance with fine-tuned models on multimodal query data to establish performance bounds
