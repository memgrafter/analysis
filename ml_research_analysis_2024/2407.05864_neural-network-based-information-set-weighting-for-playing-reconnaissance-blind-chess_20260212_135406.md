# Neural Network-based Information Set Weighting for Playing Reconnaissance Blind Chess

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.05864
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05864
- Reference count: 40
- Siamese neural network achieves 52.91% top-1 accuracy for state likelihood estimation in RBC

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a neural network-based method to improve decision-making in imperfect information games by estimating the likelihood of each possible game state in an information set. The authors propose using Siamese neural networks to learn a function that maps observation histories to probability distributions over game states. Their method is evaluated in the domain of Reconnaissance Blind Chess, where players lack full information about their opponent's pieces. The Siamese network approach achieves higher accuracy (52.91% top-1 accuracy) compared to a conventional CNN baseline (48.82%) and other baselines like Stockfish and StrangeFish2. The learned weightings are integrated into an RBC-playing agent that uses Stockfish evaluations weighted by the network's probabilities. The resulting agent, with optimal temperature parameter settings, achieves 5th place on the public RBC leaderboard, demonstrating the practical utility of the approach for improving imperfect information gameplay through state likelihood estimation.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a neural network-based method for estimating the likelihood of each game state within an information set in imperfect information games. The core innovation is using Siamese neural networks to learn a mapping from observation histories to probability distributions over possible game states. The Siamese architecture processes two observation histories simultaneously and outputs a scalar representing their similarity, which is then used to construct a probability distribution over the entire information set. This distribution is combined with Stockfish evaluations through a temperature-scaled softmax to produce weighted evaluations for decision-making. The model is trained on observation histories and corresponding possible states, with the objective of correctly identifying which states are more likely given the observations. The temperature parameter allows control over how peaked or flat the probability distribution is, with lower temperatures making the distribution more peaked around the most likely states.

## Key Results
- Siamese network achieves 52.91% top-1 accuracy for state likelihood estimation, outperforming CNN baseline at 48.82%
- The RBC-playing agent with learned weightings achieves 5th place on the public RBC leaderboard
- Temperature parameter optimization shows 0.6 as the optimal value for balancing exploration and exploitation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging the Siamese architecture's ability to compare observation histories and learn similarity metrics between them. In imperfect information games, players must reason about multiple possible game states consistent with their observations. By training a network to estimate the likelihood of each state given the observation history, the method provides a principled way to weight different possible worlds when making decisions. The temperature scaling allows fine-tuning of how deterministic or exploratory the agent's behavior should be, with lower temperatures focusing on the most likely states and higher temperatures allowing more uniform exploration of possibilities.

## Foundational Learning
**Imperfect Information Games**: Games where players lack complete information about the game state, such as card games or hidden information variants of chess. *Why needed*: RBC is an imperfect information game, and the method specifically addresses this challenge. *Quick check*: Verify that the game involves hidden information that creates uncertainty about the true game state.

**Information Sets**: Collections of game states that are indistinguishable to a player given their observations. *Why needed*: The method operates on information sets, assigning probabilities to each possible state within them. *Quick check*: Confirm that the information set contains all states consistent with the player's observations.

**Siamese Networks**: Neural network architectures that process two inputs simultaneously and learn similarity metrics between them. *Why needed*: The Siamese architecture is used to compare observation histories and learn which states are more likely. *Quick check*: Verify that the network outputs a scalar similarity measure for input pairs.

**Stockfish Integration**: Using a perfect-information chess engine as a component for evaluating game positions. *Why needed*: The method combines learned state likelihoods with Stockfish evaluations to make decisions. *Quick check*: Confirm that Stockfish provides evaluations for each possible state in the information set.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Observation History -> Siamese Network -> Similarity Matrix -> Softmax(Temperature) -> Weighted Stockfish Evaluations -> Decision

**Critical Path**: The core computation path is: observation history pairs are fed through the Siamese network to generate similarity scores, which are converted to probabilities via temperature-scaled softmax, then combined with Stockfish evaluations to produce the final decision scores.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The Siamese architecture trades increased model complexity and training data requirements for the ability to learn rich similarity metrics between observation histories. The temperature parameter provides a tunable knob between exploitation (low temperature) and exploration (high temperature), but requires careful optimization for each domain.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance may manifest as: (1) inability to distinguish between similar observation histories if the Siamese network fails to learn useful features, (2) over-confidence or under-confidence in state probabilities if the temperature parameter is mis-set, or (3) poor decision quality if the weighted combination with Stockfish evaluations is suboptimal.

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify the Siamese network can correctly rank pairs of observation histories by similarity on a held-out validation set
2. Test different temperature values (0.1, 0.6, 1.0, 2.0) to observe their impact on the entropy of the probability distribution
3. Compare the weighted evaluation scores against unweighted Stockfish scores for a set of test positions to confirm the weighting is having the intended effect

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Evaluation is confined to a single imperfect-information game domain, Reconnaissance Blind Chess, which limits generalizability claims
- The approach depends on having a perfect-information solver (Stockfish) as a component, which may not be available for many imperfect-information games
- The paper does not address computational efficiency or runtime considerations, which could be significant given the complex architecture

## Confidence
**High confidence**: Technical implementation and experimental results within the RBC domain are well-supported with clear methodology and leaderboard validation
**Medium confidence**: Generalizability of the approach to other imperfect-information games, due to limited domain testing
**Low confidence**: Novelty claim about Siamese networks for this specific application without broader literature review

## Next Checks
1. Test the Siamese network approach on at least two additional imperfect-information game domains (such as Poker or Scotland Yard) to assess generalizability beyond RBC
2. Conduct ablation studies to determine the individual contributions of the Siamese architecture versus other components (temperature scaling, Stockfish integration) to the performance gains
3. Measure and report the computational overhead introduced by the Siamese network weighting system, including inference time per decision and memory requirements, to evaluate practical deployment feasibility
