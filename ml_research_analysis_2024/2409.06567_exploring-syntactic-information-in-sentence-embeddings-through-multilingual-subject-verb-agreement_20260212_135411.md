# Exploring syntactic information in sentence embeddings through multilingual subject-verb agreement

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.06567
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06567
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Syntactic information in multilingual models is encoded through language-specific surface features rather than shared abstract structures

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether multilingual pretrained language models encode cross-linguistically shared abstract syntactic representations. Using synthetic datasets with parallel sentence structures across English, French, Italian, and Romanian, the authors test subject-verb agreement using a two-level VAE architecture. The results show poor cross-lingual transfer even between closely related languages, and multilingual training degrades performance, indicating that syntactic information is encoded through language-specific, surface-level features rather than shared abstract structures.

## Method Summary
The authors use a two-level VAE architecture to probe syntactic information in sentence embeddings. First, a sentence-level VAE compresses Electra sentence embeddings to capture chunk structure and properties. Second, a task-level VAE uses these compressed representations to detect patterns across sequences of sentences for subject-verb agreement. Experiments are conducted on synthetic Blackbird Language Matrices (BLMs) datasets in four languages, testing both cross-lingual transfer (training on one language, testing on others) and multilingual training performance (training on all languages together).

## Key Results
- Poor cross-lingual transfer in syntactic agreement tasks even between closely related languages
- Multilingual training degrades performance compared to monolingual training
- Syntactic information appears encoded through language-specific surface features rather than shared abstract structures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Syntactic information is encoded through language-specific, surface-level features rather than shared abstract structures.
- Mechanism: The multilingual pretrained models learn to map syntactic patterns to language-specific surface cues (like inflections, function words, or morphological markers) during pretraining. These surface cues differ across languages, preventing cross-linguistic transfer.
- Core assumption: The models rely on shallow, detectable patterns during pretraining rather than abstracting away to universal syntactic representations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "multilingual pretrained language models have language-specific differences, and syntactic structure is not shared, even across closely related languages."
  - [section 2] "French and Italian use number-specific determiners and inflections, while Romanian and English encode grammatical number exclusively through inflections."
  - [corpus] Weak: The corpus shows related work on syntactic probing but lacks direct evidence for surface-level feature encoding.
- Break condition: If the models were able to abstract away from surface features to learn universal syntactic rules, cross-lingual transfer would be observed.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The two-level VAE architecture successfully separates syntactic object detection from pattern recognition across sequences.
- Mechanism: The sentence-level VAE compresses sentence embeddings to capture chunk structure and properties. The task-level VAE then uses these compressed representations to detect patterns in the sequence of sentences. This separation allows for targeted probing of syntactic encoding.
- Core assumption: The VAE architecture can effectively distill relevant syntactic information from sentence embeddings without losing critical structural details.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1] "A two-level system...solves the BLM task in two steps: detect syntactic objects and their properties in individual sentences, and find patterns across an input sequence of sentences."
  - [section 4] "Figure 4 shows the tSNE projection of the latent representations of the sentences...Each language seems to have its own quite separate pattern clusters."
  - [corpus] Weak: The corpus includes related work on VAE probing but lacks specific evidence for this two-level architecture's effectiveness.
- Break condition: If the VAE architecture fails to separate object detection from pattern recognition, the probing results would be confounded.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Parallel datasets with shared syntactic structures but language-specific encoding differences enable effective cross-linguistic comparison.
- Mechanism: By constructing datasets in four languages with the same underlying syntactic structures but different surface encodings, the experiments can isolate whether syntactic information is encoded abstractly or through language-specific features.
- Core assumption: The parallel nature of the datasets ensures that any transfer failures are due to encoding differences rather than structural differences.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2] "The datasets all share sentences with the same syntactic structures...However, there are language specific differences, as in the structure of the chunks."
  - [section 4] "Figure 3 shows the results for the experiments on detecting chunk structure...there is very little transfer effect."
  - [corpus] Weak: The corpus includes related work on multilingual probing but lacks specific evidence for the effectiveness of parallel dataset construction.
- Break condition: If the datasets are not truly parallel or if there are hidden structural differences, the comparison would be invalid.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Subject-verb agreement
  - Why needed here: Subject-verb agreement is the specific syntactic phenomenon being tested. Understanding its complexity and the information required to solve it is crucial for interpreting the probing results.
  - Quick check question: What information is needed to determine if a verb agrees with its subject across intervening phrases?

- Concept: Transformer-based language models
  - Why needed here: The experiments use Electra, a transformer-based model. Understanding how transformers process information through layers and self-attention is essential for interpreting how syntactic information is encoded.
  - Quick check question: How does the transformer architecture transform input information through its layers?

- Concept: Cross-linguistic transfer
  - Why needed here: The experiments test whether syntactic information learned in one language can be applied to others. Understanding the factors that enable or prevent transfer is crucial for interpreting the results.
  - Quick check question: What factors typically enable or prevent successful cross-linguistic transfer in language models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input sentence -> Electra embedding layer -> Sentence-level VAE (encoder/decoder) -> Task-level VAE (encoder/decoder) -> Final prediction
- Critical path: The critical path is from the input sentence through Electra's embedding layer, through the sentence-level VAE's encoder and decoder, through the task-level VAE's encoder and decoder, to the final prediction.
- Design tradeoffs: The choice of a two-level VAE architecture separates object detection from pattern recognition but adds complexity. The use of Electra provides rich embeddings but ties the system to a specific model.
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on the sentence-level VAE indicates that Electra's embeddings don't contain sufficient syntactic information. Poor cross-lingual transfer indicates that the encoding is language-specific rather than abstract.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train and test the sentence-level VAE on the same language to verify that Electra embeddings contain syntactic information.
  2. Train the sentence-level VAE on one language and test on another to test for cross-linguistic transfer.
  3. Train the full two-level VAE on one language and test on another to see if the task-level supervision helps with transfer.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Do transformer-based language models encode abstract syntactic structures, or do they rely on surface-level, language-specific features?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly state this as their central research question, investigating whether multilingual pretrained models capture cross-linguistically valid abstract linguistic representations or rely on language-specific, surface-level features.
- Why unresolved: The experiments show poor cross-lingual transfer and multilingual training degradation, suggesting surface-level encoding, but this does not definitively rule out the possibility of abstract structures being encoded in ways not captured by their methodology.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic ablation studies isolating different linguistic features (e.g., morphological markers, syntactic dependencies, semantic roles) across multiple languages and model architectures, combined with interpretability techniques like attention visualization and feature importance analysis.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do specific linguistic properties (e.g., morphological richness, syntactic flexibility) influence the encoding of syntactic information in multilingual models?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper observes that French and Italian, which encode phrases and grammatical number similarly, show slightly better cross-lingual transfer than other language pairs, suggesting that linguistic similarities affect encoding.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on four languages with limited typological diversity; broader coverage of language families and deeper linguistic feature analysis is needed to generalize findings.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments with a diverse set of languages (e.g., isolating morphological richness, word order flexibility, case marking) and correlation analysis between linguistic properties and model performance on syntactic tasks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can architectural modifications or training strategies improve the learning of shared syntactic representations across languages in multilingual models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that multilingual training degrades performance, indicating that the current architecture and training approach fail to find a shared parameter space for syntactic information.
- Why unresolved: The study uses a standard Electra model with fixed architecture; exploring alternative architectures (e.g., language-agnostic subnetworks) or training strategies (e.g., cross-lingual data augmentation, syntax-aware pretraining) could yield different results.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments with modified architectures (e.g., shared syntax encoders, language-specific adapters) and training strategies (e.g., syntax-aware objectives, cross-lingual alignment) to measure improvements in cross-lingual syntactic transfer.

## Limitations

- The findings are based on synthetic datasets with controlled syntactic structures, limiting generalizability to naturalistic text.
- The two-level VAE probing methodology has not been validated against alternative probing architectures.
- The paper does not investigate whether fine-tuning could induce more language-agnostic syntactic representations.

## Confidence

- High confidence: The observation that multilingual training degrades performance relative to monolingual training is robust and directly supported by the experimental results.
- Medium confidence: The conclusion that syntactic information is encoded through surface-level features rather than abstract structures is well-supported within the synthetic dataset paradigm but requires validation in naturalistic settings.
- Medium confidence: The two-level VAE architecture's effectiveness in separating object detection from pattern recognition is demonstrated but not compared against simpler or alternative probing methods.

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the cross-lingual transfer experiments using naturally occurring parallel corpora (e.g., Europarl or UN documents) to test whether the language-specific encoding persists outside the synthetic domain.

2. Implement and compare the results using a single-level VAE or a gradient-based probing method to assess whether the two-level architecture is essential for detecting the claimed language-specific encoding patterns.

3. Fine-tune the multilingual models on subject-verb agreement tasks across languages to determine if the language-specific encoding can be mitigated through task-specific adaptation, thereby testing the mutability of the observed phenomenon.
