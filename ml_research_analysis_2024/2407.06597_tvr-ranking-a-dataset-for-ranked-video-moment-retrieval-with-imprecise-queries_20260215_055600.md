# TVR-Ranking: A Dataset for Ranked Video Moment Retrieval with Imprecise Queries

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.06597
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06597
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces TVR-Ranking dataset with 94,442 query-moment pairs and NDCG@K, IoU≥µ evaluation metric for ranked video moment retrieval

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the limitation of existing video moment retrieval (VCMR) datasets that assume users provide precise descriptions of specific moments. The authors introduce the Ranked Video Moment Retrieval (RVMR) task, where models must retrieve a ranked list of matching moments from a video collection based on potentially imprecise natural language queries. To support this task, they construct the TVR-Ranking dataset with relevance annotations for 94,442 query-moment pairs and develop a new evaluation metric (NDCG@K, IoU≥µ) that combines ranking quality with temporal localization accuracy. The authors adapt three baseline VCMR models to the RVMR task and demonstrate that while these models can be adapted, they don't perform as well on RVMR as on VCMR, highlighting the need for new approaches tailored to the ranking aspect of RVMR.

## Method Summary
The authors construct the TVR-Ranking dataset by collecting queries for TVR videos and generating relevance scores through manual annotation. To create imprecise queries that better reflect real-world user behavior, they substitute character names with gender-specific pronouns and neutral terms. For training, they use a pseudo-training approach where moments are ranked by query-caption similarity (sim(q, m.c)) and the top N are treated as relevant. They adapt three VCMR models (XML, CONQUER, ReLoCLNet) to RVMR by adding weight to the training loss based on query-moment similarity. The evaluation uses NDCG@K, IoU≥µ, which combines ranking quality with temporal localization accuracy by computing NDCG only for predictions with IoU ≥ µ relative to ground truth moments.

## Key Results
- TVR-Ranking dataset provides 94,442 query-moment pairs with relevance scores, addressing the need for RVMR research
- NDCG@K, IoU≥µ metric effectively combines ranking quality with temporal localization accuracy for RVMR evaluation
- Adapted VCMR models show significantly lower performance on RVMR compared to VCMR, indicating the need for RVMR-specific approaches
- Pseudo-training with query-caption similarity as proxy shows reasonable correlation with annotated relevance scores

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Character name substitution creates imprecise queries that better reflect real-world user behavior
- Mechanism: By replacing character names with gender-specific pronouns and neutral terms, queries become less tied to specific individuals and more aligned with general descriptions of actions or scenes
- Core assumption: Users searching for video moments often lack detailed knowledge of the video content and use general language to describe what they're looking for
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "users may or may not provide a precise description of a specific moment" and "imprecise queries"
  - [section 2]: "users have a deep understanding of the source video" vs. "queries in our dataset may or may not provide precise descriptions"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; corpus neighbors discuss video moment search but don't directly validate imprecise queries
- Break condition: If the substitution process introduces significant semantic drift, the queries may no longer accurately represent what users would search for

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Relevance scores combined with IoU thresholds enable effective evaluation of ranked retrieval quality
- Mechanism: NDCG@K measures ranking quality based on relevance levels, while IoU ≥ µ ensures only temporally accurate predictions contribute to the score
- Core assumption: A good model should both retrieve relevant moments and localize them accurately in time
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "develop the NDCG@K, IoU≥µ evaluation metric" and "combines ranking quality with temporal localization accuracy"
  - [section 4]: Detailed explanation of how NDCG@K, IoU≥µ works, including the matching process between predicted and ground truth moments
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence in corpus neighbors about this specific metric combination
- Break condition: If IoU threshold is set too high, no predictions may qualify, making NDCG meaningless

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Pseudo-training with query-caption similarity provides a scalable way to generate training data without manual annotation
- Mechanism: Moments are ranked by sim(q, m.c) and the top N are treated as relevant for training, approximating the manual relevance scores
- Core assumption: Query-caption similarity is a good proxy for the actual relevance between a query and a moment's visual content
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3]: "we rely on the query-caption similarity, i.e., sim(q, m.c), as a proxy to generate pseudo annotations"
  - [section B.3]: Analysis showing correlation between sim(q, m.c) and annotated relevance scores
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence in corpus neighbors about this specific training approach
- Break condition: If sim(q, m.c) poorly correlates with visual relevance, the model will learn incorrect patterns

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Intersection over Union (IoU) for temporal localization
  - Why needed here: IoU measures how well predicted moments align with ground truth moments in time, which is critical for evaluating moment retrieval accuracy
  - Quick check question: If a predicted moment [10s, 20s] overlaps with a ground truth [15s, 25s], what is the IoU? (Answer: 0.5)

- Concept: Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)
  - Why needed here: NDCG evaluates the quality of ranked lists, accounting for the position of relevant items and their relevance levels
  - Quick check question: Why does NDCG discount relevance scores by log2(position+1)? (Answer: To penalize relevant items appearing lower in the ranking)

- Concept: Contrastive learning for representation learning
  - Why needed here: Contrastive loss helps models distinguish between relevant and irrelevant moments by pulling similar items together and pushing dissimilar ones apart
  - Quick check question: In contrastive learning, what happens to the loss when positive pairs are correctly separated from negative pairs? (Answer: The loss decreases)

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Query encoder (BERT-based) → Context encoder (video+subtitle features) → Retrieval head → Localization head → Evaluation: NDCG@K, IoU≥µ metric computation pipeline

- Critical path:
  Query → Feature extraction → Similarity computation → Ranking → IoU filtering → NDCG calculation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Higher N in pseudo-training captures more relevant moments but increases noise
  - Stricter IoU thresholds ensure better localization but may be too difficult to achieve
  - Using both video and subtitle features improves accuracy but increases computational cost

- Failure signatures:
  - Low NDCG scores despite high IoU could indicate ranking problems
  - High NDCG but low IoU could indicate localization problems
  - Poor performance on both metrics suggests fundamental model issues

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Vary N in pseudo-training (1, 20, 40) to find optimal balance between coverage and noise
  2. Test different IoU thresholds (0.3, 0.5, 0.7) to understand localization requirements
  3. Compare model performance on VCMR vs RVMR tasks to identify specific weaknesses

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of RVMR models vary when applied to datasets with different characteristics (e.g., longer videos, more diverse activities, or different query types)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that existing VCMR models, which are adapted for RVMR, do not perform as well on RVMR as they do on VCMR. This suggests that RVMR may require different modeling approaches depending on the dataset characteristics
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates the models on the TVR-Ranking dataset, which is derived from TV series. There is no exploration of how these models would perform on datasets with different characteristics, such as longer videos or more diverse activities
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with RVMR models on various datasets with different characteristics (e.g., ActivityNet, Ego4D) and comparing their performance to the results on TVR-Ranking would provide insights into how dataset characteristics affect RVMR model performance

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the specific challenges in designing a model tailored specifically for the RVMR task, as opposed to adapting existing VCMR models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that although VCMR models can be adapted for RVMR, directly applying them to RVMR may not be appropriate, and designing a new model tailored specifically to RVMR is necessary
- Why unresolved: The paper does not delve into the specific challenges or propose a new model architecture for RVMR. It only mentions that existing models lack ranking capability and that a new approach is needed
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and evaluating a new model architecture specifically designed for RVMR, and comparing its performance to adapted VCMR models, would highlight the specific challenges and potential solutions for RVMR

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of evaluation metric (NDCG@K, IoU ≥ µ) affect the perceived performance of RVMR models, and are there alternative metrics that could better capture the nuances of the task?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces the NDCG@K, IoU ≥ µ evaluation metric, which combines ranking quality with temporal localization accuracy. However, it does not explore the impact of different metric choices on model performance
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on one evaluation metric and does not compare it with other potential metrics that could be used for RVMR, such as mean average precision (mAP) or recall at K
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating RVMR models using different metrics and comparing the results would provide insights into how the choice of evaluation metric affects the perceived performance and whether alternative metrics could better capture the task's nuances

## Limitations

- The assumption that query-caption similarity is a reliable proxy for visual relevance in pseudo-training lacks strong empirical validation
- The paper doesn't empirically validate that the character substitution approach truly captures realistic imprecise query patterns through user studies
- The adaptations made to VCMR models for RVMR are relatively simple modifications that may not address fundamental architectural limitations

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The dataset construction methodology, evaluation metric design, and experimental setup are clearly specified and reproducible
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of NDCG@K, IoU≥µ as an evaluation metric is theoretically sound but hasn't been validated against human judgments beyond correlation with annotated relevance scores
- **Low confidence**: The assumption that query-caption similarity is a reliable proxy for visual relevance in pseudo-training lacks strong empirical validation

## Next Checks

1. **User behavior validation**: Conduct a small-scale study where users generate search queries for video moments with varying levels of content knowledge to empirically validate that the character substitution approach captures realistic imprecise query patterns

2. **Pseudo-training ablation**: Systematically vary the N parameter in pseudo-training (1, 10, 20, 40) and compare results against a smaller manually annotated subset to quantify the reliability of the query-caption similarity proxy

3. **Ranking-specific architecture exploration**: Design and test a model variant that explicitly incorporates ranking mechanisms (e.g., listwise ranking loss, transformer-based cross-attention between queries and multiple moments) to determine if the poor RVMR performance stems from architectural limitations rather than just training approaches
