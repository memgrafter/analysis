# Self-Labeling in Multivariate Causality and Quantification for Adaptive Machine Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.05809
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05809
- Reference count: 40
- Self-labeling adapts ML models to concept drift using interactive causality and temporal association of cause-effect pairs

## Executive Summary
This paper extends interactive causality enabled self-labeling theory to multivariate causal graphs, proposing solutions for applying self-labeling in complex causal structures. The authors develop a framework using four basic causal relationships (chain, fork, collider, confounder) and analyze the impact of inaccurate interaction time models and effect state detectors on performance. Through simulation experiments, the method demonstrates effectiveness in adapting to concept drift even with non-ideal auxiliary models, while providing cost analysis showing conditions under which self-labeling becomes more cost-effective than fully supervised learning.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a self-labeling framework for adaptive machine learning that leverages known causal relationships and interaction times to generate labeled datasets without manual annotation. The method extends to multivariate causal graphs by decomposing complex structures into four basic causal relationships, each with specific interaction time manipulation rules. Error tolerance is analyzed through dynamical systems theory, quantifying the impact of ITM and ESD inaccuracies on performance. A cost metric incorporating both labor and electricity costs enables comparative evaluation across different learning approaches.

## Key Results
- Self-labeling outperforms traditional semi-supervised learning in adapting to concept drift, even with non-ideal ITM and ESD models
- The method maintains performance with up to 30% error in auxiliary models, demonstrating strong error tolerance
- Self-labeling is more cost-effective than fully supervised learning when average training time per sample on a single GPU is less than 1.3 hours

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Self-labeling adapts ML models to concept drift without manual labeling by leveraging interactive causality and temporal association of cause-effect pairs.
- Mechanism: The method uses known causal relationships to identify sensor modalities that generate labels for the task model, infers learnable causal time lags (interaction time) to associate effects with causes, and autonomously generates labeled datasets for continual model adaptation.
- Core assumption: Established causal relationships and interaction times are less mutable than ML model input-output relations during concept drift.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Self-labeling is predicated on the assumption that established causal relationships and the interaction time are less mutable than the input-output relations of ML models when there is concept drift"
  - [section II-A] "The self-labeling method works in the real-world environments with streaming data instead of static datasets"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The method extends to multivariate causal graphs using four basic causal structures (chain, fork, collider, confounder) with interaction time manipulation.
- Mechanism: For each basic structure, the method combines or processes interaction times differently - chains add interaction times sequentially, forks use max interaction time to capture all effect transitions, colliders use individual ITMs for each cause-effect pair, and confounders treat intermediate variables as additional causes or indirect paths.
- Core assumption: Complex causal graphs can be decomposed into combinations of the four basic structures for self-labeling application.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "A framework for the application of self-labeling to multivariate causal graphs is proposed using four basic causal relationships"
  - [section III] "The self-labeling schema for the four basic cases can be used as a tool to analyze the interaction time calculus by disentangling a complex graph into the four basic structures"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Self-labeling is robust to ITM and ESD inaccuracies, maintaining performance advantage over traditional semi-supervised learning even with non-ideal auxiliary models.
- Mechanism: The method quantifies ITM and ESD errors through error factors (ξt for ITM, ξe for ESD) and shows through dynamical systems analysis that self-labeling performance degrades gracefully with increasing error rates, maintaining superiority over traditional SSL methods.
- Core assumption: The smoothness of state change transients in real-world systems provides inherent error tolerance in the ITM sampling process.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Results show that self-labeling outperforms traditional semi-supervised learning methods in adapting to concept drift, even with non-ideal ITM and ESD models"
  - [section IV-B] "it is evident that self-labeling holds strong potential in ITM and ESD error tolerance given its performance at a 30% error ratio"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Causal relationships and interaction time
  - Why needed here: Self-labeling relies on existing causal knowledge to identify which variables can generate labels for the task model and how to temporally associate cause and effect data streams
  - Quick check question: What are the four basic causal structures used in structural causal models, and how does each structure handle interaction time differently in self-labeling?

- Concept: Dynamical systems theory and perturbation analysis
  - Why needed here: The theoretical foundation proves self-labeling effectiveness by analyzing how perturbations (concept drift) affect the relationship between cause states and effect states under different learning methods
  - Quick check question: In the simplified dynamical system example, how does the self-labeling method maintain the relationship between y2 and xslb under perturbation compared to fully supervised and traditional SSL methods?

- Concept: Cost analysis including both labor and electricity
  - Why needed here: Evaluates the tradeoff between accuracy and cost across different learning methods, showing when self-labeling becomes more cost-effective than fully supervised learning
  - Quick check question: What is the condition for self-labeling to be more cost-effective than fully supervised learning in terms of average training time per sample on a single GPU?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Task Model <- ESD -> ITM -> Causal Knowledge Graph
- Critical path: ESD inference → ITM inference → Data selection → Task model retraining
- Design tradeoffs:
  - More accurate ITMs/ESDs improve performance but increase computational cost
  - Complex causal structures require multiple ITMs but provide richer information for task models
  - Higher error tolerance in auxiliary models reduces accuracy but increases robustness
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor task model accuracy: Check ESD/ITM performance and causal relationship validity
  - High computational cost: Review ITM/ESD inference frequency and model complexity
  - Concept drift not addressed: Verify causal relationships still hold and interaction times remain stable
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement self-labeling on a simple two-variable causal structure with known interaction time, compare to fully supervised and traditional SSL
  2. Add noise to ITM/ESD outputs and measure impact on task model accuracy to validate error tolerance
  3. Create a complex causal graph with chains, forks, colliders, and confounders, implement self-labeling framework and evaluate performance on concept drift scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does self-labeling perform in scenarios with multiple interacting variables and complex logical relationships (AND, OR, XOR) between causes and effects?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses self-labeling in multivariate causal graphs but notes that the logical relations among variables further complicate the relational analysis and focuses on state transitions rather than specific logical relations.
- Why unresolved: The paper states that the logical relations are not assumed in the interaction time calculation and focuses on state transitions, but does not provide empirical evidence or theoretical analysis of self-labeling performance with different logical relations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing self-labeling performance with different logical relations (AND, OR, XOR) in multivariate causal structures would resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of ITM and ESD errors on self-labeling performance in real-world applications beyond the controlled simulation environment?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper analyzes ITM and ESD inaccuracies using dynamical systems theory and conducts a simulation experiment, but notes that the simulation uses controlled conditions and real-world applications may have additional complexities.
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides theoretical analysis and simulation results, it does not validate the findings in real-world applications with uncontrolled variables and noise.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies applying self-labeling to real-world datasets with known ground truth and varying levels of ITM and ESD errors would provide evidence of its robustness in practical scenarios.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can large language models (LLMs) be effectively integrated into the self-labeling framework to extract causality from domain knowledge?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions the potential of using LLMs as an initial causal knowledge base but does not explore this integration or provide a methodology for leveraging LLMs in the self-labeling process.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges the potential of LLMs for extracting causality but does not provide a concrete approach or experimental validation of their effectiveness in the self-labeling context.
- What evidence would resolve it: A proposed methodology for integrating LLMs into the self-labeling framework, along with experimental results demonstrating improved causality extraction and self-labeling performance, would resolve this question.

## Limitations

- Simulation-based validation may not fully capture real-world complexity and noise characteristics
- Assumes causal relationships remain stable during concept drift, which may not hold in all domains
- Cost analysis lacks empirical validation on actual hardware configurations and energy consumption patterns

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The theoretical framework for extending self-labeling to four basic causal structures is well-grounded and internally consistent. The cost analysis methodology and threshold conditions are mathematically sound.
- **Medium Confidence**: The error tolerance analysis for ITM and ESD models shows promising results in simulation, but real-world validation is needed to confirm graceful degradation properties under varied conditions.
- **Medium Confidence**: The performance claims comparing self-labeling to traditional SSL methods are supported by simulation, but may not generalize to all concept drift scenarios and data distributions.

## Next Checks

1. **Real-world Deployment Validation**: Implement the self-labeling framework on an industrial IoT dataset with known concept drift (e.g., manufacturing equipment sensor data) and compare performance against traditional SSL methods over extended periods, measuring both accuracy and cost metrics.

2. **Causal Relationship Stability Test**: Design an experiment where causal relationships are intentionally perturbed during concept drift scenarios to quantify the threshold at which self-labeling performance degrades significantly, and compare this threshold across different causal structures.

3. **Cross-domain Generalization Study**: Apply the framework to multiple domains (manufacturing, healthcare, autonomous systems) with varying causal graph complexities and concept drift patterns to identify which characteristics predict successful self-labeling performance and which require methodological modifications.
