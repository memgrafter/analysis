# Signed Graph Autoencoder for Explainable and Polarization-Aware Network Embeddings

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2409.10452
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10452
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Achieves state-of-the-art signed link prediction with up to 30% improvement on negative link prediction task

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Signed Graph Archetypal Autoencoder (SGAAE), a novel autoencoder framework for signed networks that learns interpretable node embeddings by projecting the graph onto a learned polytope. The method leverages the Skellam distribution to model signed interactions and combines it with relational archetypal analysis and graph neural networks. A key innovation is the introduction of 2-level polarization, where negative ties can form independent community structures beyond traditional "us vs. them" dynamics. SGAAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in signed link prediction across four real-world datasets.

## Method Summary
SGAAE uses two separate GNN encoders to process positive and negative interactions independently, producing membership matrices Z and W for archetypal analysis. The model employs Skellam distribution modeling to capture signed interactions as the difference of two Poisson processes, with archetypal profiles forming the extreme points of a convex polytope. The architecture is trained using random sampling of ~3000 nodes per iteration for scalability, with Adam optimizer (lr=0.005) for 3000 iterations. Link prediction is performed using logistic regression on concatenated Skellam rates and log-rates.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance in signed link prediction across four real-world datasets
- Outperforms baselines by up to 30% on the most challenging negative link prediction task
- Learned archetypal space enables interpretable visualizations revealing distinct network structures and polarization patterns
- Model scales efficiently through random sampling and provides principled approach to characterizing complex polarization dynamics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The Skellam distribution enables principled modeling of signed interactions by modeling the difference of two Poisson random variables.
- Mechanism: The Skellam distribution's parameters λ+ and λ- represent positive and negative interaction intensities respectively. By constraining the latent space to a polytope, the model achieves archetypal characterization where node embeddings are convex combinations of extreme profiles.
- Core assumption: Signed interactions in social networks can be effectively modeled as the difference of two independent Poisson processes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The framework employs a recently proposed likelihood for analyzing signed networks based on the Skellam distribution, combined with relational archetypal analysis and GNNs."
  - [section 3]: "We use the Skellam distribution, which models the difference of two independent Poisson-distributed random variables with rates λ+ and λ- as..."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct mentions of Skellam distribution in neighbor papers
- Break condition: If signed interactions cannot be adequately approximated by the difference of two Poisson processes, the Skellam-based likelihood would fail to capture the true data distribution.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: 2-level polarization allows for disentangled community structures based on positive and negative links separately.
- Mechanism: The model introduces two sets of archetypal membership matrices Z and W, enabling nodes to have distinct embeddings for positive and negative community structures. This decouples community detection from positive and negative link structures.
- Core assumption: Real signed networks contain independent community structures formed through positive and negative interactions respectively.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Additionally, we introduce the 2-level network polarization problem and show how SGAAE is able to characterize such a setting."
  - [section 3]: "In a 2-level polarization scenario, this constraint is removed, by enabling a node to have two sets of embedding vectors, each one describing the community structure based on either positive or negative link structures, separately."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct mentions of 2-level polarization in neighbor papers
- Break condition: If negative links do not form independent community structures but are simply inverses of positive structures, the 2-level approach would add unnecessary complexity.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Graph Neural Networks encode local structural information that enhances the archetypal representations.
- Mechanism: Separate GNN encoders process positive and negative interactions independently, producing embeddings Z, γ for positive links and W, δ for negative ones. This captures local neighborhood information before archetypal projection.
- Core assumption: Local graph structure contains valuable information for characterizing polarization that can be captured by message-passing GNNs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The framework employs a recently proposed likelihood for analyzing signed networks based on the Skellam distribution, combined with relational archetypal analysis and GNNs."
  - [section 3]: "To handle the signed interactions in the network, we construct an encoder based on message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) for each edge type."
  - [corpus]: Moderate - mentions of GNNs in signed graph contexts in neighbor papers
- Break condition: If local neighborhood information is not informative for polarization characterization, the GNN component would add computational overhead without performance benefits.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Skellam distribution
  - Why needed here: It provides a principled statistical model for signed interactions by representing the difference of two Poisson processes, which naturally captures positive and negative link intensities.
  - Quick check question: Can you derive the probability mass function of the Skellam distribution given two independent Poisson random variables?

- Concept: Archetypal analysis
  - Why needed here: It enables interpretable representations by expressing data points as convex combinations of extreme profiles (archetypes), which correspond to the vertices of the convex hull.
  - Quick check question: How do you formulate the optimization problem for archetypal analysis to find extreme points in a dataset?

- Concept: Graph Neural Networks
  - Why needed here: GNNs aggregate local neighborhood information through message passing, which is essential for capturing the structural context of nodes in signed networks.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between spectral and spatial approaches in Graph Neural Networks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input -> Positive GNN encoder -> Z membership matrix + γ bias terms -> Archetypal matrix A -> Skellam rate calculation -> Skellam likelihood reconstruction loss
  Input -> Negative GNN encoder -> W membership matrix + δ bias terms -> Archetypal matrix A -> Skellam rate calculation -> Skellam likelihood reconstruction loss

- Critical path: GNN encoders -> Archetypal projection -> Skellam rate computation -> Loss calculation -> Parameter updates

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Joint vs. separate processing of positive/negative links (separate chosen for disentanglement)
  - Inner product vs. Euclidean distance for proximity (inner product chosen for expressiveness)
  - Full vs. sampled likelihood computation (sampled chosen for scalability)

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor link prediction performance indicates issues with Skellam rate calibration
  - Unstable training suggests learning rate or temperature parameter issues
  - Inability to capture polarization patterns indicates archetypal space dimensionality problems

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train on synthetic 1-level polarized network and verify community detection accuracy
  2. Train on synthetic 2-level polarized network and compare Z vs W membership separation
  3. Evaluate link prediction performance on real-world signed network with varying K (archetype count)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the 2-level polarization model perform on networks with more than two distinct community structures, such as multi-polarization scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces the concept of 2-level polarization and demonstrates its effectiveness on real-world datasets, but does not explore scenarios with more than two community structures.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on 2-level polarization, leaving the performance of the model in multi-polarization scenarios untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments on networks with multiple distinct community structures, comparing the model's performance to other baselines in these scenarios.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of the temperature parameter in the softmax function on the quality of the learned archetypal memberships?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions introducing a temperature parameter in the softmax function to define memberships, but does not explore its impact on the quality of the learned memberships.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide experiments or analysis on how the temperature parameter affects the model's performance or the interpretability of the learned archetypes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Sensitivity analysis on the temperature parameter, showing its effect on the model's performance and the quality of the learned archetypes.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the model handle networks with a large number of nodes, and what are the computational limitations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using random sampling to scale the model to large networks, but does not provide a detailed analysis of its performance or limitations on very large networks.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the model's scalability in depth, leaving questions about its performance on networks with millions of nodes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments on large-scale networks, analyzing the model's performance and computational requirements as the number of nodes increases.

## Limitations
- The Skellam distribution assumption for signed interactions needs empirical validation across diverse network types
- The 2-level polarization model may overfit to specific dataset characteristics rather than representing a general phenomenon
- The sampling-based optimization approach trades off between computational efficiency and estimation accuracy

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The architectural design combining GNNs with archetypal analysis is technically sound and the reported link prediction improvements are well-supported by quantitative results.
- **Medium Confidence**: The interpretability claims regarding polarization patterns are promising but require more rigorous validation across diverse network types.
- **Low Confidence**: The theoretical justification for the Skellam distribution assumption and the generalization of 2-level polarization to real-world networks needs further empirical support.

## Next Checks

1. **Distribution Validation**: Systematically test whether the Skellam distribution assumption holds across different types of signed networks by comparing likelihood scores with alternative distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Bernoulli).

2. **Polarization Generalization**: Apply SGAAE to additional signed networks with known polarization structures (e.g., political discourse networks, product review networks) to validate whether the 2-level polarization patterns consistently emerge and are interpretable.

3. **Ablation Study**: Conduct comprehensive ablation studies removing key components (GNNs, archetypal analysis, Skellam modeling) to quantify their individual contributions to performance improvements and validate the claimed synergies.
