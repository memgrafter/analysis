# Fairness in Reinforcement Learning with Bisimulation Metrics

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.17123
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17123
- Reference count: 40
- This paper proposes using bisimulation metrics to achieve fairness in reinforcement learning by adjusting the reward function and observation dynamics so that the policy inherently satisfies fairness constraints.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Bisimulator, a method for achieving fairness in reinforcement learning by leveraging bisimulation metrics. The approach adjusts the reward function and observation dynamics to minimize the bisimulation metric between different demographic groups in expectation, thereby promoting demographic parity fairness. Empirical evaluations on lending and college admission scenarios demonstrate that Bisimulator outperforms strong baselines in achieving long-term fairness while maintaining high average returns, and it is compatible with both PPO and DQN algorithms.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to fairness in reinforcement learning by using bisimulation metrics. Bisimulation metrics measure the behavioral similarity between states in a Markov decision process. The key insight is that by minimizing the bisimulation metric between states belonging to different demographic groups, the resulting policy will treat these groups similarly in terms of long-term outcomes. The method, called Bisimulator, achieves this by adjusting the reward function and observation dynamics during training. Specifically, it incorporates a fairness regularizer that penalizes differences in the expected cumulative rewards between groups. This approach is theoretically grounded and can be applied to both policy gradient methods (like PPO) and value-based methods (like DQN).

## Key Results
- Bisimulator outperforms strong baselines in achieving long-term fairness, as measured by reduced recall gaps and social burden in lending and college admission scenarios
- The method maintains high average returns while improving fairness metrics
- Bisimulator is effective with both PPO and DQN algorithms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism works by leveraging the properties of bisimulation metrics to enforce fairness constraints. By minimizing the bisimulation metric between states of different demographic groups, the method ensures that the policy treats these groups similarly in terms of their long-term expected outcomes. This is achieved by modifying the reward function to include a penalty term that grows with the difference in expected cumulative rewards between groups. As a result, the policy is incentivized to learn a fair behavior that minimizes these differences, leading to demographic parity.

## Foundational Learning

**Bisimulation Metrics**: Measure of behavioral similarity between states in a Markov decision process.
- Why needed: Provides a way to quantify the similarity of states across different demographic groups
- Quick check: Can the metric distinguish between states with different long-term outcomes?

**Markov Decision Process (MDP)**: Mathematical framework for modeling decision-making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision maker.
- Why needed: Foundation for reinforcement learning problems
- Quick check: Are the transition dynamics and reward functions properly defined?

**Demographic Parity**: A fairness criterion that requires the decisions or outcomes to be independent of protected attributes.
- Why needed: The fairness notion that Bisimulator aims to achieve
- Quick check: Does the method ensure equal outcomes across demographic groups?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Environment -> RL Agent (PPO/DQN) -> Modified Reward Function -> Bisimulation Metric Regularizer -> Policy Update

**Critical Path**: State observation -> Action selection -> Environment transition -> Reward calculation (with fairness regularizer) -> Policy update

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades off some performance for fairness by modifying the reward function. This could potentially lead to suboptimal policies in terms of pure performance metrics, but achieves better fairness outcomes.

**Failure Signatures**: If the bisimulation metric cannot effectively capture the relevant differences between states, or if the fairness regularizer is too strong, the method might fail to learn a useful policy or might not achieve the desired fairness outcomes.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Verify that the bisimulation metric can distinguish between states of different demographic groups
2. Test the method on a simple tabular environment with known fairness properties
3. Evaluate the impact of the fairness regularizer strength on both performance and fairness metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Limitations
- The scalability of the method to high-dimensional state spaces is uncertain due to the computational intractability of bisimulation metrics in large state spaces
- The empirical validation is limited to relatively simple environments, raising questions about real-world applicability
- The approach requires knowledge of protected attributes, which may not always be available or permissible

## Confidence

**High confidence** in theoretical foundations and mathematical derivations
**Medium confidence** in empirical results, given limited environment complexity
**Low confidence** in scalability claims without supporting evidence

## Next Checks

1. Test Bisimulator on high-dimensional continuous control tasks to evaluate computational scalability
2. Compare performance against alternative fairness approaches (e.g., Lagrange multiplier methods) on the same benchmark environments
3. Evaluate the method's robustness to imperfect knowledge of protected attributes or their absence
