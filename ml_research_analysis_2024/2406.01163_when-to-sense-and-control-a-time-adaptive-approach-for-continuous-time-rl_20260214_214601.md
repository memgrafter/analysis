# When to Sense and Control? A Time-adaptive Approach for Continuous-Time RL

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.01163
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01163
- Authors: Lenart Treven; Bhavya Sukhija; Yarden As; Florian Dörfler; Andreas Krause
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Proposes a framework for reinforcement learning in continuous-time systems that minimizes costly interactions by predicting both control actions and their application duration.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of reinforcement learning in continuous-time systems where interactions are costly. The authors propose a novel approach called Time-adaptive Control & Sensing (TACOS) that reformulates the problem as a discrete-time Markov decision process by predicting both control actions and their duration. This allows standard RL algorithms to solve the extended MDP while significantly reducing the number of interactions. The authors also introduce a model-based algorithm, OTACOS, which achieves sublinear regret under smoothness assumptions and demonstrates sample efficiency gains.

## Method Summary
The authors reformulate continuous-time RL with interaction costs as an extended MDP by augmenting the state with integrated reward and time-to-go, and extending the action space to include both control and duration. Any standard RL algorithm can then solve this extended MDP. For model-based approaches, they propose OTACOS, which uses optimistic planning with well-calibrated probabilistic models to achieve sublinear regret under smoothness assumptions.

## Key Results
- TACOS significantly reduces the number of interactions compared to standard discrete-time methods while maintaining or improving performance
- OTACOS achieves sublinear regret for systems with sufficiently smooth dynamics
- Sample efficiency gains demonstrated through comparison with PETS-TACOS and MEAN-TACOS baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Time-adaptive policies reduce interactions by predicting both control and duration
- **Mechanism**: The policy outputs (action, duration) pairs, so fewer interactions are needed because each action can be applied for an optimal time instead of at fixed intervals
- **Core assumption**: The system dynamics and reward are sufficiently smooth to allow longer-duration actions without significant performance loss
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "optimizing over policies that besides control predict the duration of its application"
  - [section 3.1]: "Our formulation results in an extended MDP that any standard RL algorithm can solve"
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence; corpus focuses on discrete vs continuous discretization issues
- **Break condition**: If dynamics are highly non-smooth or reward is discontinuous, fixed discretization may outperform adaptive timing

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Reformulating to an extended MDP allows standard RL algorithms to solve the time-adaptive problem
- **Mechanism**: Augment the state with integrated reward and time-to-go, then apply any discrete-time RL algorithm to the reformulated problem
- **Core assumption**: The augmented state space remains tractable for standard RL methods
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "Our formulation results in an extended MDP that any standard RL algorithm can solve"
  - [section 3.1]: "We convert the problem with interaction costs to a standard MDP which any RL algorithm for continuous state-action spaces can solve"
  - [corpus]: Weak; corpus papers discuss discretization issues but not MDP reformulation
- **Break condition**: If the augmented state dimension grows too large, sample efficiency may degrade

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Model-based optimistic planning (OTACOS) achieves sublinear regret under smoothness assumptions
- **Mechanism**: Uses well-calibrated probabilistic models with optimism in the face of uncertainty to guide exploration, proving sublinear regret for sufficiently smooth dynamics
- **Core assumption**: The model remains well-calibrated over time and dynamics are smooth enough for regret bounds
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "We show that OTACOS enjoys sublinear regret for systems with sufficiently smooth dynamics"
  - [section 5]: "We theoretically prove that OTACOS suffers no regret and empirically demonstrate its sample efficiency"
  - [corpus]: No direct evidence; corpus neighbors focus on discretization and sampling
- **Break condition**: If smoothness assumptions are violated or model calibration degrades, regret bounds may not hold

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)**
  - Why needed here: The paper models continuous-time systems using SDEs, so understanding SDE dynamics is essential
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the diffusion term in an SDE, and how does it affect system behavior?

- **Concept: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**
  - Why needed here: The time-adaptive problem is reformulated as an extended MDP, so familiarity with MDPs is crucial
  - Quick check question: How does augmenting the state space affect the complexity of solving an MDP?

- **Concept: Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty (OFU)**
  - Why needed here: OTACOS uses OFU for exploration, so understanding the principle is key
  - Quick check question: How does OFU differ from other exploration strategies like -greedy or entropy-based methods?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  State -> Policy Network -> (Action, Duration) -> Environment -> (Next State, Reward, Cost) -> Replay Buffer -> Model Update

- **Critical path**:
  1. Collect state, action, duration, reward
  2. Update dynamics and reward models
  3. Plan optimistic trajectory
  4. Execute action for predicted duration
  5. Repeat

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - **Interaction frequency vs performance**: Higher frequency improves performance but increases cost
  - **Model complexity vs sample efficiency**: More complex models may improve accuracy but require more data
  - **Planning horizon vs computational cost**: Longer horizons improve performance but increase planning time

- **Failure signatures**:
  - **Frequent action switches**: May indicate poor duration prediction
  - **High variance in rewards**: Could signal model miscalibration
  - **Slow learning**: May suggest exploration strategy needs adjustment

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. **Baseline comparison**: Run SAC on Pendulum with and without TACOS to measure interaction reduction
  2. **Frequency robustness**: Test different tmin values to confirm TACOS robustness
  3. **Model-based vs model-free**: Compare OTACOS and SAC-TACOS on sample efficiency

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: How does the performance of OTACOS compare to other model-based RL algorithms beyond PETS and planning with the mean when applied to continuous-time RL problems?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions PETS-TACOS and MEAN-TACOS as baselines in Figure 5 but does not explore other potential model-based algorithms
  - Why unresolved: The paper only compares OTACOS to two specific baselines, leaving the question of its relative performance against other model-based RL methods unanswered
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing OTACOS to a broader range of model-based RL algorithms on various continuous-time RL benchmarks

- **Open Question 2**: What is the impact of non-Gaussian noise on the regret bounds and performance of OTACOS?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper assumes sub-Gaussian noise for theoretical analysis but does not explore the effects of non-Gaussian noise in experiments
  - Why unresolved: The theoretical analysis relies on sub-Gaussian assumptions, but real-world systems may exhibit non-Gaussian noise, making it crucial to understand the algorithm's robustness
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experiments evaluating OTACOS on continuous-time RL tasks with various types of non-Gaussian noise and analysis of its performance and regret bounds in these scenarios

- **Open Question 3**: How does the choice of the model complexity IN affect the sample efficiency and regret of OTACOS?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions IN as a measure of model complexity but does not investigate its impact on OTACOS's performance
  - Why unresolved: IN is a crucial factor in determining the regret bounds, but its relationship with sample efficiency and practical performance remains unexplored
  - What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies analyzing the effect of different IN values on OTACOS's sample efficiency and regret in various continuous-time RL tasks

## Limitations
- Performance heavily depends on the smoothness of system dynamics for regret bounds to hold
- Exact values of tmin and tmax are not specified, which could significantly impact performance
- Model-based approach's robustness to model mis-specification is not thoroughly validated

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The core mechanism of reducing interactions through time-adaptive policies is well-supported by experimental results
- **Medium Confidence**: The sublinear regret guarantee for OTACOS under smoothness assumptions is theoretically sound
- **Low Confidence**: The exact impact of different tmin and tmax values on performance is not fully explored

## Next Checks
1. Systematically vary tmin and tmax values to quantify their impact on performance and interaction count, ensuring TACOS maintains its advantage across a range of settings
2. Intentionally introduce model errors in OTACOS and measure the impact on regret bounds to assess the algorithm's robustness
3. Apply TACOS to a real-world system with non-smooth dynamics (e.g., robotic control with contact events) to test the limits of the smoothness assumptions
