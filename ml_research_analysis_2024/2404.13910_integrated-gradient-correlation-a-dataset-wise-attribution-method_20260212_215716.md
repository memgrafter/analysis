# Integrated Gradient Correlation: a Dataset-wise Attribution Method

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.13910
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13910
- Authors: Pierre Lelièvre; Chien-Chung Chen
- Reference count: 29
- Key outcome: IGC is a dataset-wise attribution method that summarizes attribution patterns across entire datasets using correlation analysis, validated on synthetic data and fMRI neural signals

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Integrated Gradient Correlation (IGC), a dataset-wise attribution method designed to summarize attribution patterns across entire datasets rather than individual predictions. The method addresses the need for interpretability in scenarios where input information localization is stable across datasets, such as neuroscience applications analyzing fMRI data. IGC builds upon path methods, specifically using Integrated Gradients as its foundation, and computes attributions by measuring the linear relationship between input components and model predictions, scaled by prediction variability.

The authors validate IGC on synthetic data and real fMRI neural signals from the NSD dataset. Results show IGC successfully reveals selective patterns aligned with model objectives, outperforming naive aggregations like mean and standard deviation of individual attributions. Applications include studying image feature representation in visual cortex and estimating visual receptive fields of neural populations, demonstrating IGC's practical utility in neuroscience research.

## Method Summary
IGC is a dataset-wise attribution method that extends Integrated Gradients by aggregating attributions across entire datasets using correlation analysis. The method computes attributions by measuring the linear relationship between input components and model predictions, scaled by prediction variability. It satisfies key properties including implementation invariance and completeness, where summed attributions equal the correlation between predictions and true outputs. The method enables region-specific analysis through direct summation over associated components and includes an auto-correlation variant for scenarios without ground truth labels.

## Key Results
- IGC successfully reveals selective patterns aligned with model objectives on synthetic data and fMRI neural signals
- Outperforms naive aggregations (mean, standard deviation) of individual attributions in dataset-wise analysis
- Enables region-specific analysis by direct summation over associated components
- Applications include studying image feature representation in visual cortex and estimating visual receptive fields

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: IGC computes attributions by measuring linear relationship between input components and model predictions, scaled by prediction variability
- Mechanism: Uses correlation between input component attributions and true outputs to summarize attribution patterns across entire datasets
- Core assumption: Localization of important input information is stable across dataset for specific problems
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "IGC builds upon path methods, specifically using Integrated Gradients as its foundation. It computes attributions by measuring the linear relationship between input components and model predictions, scaled by prediction variability"
  - [section]: "we propose to summarize the distribution of aj by a measure of its linear relationship with predictions f(x), i.e. a covariance-based analysis"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus papers focus on different aspects of integrated gradients and attribution methods but don't directly discuss dataset-wise correlation approaches
- Break condition: If input component importance varies significantly across dataset or if linear relationship assumption fails

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: IGC attributions sum to correlation between model predictions and true outputs
- Mechanism: Scaling factor 1/(σf(x)σy) ensures completeness property where summed attributions equal correlation coefficient
- Core assumption: Model predictions and true outputs have sufficient variability to make correlation meaningful
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "further relates the sum of all attributions to a model prediction score (correlation)"
  - [section]: "our proposition sums to the correlation ρ (f(x), y)" with proof provided
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus papers discuss integrated gradients properties but don't address this specific completeness-to-correlation property
- Break condition: If prediction variance is very low or if true outputs are unavailable (requires auto-correlation variant)

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: IGC enables ROI-specific analysis through direct summation over associated components
- Mechanism: Additive property allows flexible definition of regions of interest and direct comparison between different features/models
- Core assumption: Input components can be meaningfully grouped into regions of interest
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "enables region-specific analysis by a direct summation over associated components"
  - [section]: "For any ROI R, the summary bR is thus defined as a simple summation over input components"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus papers discuss various attribution methods but don't address ROI-based dataset-wise analysis
- Break condition: If ROI definitions are ambiguous or if component groupings don't reflect meaningful input structure

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Path methods and Integrated Gradients
  - Why needed here: IGC builds upon Integrated Gradients as its foundation, so understanding path methods is essential
  - Quick check question: What are the key properties that path methods must satisfy (dummy, completeness, implementation invariance)?

- Concept: Covariance and correlation analysis
  - Why needed here: IGC uses covariance-based analysis to summarize attribution distributions across datasets
  - Quick check question: How does scaling by standard deviations convert covariance to correlation coefficient?

- Concept: fMRI data preprocessing and visualization
  - Why needed here: Paper demonstrates IGC on fMRI data from NSD dataset, requiring understanding of brain imaging concepts
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between volumetric voxels and surface-based vertex representations in fMRI?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Integrated Gradients computation -> correlation calculation across dataset -> ROI aggregation
- Critical path: Compute individual IG attributions → aggregate across dataset using correlation → sum attributions for ROIs → validate against model prediction score
- Design tradeoffs: Uses correlation for interpretability but requires stable input importance; auto-correlation variant available when true outputs unavailable
- Failure signatures: Attribution maps dominated by noise, summed attributions not matching correlation score, ROI attributions not making intuitive sense
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement basic IGC on synthetic data with known ground truth patterns
  2. Apply IGC to simple CNN predicting image statistics, compare with naive aggregation methods
  3. Implement auto-correlation variant and validate on dataset without true outputs

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the choice of baseline distribution affect IGC attributions in real-world neuroimaging applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that baseline choice can be critical and suggests using dataset distributions, but doesn't empirically compare different baseline strategies
- Why unresolved: The paper uses random baselines from the dataset but doesn't systematically explore how different baseline choices (e.g., mean activity, resting state) affect attribution patterns
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic comparison of IGC results using different baseline distributions (zero, mean, resting state, dataset samples) on the same fMRI datasets to quantify stability and differences

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can IGC attributions be used to validate or improve model architectures for brain encoding/decoding tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates IGC reveals interpretable patterns in brain models but doesn't explore whether these patterns can guide architectural improvements
- Why unresolved: While IGC shows meaningful patterns, it's unclear if these insights can be used proactively to design better models rather than just interpret existing ones
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments showing how architectural modifications based on IGC insights (e.g., emphasizing V1 contributions for luminance tasks) improve model performance or interpretability

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the relationship between IGC attribution patterns and established neuroscience findings about visual processing?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that IGC results align with known visual hierarchy but doesn't provide quantitative validation against existing neuroscience literature
- Why unresolved: The paper qualitatively notes alignment with V1-V4 hierarchy and object category processing but doesn't systematically compare IGC patterns with established receptive field properties or neural tuning
- What evidence would resolve it: Quantitative analysis comparing IGC-derived receptive field properties with classical pRF measurements and spatial frequency tuning curves from the neuroscience literature

### Open Question 4
- Question: How sensitive are IGC attributions to the number of IG steps and validation set size in practice?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions these as practical considerations but doesn't systematically study their impact on attribution quality
- Why unresolved: The paper provides some error thresholds but doesn't explore how attribution patterns change with different computational budgets or how to determine optimal settings for new datasets
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive sensitivity analysis showing IGC stability across different step counts and validation set sizes, with guidance on acceptable trade-offs between computational cost and attribution reliability

## Limitations
- Requires stable input importance across datasets, limiting applicability to domains where this assumption doesn't hold
- Performance degrades when prediction variance is very low or when true outputs are unavailable
- Sensitivity to ROI definitions and component groupings may affect interpretation quality

## Confidence
- Confidence in the core claims is **Medium**. While the mathematical foundation is sound and the method builds on established path methods like Integrated Gradients, there are significant limitations. The method requires stable input importance across datasets, which may not hold for many real-world applications. The fMRI validation, while demonstrating practical utility, is limited to specific visual cortex decoding tasks and may not generalize to other domains.

## Next Checks
1. Test IGC on datasets with known variable input importance patterns to evaluate failure modes
2. Compare IGC performance against other dataset-wise attribution methods on benchmark datasets
3. Implement the auto-correlation variant and validate on datasets without ground truth labels to assess robustness
