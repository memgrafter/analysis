## Executive Summary
This study presents DAEDRA, a domain-specific language model designed to predict regulatory-relevant outcomes (mortality, ER attendance, and hospitalisation) in adverse drug reaction reports from passive pharmacovigilance systems. The model was trained on over 1.8 million VAERS reports spanning 1990-2023, using an adaptive training approach that fine-tuned a base biomedical language model on the pharmacovigilance corpus. DAEDRA achieved F1 scores of 0.85-0.93 across different outcome classes, representing a 1% improvement over general biomedical models. The model demonstrates the effectiveness of domain-specific fine-tuning for specialised text classification tasks, particularly in scenarios involving diverse report sources and complex medical terminology.

## Method Summary
DAEDRA was developed through an adaptive training approach that began with evaluating multiple base biomedical language models on a 10% sample of VAERS reports. The best-performing model (BioBERT) was then retrained with an expanded tokeniser vocabulary (28,996 to 52,000 tokens) specifically on the pharmacovigilance corpus to better handle rare medical terminology. Finally, the model was fine-tuned on the complete training set (75% of the full VAERS corpus) to capture domain-specific linguistic patterns. The dataset was split by gender and age quintile to ensure balanced representation, and evaluation focused on three binary outcome classes with appropriate metrics for the highly imbalanced data.

## Key Results
- Achieved F1 scores of 0.85-0.93 across mortality, ER attendance, and hospitalisation outcome classes
- Demonstrated 1% absolute improvement over general biomedical models in F1 score
- Showed 2.5% improvement in precision and 3.8% improvement in recall through domain-specific fine-tuning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Domain-specific tokeniser training improves subword segmentation accuracy for rare medical terminology
- Mechanism: By expanding the vocabulary from 28,996 to 52,000 tokens and retraining WordPiece on the pharmacovigilance corpus, the model learns to treat medically significant compounds (e.g., "intussusception") as single tokens rather than fragmented subwords, preserving semantic coherence
- Core assumption: Tokeniser retraining on domain corpus is more effective than relying on general medical models' tokenisers
- Evidence anchors: The absence of specific tokens may lead to the loss of crucial meaning. Consider, for instance, the term 'intussusception', a rare but serious complication of the rotavirus vaccine that frequently results in hospitalisation. A naive tokeniser would tokenise it as int, ##uss, ##us, ##ception; Re-tokenisation uses the same WordPiece tokeniser used by the original model... expanding the maximum vocabulary size
- Break condition: If the expanded vocabulary causes increased out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rates or if rare terms still split incorrectly

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Adaptive training on the full corpus yields marginal but statistically meaningful performance gains
- Mechanism: Fine-tuning the best-performing base model (BioBERT) on the complete training set captures nuanced linguistic patterns specific to pharmacovigilance reports that are absent in smaller samples
- Core assumption: The full corpus contains domain-specific linguistic patterns not present in the 10% evaluation subset
- Evidence anchors: This yielded a small but significant improvement in F1 (+1%), precision (+2.5%) and recall (+3.8%); Even though the overall impact of training the model on the entire training set (75% of the entire V AERS corpus) has only created approx. 1.5% uplift in terms of the F1 score
- Break condition: If training time increases disproportionately relative to performance gains, or if overfitting occurs on the highly imbalanced dataset

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Specialized tokeniser and training approach accommodates the unique linguistic context of passive reporting
- Mechanism: By training on a corpus that includes both clinical and lay language, the model develops robust representations for colloquial terminology, misspellings, and shorthand that appear in spontaneous adverse event reports
- Core assumption: Passive reporting corpora contain linguistic features distinct from both formal clinical documentation and scientific literature
- Evidence anchors: Generic language models may not capture the complex clinical dimensions while specific clinical or biomedical models may not perform well on lay reports; shorthand, e.g. y/o (for 'years old'), S/P (for 'status post')
- Break condition: If model performance degrades when encountering reports with heavy colloquial usage or severe misspellings

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Tokenisation and subword segmentation
  - Why needed here: The model's ability to correctly parse medical terminology depends on how tokens are created from input text
  - Quick check question: Why would splitting "intussusception" into subwords like "int", "##uss", "##us", "##ception" be problematic for pharmacovigilance tasks?

- Concept: Language model fine-tuning strategies
  - Why needed here: Understanding how adaptive training (training on full corpus after base model selection) differs from standard fine-tuning is crucial for replicating results
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes adaptive training from traditional fine-tuning in the context of domain-specific model development?

- Concept: Class imbalance handling in classification
  - Why needed here: The dataset has 77.2% no-event reports, requiring appropriate evaluation metrics and training strategies
  - Quick check question: Why is F1 score preferred over accuracy when evaluating models on highly imbalanced datasets?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Base model selection -> Tokeniser retraining -> Full corpus fine-tuning -> Evaluation pipeline
- Critical path: Corpus preprocessing -> Base model evaluation -> Tokeniser retraining -> Full training -> Validation
- Design tradeoffs: Small model size (126M parameters) for accessibility vs. potential gains from larger models; computational efficiency vs. comprehensive representation
- Failure signatures: Overfitting to majority class (no-event reports); poor performance on rare event combinations; inability to parse colloquial medical terminology
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate base models on 10% sample to identify best performer
  2. Retrain tokeniser with expanded vocabulary on training corpus
  3. Fine-tune selected model on full training set and evaluate on validation set

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would DAEDRA perform when trained on pharmacovigilance data from different countries and languages, particularly those with different demographic profiles and reporting patterns?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] from the discussion section noting the model was limited to US vaccine reports in English and suggesting future research explore data from other countries and languages
- Why unresolved: The current model has only been evaluated on US vaccine data, limiting generalizability to other pharmaceutical products, healthcare systems, and linguistic contexts
- What evidence would resolve it: Training and evaluating DAEDRA on FAERS data for non-vaccine pharmaceuticals, Yellow Card scheme data from the UK, and EudraVigilance data from Europe would demonstrate cross-cultural and cross-linguistic performance

### Open Question 2
- Question: Would larger language models (with billions of parameters) provide significantly better performance for pharmacovigilance tasks compared to DAEDRA's current 126 million parameter model?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] from the discussion section which notes DAEDRA is "small in scale compared to the prevailing scale of SOTA models" but found "gains of increasing model size for highly specific models are rapidly diminishing"
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates effectiveness of a smaller model but doesn't directly compare against larger alternatives to quantify the performance tradeoff
- What evidence would resolve it: Head-to-head comparison of DAEDRA against larger biomedical models like PubMedBERT or ClinicalBERT on the same pharmacovigilance task would establish whether scale provides meaningful improvements

### Open Question 3
- Question: How could DAEDRA be adapted to handle the full spectrum of adverse drug reactions beyond the three specific outcomes it currently predicts (mortality, ER attendance, and hospitalization)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] from the discussion acknowledging DAEDRA "only explores one aspect of pharmacovigilance" and the limitations section noting it focuses on "certain outcomes, selected for their prevalence and regulatory importance"
- Why unresolved: The model's current architecture is optimized for a specific set of binary outcomes rather than the full range of potential adverse events that may need classification
- What evidence would resolve it: Retraining DAEDRA on a broader set of ADR outcomes including gastrointestinal symptoms, injection site reactions, and other common adverse events would demonstrate its adaptability to comprehensive pharmacovigilance tasks

## Limitations
- Modest 1% absolute improvement over general biomedical models may not justify additional complexity in all deployment scenarios
- Evaluation relies on single data source (VAERS) with known reporting biases, limiting generalizability
- Adaptive training approach requires substantial computational resources for tokeniser retraining and full corpus fine-tuning

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core mechanism of domain-specific tokeniser retraining and adaptive fine-tuning is well-supported by the evidence. The F1 scores of 0.85-0.93 across outcome classes are clearly reported and demonstrate measurable improvement over baseline models. The methodology for handling class imbalance through appropriate metric selection (F1 score) is standard practice and well-justified.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that domain-specific models outperform general biomedical models by 1% is supported, but the practical significance of this improvement is unclear. The study does not provide cost-benefit analysis of the additional training complexity versus performance gains. The tokeniser expansion from 28,996 to 52,000 tokens is documented, but the specific impact of this expansion on rare term recognition is not quantitatively analyzed.

**Low Confidence**: The model's generalization to other pharmacovigilance systems and real-world deployment scenarios is not validated. The study does not address potential ethical concerns around automated outcome prediction in passive reporting systems, such as false positives leading to unnecessary investigations or false negatives missing serious adverse events.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-System Validation**: Evaluate DAEDRA on at least two additional pharmacovigilance databases (e.g., FAERS, EudraVigilance) to assess generalizability beyond VAERS. Compare performance metrics and identify any systematic differences in prediction accuracy across different reporting systems.

2. **Temporal Robustness Testing**: Assess model performance on reports from different time periods (e.g., pre-2000 vs post-2020) to evaluate temporal drift and adaptability to evolving medical terminology and reporting practices. Include emerging vaccine types and new adverse event patterns.

3. **Deployment Impact Analysis**: Conduct a pilot deployment in a controlled setting to measure real-world impact on regulatory decision-making. Track false positive/negative rates, analyst workload changes, and any downstream effects on adverse event investigation prioritization and public health outcomes.
