# Multi-Agent Norm Perception and Induction in Distributed Healthcare

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.18454
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18454
- Reference count: 40
- Agents successfully learned collective medical norms with KL divergence below 0.1 in healthcare environment

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a Multi-Agent Norm Perception and Induction Learning Model for distributed healthcare environments where autonomous agents learn both descriptive norms (collective tendencies) and prescriptive norms (ideal behaviors) through dynamic interactions. Using parameterized mixed probability density models and practice-enhanced Markov games, the system enables agents to perceive descriptive norms via Gaussian Mixture Models and capture emergent prescriptive norms through Bayesian rule induction. Experiments with a neurological medical center dataset demonstrated successful norm learning, with agents' Subjective Individual Norm Perception (SINP) achieving stable KL divergence below 0.1 with the Objective Collective Norm (OBJ) after practice-sharing activities.

## Method Summary
The method employs a two-pronged approach: descriptive norm learning through Gaussian Mixture Models using Expectation-Maximization algorithms, where agents exchange medical tendency information in a fully connected network to update their SINP; and prescriptive norm learning through practice-enhanced Markov games with Bayesian inference, where agents observe actions and update beliefs about clinical protocols with external regulation through practice verification. The system uses adaptive learning rates and momentum mechanisms to stabilize belief updates, while convergence rate decreases linearly as agent numbers increase in large-scale communities.

## Key Results
- SINP achieved stable KL divergence below 0.1 with OBJ after practice-sharing activities
- System learned key clinical protocols within a norm space containing 30 control norms
- Convergence rate decreased linearly as agent numbers increased in large-scale communities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Agents learn descriptive norms through dynamic interaction and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM).
- Mechanism: Agents continuously exchange medical tendency information in a fully connected network. They use Expectation-Maximization (EM) to iteratively update their Subjective Individual Norm Perception (SINP) based on received data, aiming to minimize KL divergence with the Objective Collective Norm (OBJ).
- Core assumption: Agents can accurately perceive and interpret the medical tendency information exchanged by others, and the medical tendency data follows a Gaussian distribution.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Through parameterized mixed probability density models and practice-enhanced Markov games, the multi-agent system perceives descriptive norms in dynamic interactions and captures emergent prescriptive norms."
  - [section 2.1]: "Each agent's tendency (MedT) is modeled as a single Gaussian distribution based on the sampled MedT value from their respective group."
- Break condition: KL divergence between SINP and OBJ fails to fall below the predetermined threshold (0.1 in the experiments), indicating agents cannot accurately perceive collective medical norms.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Agents learn prescriptive norms through Bayesian rule induction in a Markov game environment with external regulation.
- Mechanism: Agents observe the actions of other agents in a Markov game environment. They use Bayesian inference to update their beliefs about potential prescriptive norms. External regulation is introduced through "practice verification" where agents practice and verify learned norms within the environment. Adaptive learning rates and momentum mechanisms are used to stabilize belief updates.
- Core assumption: Agents can accurately observe the actions of other agents and infer the underlying prescriptive norms from those actions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "In the experiment where multiple agents infer prescriptive norms within a dynamic healthcare environment, the agents effectively learned the key clinical protocols..."
  - [section 2.4]: "Agents need to update their beliefs about a specific prescriptive norm based on the observed behavior of other agents in the healthcare environment."
- Break condition: Agents fail to learn the core clinical protocols and instead converge to irrelevant or invalid norms.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The system's convergence rate decreases linearly as the number of agents increases in large-scale communities.
- Mechanism: As the number of agents increases, the probability of any individual agent receiving complete information from all other agents decreases. This leads to slower convergence as agents may not have sufficient data to accurately perceive the collective norms.
- Core assumption: Information exchange is random and not all agents communicate with all other agents at each time step.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "In large-scale communities, the system's convergence rate exhibited fluctuations; however, overall, it decreased linearly as the number of agents increased."
  - [section 3.3]: "Although there are slight fluctuations in certain intervals (e.g., between 80 and 92 agents), the overall trend clearly demonstrates that as the number of agents increases, the convergence ratio decreases..."
- Break condition: Convergence rate does not decrease linearly with the number of agents, or the system fails to converge at all in large-scale communities.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm
  - Why needed here: GMM is used to model the distribution of medical tendencies among agents, and the EM algorithm is used to iteratively update the model parameters based on the data received from other agents.
  - Quick check question: What are the two main steps of the EM algorithm, and how do they contribute to the GMM parameter estimation?

- Concept: Markov Games and Bayesian Inference
  - Why needed here: Markov games provide the framework for modeling the interactions between agents in the healthcare environment, and Bayesian inference is used to update agents' beliefs about prescriptive norms based on observed actions.
  - Quick check question: How does the Bellman equation relate to the agents' decision-making process in the Markov game?

- Concept: KL Divergence
  - Why needed here: KL divergence is used to measure the difference between the agents' perceived descriptive norms (SINP) and the actual collective norms (OBJ), providing a quantitative measure of norm perception accuracy.
  - Quick check question: What does it mean if the KL divergence between two probability distributions is zero?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Agents -> Communication Network -> Descriptive Norm Module -> Prescriptive Norm Module -> External Regulation
- Critical path: 1. Agents exchange medical tendency information. 2. Descriptive Norm Module updates SINP using GMM and EM. 3. Prescriptive Norm Module observes actions and updates beliefs using Bayesian inference. 4. External Regulation verifies and refines learned norms through practice.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Fully connected network vs. sparse network: Fully connected network ensures all agents have access to information but may be computationally expensive for large-scale systems.
  - GMM complexity: More components in the GMM can lead to better norm representation but also increase computational complexity.
  - Belief update frequency: More frequent updates can lead to faster learning but may also introduce noise and instability.
- Failure signatures:
  - High KL divergence between SINP and OBJ: Indicates poor descriptive norm perception.
  - Agents converging to irrelevant or invalid prescriptive norms: Indicates issues with the Bayesian inference or external regulation mechanisms.
  - Slow or no convergence in large-scale communities: Indicates information exchange bottlenecks or insufficient data.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement the descriptive norm learning module with a small number of agents (e.g., 5) and verify that the KL divergence converges to below 0.1.
  2. Implement the prescriptive norm learning module with a small number of agents (e.g., 5) and verify that agents learn the core clinical protocols.
  3. Gradually increase the number of agents and observe the convergence rate, verifying that it decreases linearly as the number of agents increases.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the model's performance scale beyond 110 agents in large-scale healthcare environments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that maintaining a higher level of awareness of descriptive norms in large-scale multi-agent systems (with far more than 80 medical agents) remains an interesting challenge.
- Why unresolved: The experiments only tested up to 110 agents, and the convergence rate decreased linearly with increasing agent numbers. The model's behavior and effectiveness in even larger systems is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing the model's performance with 200+, 500+, or 1000+ agents would provide insights into its scalability and identify potential bottlenecks or limitations in large-scale healthcare environments.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the model autonomously and rationally infer correct and useful clinical protocols without relying on external regulation mechanisms?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that while external regulation mechanisms like 'norm practice' were introduced to address issues, the deeper issue lies in exploring the general mathematical properties of the model's internal probabilities to enable autonomous and rational inference of correct clinical protocols.
- Why unresolved: The current model relies on external regulation to prevent convergence to non-functional norms. Achieving autonomous and rational inference without this reliance remains a challenge.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrating the model's ability to learn and converge on correct clinical protocols without external regulation, while maintaining accuracy and avoiding convergence to irrelevant norms, would resolve this question.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the model be extended to handle the vast diversity of medical norms and dissemination channels beyond clinical protocols and recommendations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges that the diversity in types and dissemination channels of medical norms is vast, and this study focused solely on clinical protocols and recommendations within the given dataset.
- Why unresolved: The model's current scope is limited to a specific subset of medical norms. Extending it to handle the broader range of medical norms and their diverse dissemination channels presents a significant challenge.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successfully applying the model to learn and adapt to different types of medical norms (e.g., ethical guidelines, administrative protocols) and their various dissemination channels (e.g., official requirements, best practices) would demonstrate its generalizability and effectiveness in real-world healthcare scenarios.

## Limitations
- Model performance heavily depends on quality and completeness of practice-sharing information, which may be incomplete or biased in real-world healthcare settings
- Fully connected communication network assumption may not hold in practice due to network constraints and agent availability
- Study relies on single medical center dataset (2016-2020), limiting generalizability across different healthcare systems and time periods

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The descriptive norm learning mechanism using GMM and EM algorithms
- Medium Confidence: The prescriptive norm learning through Bayesian rule induction in Markov games
- Medium Confidence: The linear relationship between agent count and convergence rate

## Next Checks
1. Test the system with synthetic datasets containing known ground truth norms to quantify the accuracy of both descriptive and prescriptive norm learning under controlled conditions
2. Implement and evaluate alternative communication network topologies (e.g., random graphs, small-world networks) to assess the impact of network structure on convergence rates and norm learning accuracy
3. Conduct cross-validation using datasets from multiple medical centers to evaluate the model's generalizability and identify potential biases in norm perception across different institutional contexts
