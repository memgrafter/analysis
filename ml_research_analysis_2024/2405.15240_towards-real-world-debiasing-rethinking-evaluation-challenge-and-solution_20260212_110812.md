# Towards Real-world Debiasing: Rethinking Evaluation, Challenge, and Solution

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.15240
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15240
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Existing debiasing benchmarks poorly represent real-world biases, which are typically low in both magnitude and prevalence; DiD method significantly improves performance on low-prevalence biases.

## Executive Summary
This paper critically examines the realism of existing debiasing benchmarks and reveals that they poorly represent real-world biases, which are typically low in both magnitude and prevalence. The authors propose a fine-grained framework for analyzing bias, combining empirical and theoretical insights to show that high-prevalence biases assumed by current benchmarks require strong assumptions not met in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, they introduce two novel real-world-inspired bias types (low magnitude/low prevalence and high magnitude/low prevalence) and build a systematic evaluation framework called RDBench. The paper identifies a key challenge—sparse bias capturing—in real-world debiasing without bias labels, where dominant non-biased samples cause biased models to overlook bias-conflicting cases. They propose a simple yet effective method, Debias in Destruction (DiD), which destroys target features during bias model training to improve bias capture.

## Method Summary
The method, Debias in Destruction (DiD), works by destroying target features during the training of a biased auxiliary model. This feature destruction forces the model to focus only on bias-related features, breaking the dominant non-biased sample learning loop that causes sparse bias capturing. The approach can be applied to existing debiasing methods by modifying their biased model training phase. DiD uses target feature destructive transformations (like patch-shuffle for vision and word shuffling for NLP) to make target features unlearnable, ensuring the biased model can only capture bias features and creating clear loss distinctions between bias-conflicting and bias-aligned samples.

## Key Results
- DiD significantly improves performance on low-prevalence biases, boosting accuracy by up to +32.6 points on BC samples
- Extensive experiments on 8 datasets show DiD consistently effective across various bias types (LMLP, HMLP, HMHP)
- DiD improves average accuracy by +25.8 points while maintaining performance on unbiased data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: DiD Feature Destruction Breaks the Dominant BN Sample Learning Loop
The biased model learns spurious attributes preferentially over target attributes. In real-world scenarios with low prevalence biases, dominant BN samples cause low loss differences between BA and BC samples. DiD applies target feature destructive transformations to make target features unlearnable during biased model training, forcing the model to focus only on bias features. This eliminates side branch learning on BN samples, ensuring proper weighting of BN samples in subsequent training.

### Mechanism 2: Sparse Bias Capturing Challenge is Resolved Through DiD's Focused Learning
Existing methods fail on low prevalence biases because dominant BN samples cause the biased model to overlook bias-conflicting cases. DiD resolves this by destroying target features during biased model training, forcing the model to only learn bias features. This creates clear loss distinctions between BA (high loss) and BC (low loss) samples, enabling accurate bias capture even when BA samples are not the dominant class.

### Mechanism 3: DiD Generalizes Across Multiple Bias Types and Modalities
By destroying target features during biased model training, DiD forces the model to focus on bias features regardless of their prevalence or magnitude. This universal approach works for low magnitude/low prevalence biases where existing methods fail, high magnitude/low prevalence biases where sparse bias capturing is challenging, and high magnitude/high prevalence biases where existing methods already work well. The feature destruction approach is modality-agnostic, working with patch-shuffle for vision and word shuffling for NLP.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: KL Divergence as Bias Magnitude Measure
  - Why needed here: The paper uses KL divergence to measure bias magnitude, requiring understanding of information theory concepts
  - Quick check question: How does KL divergence differ from total variation distance in measuring distribution differences?

- Concept: Spurious Correlation vs Causal Relationship
  - Why needed here: The entire paper builds on understanding the difference between statistical correlations and causal relationships in data
  - Quick check question: Why can a model learn spurious correlations even when there's no causal relationship between features?

- Concept: Biased Feature Prevalence vs Bias Magnitude
  - Why needed here: The paper distinguishes between how prevalent a bias is in the dataset versus how strong the bias is, which is crucial for understanding real-world bias characteristics
  - Quick check question: Can a dataset have high bias magnitude but low bias prevalence? What would that look like?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input pipeline with feature destruction transformation -> Biased auxiliary model (Mb) with destroyed target features -> Debiased model (Md) trained with sample reweighing -> Evaluation framework with multiple bias types and metrics

- Critical path:
  1. Apply feature destructive transformation to training data
  2. Train biased model Mb on transformed data to capture bias features
  3. Use Mb's predictions to calculate sample weights via loss-based reweighing
  4. Train debiased model Md using weighted samples
  5. Evaluate performance on bias-conflicting samples

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Feature destruction strength vs preserving enough information for bias capture
  - Model complexity of Mb vs computational efficiency
  - Choice of bias magnitude threshold for BN sample identification
  - Balance between improving BC accuracy vs maintaining overall accuracy

- Failure signatures:
  - No improvement in BC accuracy despite DiD implementation
  - Significant drop in overall accuracy when applying DiD
  - Inconsistent performance across different bias types
  - Failure to converge during biased model training

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement DiD on Colored MNIST with patch-shuffle destruction, compare BC accuracy with and without DiD
  2. Test different feature destruction strengths (patch sizes) to find optimal balance
  3. Apply DiD to a second dataset (e.g., Corrupted CIFAR10) to verify cross-dataset effectiveness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper doesn't explicitly call out open questions, but based on the content, several important questions emerge:
1. How can we systematically characterize and quantify "sparse bias capturing" challenges in real-world datasets beyond the low prevalence/high magnitude framework?
2. What alternative feature destruction methods could be more effective than patch-shuffling for different types of target features in visual recognition tasks?
3. How does the performance of DiD scale with the number and complexity of concurrent biases in real-world multi-bias scenarios?

## Limitations
- The empirical validation relies heavily on synthetic datasets where bias is artificially injected, not naturally occurring real-world biases
- The cross-modality generalization claims may not hold uniformly as the feature destruction mechanisms differ significantly between vision and NLP tasks
- The evaluation framework RDBench may not capture all real-world bias scenarios, particularly those involving complex interactions between multiple bias types

## Confidence
- Confidence Level: Medium for the core DiD mechanism claims
- Confidence Level: Low for the cross-modality generalization claims
- Confidence Level: Medium for the evaluation framework completeness

## Next Checks
1. Apply DiD to datasets with naturally occurring low-prevalence biases (not artificially injected) to verify the claimed improvements hold outside controlled experimental settings
2. Test DiD's performance when multiple bias types coexist in the same dataset to understand how the method handles complex, real-world bias scenarios where biases are not mutually exclusive
3. Evaluate DiD on datasets with extremely rare bias-conflicting samples (less than 1% prevalence) to determine the method's effectiveness at the extreme end of the low-prevalence spectrum
