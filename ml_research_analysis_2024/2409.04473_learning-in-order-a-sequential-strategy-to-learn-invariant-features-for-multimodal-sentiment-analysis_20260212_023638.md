# Learning in Order! A Sequential Strategy to Learn Invariant Features for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2409.04473
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04473
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Sequential learning strategy for multimodal sentiment analysis achieves state-of-the-art performance on CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and MELD datasets under out-of-distribution settings

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of multimodal sentiment analysis when models must generalize across different domains without access to target domain data. The authors propose a sequential learning strategy that first identifies domain-invariant features from text modality, then uses these features to guide the selection of domain-invariant features from video modality. The approach employs learnable masks and sparse regularization to automatically select relevant features while removing spurious correlations. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting the importance of learning order between modalities for effective generalization.

## Method Summary
The proposed method introduces a sequential learning framework that prioritizes text modality over video modality in the feature learning process. The approach uses learnable masks to identify and select domain-invariant features from each modality, with sparse regularization ensuring the selection of only the most relevant features. The model first learns invariant features from text data, then leverages these learned features to guide the selection of invariant features from video data. This sequential dependency ensures that the video feature selection is constrained by the more robust text-based features, reducing the impact of domain-specific variations in the video modality. The method is trained in a fully unsupervised manner for feature selection, requiring only sentiment labels for the final classification task.

## Key Results
- The proposed sequential learning strategy significantly outperforms state-of-the-art domain generalization methods on CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and MELD datasets
- The model achieves better performance than multimodal large language models on the tested datasets
- Text-first learning demonstrates superior performance compared to alternative learning orders, validating the importance of modality sequencing

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The sequential learning strategy works by leveraging the inherent properties of different modalities. Text modality typically contains more explicit semantic information about sentiment, making it more robust to domain variations compared to video modality, which can be heavily influenced by visual style, background, and presentation differences across domains. By first learning invariant features from text, the model establishes a strong foundation for sentiment understanding that is less susceptible to domain-specific noise. When video features are subsequently selected using guidance from the text features, the model can filter out spurious correlations and focus on visual cues that genuinely support the sentiment prediction. The learnable masks with sparse regularization provide an automated mechanism for feature selection without requiring manual specification of which features to keep or discard.

## Foundational Learning
- **Domain Generalization:** Why needed - Enables models to perform well on unseen target domains without requiring target data. Quick check - Evaluate performance drop when tested on different domains than training.
- **Multimodal Learning:** Why needed - Sentiment is expressed through multiple channels (text, audio, visual) that provide complementary information. Quick check - Compare performance with single modality versus multimodal input.
- **Invariant Feature Learning:** Why needed - Identifies features that remain consistent across different domains, enabling better generalization. Quick check - Measure feature stability across domain shifts using correlation metrics.
- **Sparse Regularization:** Why needed - Encourages selection of only the most relevant features, reducing overfitting to domain-specific noise. Quick check - Analyze feature selection patterns and their correlation with performance.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Text feature extractor -> Learnable mask -> Text invariant features -> Video feature extractor -> Learnable mask -> Video invariant features -> Fusion layer -> Classifier

**Critical Path:** The critical path flows from text feature extraction through the first learnable mask to obtain text invariant features, which then guide the video feature selection process through the second learnable mask. The selected invariant features from both modalities are fused and passed to the classifier for final sentiment prediction.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The sequential approach trades off potential parallel processing efficiency for improved feature selection quality. By constraining video feature selection with text features, the model may miss some video-specific sentiment indicators that don't align with text patterns, but gains robustness against domain-specific visual variations.

**Failure Signatures:** The model may underperform when text and video modalities provide contradictory sentiment signals, or when the text modality itself is domain-dependent. Performance degradation could also occur when visual sentiment cues are crucial but not well-represented in the text modality.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Compare performance of text-first, video-first, and parallel learning strategies to quantify the impact of learning order
2. Evaluate feature selection quality by measuring the correlation between selected features and ground truth sentiment labels
3. Test the model's robustness to increasing levels of domain shift by gradually modifying source domain characteristics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The sequential learning approach's effectiveness beyond sentiment analysis tasks remains unverified
- The assumption that text modality provides more domain-invariant features than video may not hold across all datasets
- The learnable masks and sparse regularization could introduce their own selection biases not fully explored
- Experimental validation is limited to three specific datasets, requiring broader testing for generalization claims

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the core methodology and mathematical formulation
- **Medium confidence** in the superiority over existing domain generalization methods, pending broader validation
- **Medium confidence** in the practical applicability beyond the specific sentiment analysis domain

## Next Checks
1. Test the sequential learning approach on non-sentiment multimodal tasks to verify cross-domain applicability
2. Conduct ablation studies removing the text-first constraint to quantify the importance of learning order
3. Evaluate performance degradation when training with varying amounts of source domain data to establish data efficiency boundaries
