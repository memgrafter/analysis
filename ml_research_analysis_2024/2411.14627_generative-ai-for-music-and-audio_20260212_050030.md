## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores generative AI for music and audio through three primary research directions: multitrack music generation, assistive music creation tools, and multimodal learning for audio and music. The work introduces several novel contributions including MusPy, a comprehensive toolkit for symbolic music generation, and various deep learning models for music performance synthesis, sound separation, and text-to-audio synthesis. The research demonstrates how these models can effectively learn to generate and manipulate music and audio, offering new possibilities for music creation and audio production. The approach combines symbolic music processing with audio synthesis techniques to create systems that can both understand musical structure and produce high-quality audio outputs.

## Method Summary
The dissertation presents a multi-faceted approach to generative AI for music and audio. The research introduces MusPy, a Python toolkit that provides standardized data structures and processing pipelines for symbolic music generation tasks. For multitrack music generation, the Multitrack Music Transformer (MMT) is developed, which can generate multi-instrument compositions while maintaining faster inference speeds compared to existing models. The assistive music creation tools include automatic instrumentation models that can assign appropriate instruments to musical notes, and Deep Performer, a score-to-audio synthesis system that generates natural musical performances from written scores. The multimodal learning components include CLIPSep for text-queried sound separation and CLIPSonic for text-to-audio synthesis, both of which are trained without requiring paired text-audio data. These models leverage contrastive learning and transformer architectures to achieve their respective tasks while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Key Results
- MusPy toolkit provides comprehensive support for symbolic music generation including dataset management and model evaluation
- MMT achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art systems with faster inference speed for multi-instrument music generation
- Deep Performer successfully synthesizes natural musical performances from scores with high fidelity
- CLIPSep and CLIPSonic demonstrate effective sound separation and text-to-audio synthesis without requiring text-audio pairs during training

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of these generative models stems from their ability to learn hierarchical representations of music and audio data. The symbolic music models (MusPy and MMT) work by encoding musical structures at multiple timescales, from individual notes to entire compositions, allowing them to capture both local melodic patterns and global musical form. The score-to-audio synthesis (Deep Performer) bridges the gap between symbolic representations and raw audio by learning the mapping between musical scores and their expressive performances, including timing variations, dynamics, and articulation. The multimodal models (CLIPSep and CLIPSonic) leverage large-scale pretraining on diverse audio and text data, enabling them to understand semantic relationships between textual descriptions and audio content without explicit supervision. The transformer architectures used throughout provide the ability to model long-range dependencies in music and audio sequences, which is crucial for maintaining coherence in generated outputs.

## Foundational Learning
- Symbolic music representation: Understanding how musical scores are encoded as structured data (why needed: enables algorithmic manipulation of musical elements; quick check: can convert MIDI files to/from internal representation)
- Multitrack composition modeling: Learning how multiple instruments interact in musical arrangements (why needed: essential for realistic ensemble generation; quick check: can separate and recombine instrument tracks)
- Score-to-audio synthesis: Mapping from symbolic scores to expressive audio performances (why needed: bridges gap between composition and production; quick check: can generate audio from simple piano scores)
- Contrastive learning for audio: Training models using similarity relationships rather than explicit labels (why needed: enables training without paired text-audio data; quick check: can cluster similar audio clips without labels)
- Transformer attention mechanisms: Understanding self-attention for sequence modeling (why needed: captures long-range dependencies in music; quick check: can model dependencies across multiple measures)

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: MusPy -> MMT -> Deep Performer -> CLIPSep/CLIPSonic

Critical path: Symbolic music processing (MusPy) → Multitrack generation (MMT) → Performance synthesis (Deep Performer) → Multimodal audio processing (CLIPSep/CLIPSonic)

Design tradeoffs: The models balance between computational efficiency and generation quality, with MMT prioritizing faster inference while maintaining comparable performance to slower state-of-the-art systems. The multimodal models trade explicit supervision for the flexibility of training without text-audio pairs, which requires more sophisticated training strategies but enables broader applicability.

Failure signatures: Symbolic models may generate musically incoherent compositions when attention mechanisms fail to capture long-range dependencies. Score-to-audio synthesis can produce mechanical performances lacking human expressiveness when dynamics and timing variations are not properly learned. Multimodal models may generate audio that loosely matches text descriptions when the semantic alignment between modalities is weak.

First experiments:
1. Generate a simple melody using MusPy and verify correct MIDI output
2. Test MMT on a single-instrument composition before scaling to multitrack generation
3. Validate Deep Performer with a pre-scored classical piece to assess performance quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalizability across diverse musical genres and styles requires further validation
- Quality and diversity of generated outputs across various text prompts for multimodal models remain unclear
- The exact benchmark datasets and evaluation protocols would benefit from more explicit documentation

## Confidence
- Technical implementations and core models: High
- Performance comparisons: Medium (depends on benchmark transparency)
- Generalizability across music styles: Low
- Multimodal learning effectiveness: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Conduct genre-transfer experiments to test model performance across diverse musical styles (classical, jazz, electronic, pop) using standardized evaluation metrics
2. Perform ablation studies on the text-free training approach for CLIPSep and CLIPSonic to quantify the impact of different training strategies
3. Implement cross-validation using multiple benchmark datasets to verify the reproducibility of the claimed performance improvements over state-of-the-art systems
