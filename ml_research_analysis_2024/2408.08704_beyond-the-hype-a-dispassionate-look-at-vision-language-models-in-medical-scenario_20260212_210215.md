# Beyond the Hype: A dispassionate look at vision-language models in medical scenario

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2408.08704
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08704
- **Reference count:** 32
- **Key outcome:** This study introduces RadVUQA, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate large vision-language models (LVLMs) in medical imaging scenarios across five key dimensions: anatomical understanding, multimodal comprehension, quantitative and spatial reasoning, physiological knowledge, and robustness.

## Executive Summary
This study introduces RadVUQA, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate large vision-language models (LVLMs) in medical imaging scenarios across five key dimensions: anatomical understanding, multimodal comprehension, quantitative and spatial reasoning, physiological knowledge, and robustness. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on simple visual question answering, RadVUQA systematically assesses LVLMs' capabilities through open-ended and close-ended questions, testing performance against synthetic data, unharmonized imaging protocols, and the effectiveness of chain-of-thought prompting strategies. The evaluation of nine LVLMs, including both general-purpose and medical-specific models, reveals critical deficiencies in multimodal comprehension and quantitative reasoning, with GPT-4o achieving the highest overall performance while medical-specific models like Huatuo-34b demonstrate competitive capabilities.

## Method Summary
The study constructs RadVUQA using multi-source CT and MRI datasets (10,759 images, 193,662 QA pairs) and evaluates nine LVLMs including GPT-4o, medical-specific models like Huatuo-34b, and general-purpose models. Models are fine-tuned on the dataset and evaluated using commercial LLMs as judges, measuring response accuracy, hallucination scores, and multiple-choice accuracy across five dimensions: anatomical understanding, multimodal comprehension, quantitative and spatial reasoning, physiological knowledge, and robustness. The benchmark includes synthetic data and unharmonized imaging protocols to test model generalization.

## Key Results
- GPT-4o achieved the highest overall performance among evaluated models, though no model achieved clinical-level performance
- Medical-specific models like Huatuo-34b demonstrated competitive capabilities despite lower overall rankings
- Critical deficiencies were identified in multimodal comprehension and quantitative reasoning across all evaluated LVLMs
- Chain-of-thought prompting strategies showed variable effectiveness depending on the task type and model architecture

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The proposed RadVUQA benchmark is effective because it targets high-level cognitive abilities rather than simple VQA tasks.
- Mechanism: By designing questions that probe anatomical understanding, multimodal comprehension, quantitative and spatial reasoning, physiological knowledge, and robustness, RadVUQA systematically evaluates whether models truly understand medical images or are just pattern-matching.
- Core assumption: The five dimensions used in RadVUQA correspond to clinically relevant skills that are necessary for medical AI applications.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "RadVUQA systematically assesses LVLMs' capabilities through open-ended and close-ended questions, testing performance against synthetic data, unharmonized imaging protocols, and the effectiveness of chain-of-thought prompting strategies."
  - [section] "RadVUQA mainly validates LVLMs across five dimensions: 1) Anatomical understanding, 2) Multimodal comprehension, 3) Quantitative and spatial reasoning, 4) Physiological knowledge, and 5) Robustness."
- Break condition: If models could achieve high scores on RadVUQA by exploiting surface-level correlations without genuine comprehension, the benchmark would fail to measure what it claims.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Including both general-purpose and medical-specific LVLMs in the evaluation reveals critical deficiencies in multimodal comprehension and quantitative reasoning.
- Mechanism: By comparing nine different models, including GPT-4o, medical-specific models like Huatuo-34b, and general LVLMs, the study identifies where each type excels or falls short, highlighting the gap between current LVLMs and clinical requirements.
- Core assumption: Different model architectures and training datasets will lead to different strengths and weaknesses in medical imaging tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The evaluation of nine LVLMs, including both general-purpose and medical-specific models, reveals critical deficiencies in multimodal comprehension and quantitative reasoning, with GPT-4o achieving the highest overall performance while medical-specific models like Huatuo-34b demonstrate competitive capabilities."
  - [section] "We investigate nine solid LVLMs, including three medical-specific LVLMs (LLaV A-Med and Huatuo) and four general LVLMs (LLava, InternVL, MiniCPM, and BLIP2). Additionally, we further include two superior commercial models, GPT-4o and Gemini-1.50-pro to test the upper-bound performance of current LVLMs."
- Break condition: If the performance differences between model types were due to random factors rather than systematic architectural or training differences, the conclusions about deficiencies would be invalid.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using synthetic data, unharmonized imaging protocols, and chain-of-thought prompting strategies in the benchmark reveals robustness issues and the effectiveness of different prompting techniques.
- Mechanism: By testing models on data that varies from standard clinical protocols (e.g., different CT windowing settings, motion blur, low resolution), the benchmark assesses whether models can generalize beyond idealized training conditions.
- Core assumption: Real-world medical imaging data is heterogeneous and models need to be robust to variations in acquisition protocols and image quality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "RadVUQA systematically assesses LVLMs' capabilities through open-ended and close-ended questions, testing performance against synthetic data, unharmonized imaging protocols, and the effectiveness of chain-of-thought prompting strategies."
  - [section] "Guided by [22], the OOD subsets were designed to assess the models' capability against these different scenarios, including noise, diverse contrast, sharpness, motion blur, low-dose scanning, etc."
- Break condition: If the robustness tests used scenarios that were too extreme or unrealistic compared to actual clinical practice, the results might not be clinically relevant.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Anatomical understanding in medical imaging
  - Why needed here: Models must correctly identify and name anatomical structures to be useful in clinical settings
  - Quick check question: Can the model distinguish between the spleen and left kidney in a CT scan when both are visible?

- Concept: Multimodal comprehension
  - Why needed here: Medical tasks often require integrating visual information with textual instructions or contextual knowledge
  - Quick check question: Can the model identify which structure is inside a green bounding box when given both the image and the instruction "What is the structure within the green bounding box?"

- Concept: Quantitative and spatial reasoning
  - Why needed here: Clinical decisions often depend on measurements, proportions, and spatial relationships between structures
  - Quick check question: Can the model determine the relative position of the small intestine compared to the liver when both are marked with yellow boxes?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data preprocessing pipeline (CT/MRI image loading, normalization, windowing)
  - Question generation system (mapping anatomical structures to QA pairs)
  - Model inference interface (supports multiple LVLM APIs and open-source models)
  - Evaluation framework (LLM-based scoring system with response accuracy, hallucination detection, and multiple-choice accuracy metrics)
  - Robustness testing module (synthetic data generation, image augmentation for unharmonized data)

- Critical path:
  1. Load and preprocess medical images
  2. Generate context-appropriate questions based on anatomical labels
  3. Run model inference on each question-image pair
  4. Evaluate responses using the LLM judge
  5. Aggregate results across all dimensions and modalities

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using LLM-based evaluation vs human annotation: LLM scoring is faster and more consistent but may miss nuanced errors that human experts would catch
  - Including both open-ended and close-ended questions: Provides comprehensive assessment but increases evaluation complexity
  - Testing on synthetic vs real data: Synthetic data allows controlled experiments but may not fully represent real-world variability

- Failure signatures:
  - Low anatomical understanding scores with high hallucination rates: Model is guessing rather than recognizing structures
  - Poor performance on unharmonized data but good on standard data: Model overfits to specific imaging protocols
  - Chain-of-thought prompting decreases performance: Model's reasoning capabilities are limited or the prompting strategy is inappropriate for the task

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test a single model on a small subset of RadVUQA-CT with basic anatomical questions to verify the evaluation pipeline works
  2. Compare performance on CT vs MRI for the same model to identify modality-specific strengths/weaknesses
  3. Run the same questions with and without chain-of-thought prompting to measure the impact of this technique on model performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does Chain-of-Thought prompting specifically affect the performance of large vision-language models on medical tasks involving complex spatial reasoning and multimodal comprehension?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting on improving the reasoning capabilities of LVLMs in medical tasks, highlighting improvements in multimodal comprehension and spatial reasoning.
- Why unresolved: While the paper shows that CoT improves performance in certain areas, it does not provide a detailed analysis of how CoT affects specific reasoning tasks or the underlying mechanisms that lead to these improvements.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting controlled experiments that isolate the impact of CoT on different reasoning tasks, such as spatial reasoning and multimodal comprehension, and analyzing the intermediate reasoning steps to understand the improvement mechanisms.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the potential benefits and challenges of integrating explainable AI (XAI) techniques into large vision-language models for medical applications?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions the promise of explainable AI for interpreting model decisions, which is crucial for clinician trust and regulatory compliance, but does not delve into the specific benefits or challenges of such integration.
- Why unresolved: The integration of XAI into LVLMs is a complex process that requires addressing technical, ethical, and regulatory challenges, which are not fully explored in the paper.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing XAI methods tailored for LVLMs in medical contexts, evaluating their effectiveness in improving transparency and trust, and addressing the associated challenges.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can federated learning be effectively implemented to train large vision-language models on distributed healthcare data while ensuring data privacy and model robustness?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the potential of federated learning to train LVLMs on distributed data without transferring sensitive information, but does not explore the practical implementation challenges.
- Why unresolved: Implementing federated learning for LVLMs involves technical challenges such as data heterogeneity, communication efficiency, and maintaining model robustness, which are not fully addressed.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting case studies or pilot projects that implement federated learning for LVLMs in healthcare settings, evaluating the effectiveness and challenges, and proposing solutions to overcome identified obstacles.

## Limitations
- The evaluation relies on LLM-based judges for scoring responses, which may introduce their own biases or inconsistencies
- The synthetic data used for robustness testing may not fully capture the complexity and variability of real-world clinical data
- The study focuses on static imaging modalities (CT and MRI) and does not address dynamic imaging or video-based medical scenarios

## Confidence
High confidence in claims about: (1) the existence of critical deficiencies in multimodal comprehension and quantitative reasoning among current LVLMs, (2) GPT-4o's superior performance compared to other evaluated models, and (3) the general gap between current LVLMs and clinical requirements based on the benchmark results.

Medium confidence in claims about: (1) the specific ranking of medical-specific vs general LVLMs, as this may depend on the particular tasks and data used in RadVUQA, (2) the effectiveness of chain-of-thought prompting strategies, which may vary by model architecture and task type, and (3) the clinical relevance of the identified deficiencies, as the study does not validate findings with practicing clinicians.

## Next Checks
1. **Clinical Expert Review**: Have practicing radiologists or medical imaging specialists review a sample of model responses to assess whether the identified deficiencies align with real clinical concerns and whether the benchmark questions accurately reflect clinically relevant scenarios.

2. **Cross-Dataset Validation**: Test the same LVLMs on independent medical imaging datasets not used in RadVUQA to determine whether performance patterns generalize beyond the specific data distribution used in this study.

3. **Real-World Deployment Study**: Conduct a controlled deployment of the top-performing LVLMs in a clinical setting (e.g., assisting with preliminary report generation) to measure actual utility and identify any additional limitations not captured by the benchmark.
