# Multi-view Granular-ball Contrastive Clustering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.13550
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13550

- Primary result: Achieves competitive or superior clustering performance on seven benchmark datasets with best results showing ACC 95.77%, NMI 87.21%, PUR 95.77% on BBCSport

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Multi-view Granular-ball Contrastive Clustering (MGBCC), a novel deep multi-view clustering method that performs contrastive learning at the granular-ball level. The method addresses limitations of existing instance-level and cluster-level contrastive approaches by constructing granular balls in the latent space to preserve local topological structure while establishing associations between intra-view and cross-view granular balls based on overlap and intersection size. Experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate MGBCC achieves competitive or superior clustering performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

## Method Summary
MGBCC constructs autoencoders for each view to map data into a shared latent space, where granular balls are generated using k-means clustering. These granular balls preserve local topological structure better than instance-level approaches while avoiding the coarseness of cluster-level methods. The method establishes intra-view associations based on overlap and cross-view associations based on intersection size between granular balls. A combined loss function incorporating both reconstruction and granular-ball contrastive losses is optimized to learn discriminative features for clustering. Final clustering is performed using k-means on the fused features from all views.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance with ACC 95.77%, NMI 87.21%, PUR 95.77% on BBCSport dataset
- Demonstrates effectiveness across seven benchmark datasets with varying characteristics
- Shows particular strength in handling the trade-off between consistency and diversity across views
- Avoids false negatives common in instance-level contrastive methods while preserving local structures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Granular-ball representation preserves local topological structure better than instance-level or cluster-level approaches by grouping neighboring samples into coarse-grained granular balls, maintaining local relationships while reducing contrastive pairs.

### Mechanism 2
Cross-view granular-ball association based on intersection size is more robust than one-to-one sample correspondence, considering granular balls from different views as associated if they share sufficient common samples.

### Mechanism 3
Combined reconstruction and contrastive loss optimizes both feature quality and cluster discriminability, with reconstruction ensuring meaningful representations while contrastive learning encourages associated granular balls to be close in latent space.

## Foundational Learning

- **Multi-view data representation**: Understanding how different views of the same sample relate to each other is fundamental to multi-view clustering. *Quick check*: What is the key challenge in multi-view clustering mentioned in the introduction?
- **Contrastive learning fundamentals**: The method builds on contrastive learning principles but applies them at the granular-ball level. *Quick check*: How does the method define positive and negative pairs differently from traditional contrastive learning?
- **Granular-ball computing principles**: The entire method relies on constructing and using granular balls to represent local structures in data. *Quick check*: What is the main advantage of using granular balls over individual samples or clusters?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Autoencoders (Ev, Dv) -> Granular-ball generation module -> Cross-view association computation -> Contrastive loss calculation -> Reconstruction loss calculation -> Combined optimization
- **Critical path**: Data → Autoencoders → Latent space → Granular-ball generation → Association establishment → Contrastive learning → Clustering
- **Design tradeoffs**: Granularity parameter p vs. computational efficiency and local structure preservation; Dimension d of latent space vs. information retention and computational complexity; Threshold τ for cross-view association vs. robustness and number of associations
- **Failure signatures**: Poor clustering performance across all metrics suggests issues with overall framework; Good reconstruction but poor clustering suggests contrastive learning isn't working effectively; High variance in results across datasets suggests sensitivity to hyperparameters
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Run with p=1 (instance-level contrastive) to verify baseline performance; 2) Run with p=2 to test core granular-ball mechanism; 3) Vary threshold τ to find optimal cross-view association settings

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: How does MGBCC performance scale with increasing numbers of views beyond the typical 2-4 views tested? The paper demonstrates effectiveness on existing benchmark datasets without exploring behavior as view count increases significantly.
- **Open Question 2**: What is the theoretical relationship between granularity parameter p and optimal clustering performance across different dataset types? The paper empirically shows p=2 works well but provides only empirical observations without theoretical grounding.
- **Open Question 3**: How does MGBCC perform on incomplete or partially observed multi-view datasets compared to methods specifically designed for such scenarios? The paper acknowledges this limitation and plans future work to handle incomplete data.

## Limitations

- Performance heavily depends on hyperparameter selection, particularly granularity parameter p and threshold τ for cross-view associations
- Assumes samples within granular balls are semantically related, which may not hold for datasets with complex cluster structures
- Limited sensitivity analysis for critical parameters that significantly impact experimental results

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Basic mechanism of preserving local topological structure through granular-ball representation is well-founded
- **Medium confidence**: Effectiveness of dual-loss optimization in improving clustering performance is demonstrated empirically but lacks theoretical justification
- **Low confidence**: Claim that intersection-based cross-view association is more robust than exact sample correspondence needs more rigorous validation

## Next Checks

1. **Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary granularity parameter p (2, 4, 8, 16) and threshold τ (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7) across all datasets to quantify their impact on clustering performance.

2. **Ablation study**: Evaluate MGBCC with only reconstruction loss, only contrastive loss, and various combinations to isolate contribution of each component to overall performance improvement.

3. **Robustness testing**: Introduce controlled amounts of noise (10%, 20%, 30%) to input features and evaluate whether intersection-based cross-view association mechanism maintains effectiveness compared to exact correspondence methods.
