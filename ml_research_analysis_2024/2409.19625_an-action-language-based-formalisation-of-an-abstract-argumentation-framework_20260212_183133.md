# An action language-based formalisation of an abstract argumentation framework

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.19625
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19625
- Reference count: 28
- One-line primary result: Introduces an action language-based framework to model abstract argumentation with ordered argument enunciation, enabling unique dialogue outcomes and explanations.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a novel framework for modeling abstract argumentation graphs that incorporates the order of argument enunciation using action description languages (ADL). By transforming abstract argumentation frameworks into ADL contexts with fluents, events, and priority rules, the authors enable temporal reasoning about argument acceptability and guarantee unique outcomes for each dialogue. The approach addresses the challenge of achieving completeness in cyclic argumentation graphs through a "last enunciated last updated" strategy.

## Method Summary
The method involves transforming an abstract argumentation framework (AAF) into an action description language (ADL) context by defining fluents representing argument presence and acceptability states (IN/OUT/UNDEC), along with exogenous events that model acceptability updates. Priority rules are established to ensure termination even in cyclic argumentation graphs. The framework processes a sequence of argument enunciations as actions, triggering events according to the priority rules to update the argumentative state. The final state corresponds to a unique complete extension, with the "last enunciated last updated" strategy ensuring completeness for even-length cycles.

## Key Results
- Proposes an ADL-based transformation of AAFs that captures the order of argument enunciation
- Establishes formal properties of termination and correctness for the complete semantics
- Introduces a "last enunciated last updated" strategy to ensure completeness and unique outcomes
- Demonstrates that the order of enunciation determines a unique argumentative state and complete extension

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The use of exogenous events to model argument acceptability updates ensures termination even in cyclic argumentation graphs.
- Mechanism: By decomposing the acceptability update process into four distinct exogenous events (∆1, ∆2, I1, I2) and enforcing priority rules (R1-R3), the model prevents infinite loops in cycles. The priority rules ensure that arguments are first set to "undecided" before any further transitions occur, breaking potential cycles.
- Core assumption: The priority rules correctly model the intended argumentative semantics and that exogenous events can be triggered in a finite sequence.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "propose a modification of the previous transformation based on a 'last enunciated last updated' strategy, which verifies the second form of completeness."
  - [section] "By doing so, all attackers of x may become unaccepted and so the status of x may not change."
  - [corpus] Weak - the corpus papers focus on extensions, rejection, and LLMs, not on cyclic termination in ADL-based argumentation.
- Break condition: If the priority rules are incorrectly defined or if the exogenous events do not cover all necessary transitions, termination may fail.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The formal properties (termination and correctness) are preserved under the modified "last enunciated last updated" strategy.
- Mechanism: The modification introduces a new fluent 'lx' that marks recently enunciated arguments, ensuring they are updated last. This prevents premature updates that could disrupt the intended semantics.
- Core assumption: The new fluent and event structure correctly captures the temporal dependencies without introducing new inconsistencies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we propose a modification of the previous transformation based on a 'last enunciated last updated' strategy, which verifies the second form of completeness."
  - [section] "By doing so, all attackers of x may become unaccepted and so the status of x may not change."
  - [corpus] Weak - the corpus does not address completeness strategies in ADL-based argumentation.
- Break condition: If the new fluent 'lx' or the modified events introduce contradictions or fail to enforce the intended update order.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The second form of completeness is achieved by ensuring a unique outcome for each dialogue based on the order of enunciation.
- Mechanism: By modeling the dialogue as a sequence of actions and enforcing the "last enunciated last updated" strategy, the model guarantees that each order of enunciation leads to a unique argumentative state, which corresponds to a unique complete extension.
- Core assumption: The argumentative setting χ correctly captures the dialogue order and that the final state is always a Σc-argumentative state.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we have the means to deduce a unique outcome for each dialogue, called an extension."
  - [section] "Therefore, modelling a dialogue with the formalism we propose instead of an argumentation framework allows us, thanks to the order of enunciation, to output a unique complete extension i.e. a unique outcome for the dialogue."
  - [corpus] Weak - the corpus papers do not discuss uniqueness of outcomes based on dialogue order.
- Break condition: If multiple argumentative states can be reached from the same dialogue order, or if the final state is not always a Σc-argumentative state.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Labelled Transition Systems (LTS) and Action Description Languages (ADL)
  - Why needed here: The paper uses an LTS and ADL to model the temporal evolution of argumentation graphs, capturing the order of argument enunciation.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a state in an LTS and an argumentative state in this paper's framework?

- Concept: Abstract Argumentation Frameworks (AAF) and Dung's semantics
  - Why needed here: The paper builds upon AAFs and Dung's semantics to incorporate temporality, so understanding the base concepts is crucial.
  - Quick check question: What are the three possible acceptability statuses of an argument in a cyclic argumentation framework?

- Concept: Priority rules and event triggering in ADLs
  - Why needed here: The paper relies on priority rules to ensure termination and correctness, so understanding how events are triggered and prioritized is essential.
  - Quick check question: How do the priority rules R1-R3 prevent infinite loops in cyclic argumentation graphs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Arguments (A) -> Attack Relations (R) -> Fluents (F) -> Events (E) -> Priority Rules (≻) -> Argumentative Setting (χ)

- Critical path:
  1. Initialize the context κ with the dialogue and argumentation graph.
  2. Define the fluents and events based on the arguments and attack relations.
  3. Establish the priority rules to ensure termination and correctness.
  4. Input a sequence of actions (enunciations) to determine the unique path.
  5. Execute the path, triggering events and updating the state.
  6. Output the final argumentative state, which corresponds to a unique complete extension.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using exogenous events and priority rules ensures termination but adds complexity to the model.
  - The "last enunciated last updated" strategy guarantees uniqueness but may not always reflect the intended argumentative semantics.
  - Focusing on the complete semantics allows for a simpler model but limits the applicability to other semantics.

- Failure signatures:
  - If the priority rules are incorrectly defined, the model may not terminate or may produce incorrect results.
  - If the exogenous events do not cover all necessary transitions, the model may get stuck in an intermediate state.
  - If the argumentative setting χ is not correctly defined, the model may produce multiple outcomes for the same dialogue order.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the model on a simple acyclic argumentation graph to verify that it produces the expected outcome.
  2. Test the model on a cyclic argumentation graph to verify that it terminates and produces a unique outcome.
  3. Test the model on a more complex dialogue with multiple arguments and attack relations to verify that it scales and maintains correctness.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the "last enunciated last updated" strategy perform in terms of computational efficiency compared to the original transformation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions this strategy as a modification to handle even-length cycles and improve completeness, but does not provide empirical performance data.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on theoretical properties and does not include experimental evaluations or performance comparisons.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation and benchmarking of both the original and modified transformations on various argumentation graphs, measuring execution time and resource usage.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the formal properties (termination, correctness) be extended to stable semantics, and if so, what modifications would be necessary?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses stable semantics and identifies technical challenges, particularly around termination when no stable extension exists.
- Why unresolved: The authors state that an in-depth study of stable semantics is left for future work and do not provide a complete solution.
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal proof of termination and correctness for stable semantics, or a demonstration that such properties cannot be guaranteed without additional constraints.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the order of enunciation affect the final argumentative state in complex real-world dialogues beyond theoretical examples?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper establishes that order matters for determining unique outcomes, but only demonstrates this with simple examples.
- Why unresolved: The paper is theoretical and does not include case studies or empirical analysis of real dialogue scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Application of the framework to actual dialogue datasets or simulation studies showing how different utterance orders lead to different outcomes in practical scenarios.

## Limitations

- The formal definitions of priority rules R2 and R3 are not fully specified, making it difficult to verify their effectiveness in handling all edge cases.
- The implementation details of the "last enunciated last updated" strategy, including the lx fluent and modified events, are not provided, limiting the ability to assess its completeness guarantees.
- The framework is focused on the complete semantics, which restricts its applicability to other argumentation semantics such as stable or preferred semantics.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core idea of using ADLs to model the temporal evolution of argumentation graphs and the general approach of decomposing acceptability updates into exogenous events are well-founded and align with established concepts in the field.
- **Medium Confidence**: The formal properties (termination and correctness) are likely to hold under the specified conditions, but the lack of precise definitions for the priority rules and the modified events introduces some uncertainty.
- **Low Confidence**: The claim of achieving the second form of completeness through the "last enunciated last updated" strategy is less certain, as the implementation details are not fully provided and the potential for introducing new inconsistencies cannot be ruled out.

## Next Checks

1. Implement and test the priority rules R1-R3 on a range of cyclic argumentation graphs to verify that they indeed prevent infinite loops and ensure termination.
2. Develop a detailed implementation of the "last enunciated last updated" strategy, including the lx fluent and modified events, and test it on sample dialogues to assess its effectiveness in ensuring completeness and uniqueness of outcomes.
3. Extend the framework to handle different argumentation semantics (e.g., stable, preferred) and evaluate its performance and correctness in these settings.
