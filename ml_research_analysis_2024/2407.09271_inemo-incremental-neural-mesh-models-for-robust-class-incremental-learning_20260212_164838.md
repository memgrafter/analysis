# iNeMo: Incremental Neural Mesh Models for Robust Class-Incremental Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.09271
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09271
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Outperforms existing baselines for classification by 2-6% in-domain and by 6-50% in OOD settings; presents first incremental learning approach for pose estimation.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces incremental Neural Mesh Models (iNeMo), a method for robust class-incremental learning in vision tasks. Unlike traditional approaches that train on fixed datasets, iNeMo can learn from continual data streams and handle out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios effectively. The core idea is to extend neural mesh models by adding new meshes over time, using a latent space initialization strategy to allocate feature space for future unseen classes, and employing positional regularization to maintain feature consistency. Experiments on Pascal3D and ObjectNet3D datasets demonstrate that iNeMo outperforms existing baselines for classification by 2-6% in-domain and by 6-50% in OOD settings. Additionally, iNeMo presents the first incremental learning approach for pose estimation, showing significant improvements over traditional methods. Overall, iNeMo enhances robustness and adaptability in continual learning scenarios.

## Method Summary
iNeMo extends neural mesh models to handle class-incremental learning by incrementally adding new neural meshes and leveraging a replay memory with knowledge distillation. The method uses a latent space initialization strategy based on equiangular tight frames to pre-allocate feature space for future unseen classes. During training, iNeMo employs contrastive loss with positional regularization to maintain feature consistency and prevent drift. The approach also includes pose-aware exemplar selection to balance samples across azimuth angles. The model is trained incrementally across tasks, using a replay buffer and knowledge distillation from previous tasks to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

## Key Results
- Outperforms existing baselines for classification by 2-6% in-domain and by 6-50% in OOD settings
- Presents the first incremental learning approach for pose estimation, showing significant improvements over traditional methods
- Demonstrates robust performance on Pascal3D and ObjectNet3D datasets, including out-of-distribution scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Incremental neural mesh models maintain a structured latent space by pre-partitioning it using an equiangular tight frame (ETF) of class centroids, preventing feature drift when new classes are added.
- Mechanism: At initialization, the latent space is sampled uniformly on the unit sphere and partitioned into N clusters around centroids maximally far apart. When adding a new class, its mesh vertices are initialized from the unused partition, and positional regularization (Letf) keeps them close to their centroid.
- Core assumption: The contrastive loss alone does not enforce inter-class separation in incremental settings; explicit latent-space partitioning is needed.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "latent space initialization strategy that enables us to allocate feature space for future unseen classes in advance"
  - [section 4.1] Describes ETF-based centroid placement and partitioning of initial features
  - [corpus] No direct evidence; assumption based on ablation in Table 5 showing performance drop without Letf
- Break condition: If new classes exceed the pre-allocated N, the model must re-partition or collapse partitions, losing the benefit.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Knowledge distillation from the frozen old backbone (Φi−1) preserves feature-space consistency for previously seen classes during new task training.
- Mechanism: When training Φi on new data, the same samples are passed through Φi−1; KL divergence between their feature distributions (Lkd) forces Φi to mimic Φi−1's responses on old-class data.
- Core assumption: Dark knowledge from the old model about old-class features is valuable even when new data is present.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "leveraging a replay memory, presenting a novel regularization scheme and adding newly trained neural meshes"
  - [section 4.2] Equation 9 defines Lkd with small κ3 to extract dark knowledge
  - [corpus] No direct evidence; assumption consistent with prior distillation work in CIL
- Break condition: If κ3 is too large, gradients vanish; if too small, new-task gradients dominate and old knowledge is lost.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Contrastive loss with both old-class features and unused partitions (¯H) keeps the current mesh features from drifting into regions reserved for unseen classes.
- Mechanism: Lcont pulls image features toward their corresponding vertex features while pushing them away from both other current-class vertices and features in ¯H, effectively reserving space for future classes.
- Core assumption: Without explicit separation from ¯H, vertex features will drift and collide with future class partitions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2] Equation 8 shows denominator split into θm∈¯θk and hj∈¯H terms
  - [abstract] "a positional regularization term that forces the features of the different classes to consistently stay in respective latent space regions"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence; assumption supported by ablation showing drop when ¯H constraint removed
- Break condition: If ¯H set is too small or sampling is biased, future classes may still overlap.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Class-incremental learning (CIL)
  - Why needed here: The method must learn new object classes over time without forgetting old ones, which is the core challenge being addressed.
  - Quick check question: What happens to model performance on old classes if we simply fine-tune on new data without replay or regularization?

- Concept: Contrastive learning with von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions
  - Why needed here: It allows matching rendered mesh features to image features in a probabilistic, geometry-aware way, critical for NeMo's 3D consistency.
  - Quick check question: How does the concentration parameter κ control the sharpness of the vMF likelihood, and why is it different for Lcont vs Lkd?

- Concept: Knowledge distillation
  - Why needed here: It preserves the learned feature space of the old model when training the new model, preventing catastrophic forgetting.
  - Quick check question: Why must the concentration κ3 in Lkd be small (<1) compared to κ1 in Lcont?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - 2D CNN backbone (Φ) shared across classes
  - Set of 3D neural meshes {Nc}, one per class, with vertices carrying neural features
  - Background feature set B for non-object pixels
  - Replay buffer E storing exemplars from old classes
  - Latent space H partitioned into N clusters with centroids E

- Critical path:
  1. Pre-train Φ jointly on all classes (upper bound) to establish baseline.
  2. Train with only fine-tuning on new tasks (no replay/reg) to measure forgetting baseline.
  3. Add replay only (herding) to measure benefit of exemplar storage before adding regularization.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Pre-allocating N partitions limits scalability but guarantees separation; dynamic resizing would require re-partitioning.
  - Using vMF likelihoods for matching is more stable than dot-product similarity but adds normalization overhead.
  - Storing exemplars per class increases memory but improves robustness; random sampling is cheaper but less effective.

- Failure signatures:
  - Sharp accuracy drop on old classes → forgetting, likely insufficient Lkd weight or too aggressive learning rate.
  - Confusion between visually similar classes → insufficient separation in latent space, possibly wrong N or κ values.
  - Slow convergence or divergence → poor initialization of meshes or background model, or incorrect η/momentum.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train Φ jointly on all classes (upper bound) to establish baseline.
  2. Train with only fine-tuning on new tasks (no replay/reg) to measure forgetting baseline.
  3. Add replay only (herding) to measure benefit of exemplar storage before adding regularization.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed latent space initialization strategy scale with an increasing number of classes beyond the fixed upper bound N?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions generating centroids for a fixed upper bound of classes N and partitioning the latent space accordingly, but does not discuss scalability beyond this bound.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide insights into how the model adapts or reinitializes the latent space when the number of classes exceeds the predefined limit N, which is crucial for real-world applications with potentially unlimited classes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments demonstrating the model's performance and adaptability when the number of classes significantly exceeds N, or theoretical analysis of the scalability of the latent space initialization strategy.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of the concentration parameters κ1, κ2, and κ3 on the model's performance, and how sensitive is the model to their tuning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper specifies values for the concentration parameters κ1 = 1/0.07 ≈ 14.3, κ2 = 1, and κ3 = 0.5, but does not provide an analysis of their impact on performance or sensitivity to tuning.
- Why unresolved: The choice of concentration parameters is critical for the model's contrastive learning and knowledge distillation processes, yet the paper does not explore how variations in these parameters affect the model's robustness and accuracy.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive ablation study varying κ1, κ2, and κ3 across a wide range, analyzing the resulting performance changes, and identifying optimal ranges for different datasets or tasks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed pose-aware exemplar selection strategy compare to other potential strategies, such as those based on class difficulty or feature diversity?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces a pose-aware exemplar selection strategy that balances samples across azimuth angles, but does not compare it to other strategies.
- Why unresolved: While the pose-aware strategy is shown to improve performance, the paper does not explore whether other strategies, such as selecting exemplars based on class difficulty or maximizing feature diversity, could yield even better results.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments evaluating the pose-aware strategy against alternative exemplar selection methods, such as those based on class difficulty or feature diversity, across multiple datasets and tasks.

## Limitations
- The method requires pre-allocating N partitions in the latent space, which limits scalability when the number of classes exceeds N.
- The assumption that positional regularization alone can maintain feature consistency may not hold for highly complex or similar classes.
- The paper lacks extensive ablation studies on the impact of background feature sampling strategies and the exact configuration of Nbgupdate.

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core mechanism of incremental mesh learning with knowledge distillation and replay buffer is well-established and experimentally validated.
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of the latent space initialization strategy and positional regularization in maintaining feature consistency across tasks is supported by ablation studies but could benefit from further analysis.
- **Low confidence**: The scalability of the method beyond the pre-allocated N partitions and its performance in highly dynamic or noisy environments remains uncertain.

## Next Checks
1. **Scalability test**: Evaluate iNeMo's performance when the number of classes exceeds the pre-allocated N partitions to assess the need for dynamic re-partitioning.
2. **Ablation on background features**: Conduct an ablation study on the impact of different background feature sampling strategies (e.g., Nbgupdate frequency, sampling bias) on model robustness.
3. **Cross-dataset generalization**: Test iNeMo on a more diverse set of datasets with varying levels of class similarity and environmental noise to validate its robustness claims.
