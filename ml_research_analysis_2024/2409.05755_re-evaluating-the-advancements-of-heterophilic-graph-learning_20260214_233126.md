# Re-evaluating the Advancements of Heterophilic Graph Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.05755
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05755
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Identifies critical evaluation pitfalls in heterophilic graph learning and demonstrates that most state-of-the-art GNNs do not significantly outperform baselines on truly challenging datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper critically examines the evaluation practices in heterophilic graph learning research, identifying three major pitfalls: insufficient hyperparameter tuning, inadequate evaluation on truly challenging heterophilic datasets, and lack of quantitative benchmarks for homophily metrics. The authors systematically address these issues by fine-tuning baseline models across 27 benchmark datasets and categorizing them into malignant, benign, and ambiguous heterophilic groups. Through comprehensive experiments with 10 state-of-the-art GNNs, they reveal that most models do not significantly outperform baseline models on truly challenging datasets. Additionally, they propose a Fréchet distance-based quantitative benchmark for comparing homophily metrics on synthetic graphs, demonstrating that traditional metrics remain effective in most cases.

## Method Summary
The authors conduct a systematic evaluation of heterophilic graph learning by first performing extensive hyperparameter tuning on baseline models across 27 benchmark datasets. They then classify these datasets into three categories based on their heterophily levels: malignant (truly challenging), benign (easier), and ambiguous. Using the fine-tuned hyperparameters, they re-evaluate 10 state-of-the-art GNNs to compare their performance against baselines. To address the lack of quantitative benchmarks for homophily metrics, they propose a Fréchet distance-based approach using synthetic graphs to evaluate 11 different homophily metrics, providing a more rigorous comparison framework than previously available.

## Key Results
- Only malignant and ambiguous heterophilic datasets are truly challenging for graph learning models
- Most state-of-the-art GNNs do not significantly outperform baseline models when properly fine-tuned
- Traditional homophily metrics like edge and node homophily remain effective in most cases according to the proposed quantitative benchmark

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper's methodology works by systematically addressing evaluation pitfalls through comprehensive hyperparameter tuning and dataset classification. By fine-tuning baseline models across all 27 benchmark datasets, the authors establish a fair performance baseline that prevents overstated claims about SOTA model superiority. The dataset classification into malignant, benign, and ambiguous categories allows for more nuanced understanding of which heterophilic graphs truly challenge existing models. The Fréchet distance-based quantitative benchmark provides an objective framework for comparing homophily metrics on synthetic graphs, addressing the previous lack of standardized evaluation methods.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Baselines (GCN, GAT) -> Fine-tuning process -> Dataset classification -> SOTA model evaluation -> Quantitative benchmark

**Critical Path**
Fine-tuning baselines → Dataset categorization → SOTA model re-evaluation → Homophily metric benchmarking

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Comprehensive fine-tuning vs. computational cost
- Synthetic graph benchmarking vs. real-world representation
- Traditional metrics vs. novel metric development

**Failure Signatures**
- Overstated SOTA performance due to inadequate hyperparameter tuning
- Misleading conclusions from evaluating only easy heterophilic datasets
- Ineffective homophily metrics due to lack of quantitative comparison framework

**3 First Experiments**
1. Fine-tune baseline models across all 27 benchmark datasets
2. Classify datasets into malignant, benign, and ambiguous categories
3. Evaluate 10 SOTA GNNs using fine-tuned hyperparameters on malignant datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Classification of challenging datasets may evolve as new benchmarks emerge
- Fine-tuning approach covers only 27 datasets, potentially missing broader heterophily patterns
- Quantitative benchmark based on synthetic graphs may not fully capture real-world graph properties

## Confidence
- High confidence: Baseline model performance comparisons and hyperparameter tuning methodology
- Medium confidence: Classification of datasets into heterophilic categories
- Medium confidence: Effectiveness of traditional homophily metrics based on synthetic graph experiments

## Next Checks
1. Replicate experiments on additional real-world heterophilic datasets not included in the original 27 benchmarks to verify robustness of challenging dataset classification
2. Conduct ablation studies removing specific hyperparameters to understand their individual impact on model performance across heterophilic and homophilic graphs
3. Test the quantitative benchmark approach on a diverse set of real-world graphs to validate applicability beyond synthetic data
