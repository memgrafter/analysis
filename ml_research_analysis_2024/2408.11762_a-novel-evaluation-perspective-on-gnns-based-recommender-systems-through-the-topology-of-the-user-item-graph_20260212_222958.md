# A Novel Evaluation Perspective on GNNs-based Recommender Systems through the Topology of the User-Item Graph

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.11762
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11762
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Strong statistical correspondences (adjusted R² > 95%) found between graph topology characteristics and GNN-based recommender system performance

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates how the topological structure of user-item graphs impacts the performance of GNNs-based recommender systems. The authors propose a novel evaluation framework that generates 1,800 reduced-size datasets from popular recommendation datasets using node- and edge-dropout strategies. By calculating classical and topological dataset characteristics and training three different GNN models on these datasets, they demonstrate strong statistical correspondences between graph topology and recommendation performance through linear regression analysis.

## Method Summary
The authors sample and manipulate popular recommendation datasets (Yelp2018, Gowalla, Amazon-Book) using node- and edge-dropout to generate 1,800 size-reduced datasets with varied topological structures. They calculate five classical dataset characteristics (space size, shape, density, Gini coefficient) and three topological characteristics (node degree, clustering coefficient, degree assortativity). Three GNNs-based recommender systems (LightGCN, DGCF, SVD-GCN) are trained and evaluated on these datasets, and an explanatory framework using linear regression is fitted to find statistical correspondences between dataset characteristics and recommendation performance.

## Key Results
- Strong correspondences found between graph topology and GNN performance, with adjusted R² values above 95% for all datasets and models
- Node degree and clustering coefficient show particularly strong explanatory power for recommendation performance
- Joint use of node- and edge-dropout sampling strategies is beneficial for producing meaningful explanations
- Different GNN architectures capture topological properties differently, with LightGCN and DGCF showing higher sensitivity to assortativity measures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GNNs-based recommender systems explicitly integrate node degree into their message-passing layers, and this integration strongly correlates with recommendation performance.
- Mechanism: The graph convolutional layers in LightGCN, DGCF, and SVD-GCN weight neighbor contributions by normalizing with the product of node degrees (√σuσi′), effectively incorporating degree information into the learned embeddings.
- Core assumption: Node degree is a meaningful topological characteristic that captures user activity level (cold-start problem) and item popularity, which are critical for recommendation quality.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The analyzed GNN models explicitly utilize the node degree information during the representation learning phase, each of them in a different way."
  - [abstract] "Results show strong correspondences, particularly for node degree and clustering coefficient, with adjusted R² values above 95% for all datasets and models."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence for this specific mechanism.
- Break condition: If node degree normalization is removed from the message-passing equations or if the correlation between degree and performance disappears.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The joint use of node-dropout and edge-dropout sampling strategies creates a diverse set of datasets that better capture the relationship between topological characteristics and recommendation performance.
- Mechanism: Node-dropout removes nodes and all their connections, while edge-dropout removes edges and potentially disconnects nodes. Combining both strategies ensures that the generated datasets span a wider range of topological structures than using either strategy alone.
- Core assumption: Real-world networks exhibit scale-free properties where high-degree nodes are less frequent than low-degree ones, and sampling must account for this distribution.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "we decide to use ad-hoc graph sampling strategies such as node- and edge-dropout, which have gained recent attention in graph learning literature."
  - [section] "The theoretical and analytical evaluation of the explanatory model for different settings of node- and edge-dropout indicates that their joint combination is beneficial to produce meaningful explanations."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence for this specific sampling mechanism.
- Break condition: If using only node-dropout or only edge-dropout produces equally good or better explanatory models.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Topological characteristics beyond node degree (clustering coefficient and degree assortativity) provide additional explanatory power for GNNs performance, particularly for distinguishing between different GNN architectures.
- Mechanism: Clustering coefficient measures how neighborhoods overlap, capturing collaborative filtering effects. Degree assortativity measures the tendency of similar-degree nodes to connect, providing a "look-ahead" view of the graph structure that multi-layer GNNs can capture.
- Core assumption: These higher-order topological properties are embedded in the graph structure in ways that different GNN architectures can capture differently during training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "clustering coefficient and (especially) degree assortativity may help to recognize how the different models address the topological properties of the graph"
  - [abstract] "strong correspondences between graph topology and GNNs performance, offering a novel evaluation perspective on such approaches"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence for these specific topological mechanisms.
- Break condition: If removing clustering coefficient and assortativity from the explanatory model doesn't significantly reduce model performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph neural networks and message-passing
  - Why needed here: The paper analyzes how GNN-based recommender systems use graph topology, so understanding the message-passing mechanism is fundamental.
  - Quick check question: How does a graph convolutional layer update node embeddings based on their neighbors?

- Concept: Topological graph characteristics (degree, clustering coefficient, assortativity)
  - Why needed here: These are the core dataset characteristics being studied for their impact on recommendation performance.
  - Quick check question: What does a high clustering coefficient indicate about the structure of a graph?

- Concept: Linear regression and statistical significance
  - Why needed here: The paper uses linear regression to find correspondences between characteristics and performance, with statistical tests validating the findings.
  - Quick check question: What does an adjusted R² value above 95% indicate about a regression model's explanatory power?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Original datasets -> Sampled datasets (node/edge dropout) -> Characteristic calculation -> Model training -> Explanatory framework
- Critical path: Data generation -> Characteristic calculation -> Model training -> Explanatory framework
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Sampling strategy: Node-dropout vs edge-dropout vs both
  - Dataset size: Balance between computational cost and statistical significance
  - Model selection: Three GNNs chosen for diversity in architectural approaches
- Failure signatures:
  - Low adjusted R² values (< 80%) indicating poor explanatory power
  - Non-significant regression coefficients (p > 0.05)
  - Inconsistent results across different datasets or models
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Generate a small sample of datasets using only edge-dropout and verify the pipeline produces reasonable results
  2. Compare node-dropout vs edge-dropout performance on a single dataset/model pair
  3. Run the full pipeline on one dataset/model combination to validate all components work together

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different GNNs-based recommender systems (LightGCN, DGCF, SVD-GCN) differentially capture topological characteristics like clustering coefficient and degree assortativity during training?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that LightGCN and DGCF show higher coefficients for assortativity measures compared to SVD-GCN, but the reasons for these differences are not fully explained.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies differences in how models capture topological properties, it does not provide a detailed analysis of the mechanisms behind these differences.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed comparison of how each model's architecture and training process influence its ability to capture clustering coefficient and degree assortativity.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do node- and edge-dropout strategies impact the statistical significance of the explanatory framework's results across different GNNs-based models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the theoretical and analytical implications of node- and edge-dropout but does not provide a comprehensive analysis of their impact on model performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper suggests that combining node- and edge-dropout is beneficial but does not explore how this combination affects the statistical significance of results for each model individually.
- What evidence would resolve it: An analysis of the statistical significance of results when using different combinations of node- and edge-dropout for each GNNs-based model.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do the topological properties of the user-item graph influence the recommendation performance of GNNs-based models in scenarios with varying levels of data sparsity?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the impact of topological characteristics on performance but does not explicitly address how these effects vary with data sparsity.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the interaction between topological properties and data sparsity, which could be crucial for understanding model performance in real-world scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: An investigation into how topological characteristics affect model performance across datasets with different levels of sparsity.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can the insights from the topological analysis of GNNs-based recommender systems be used to design more effective recommendation algorithms?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper concludes by suggesting the potential for designing new GNNs-based approaches that exploit graph topology to boost performance.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies strong correspondences between topology and performance, it does not provide a concrete framework for designing new algorithms based on these insights.
- What evidence would resolve it: A proposed framework or algorithm that explicitly incorporates topological insights to improve recommendation performance.

## Limitations

- Limited generalizability due to focus on only three recommendation datasets and three specific GNN architectures
- Single performance metric (Recall@20) without exploring other metrics like NDCG or precision
- Potential non-linear relationships between topology and performance may not be captured by linear regression

## Confidence

- Strong statistical evidence (adjusted R² > 95%, p-values < 0.001) for topological-performance correspondences: High
- Mechanisms explaining why specific topological properties matter: Medium
- Benefits of combining node- and edge-dropout sampling strategies: Medium
- Generalizability to other GNN architectures and datasets: Low

## Next Checks

1. **Mechanism validation**: Remove node degree normalization from the message-passing equations in LightGCN and verify if the correlation between degree and performance disappears as predicted.

2. **Sampling strategy comparison**: Run the full experimental pipeline using only node-dropout and only edge-dropout sampling, then compare the explanatory power of the resulting regression models.

3. **Architecture sensitivity**: Train and evaluate an additional GNN architecture with different message-passing mechanisms to test if the observed topological correspondences hold across a broader range of model designs.
