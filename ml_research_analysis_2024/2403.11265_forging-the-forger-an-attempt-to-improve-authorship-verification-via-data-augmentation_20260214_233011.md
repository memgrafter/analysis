# Forging the Forger: An Attempt to Improve Authorship Verification via Data Augmentation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2403.11265
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11265
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Data augmentation via synthetic forgery generation failed to improve authorship verification classifier performance, with some cases showing deterioration.

## Executive Summary
This paper explores using synthetic forgery generation as a data augmentation strategy to improve authorship verification (AV) classifier performance in adversarial settings. The authors propose training generator models to create synthetic negative examples that imitate the style of the target author, which are then added to the classifier's training set. Three generator architectures (GRU, transformer, and GPT-2) are tested with two training strategies (language modeling and WGAN-based). Despite the theoretical promise, experiments across five datasets show no significant improvements in classifier performance, with analysis suggesting the generated examples are too dissimilar from the target author's style to be effective.

## Method Summary
The approach involves training generator models to create synthetic negative examples that imitate the style of the target author. Three generator architectures (GRU, transformer, and GPT-2) are trained using either language modeling or WGAN-based strategies. These synthetic examples are added to the classifier's training set alongside real negative examples. Two classifier algorithms (SVM and CNN) are then trained on the augmented data and evaluated on their ability to distinguish between real and synthetic examples. The method is tested across five datasets with documents segmented into 100-token chunks.

## Key Results
- No significant improvements in classifier performance across five datasets and two classifier algorithms
- Some cases showed deterioration in performance when using augmented training data
- Generated examples were found to be too dissimilar from the target author's style, limiting their effectiveness
- Statistical significance testing using McNemar's test confirmed the lack of meaningful improvement

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Synthetic forgeries improve classifier robustness by exposing it to adversarial examples during training.
- Mechanism: Generated negative examples imitating the target author's style are added to the training set, forcing the classifier to learn patterns that distinguish real authorship from imitation.
- Core assumption: The generator can produce examples sufficiently similar to the target author's style to be realistic forgeries.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "These synthetic examples are generated to imitate the style of the author of interest." [section]: "We propose to enhance the classifier performance with the addition of adversarial training examples, i.e., textual examples specifically generated to imitate the author that the classifier tries to identify."
- Break condition: If generated examples are too dissimilar from the target author's style, the classifier learns nothing useful from them.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: GAN-based training creates examples that exploit classifier weaknesses.
- Mechanism: The generator is trained to fool the discriminator (the classifier) by producing examples that the classifier is likely to misclassify as positive examples.
- Core assumption: The discriminator's weaknesses reflect realistic attack vectors that the classifier needs to defend against.
- Evidence anchors: [section]: "another based on GAN training (hereafter:GANtr), where the generator plays the role of the forger that tries to fool the discriminator." [abstract]: "experiment with three different generator architectures... and with two training strategies (one inspired by standard Language Models, and another inspired by Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks)."
- Break condition: If the discriminator is not a good proxy for real-world attackers, the generated examples won't be useful.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Data augmentation reduces overfitting in AV classifiers.
- Mechanism: Adding synthetic negative examples increases the effective training set size, helping the classifier generalize better to unseen examples.
- Core assumption: The AV task suffers from data scarcity, making augmentation beneficial.
- Evidence anchors: [section]: "the main limitation of this strategy is the limited amount of sequences we might expect to have access to, since these are bounded by the production of one single author." [abstract]: "The latter is collectively represented as the negative classA, and encompasses examples from other authors."
- Break condition: If the classifier already has sufficient data or if augmentation introduces too much noise.

## Foundational Learning

- **Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) loss function**: Why needed here: WGAN provides smoother gradients than traditional GANs, which is crucial for training stable text generators. Quick check question: What problem does the Wasserstein distance solve in GAN training?

- **One-hot vs dense embeddings for text generation**: Why needed here: Different encoding schemes affect generator output quality and classifier input representation. Quick check question: Why does the paper use a linear layer to project one-hot vectors to 128 dimensions?

- **t-SNE visualization for high-dimensional data**: Why needed here: Used to analyze whether generated examples are distinguishable from real examples in classifier embedding space. Quick check question: What does it mean if synthetic examples cluster separately from real examples in t-SNE plots?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Generator (GRU, TRA, GPT variants) → produces synthetic texts → Discriminator/CNN classifier → distinguishes real from fake → SVM baseline classifier → evaluates augmentation benefits → Feature extraction (BFs, char n-grams, POS tags) → creates classifier inputs

- **Critical path**: Generator training → synthetic example generation → training set augmentation → classifier training → evaluation

- **Design tradeoffs**: Generator complexity vs training data availability, Real vs synthetic example balance in training set, Dense vs sparse feature representations

- **Failure signatures**: Generated examples too different from real texts (visible in t-SNE), Classifier performance worse with augmentation than without, No improvement across multiple dataset configurations

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Run GRU LMtr 1h generator on TweepFake dataset with CNN classifier, compare F1 with baseline
  2. Run GPT GANtr emb generator on PAN11 dataset with SVM classifier, measure K metric improvement
  3. Visualize t-SNE embeddings of real vs synthetic examples for RJ dataset to check similarity

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Open Question 1**: Why did data augmentation with synthetic forgery generation fail to improve authorship verification classifier performance consistently across datasets? Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper's experiments showed no significant improvements, with some cases even showing deterioration, and analysis suggested generated examples were too dissimilar from the target author's style. Why unresolved: The paper explored multiple architectures and training strategies but could not pinpoint why the generated examples failed to be sufficiently representative of the target author's style to aid the classifier. What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies measuring stylistic similarity between generated and real examples using established authorship metrics, and experiments varying the amount of training data for generators.

- **Open Question 2**: What specific characteristics of the generated examples made them ineffective for improving classifier performance? Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper suggests generated examples were too dissimilar from the target author's style, but does not specify which stylistic features were lacking. Why unresolved: The paper focused on overall classifier performance rather than detailed analysis of the stylistic properties of generated examples. What evidence would resolve it: Detailed stylistic analysis of generated examples compared to real examples, identifying specific features (e.g., vocabulary, syntax, n-grams) that were missing or poorly imitated.

- **Open Question 3**: Would increasing the amount of training data for the generator models improve the quality of generated examples and classifier performance? Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions data scarcity as a characteristic of AV settings and suggests the generation process might benefit from more data, but did not attempt this due to questioning the utility in typical AV problems. Why unresolved: The paper did not experiment with increasing training data for generators due to the inherent data scarcity in AV tasks. What evidence would resolve it: Experiments training generators with varying amounts of data and measuring the impact on generated example quality and classifier performance.

- **Open Question 4**: Are there alternative strategies to improve authorship verification classifier performance in adversarial settings beyond synthetic forgery generation? Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the limitations of their approach and suggests future work could explore modifying pre-existing texts instead of creating them from scratch, drawing inspiration from Text Style Transfer. Why unresolved: The paper focused on synthetic forgery generation and did not explore other potential strategies. What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of different data augmentation strategies (e.g., text style transfer, synonym replacement, paraphrasing) and their impact on classifier performance in adversarial settings.

## Limitations
- The generator architectures may be fundamentally incapable of producing examples close enough to target author styles
- The choice of evaluation metrics may not capture subtle improvements in adversarial robustness
- The paper does not explore whether different hyperparameter settings might yield better results

## Confidence
- **Low confidence**: The claim that data augmentation via synthetic forgeries cannot improve AV performance. The generators may simply be poorly implemented rather than the approach being fundamentally flawed.
- **Medium confidence**: The observation that generated examples are distinguishable from real examples in feature space. This is directly observable from t-SNE plots.
- **Medium confidence**: The finding that no improvement was observed across multiple dataset and classifier combinations. This is a factual result of the experiments conducted.

## Next Checks
1. **Generator quality validation**: Test whether the generators can produce examples that fool a human annotator into believing they were written by the target author, using a blind comparison study.
2. **Classifier sensitivity analysis**: Train classifiers on progressively larger amounts of synthetic data to determine if there's a threshold where augmentation begins to help, or if the approach is fundamentally limited.
3. **Alternative evaluation metrics**: Test classifier performance specifically against attacks like obfuscation and imitation (as described in related work) rather than just overall F1/K metrics to see if augmentation provides targeted benefits.
