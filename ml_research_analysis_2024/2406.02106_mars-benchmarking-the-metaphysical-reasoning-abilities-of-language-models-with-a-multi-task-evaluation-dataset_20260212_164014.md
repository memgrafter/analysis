# MARS: Benchmarking the Metaphysical Reasoning Abilities of Language Models with a Multi-task Evaluation Dataset

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Novel benchmark exposing significant gaps in LLMs' metaphysical reasoning abilities

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MARS (Metaphysical Reasoning Benchmark), a novel evaluation framework designed to assess language models' ability to understand distributional changes in events. The benchmark systematically decomposes events into components and creates hierarchical distributions through abstraction and numerical variation, resulting in three discriminative tasks: metaphysical event discrimination, metaphysical inference discrimination, and metaphysical transition reasoning. Extensive experiments with over 20 language models demonstrate that all three tasks present significant challenges, even for state-of-the-art models and those undergoing fine-tuning. The study reveals that current LLMs struggle with handling distributional changes in events, particularly in spatial, temporal, and numerical contexts, highlighting critical gaps in their metaphysical reasoning capabilities.

## Method Summary
MARS constructs a benchmark through an automated pipeline using LLMs (ChatGPT) to decompose text into events, extract components, generate abstractions and variations, create inferences, and generate transitions, followed by human annotation and expert verification. The benchmark comprises three discriminative tasks evaluating (1) plausibility of changes in actions, (2) plausibility of states caused by changed actions, and (3) plausibility of situational transitions driven by action changes. Models are evaluated in zero-shot, fine-tuning, and LLM API settings using accuracy, AUC, and Macro-F1 metrics. Transfer learning from conceptualization knowledge (CANDLE) is explored as a potential enhancement method.

## Key Results
- All three MARS tasks pose significant challenges for language models, even state-of-the-art models
- Transfer learning from conceptualization knowledge provides only marginal improvements
- Fine-tuning on MARS data improves performance, but models still struggle with distributional changes
- Specific weaknesses identified in handling spatial, temporal, and numerical changes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** MARS reveals critical gaps in LLMs' metaphysical reasoning by systematically evaluating distributional change handling
- **Mechanism:** Three discriminative tasks assess plausibility of action changes, state changes from actions, and situational transitions, exposing limitations in out-of-distribution generalization
- **Core assumption:** LLMs lack inherent ability to reason about improbable/abstract scenarios distinct from counterfactual reasoning
- **Evidence anchors:** Extensive evaluations show all tasks challenging even for fine-tuned models
- **Break condition:** If LLMs show robust performance across all tasks, suggesting adequate metaphysical reasoning abilities

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Transfer learning from conceptualization knowledge provides marginal improvements
- **Mechanism:** Pre-training on CANDLE conceptualization taxonomies enhances abstract knowledge representations for reasoning about event component changes
- **Core assumption:** Abstract knowledge representations are transferable and beneficial for distributional reasoning
- **Evidence anchors:** Sequential fine-tuning on CANDLE + MARS shows improvement over MARS alone
- **Break condition:** If pre-training shows no improvement in metaphysical reasoning tasks

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Automated pipeline with human verification enables scalable high-quality data creation
- **Mechanism:** Sequential ChatGPT instructions for data generation followed by human annotation and expert verification
- **Core assumption:** LLMs can generate contextually relevant changes requiring human verification for quality
- **Evidence anchors:** Large-scale human annotations provide evaluation labels and verify benchmark quality
- **Break condition:** If generated data consistently fails quality checks or requires extensive correction

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Understanding of distributional changes and their impact on event plausibility
  - Why needed here: MARS evaluates LLMs' ability to reason about changes in event components and consequences
  - Quick check question: How does changing "10 years" to "10 centuries" affect event plausibility?

- **Concept:** Knowledge of conceptualization and abstraction hierarchies
  - Why needed here: MARS uses abstraction and numerical variation to create hierarchical distributions
  - Quick check question: How would you abstract "human" to create a more generalized category?

- **Concept:** Familiarity with LLM evaluation methodologies and benchmark construction
  - Why needed here: MARS requires understanding evaluation metrics, data collection, and quality assurance
  - Quick check question: What are key differences between zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning evaluation approaches?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Text decomposition → Component extraction → Abstraction/variation generation → Inference generation → Transition generation → Human annotation → Model evaluation → Analysis
- **Critical path:** Data generation pipeline → Human annotation → Model evaluation → Analysis and improvement
- **Design tradeoffs:** Automated vs. manual data generation (scalability vs. quality), binary vs. multi-choice tasks (simplicity vs. granularity), zero-shot vs. fine-tuning (generalization vs. optimization), proprietary vs. open-source backbone (quality vs. reproducibility)
- **Failure signatures:** Low inter-annotator agreement (<0.5 Fleiss Kappa), consistent model performance across tasks, high variance in results, poor transferability of conceptualization knowledge
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Evaluate baseline LLMs (zero-shot) on all three MARS tasks to establish difficulty baseline
  2. Fine-tune selected LLMs on MARS training data and evaluate performance improvement
  3. Pre-train models on CANDLE knowledge and evaluate transfer learning benefits on MARS tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does pre-training LLMs on large-scale conceptualization taxonomies consistently improve metaphysical reasoning across different model architectures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Sequential fine-tuning on CANDLE + MARS yields better results than MARS alone, but only tested specific model types
- Why unresolved: Limited to DeBERTa, VERA, LLaMa-3-8B; unclear if improvement generalizes to other architectures or is consistent across all tasks
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments fine-tuning diverse models on CANDLE followed by MARS with detailed ablation studies

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the minimal training data requirement for effective metaphysical reasoning fine-tuning on MARS?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Performance doesn't significantly degrade when training data is reduced to 20-80% of full dataset
- Why unresolved: Only tested ratios up to 80% reduction; relationship between training data size and generalization unclear
- What evidence would resolve it: Fine-tuning experiments with progressively smaller subsets (1%, 5%, 10%, 20%) and systematic evaluation

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does task formulation (binary vs. multiple-choice vs. open-ended) impact assessment of metaphysical reasoning capabilities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Binary tasks chosen for scalability; acknowledges multiple-choice impractical and generation provides complementary insights
- Why unresolved: Only qualitative discussion; no systematic comparison of how different formulations affect performance or reveal different aspects
- What evidence would resolve it: Head-to-head comparison experiments using same dataset with different formulations, measuring accuracy, calibration, confidence, and qualitative reasoning patterns

## Limitations
- Benchmark may not comprehensively represent all forms of metaphysical reasoning
- Automated data generation followed by human verification introduces potential biases
- Focus on discriminative tasks may not capture full breadth of metaphysical reasoning capabilities
- Modest performance improvements from transfer learning suggest limitations in knowledge transfer mechanisms

## Confidence

**High confidence:** Benchmark construction methodology and evaluation framework are clearly specified and reproducible; finding that current LLMs struggle with all three tasks is well-supported

**Medium confidence:** Pre-training on conceptualization taxonomies provides marginal improvements, though magnitude suggests limitations warranting further investigation

**Low confidence:** Assertion that MARS exposes fundamental gaps should be tempered by acknowledgment that benchmark may not represent all metaphysical reasoning

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-dataset validation:** Test same models on alternative metaphysical reasoning benchmarks to verify consistency of observed limitations
2. **Human baseline comparison:** Establish human performance on MARS tasks to determine appropriate benchmark difficulty
3. **Ablation study on knowledge transfer:** Conduct systematic ablation studies to isolate which aspects of conceptualization knowledge contribute most to performance improvements
