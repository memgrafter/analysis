# Robust Stochastic Shortest-Path Planning via Risk-Sensitive Incremental Sampling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.08668
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08668
- Authors: Clinton Enwerem; Erfaun Noorani; John S. Baras; Brian M. Sadler
- Reference count: 27
- Key outcome: Proposes RA-RRT* algorithm that minimizes CVaR for robust stochastic shortest-path planning, reducing failure rates and noise sensitivity while maintaining similar computational complexity to RRT*.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a risk-sensitive variant of the RRT* algorithm (RA-RRT*) for stochastic shortest-path planning in environments with uncertainty. The key innovation is using Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) as a risk measure when selecting nodes during tree expansion, making the algorithm more robust to environmental noise. The RA-RRT* algorithm maintains similar computational complexity to standard RRT* while significantly improving path reliability and reducing sensitivity to noise. Through simulation experiments, the algorithm demonstrates lower variability in path lengths and better worst-case performance compared to the baseline, particularly in high-noise environments.

## Method Summary
The RA-RRT* algorithm modifies the standard RRT* by incorporating CVaR-based node selection during tree expansion. At each iteration, the algorithm computes the VaRα and CVaRα of path segment lengths for candidate nodes, then selects the node that minimizes CVaRα. The algorithm maintains log-linear processing time complexity by limiting connections to kn nearest neighbors instead of all neighbors within a radius. The approach provides probabilistic guarantees on path optimality through KL divergence bounds between the optimal path length distribution and designer-prescribed thresholds. Simulations were conducted across varying noise levels (σCk = 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5) and confidence levels (α = 0.1, 0.5, 0.9) to evaluate performance.

## Key Results
- RA-RRT* significantly reduces failure rates compared to baseline RRT*, especially in high-noise environments
- The algorithm produces paths with lower variability and shorter worst-case lengths than RRT*
- Computational complexity remains similar to RRT* with only log-linear increases in processing time
- RA-RRT* provides probabilistic guarantees on optimal worst-case path length through CVaR-based risk assessment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: CVaR-based node selection improves path robustness under environmental uncertainty.
- Mechanism: The algorithm minimizes the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) of path segment lengths during tree expansion, optimizing for paths with lower variability and shorter worst-case lengths.
- Core assumption: The SSP problem has optimal substructure and CVaR is step-wise coherent.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract and section III-A confirm theoretical motivation; no direct evidence in neighbor corpus.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: RA-RRT* provides probabilistic guarantees on optimal worst-case path length.
- Mechanism: Uses KL divergence between optimal path length distribution and designer-prescribed threshold to establish upper bound on probability of exceeding threshold.
- Core assumption: Path length distribution converges to normal distribution as sample size increases.
- Evidence anchors: Section III-B provides theoretical derivation; relies on central limit theorem assumptions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: RA-RRT* maintains similar computational complexity to baseline RRT*.
- Mechanism: Differs from RRT* by connecting to kn nearest neighbors and adding VaRα/CVaRα computation steps, resulting in log-linear complexity increase.
- Core assumption: Sorting algorithm used is merge sort.
- Evidence anchors: Section III-D provides theoretical complexity analysis comparing O(n log(n·nRA)) vs O(n log n).

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) Problems
  - Why needed here: The paper focuses on solving SSP problems with environmental uncertainty.
  - Quick check question: What is the main difference between a deterministic shortest path problem and an SSP problem?

- Concept: Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR)
  - Why needed here: The paper uses CVaR as a risk measure to assess the robot's risk at each stage of the SSP problem.
  - Quick check question: How is CVaR different from Value-at-Risk (VaR)?

- Concept: Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRT*) Algorithm
  - Why needed here: The paper proposes a risk-sensitive variant of the RRT* algorithm for robust stochastic shortest-path planning.
  - Quick check question: What is the main advantage of the RRT* algorithm over the basic RRT algorithm?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: SAMPLE → NEAREST → STEER → GETNEIGHBORS → VaRα and CVaRα Computation → COLLISION FREE → REWIRE

- Critical path: The sequence of operations from sampling to rewiring that constructs the risk-sensitive tree

- Design tradeoffs:
  1. Increasing samples (nkc) or neighbors (kn) improves CVaR accuracy but increases processing time
  2. Larger rewiring radius (ρmax) enables more extensive updates but may increase collision risk
  3. Risk sensitivity parameter α trades off between path optimality and computational efficiency

- Failure signatures:
  1. Algorithm fails to return path within maximum iterations
  2. Returned path exceeds designer-prescribed length threshold
  3. Excessive computation time due to large neighborhood sizes

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare RA-RRT* and RRT* in grid world with increasing noise variance
  2. Evaluate impact of risk sensitivity parameter α on algorithm performance
  3. Analyze computational complexity by varying samples (nkc) and neighbors (kn)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does RA-RRT* performance scale with increasing dimensionality of the configuration space?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Paper focuses on 2D grid world and mentions "high-dimensional configuration spaces" in reference [8] but does not test higher dimensions.
- Why unresolved: Computational complexity analysis suggests linear query time and log-linear processing time, but not verified beyond 2D.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results comparing RA-RRT* performance across varying dimensions (3D, 6D, 10D).

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of non-Gaussian noise distributions on RA-RRT* performance and theoretical guarantees?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper states intention to adapt ideas to non-Gaussian noise and cases where CVaR cannot be computed precisely.
- Why unresolved: Current algorithm assumes Gaussian noise and relies on CVaR properties that may not hold for other distributions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Simulation results and theoretical analysis using different noise distributions (uniform, exponential, heavy-tailed).

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does choice of risk sensitivity parameter α affect trade-off between path optimality and computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper tests three α values but doesn't systematically analyze the trade-off.
- Why unresolved: While different α values lead to different performance metrics, comprehensive analysis of the balance is missing.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed study varying α across wider range analyzing resulting path lengths, computation times, and failure rates.

## Limitations
- Theoretical analysis relies on asymptotic convergence assumptions that may not hold in finite sample regimes
- Limited empirical validation of computational complexity claims - theoretical O(n log(n·nRA)) vs O(n log n) difference not quantified in practice
- Lacks comparative evaluation against other risk-sensitive planning approaches

## Confidence

- Mechanism 1 (CVaR-based robustness): Medium confidence - theoretical justification but limited empirical validation
- Mechanism 2 (probabilistic guarantees): Medium confidence - relies on asymptotic convergence assumptions
- Mechanism 3 (computational complexity): Medium confidence - theoretical analysis lacks practical runtime benchmarks

## Next Checks

1. Implement runtime benchmarks comparing RA-RRT* and RRT* across varying problem sizes to empirically verify claimed computational complexity
2. Conduct ablation studies systematically varying kn and nkc to quantify their impact on both path quality and computational cost
3. Validate probabilistic guarantees by measuring actual path length distributions across multiple trials to confirm KL divergence bounds hold in practice
