# Improving Robustness of Spectrogram Classifiers with Neural Stochastic Differential Equations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.01532
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01532
- Authors: Joel Brogan; Olivera Kotevska; Anibely Torres; Sumit Jha; Mark Adams
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: NSDE-ConvNeXt achieves competitive accuracy (82.88% vs 87.20% baseline) with significantly better robustness to noise and adversarial attacks

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of improving robustness in spectrogram classifiers for signal processing applications in noisy environments. The authors propose using Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (NSDEs) with domain-shaped Brownian motion noise injection during training of ConvNeXt models. Tested on electromagnetic waveform data transformed into spectrograms, the approach achieves competitive classification accuracy while maintaining significantly better performance under noise and adversarial perturbations, along with improved attribution stability for model explainability.

## Method Summary
The method injects Brownian motion noise into the residual layers of ConvNeXt architecture during training, creating a stochastic neural differential equation that models input noise as part of the network's internal dynamics. The approach is trained on a custom dataset of electromagnetic waveforms injected into building wiring and transformed into spectrograms. The model is evaluated on classification accuracy, robustness to random noise at varying intensities, adversarial noise using APGD-CE attacks, and Attribute-Based Confidence (ABC) scores for explainability.

## Key Results
- NSDE-ConvNeXt achieves 82.88% accuracy versus 87.20% baseline on clean data
- At 0.05 noise intensity, NSDE maintains 87.50% accuracy versus 84.38% baseline
- Baseline model completely fails under adversarial attacks while NSDE shows robustness
- NSDE produces more stable attribution maps with higher ABC scores for correct predictions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: NSDE injects domain-shaped Brownian motion noise into residual layers, regularizing the network to handle noisy inputs more robustly
- Mechanism: The stochastic component models input noise as part of the network's internal dynamics, forcing it to learn representations that are invariant to noise patterns
- Core assumption: Brownian motion noise shape matches the noise characteristics of real-world signal processing domains
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "The authors propose using Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (NSDEs) to inject domain-shaped noise during training of convolutional neural networks (CNNs)"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: NSDE improves attribution stability and confidence metrics for model explainability
- Mechanism: Stochastic regularization smooths the loss landscape, leading to more coherent gradient-based explanations that are less sensitive to input perturbations
- Core assumption: More stable attributions correlate with better model generalization and reliability
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "The approach also produces more coherent and stable attribution maps for explainability, with higher Attribute-Based Confidence (ABC) scores for correct predictions"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: NSDE provides robustness to adversarial perturbations while maintaining competitive accuracy
- Mechanism: The stochastic dynamics create decision boundaries that are less susceptible to small input perturbations that adversarial attacks exploit
- Core assumption: Adversarial perturbations follow similar patterns to noise that the NSDE is trained to handle
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Results show that the NSDE-ConvNeXt model achieves competitive classification accuracy... while maintaining significantly better accuracy under increasing noise levels... and showing robustness to adversarial attacks where the baseline model completely fails"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs)
  - Why needed here: NSDE builds directly on Neural ODE framework; understanding continuous-depth models is prerequisite
  - Quick check question: How does a Neural ODE differ from a standard residual network in terms of depth parameterization?

- Concept: Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) and Brownian motion
  - Why needed here: NSDE adds stochastic terms to Neural ODEs; understanding noise injection mechanisms is crucial
  - Quick check question: What mathematical properties make Brownian motion suitable for domain-shaped noise injection?

- Concept: Attribution methods (Integrated Gradients, NoiseTunnel)
  - Why needed here: Paper evaluates NSDE's impact on model explainability using these specific methods
  - Quick check question: How does NoiseTunnel improve the stability of Integrated Gradients attributions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input spectrogram -> ConvNeXt feature extraction -> stochastic noise injection layer -> classification head
- Critical path: Input spectrogram -> ConvNeXt feature extraction -> stochastic regularization -> classification head
- Design tradeoffs: Accuracy vs robustness (NSDE shows 82.88% vs 87.20% baseline), computational overhead from noise sampling
- Failure signatures: Unexplained accuracy drop, attribution maps that don't highlight meaningful signal features, poor adversarial robustness despite stochastic training
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train deterministic ConvNeXt on clean spectrogram data, establish baseline accuracy
  2. Add Gaussian noise injection to ConvNeXt training, compare robustness metrics
  3. Implement NSDE with Brownian motion noise, evaluate both accuracy and robustness improvements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the choice of noise shape (beyond Brownian motion) affect the robustness and attribution stability of Neural SDEs in spectrogram classification?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that "The shape of injected noise in an NSDE is an important factor to consider" and references prior work on noise shaping, but only uses Brownian motion noise in their experiments.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests Brownian motion noise and does not explore other noise shapes like Ornstein-Uhlenbeck or Lévy noise, leaving open whether alternative noise shapes could provide better robustness or attribution properties.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments comparing Neural SDE performance using different noise shapes (Brownian, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, Lévy) on the same dataset, measuring both classification accuracy under noise and attribution stability metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the relationship between the regularization strength (noise intensity) in Neural SDEs and the trade-off between accuracy on clean data versus robustness to adversarial attacks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper shows that Neural SDE models have slightly lower accuracy on clean data but better robustness to noise and adversarial attacks, suggesting a trade-off exists but does not systematically explore this relationship.
- Why unresolved: The paper uses a fixed noise injection level and shows preliminary results, but does not investigate how varying the noise intensity affects the accuracy-robustness trade-off or identify optimal regularization levels.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments varying noise injection intensity across a range of values, plotting accuracy on clean data against robustness metrics for different noise levels to identify the optimal trade-off point.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can Neural SDEs trained on spectrogram data generalize to other signal processing domains with different noise characteristics, such as audio or biomedical signals?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates success on electromagnetic waveforms in building wiring but does not test generalization to other signal types, leaving open whether the approach transfers to domains with different noise statistics.
- Why unresolved: The experiments are limited to one specific dataset with particular noise characteristics, and the paper does not discuss or test cross-domain generalization capabilities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training Neural SDE models on spectrogram data from multiple signal processing domains (audio, biomedical, etc.) and evaluating performance and robustness when tested on data from different domains than training.

## Limitations
- Dataset specificity: The custom electromagnetic waveform dataset may not generalize to other signal classification domains
- Implementation details: Key implementation specifics for NSDE noise injection are not fully specified
- Noise shape assumptions: Effectiveness depends on assumptions about noise characteristics in target domain

## Confidence

- Robustness improvement claims: High confidence
- Attribution stability claims: Medium confidence
- Accuracy trade-off claims: High confidence

## Next Checks
1. Test NSDE with different noise injection shapes (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, Gaussian) to confirm Brownian motion is optimal
2. Apply NSDE to a different signal classification dataset (audio, medical signals) to assess generalizability
3. Perform ablation study removing stochastic components to quantify their specific contribution to robustness vs. accuracy
