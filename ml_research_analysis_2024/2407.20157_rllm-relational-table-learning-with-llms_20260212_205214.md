# rLLM: Relational Table Learning with LLMs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.20157
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20157
- Reference count: 36
- BRIDGE achieves 0.362±0.03 accuracy on TML1M dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces rLLM, a PyTorch library for Relational Table Learning (RTL) that decomposes Graph Neural Networks, LLMs, and Table Neural Networks into standardized modules. The library enables fast construction of novel RTL-type models by providing a modular framework for combining table processing with relational graph modeling. To demonstrate the library's capabilities, the authors present BRIDGE, a simple RTL method that combines Table Neural Networks for processing tabular data with Graph Neural Networks for modeling inter-table relationships through foreign-key links.

## Method Summary
rLLM provides a modular framework that decomposes RTL methods into standardized components including table neural networks, graph neural networks, and embedding modules. The library enables rapid prototyping of RTL models by allowing researchers to combine these components in various configurations. BRIDGE, the primary demonstration method, processes a target table using Table Neural Networks (specifically TabTransformer) while modeling relationships to other tables through a Graph Neural Network (GCN). The method follows a "combine, align, and co-train" approach where table embeddings and graph embeddings are integrated during training. The framework simplifies complex relational learning by focusing on single relational table connections and preprocessing other tables into dense embeddings.

## Key Results
- BRIDGE achieves 0.362±0.03 accuracy on the TML1M dataset, outperforming TabTransformer (0.347±0.02), TabNet (0.259±0.08), and FT-Transformer (0.352±0.02)
- Three novel relational tabular datasets (TML1M, TLF2K, TACM12K) are introduced, derived from classic datasets with foreign key relationships
- The rLLM library demonstrates 20% faster model construction compared to building from scratch

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The rLLM framework works by decomposing complex RTL models into standardized, reusable modules that can be combined in various configurations. By separating table processing (via TNNs) from relational modeling (via GNNs), the framework allows each component to specialize in its respective task while maintaining clear interfaces for integration. The modular design enables rapid experimentation with different architectural choices and simplifies the implementation of novel RTL methods. The BRIDGE method specifically leverages this decomposition by using TNNs to extract rich feature representations from tabular data while GNNs capture complex inter-table relationships through foreign-key links, resulting in more comprehensive data understanding than either approach alone.

## Foundational Learning

**Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**: Neural networks that operate on graph-structured data by propagating information through edges
*Why needed*: Essential for modeling relationships between tables in relational databases
*Quick check*: Verify the graph construction correctly represents foreign-key relationships between tables

**Table Neural Networks (TNNs)**: Neural architectures designed to process tabular data with mixed feature types
*Why needed*: Specialized for handling the unique characteristics of tabular data (categorical, numerical, missing values)
*Quick check*: Ensure the table encoder can handle the mixed feature types in the target table

**Foreign Key Relationships**: Database constraints that establish links between records in different tables
*Why needed*: Forms the foundation for relational learning by defining how tables are connected
*Quick check*: Validate that foreign key mappings correctly identify related records across tables

**Embedding Fusion Strategies**: Techniques for combining representations from different neural network components
*Why needed*: Critical for integrating table-level features with relational information
*Quick check*: Test different fusion methods (concatenation, attention, gating) to find optimal combination

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: TNN (TabTransformer) -> Embedding Layer -> GCN -> Fusion Layer -> Classifier
The TNN processes the target table to produce initial embeddings, which are then combined with graph-based representations from the GCN through a fusion layer before classification

**Critical Path**: Table encoding → Graph construction → Embedding fusion → Classification
The most important sequence is ensuring proper alignment between table embeddings and graph representations before fusion, as misalignment here directly impacts model performance

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades implementation flexibility for potential performance overhead. While modular design enables rapid prototyping, the abstraction layers may introduce inefficiencies compared to hand-optimized implementations. The BRIDGE simplification (focusing on single relational table) trades representational power for computational efficiency and ease of implementation.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance often manifests as the model relying too heavily on table features while ignoring relational information, or vice versa. This typically appears as validation accuracy plateauing early or showing high variance across training runs. Another failure mode is incorrect foreign key mapping, which results in the GCN receiving invalid relational structure.

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify foreign key relationship graph construction by testing on a small subset of TML1M with known user-movie connections
2. Implement and compare multiple fusion strategies (concatenation, attention, gating) for combining TNN and GNN embeddings
3. Conduct ablation studies removing the graph component to quantify the exact contribution of relational modeling

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: How does the performance of BRIDGE scale with increasing numbers of relational tables and foreign-key relationships?
The paper simplifies RDL by considering only a single relational table and preprocessing others into dense embeddings. The scalability of this approach to more complex relational structures is not addressed, and real-world databases often involve many interconnected tables with complex foreign-key relationships.

**Open Question 2**: What is the optimal balance between table neural networks and graph neural networks within the rLLM framework for different types of tabular data?
The paper presents BRIDGE as combining TNNs and GNNs but doesn't explore the trade-offs or optimal configurations for different data characteristics. Systematic ablation studies varying the relative contributions of TNNs and GNNs would help understand how different tabular data characteristics influence optimal architectural choices.

**Open Question 3**: How does the choice of preprocessing strategy for non-target tables (dense embeddings vs. other representations) affect BRIDGE's performance?
While the paper presents preprocessing all other tables into dense embeddings as a simplification, it doesn't explore alternative preprocessing strategies or evaluate whether this is the optimal approach for different scenarios. Comparative experiments testing different preprocessing strategies would help determine the best approach for various dataset types.

## Limitations
- The experimental setup uses an extremely small training set (20 samples per class), raising questions about generalization and suggesting results may be sensitive to random initialization
- Critical implementation details for BRIDGE are missing, particularly the exact mechanism for combining table and graph embeddings
- Specific hyperparameter configurations that are critical for reproducing the reported accuracy results are not provided

## Confidence
**Methodology reproducibility: Medium** - The modular framework design is well-specified and reproducible, but critical implementation details are missing
**Numerical results: Low** - Without exact architectural details and hyperparameters, achieving identical numerical results is unlikely

## Next Checks
1. Verify the foreign key relationship graph construction by testing on a subset of TML1M with known user-movie connections to ensure the GCN receives correct relational structure
2. Implement and compare multiple fusion strategies (concatenation, attention, gating) for combining TNN and GNN embeddings to identify which approach yields the reported performance
3. Conduct ablation studies removing the graph component to quantify the exact contribution of relational modeling versus table-only approaches on the TML1M dataset
