- 117x faster search on CIFAR100  
- 3.7x faster search on TinyImageNet200
- Maintains high accuracy while meeting memory budgets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Reducing search space by removing low-significance operations improves search efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.
- Mechanism: The SpikeNAS framework analyzes the impact of each pre-defined operation on accuracy. Operations that have negligible impact on accuracy (like 1x1Conv, 3x3AvgPool, and Zeroize) are removed from the search space. This reduces the number of architecture candidates from 15625 to a smaller set while maintaining accuracy.
- Core assumption: The significance of operation types can be determined empirically through controlled experiments where one operation type is removed at a time.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "SpikeNAS employs several key steps: analyzing the impacts of network operations on the accuracy, enhancing the network architecture to improve the learning quality"
  - [section]: "Removing the Zeroize, 1x1Conv, 3x3AvgPool operations from the cells do not change the accuracy significantly"
  - [corpus]: "LightSNN: Lightweight Architecture Search for Sparse and Accurate Spiking Neural Networks" (related work on lightweight SNN architecture search)
- Break condition: If the remaining operations cannot capture the necessary feature extraction and transformation capabilities for the given dataset.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Memory-aware search with individual cell optimization finds architectures meeting memory constraints while maintaining accuracy.
- Mechanism: SpikeNAS uses a fast memory-aware search algorithm that explores architecture candidates for each cell individually, evaluates memory footprint using an analytical model, and filters out architectures exceeding memory budgets. This ensures generated architectures meet memory constraints.
- Core assumption: The analytical model for memory footprint (based on number of parameters) accurately predicts actual memory usage on target hardware.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "SpikeNAS employs several key steps: ... developing a fast memory-aware search algorithm"
  - [section]: "Information of the memory constraint is included into the search process (Alg. 1: line 21-22)"
  - [corpus]: "NeuroNAS: Enhancing Efficiency of Neuromorphic In-Memory Computing for Intelligent Mobile Agents through Hardware-Aware Spiking Neural Architecture Search" (related work on hardware-aware NAS)
- Break condition: If the analytical model fails to accurately predict memory usage or if memory constraint is too tight to find suitable architectures.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Consecutive search across cells with reduced operation sets achieves faster search times while maintaining accuracy.
- Mechanism: SpikeNAS performs search for each cell individually (starting from second cell), applies the same architecture to all previous cells, and uses reduced operation sets. This reduces search space significantly compared to random search across all cells with all operations.
- Core assumption: Good architectures found for earlier cells remain good when applied to subsequent cells.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "SpikeNAS improves the searching time by 29x, 117x, and 3.7x for CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet200 respectively"
  - [section]: "Investigation of redundant architectures for each cell is minimized to improve the effectiveness of our search"
  - [corpus]: "FastSpiker: Enabling Fast Training for Spiking Neural Networks on Event-based Data through Learning Rate Enhancements for Autonomous Embedded Systems" (related work on fast SNN training)
- Break condition: If the cell-by-cell search strategy misses globally optimal architectures that require different architectures for different cells.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and LIF neurons
  - Why needed here: SpikeNAS is specifically designed for SNNs, which have different characteristics than traditional ANNs. Understanding SNNs is crucial for understanding why SpikeNAS's approach is different from traditional NAS.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between how SNNs and ANNs process information?

- Concept: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) without training
  - Why needed here: SpikeNAS uses NAS without training approach to quickly evaluate architecture candidates. Understanding this concept is essential for understanding SpikeNAS's search efficiency.
  - Quick check question: How does NAS without training evaluate architecture candidates without full training?

- Concept: Memory constraints in embedded systems
  - Why needed here: SpikeNAS specifically addresses memory constraints for embedded AI systems. Understanding these constraints is crucial for understanding the problem SpikeNAS solves.
  - Quick check question: Why are memory constraints particularly important for embedded AI systems using SNNs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Analysis module -> Enhancement module -> Search algorithm -> Memory estimator -> Evaluation module
- Critical path:
  1. Operation significance analysis
  2. Network architecture enhancement based on analysis
  3. Memory-aware search using enhanced architecture
  4. Architecture selection based on score and memory constraint
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Fewer operations vs. search space size vs. accuracy potential
  - Cell count vs. memory footprint vs. accuracy potential
  - Search speed vs. exploration completeness
- Failure signatures:
  - Architecture fails to meet memory constraint despite search algorithm
  - Accuracy degradation after removing operations
  - Search time not improving as expected
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run operation significance analysis on CIFAR10 to identify which operations can be removed
  2. Test enhanced architecture with 2 cells and reduced operation set on CIFAR100 without memory constraint
  3. Test memory-aware search with CIFAR10 and 1.2M parameter constraint to verify constraint satisfaction

## Limitations
- Analytical memory model may not accurately predict actual memory usage on target hardware
- Operation significance analysis results may not generalize across different datasets
- Cell-by-cell search strategy might miss globally optimal architectures

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The 29x-117x search time improvements are well-supported by the reduced search space (15625 to smaller set) and cell-by-cell search strategy
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that removing specific operations doesn't significantly impact accuracy, as this depends heavily on the datasets and specific SNN implementations used
- **Medium confidence**: The memory-aware search algorithm's ability to consistently find architectures meeting memory constraints, given potential discrepancies between analytical and actual memory usage

## Next Checks
1. Validate the analytical memory model by implementing the same architectures on target embedded hardware and measuring actual memory usage versus predicted values
2. Test the operation significance analysis across multiple diverse datasets (beyond CIFAR10/100) to verify the removed operations consistently don't impact accuracy
3. Compare the cell-by-cell search strategy against global search approaches on architectures where different cells might genuinely benefit from different architectures
