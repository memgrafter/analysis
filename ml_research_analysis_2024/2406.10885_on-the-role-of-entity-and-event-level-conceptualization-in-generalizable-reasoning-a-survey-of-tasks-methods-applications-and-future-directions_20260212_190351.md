# On the Role of Entity and Event Level Conceptualization in Generalizable Reasoning: A Survey of Tasks, Methods, Applications, and Future Directions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.10885
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10885
- Reference count: 40
- This survey presents the first comprehensive overview of conceptualization across entity and event levels, addressing inconsistencies in terminology and methods within the field.

## Executive Summary
This survey provides the first comprehensive overview of conceptualization at entity and event levels, addressing inconsistencies in terminology and methods within the field. The paper defines four distinct levels of conceptualization—entity, event, document, and system—clarifying the scope and taxonomy of conceptualization tasks. By reviewing over 150 papers, it categorizes methods into extraction, retrieval, and generative approaches, exploring downstream applications in commonsense reasoning, complex reasoning, and other domains. The work highlights the benefits of conceptualization in enhancing model generalization and reasoning capabilities, particularly through zero-shot generative methods using large language models.

## Method Summary
The survey methodology involves reviewing over 150 papers from ACL Anthology, ACM Digital Library, and major AI/ML conferences, focusing on entity and event level conceptualization. Papers are categorized into four levels (entity, event, document, system) with primary emphasis on entity and event levels. Methods are organized into three main categories: extraction-based, retrieval-based, and generative-based approaches. The survey catalogs existing datasets and benchmarks, and maps applications to downstream reasoning tasks, providing a comprehensive taxonomy of the conceptualization field.

## Key Results
- Four-level conceptualization hierarchy (entity, event, document, system) provides clear framework for understanding different conceptualization approaches
- Zero-shot generative methods using large language models offer most scalable approach for acquiring conceptualization knowledge
- Conceptualization enhances model generalization and reasoning capabilities across diverse downstream applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Conceptualization at entity and event levels enables models to transfer knowledge from known instances to novel scenarios through abstraction and instantiation.
- **Mechanism:** The paper proposes a four-level hierarchy where conceptualization involves abstracting specific instances into higher-level concepts, which then form abstract knowledge that can be reapplied to new instances via instantiation.
- **Core assumption:** That abstract knowledge derived from conceptualized instances can be meaningfully instantiated to new, unseen instances while preserving semantic relevance.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Generally speaking, it refers to the process of sequentially abstracting specific instances into higher-level concepts and then forming abstract knowledge that can be applied in unfamiliar or novel situations."
  - [section 2] "When encountering unfamiliar or novel scenarios, concepts in abstract knowledge can be instantiated to new instances to support downstream reasoning."
- **Break condition:** If semantic distance between original and new instances is too large, instantiation may fail or produce irrelevant results.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Different conceptualization levels require distinct methodological paradigms due to their inherent semantic differences.
- **Mechanism:** The paper argues that entity-level and event-level conceptualization require different approaches than document-level or system-level work, with entity and event conceptualization focusing on clustering instances under shared concepts.
- **Core assumption:** That the semantic nature of instances (entities vs. events vs. documents) fundamentally determines the appropriate conceptualization methodology.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "As illustrated in Figure 1, the conceptualization of entities and documents requires two distinct paradigms; however, the current terminology fails to adequately address these differences."
  - [section 2] "We then propose a set of objectives to select and survey papers that feature conceptualization as their core idea, review more than 150 papers, and organize them into three main categories."
- **Break condition:** If semantic boundaries between levels blur (e.g., an event described in a document), the distinct paradigms may become less clear or effective.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Zero-shot generative methods using large language models provide the most scalable and flexible approach to acquiring conceptualization knowledge.
- **Mechanism:** The paper identifies zero-shot generative methods as particularly effective because they leverage the vast internal knowledge of LLMs and human-crafted prompts to distill conceptualizations without requiring task-specific fine-tuning or extensive training data.
- **Core assumption:** That LLMs contain sufficient internal knowledge to generate meaningful conceptualizations across diverse domains without additional training.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 4.3.2] "These methods can collect conceptualizations efficiently and at low cost without specific fine-tuning. The resulting conceptualization knowledge base are thus scalable and downstream models trained on them typically have improved generalization ability to new instances and domains."
  - [section 4.3.2] "However, to ensure high-quality generated conceptualizations, it is recommended to implement quality control mechanisms such as human evaluation or discriminators as post-filters."
- **Break condition:** If LLM internal knowledge is incomplete or biased, or if quality control mechanisms are insufficient, generated conceptualizations may be unreliable or incorrect.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Abstraction and instantiation in cognitive reasoning
  - Why needed here: The entire framework relies on understanding how humans abstract specific instances into concepts and then instantiate those concepts to new situations.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between abstraction and instantiation in the context of conceptualization?

- **Concept:** Knowledge graph construction and semantic networks
  - Why needed here: Many conceptualization methods involve extracting or generating relationships between concepts, which requires understanding knowledge graph structures.
  - Quick check question: How do knowledge graphs represent relationships between concepts differently from taxonomies?

- **Concept:** Zero-shot learning and prompt engineering
  - Why needed here: The paper highlights zero-shot generative methods as particularly promising, which requires understanding how to effectively prompt LLMs without fine-tuning.
  - Quick check question: What makes a prompt effective for zero-shot generation of conceptualizations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** The survey architecture consists of four main components: (1) Definition and taxonomy of conceptualization levels, (2) Dataset and benchmark cataloging, (3) Method categorization (extraction, retrieval, generative), and (4) Application mapping to downstream tasks. These components are interconnected, with methods feeding into applications and datasets providing evaluation frameworks.

- **Critical path:** The most critical path for implementing conceptualization is: (1) Identify the appropriate conceptualization level for your task, (2) Select or curate relevant datasets, (3) Choose a method paradigm that matches your data and computational constraints, (4) Apply to downstream reasoning tasks with appropriate evaluation.

- **Design tradeoffs:** Extraction methods offer speed and simplicity but lack semantic understanding; retrieval methods provide semantic accuracy but depend heavily on knowledge base quality; generative methods offer flexibility and scalability but require quality control and may produce novel but unreliable concepts.

- **Failure signatures:** Common failure modes include: (1) Semantic drift when instantiating abstract knowledge to new instances, (2) Knowledge base incompleteness causing retrieval failures, (3) LLM hallucinations in zero-shot generation, (4) Overfitting to training data distributions in fine-tuned methods.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Implement a simple extraction-based conceptualization pipeline on a small text corpus to understand the basic mechanics and limitations.
  2. Test a retrieval-based approach using WordNet or ConceptNet to see how semantic similarity affects concept selection.
  3. Experiment with zero-shot prompting on a few entity and event instances to gauge LLM's inherent conceptualization capabilities before investing in fine-tuning.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can conceptualization methods effectively handle the challenge of ambiguous words and context-dependent meanings in entity and event level conceptualization?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that extraction-based methods are limited by their inability to handle ambiguous words and that semantic-based retrieval methods still do not consider the semantic context of the input instance.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific solutions or evidence on how to effectively address the ambiguity and context-dependency issues in conceptualization methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing improved performance of conceptualization methods on datasets with ambiguous words and context-dependent meanings, along with ablation studies demonstrating the effectiveness of specific techniques in handling these challenges.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can conceptualization methods be improved to better generalize to unseen concepts and domains, especially in specialized fields like medical or legal text?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper highlights that extraction-based methods are not able to generalize well to unseen concepts, and fine-tuning-based generative methods have uncertain performance across diverse domains.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore potential solutions or provide empirical evidence on how to enhance the generalization capabilities of conceptualization methods to new domains and unseen concepts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies evaluating the performance of different conceptualization methods on specialized domains, along with analysis of the factors influencing generalization and the effectiveness of domain adaptation techniques.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the potential benefits and challenges of using conceptualization in controllable text generation and hallucination reduction, and how can these be effectively implemented?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper proposes future directions for using conceptualization in controllable text generation and hallucination reduction, but does not provide concrete solutions or empirical evidence.
- Why unresolved: The paper outlines the potential benefits and challenges of using conceptualization in these areas but does not offer specific implementation strategies or experimental results to support these claims.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of conceptualization in improving controllable text generation and reducing hallucinations, along with detailed analysis of the implementation challenges and potential solutions.

## Limitations

- The survey focuses on entity and event levels, leaving document and system level conceptualization unexplored
- Reliance on existing datasets without additional curation may limit applicability to emerging conceptualization tasks
- The selection criteria for "exceptional value and uniqueness" when categorizing papers remains somewhat subjective

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The proposed four-level taxonomy of conceptualization and its distinction between entity/event versus document/system levels is well-supported by the literature review.
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of zero-shot generative methods using LLMs for conceptualization acquisition is supported by recent work but requires further empirical validation across diverse domains.
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that conceptualization universally enhances model generalization lacks comprehensive empirical validation across all downstream tasks mentioned.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-domain validation**: Test the effectiveness of conceptualization methods across domains not represented in the surveyed literature (e.g., medical reasoning, legal analysis).
2. **Generalization benchmarks**: Design experiments to quantify how much conceptualization actually improves model generalization versus task-specific fine-tuning on downstream tasks.
3. **Quality control evaluation**: Systematically evaluate different quality control mechanisms for zero-shot generative methods to determine optimal approaches for ensuring reliable conceptualization generation.
