# Give me a hint: Can LLMs take a hint to solve math problems?

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2410.05915
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05915
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Key outcome**: Hinting improves mathematical reasoning in LLMs compared to other prompting methods like one-shot, few-shot, and chain of thought.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates "hinting" as a prompting technique to enhance LLMs' mathematical problem-solving abilities. The authors propose providing subtle guidance or clues to help LLMs solve advanced mathematical problems, drawing inspiration from human pedagogical approaches. They evaluate their method on the MATH dataset using diverse LLMs and demonstrate that hinting outperforms other prompting techniques while being sensitive to adversarial hints.

## Method Summary
The study tests 11 models (both open and closed-source) across 17 prompting techniques on the MATH dataset. Hints are generated using Gemini-1.5-flash and provided as prompts to help guide model reasoning. The approach is compared against baseline, one-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting methods. Performance is evaluated by comparing model outputs to ground truth using DeepSeek-7B-Math-Compare-Answer, with robustness testing including adversarial and random hints.

## Key Results
- Hinting significantly improves mathematical reasoning performance compared to baseline, one-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting methods
- Models show sensitivity to adversarial hints, with performance dropping below chain-of-thought levels when given misleading information
- Hinting outperforms other techniques by providing correct initial direction without overfitting to exact solutions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Hinting improves performance by guiding models toward correct reasoning paths without overfitting to exact solutions. Hints provide high-level guidance or initial steps, helping models focus on relevant concepts rather than restricting search space like chain-of-thought or providing narrow examples like few-shot. Core assumption: Models can effectively utilize abstract hints to generalize problem-solving strategies.

### Mechanism 2
Hinting is more effective than chain-of-thought prompting due to the "snowball" effect. Chain-of-thought can lead to compounding errors if intermediate steps contain mistakes, whereas hinting provides a correct starting point without requiring detailed step-by-step reasoning. Core assumption: Models' intermediate reasoning steps in chain-of-thought are prone to errors that accumulate and derail solutions.

### Mechanism 3
Models are sensitive to adversarial and random hints, with performance degrading significantly when provided incorrect information. Incorrect hints introduce misleading information that confuses reasoning processes, leading to errors. Core assumption: Models incorporate provided hints into reasoning context, and misleading hints negatively impact problem-solving.

## Foundational Learning

- **Understanding prompting techniques (one-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, hinting)**: Why needed: The paper compares hinting against other methods, requiring clear understanding of each approach's strengths and weaknesses. Quick check: What is the key difference between few-shot prompting and hinting in terms of information provided to the model?

- **Recognizing the "snowball" effect in reasoning models**: Why needed: The paper attributes poorer chain-of-thought performance to snowball effect where mistakes in intermediate steps compound. Quick check: How does the snowball effect in chain-of-thought differ from potential impact of incorrect hints?

- **Evaluating model robustness to adversarial inputs**: Why needed: The paper tests models' sensitivity to adversarial and random hints, requiring understanding of how incorrect information affects performance. Quick check: Why might performance drop below baseline levels when given adversarial hints?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Dataset of math problems → Hint generation model (Gemini-1.5-flash) → Various prompting techniques → Diverse set of LLMs for evaluation
- **Critical path**: Hint generation → Prompting with hints → Model evaluation → Performance comparison
- **Design tradeoffs**: Balancing hint specificity (too specific restricts generalization, too abstract may confuse) vs. model robustness (ability to reject incorrect hints)
- **Failure signatures**: Performance drops with adversarial/random hints, chain-of-thought suffers from snowball effect, base models struggle with instruction following
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Compare hinting vs. baseline performance on subset of math problems to establish effectiveness
  2. Test model sensitivity to adversarial hints by introducing deliberate errors in hints
  3. Evaluate impact of random hints (from unrelated problems) on model performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **How does hinting effectiveness scale with model size for very large LLMs (Llama 3.1 70B/450B, Falcon 180B)?**
- **How robust are hinting techniques against more sophisticated adversarial attacks beyond random and adversarial hints tested?**
- **Can hinting techniques be effectively extended to multi-modal models for visual mathematical reasoning tasks?**

## Limitations

- Exact prompt templates and detailed instructions for generating hints are not provided in main text
- Evaluation uses DeepSeek-7B-Math-Compare-Answer, introducing potential bias from that model's interpretation
- Statistical significance testing or confidence intervals for performance differences are not reported

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Basic premise that hinting improves mathematical reasoning compared to baseline performance is well-supported
- **Medium confidence**: Claim that hinting outperforms chain-of-thought due to snowball effect is plausible but not fully ruled out
- **Low confidence**: Assertion that hinting provides superior generalization compared to few-shot is weakly supported

## Next Checks

1. Perform statistical significance analysis (e.g., paired t-tests) on accuracy differences between hinting and other techniques across models

2. Conduct ablation study on hint specificity by systematically varying hint detail levels

3. Test hinting approach on independent mathematical reasoning dataset (e.g., GSM8K or AQuA) to verify generalizability
