# Survey of Large Multimodal Model Datasets, Application Categories and Taxonomy

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.17759
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17759
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Survey categorizes multimodal datasets into training-specific, task-specific, and domain-specific types to support MLLM development

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive classification of multimodal datasets essential for developing multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The authors categorize datasets into three major types: training-specific, task-specific, and domain-specific, each serving distinct purposes in the MLLM development pipeline. The survey highlights the critical role of large-scale, diverse datasets in enabling robust MLLM performance across various applications including healthcare, autonomous systems, and visual reasoning tasks.

## Method Summary
This survey paper systematically reviews and classifies existing multimodal datasets based on their intended use in MLLM development. The methodology involves analyzing published datasets and categorizing them according to their primary function - whether they support pre-training, serve as benchmarks for specific tasks, or address domain-specific challenges. The survey draws from academic literature and publicly available dataset repositories to compile a taxonomy of multimodal datasets, examining their characteristics, applications, and limitations.

## Key Results
- Categorizes multimodal datasets into training-specific, task-specific, and domain-specific types for systematic MLLM development
- Identifies key datasets like LAION-5B, MS-COCO, and MIMIC-CXR as critical resources for different stages of MLLM development
- Highlights emerging trends toward increasing dataset diversity and addressing real-world complexities in multimodal learning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Categorizing multimodal datasets into training-specific, task-specific, and domain-specific types improves model development efficiency.
- Mechanism: Clear dataset taxonomy reduces the search space for relevant data, enabling targeted model training and benchmarking.
- Core assumption: Different stages of model development (pre-training, fine-tuning, domain adaptation) require distinct dataset characteristics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This survey categorizes multimodal datasets into training-specific, task-specific, and domain-specific types to support the development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs)."
  - [section] "In the following sections, we classify datasets that are critical for MLLMs into three major types: training-specific datasets, task-specific datasets, and domain-specific datasets, as illustrated in Fig. 2."
- Break condition: If dataset overlap between categories is too high, taxonomy loses practical value.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Large-scale multimodal datasets enable comprehensive testing and training of MLLMs.
- Mechanism: Scale increases diversity of data distributions, improving model robustness and generalization.
- Core assumption: Real-world applications require models trained on data that spans varied scenarios and modalities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Large-scale multimodal datasets are essential because they allow for thorough testing and training of these models."
  - [section] "Large-scale multimodal datasets are essential because they allow for thorough testing and training of these models."
- Break condition: If dataset scale comes at the expense of annotation quality, performance gains may not materialize.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Integration of multiple modalities enables more versatile and robust AI systems compared to single-modality approaches.
- Mechanism: Multimodal fusion captures complementary information across data types, enhancing understanding and reasoning.
- Core assumption: Real-world experiences are inherently multimodal, so models must learn cross-modal relationships.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Multimodal learning consists of building models that can process and combine information from various data modalities, such as text, images, audio, and video."
  - [corpus] Corpus shows related surveys on multimodal datasets, supporting the claim's relevance to current research.
- Break condition: If cross-modal integration introduces too much noise, model performance may degrade.

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Dataset repository → Preprocessing pipeline → Model training → Evaluation framework → Domain-specific deployment
- **Critical path**: Dataset selection → Preprocessing → Training → Fine-tuning → Evaluation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Scale vs. quality, diversity vs. specificity, computational cost vs. performance
- **Failure signatures**: Poor cross-modal alignment, bias in training data, inadequate benchmark coverage
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Load and preprocess a small multimodal dataset (e.g., MS-COCO) to verify data pipeline functionality.
  2. Train a simple multimodal model on a task-specific dataset (e.g., VQA) to validate model architecture.
  3. Evaluate model performance on a domain-specific dataset (e.g., MIMIC-CXR) to test domain adaptation capabilities.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do multimodal datasets influence the development of domain-specific applications, such as in healthcare and autonomous driving?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the role of multimodal datasets in domains like healthcare (e.g., MIMIC-CXR) and autonomous driving (e.g., KITTI and nuScenes).
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies these datasets and their applications, it does not explore the specific mechanisms by which these datasets influence model development or address domain-specific challenges.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing model performance across different domain-specific datasets and analyses of how dataset characteristics impact model robustness and adaptability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the most effective strategies for addressing biases and imbalances in multimodal datasets?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions challenges such as data biases and imbalances but does not provide specific strategies for mitigating these issues.
- Why unresolved: Addressing biases is critical for ensuring fair and reliable AI systems, but the paper does not delve into the methodologies or best practices for dataset curation and bias mitigation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Research on bias detection and mitigation techniques, along with case studies demonstrating their effectiveness in multimodal learning.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can multimodal datasets be designed to better support real-world applications with complex interactions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the need for datasets that reflect real-world scenarios and complex interactions, such as those involving tactile, olfactory, and physiological signals.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies the importance of real-world applicability, it does not provide concrete guidelines or examples of how to design datasets that capture these complex interactions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of new datasets that incorporate diverse modalities and complex interactions, along with evaluations of their impact on model performance in real-world applications.

## Limitations

- The survey's classification framework may not account for emerging dataset types or hybrid categories that combine multiple characteristics
- Reliance on publicly available dataset descriptions may not fully capture data quality nuances or annotation consistency
- The survey does not provide quantitative validation of the proposed taxonomy's effectiveness in actual MLLM development workflows

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The categorization of datasets into training-specific, task-specific, and domain-specific types is well-supported by the survey's systematic review of existing literature and datasets.
- **Medium confidence**: The claims about the importance of large-scale multimodal datasets are supported by cited evidence, but the relationship between dataset scale and model performance may vary depending on specific tasks and domains.
- **Medium confidence**: The assertion that multimodal integration enables more robust AI systems is theoretically sound but requires empirical validation across diverse application scenarios.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a comparative analysis of MLLM performance using datasets from different categories (training-specific vs. task-specific) to validate the practical utility of the proposed taxonomy.
2. Evaluate the impact of dataset diversity on model generalization by testing models trained on homogeneous vs. heterogeneous multimodal datasets across multiple domains.
3. Assess the quality and consistency of annotations in large-scale datasets like LAION-5B to determine if scale compromises data reliability.
