# Uncertainty measurement for complex event prediction in safety-critical systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.01289
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01289
- Reference count: 37
- Key outcome: ML_CP approach achieves 99% accuracy in fire detection and 98% in binary congestion classification with prediction intervals and confidence metrics

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes ML_CP, an approach for uncertainty measurement in complex event prediction for safety-critical systems. The method combines machine learning for rule generation, sensitivity analysis (Sobol indices) for input importance, and conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification. Tested on classification and regression problems, ML_CP demonstrates high accuracy while providing transparent uncertainty assessment through prediction intervals. The approach addresses the critical need for reliable complex event processing in domains where prediction uncertainty must be explicitly quantified.

## Method Summary
ML_CP combines Random Forest and kNN models with conformal prediction to generate complex event predictions and associated uncertainty measures. The approach begins with sensitivity analysis using Sobol indices to identify important input parameters, followed by ML model training on the selected features. Conformal prediction is then applied to generate statistically valid prediction intervals with specified confidence levels. The method was evaluated on traffic congestion detection using SUMO-simulated data and fire detection using real sensor data, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline probabilistic models.

## Key Results
- Achieved 99% accuracy in fire detection with ML_CP approach
- Obtained 98% accuracy in binary congestion classification
- Generated prediction intervals with 97% confidence level across all test scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Sobol sensitivity indices identify which input parameters most affect output uncertainty
- Mechanism: The model computes first-order and total Sobol indices (S1 and ST) to quantify each input's contribution to output variance
- Core assumption: Variance-based sensitivity analysis effectively captures input-output relationships in the ML model
- Evidence anchors:
  - "Thus, we use the first-order Sobol indices. These indices identify the input parameters with the most significant effect on output variability"
  - "S1 means first-order Sobol indices, and ST indicates total Sobol indices"
- Break condition: The Sobol index calculations fail if the model output is not sensitive to input variations, or if input parameters are correlated in ways that violate Sobol's independence assumption.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Conformal prediction provides statistically valid prediction intervals with specified confidence levels
- Mechanism: The ICP model generates prediction intervals by computing nonconformity scores from calibration data and applying significance thresholds
- Core assumption: The underlying ML model's predictions follow the same distribution as the calibration data
- Evidence anchors:
  - "Therefore, we use conformal prediction to build prediction intervals, as the model itself has uncertainties, and the data has noise"
  - "We use the conformal predictor shown in Figure 1 as part of our approach proposed"
- Break condition: The prediction intervals become invalid if the data distribution shifts significantly from the calibration set, or if the nonconformity measure is not properly calibrated.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: ML rule generation replaces manual CEP rule creation while maintaining accuracy
- Mechanism: Random Forest and kNN models learn patterns from training data to predict complex events, with sensitivity analysis explaining input importance
- Core assumption: The ML model can capture the same patterns that human experts would encode in manual rules
- Evidence anchors:
  - "Instead of using specialists' manual work to compose the model rules, we use machine learning (ML) to self-define these patterns"
  - "the model should be responsible for elaborating the rules for triggering a complex event"
- Break condition: The ML model fails to generalize if the training data is insufficient or unrepresentative of real-world conditions.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Sobol sensitivity analysis
  - Why needed here: To identify which input parameters contribute most to output uncertainty in complex event predictions
  - Quick check question: What does a high Sobol index (close to 1) indicate about an input parameter's effect on output variance?

- Concept: Conformal prediction
  - Why needed here: To provide statistically valid uncertainty quantification through prediction intervals
  - Quick check question: How does the significance level α relate to the confidence level of prediction intervals?

- Concept: Complex event processing (CEP)
  - Why needed here: To understand how primitive events combine to form higher-level complex events
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes primitive events from complex events in CEP systems?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input data → Sensitivity analysis (Sobol indices) → Feature selection → ML model (RF/kNN) → Conformal prediction → Prediction intervals with confidence metrics
- Critical path: Data preprocessing → Sobol sensitivity analysis → ML model training → Conformal prediction calibration → Test prediction
- Design tradeoffs: ML CP achieves higher accuracy but requires more computational resources than simpler probabilistic models (NPM/IPM)
- Failure signatures: High prediction intervals indicate model uncertainty; low sensitivity indices suggest inputs can be ignored
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Binary classification (congestion detection) with simulated SUMO traffic data
  2. Multi-level classification (congestion severity levels) with same traffic dataset
  3. Regression (predicting jam length) with traffic data features

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the ML_CP approach perform when applied to data from real-world IoT sensor networks with varying degrees of noise and missing data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that uncertainty measurement is necessary for event representation languages and that sensors can be noisy, data transmission can be affected by the available network, or even the rules of pattern combinations to trigger a complex event can contain faults.
- Why unresolved: The experiments in the paper were conducted on simulated data and a single real dataset. Real-world IoT sensor networks often have varying degrees of noise, missing data, and other complexities not present in the tested datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the ML_CP approach on multiple real-world IoT sensor networks with varying levels of noise and missing data, and comparing its performance to other approaches under these conditions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the ML_CP approach be extended to handle streaming data and adapt to changing patterns in real-time?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the inductive conformal predictor (ICP) is used, which requires that the ML model be trained one single time for all predictions until a new amount of data is collected, and it is worth retraining to update the model.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not discuss how the ML_CP approach handles streaming data or adapts to changing patterns in real-time. This is a crucial aspect of complex event processing in dynamic environments.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing the ML_CP approach to handle streaming data and adapt to changing patterns in real-time, and evaluating its performance in a dynamic environment.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the ML_CP approach scale with the number of input parameters and the complexity of the event patterns?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that complex events are composed of a large amount of data from different sources and that the sensitivity analysis identifies the input parameters with the most significant effect on output variability.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not discuss how the ML_CP approach scales with the number of input parameters and the complexity of the event patterns. This is an important consideration for real-world applications with numerous sensors and complex event patterns.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the ML_CP approach with varying numbers of input parameters and complex event patterns, and analyzing its performance and computational requirements.

## Limitations
- Performance evaluation based on simulated traffic data rather than real-world sensor networks
- Sobol sensitivity analysis assumes input parameter independence, which may not hold in practice
- Limited testing to specific domains (traffic and fire detection) without broader applicability validation

## Confidence
- Medium: Strong performance metrics in controlled experiments, but limited real-world validation and domain generalizability

## Next Checks
1. **Real-world deployment test**: Validate the ML_CP approach on live traffic monitoring systems with actual sensor data rather than simulated SUMO data.
2. **Distribution shift evaluation**: Assess model performance when input data distributions change significantly from the training set to test robustness of the conformal prediction intervals.
3. **Multi-domain application**: Apply the approach to a different safety-critical domain (e.g., industrial equipment monitoring) to verify generalizability beyond traffic and fire detection scenarios.
