# Time Series Foundational Models: Their Role in Anomaly Detection and Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.19286
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19286
- Reference count: 25
- Primary result: TSFMs like TimeGPT and FPT show promise in forecasting but traditional statistical and deep learning models outperform them in anomaly detection and prediction tasks

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates time series foundational models (TSFMs) for anomaly detection and prediction across five diverse datasets. While TSFMs demonstrate strong forecasting capabilities, traditional statistical models (Weighted XGBoost) and deep learning approaches (Autoencoder) consistently outperform them in anomaly-related tasks. The research reveals that TSFMs require substantial computational resources, struggle to capture sequential dependencies, and lack interpretability—critical factors for practical anomaly detection. Fine-tuning provides only marginal improvements, suggesting that TSFMs are not inherently optimized for detecting rare, unexpected patterns in time series data.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates five TSFMs (TimeGPT, FPT, Time-MOE, MOIRAI, Chronos) against traditional statistical (Weighted XGBoost) and deep learning (Autoencoder) models across five datasets: Pulp and Paper manufacturing, Future Factories, MSL, SMD, and ETTh1. Zero-shot and fine-tuning experiments are conducted using original hyperparameters, with performance measured through precision, recall, F1-score, RMSE, MSE, and MAE. Computational costs are assessed through inference time measurements, and all models are compared across anomaly detection and prediction tasks.

## Key Results
- TSFMs demonstrate superior forecasting performance but underperform in anomaly detection compared to traditional models
- Weighted XGBoost and Autoencoder models achieve higher precision, recall, and F1-scores for anomaly detection tasks
- TSFMs require significantly higher computational resources with only marginal improvements from fine-tuning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Time series foundational models (TSFMs) are not inherently optimized for anomaly detection and prediction tasks because they are designed for general-purpose forecasting.
- Mechanism: TSFMs focus on predicting future values in a sequence, which is fundamentally different from detecting rare, unexpected patterns (anomalies). Their architectures and training objectives do not prioritize identifying deviations from normal behavior.
- Core assumption: The core assumption is that forecasting and anomaly detection require different types of pattern recognition and data handling.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "TSFMs may either miss subtle anomalies or mistakenly classify normal variations as anomalies, leading to high false positive rates."
  - [section] "Time series foundational models (TSFMs) have gained prominence in time series forecasting, promising state-of-the-art performance across various applications. However, their application in anomaly detection and prediction remains underexplored..."
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence; the cited papers focus on adapting TSFMs for anomaly tasks, which aligns with the claim that TSFMs are not naturally suited for this purpose.
- Break condition: This mechanism breaks if TSFMs are specifically trained or fine-tuned with objectives that prioritize anomaly detection, which could shift their pattern recognition capabilities.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: TSFMs require significant computational resources and lack interpretability, making them less practical for anomaly detection compared to traditional models.
- Mechanism: TSFMs are resource-intensive due to their large scale and complex architectures. Their black-box nature also limits interpretability, which is crucial in high-stakes applications like anomaly detection.
- Core assumption: The assumption is that computational efficiency and interpretability are critical factors in the practical deployment of anomaly detection models.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "TSFMs require high computational resources and fail to capture sequential dependencies effectively."
  - [section] "TSFMs are resource-intensive, requiring substantial computational power and extensive labeled datasets for training."
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence; the cited papers do not directly address computational efficiency or interpretability issues of TSFMs.
- Break condition: This mechanism breaks if TSFMs become more computationally efficient through architectural improvements or if techniques for improving interpretability are developed and integrated.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Traditional statistical and deep learning models outperform TSFMs in anomaly detection due to their task-specific design and efficiency.
- Mechanism: Statistical models like Weighted XGBoost and deep learning models like Autoencoders are designed with specific objectives for anomaly detection, making them more effective and efficient for this task compared to general-purpose TSFMs.
- Core assumption: The assumption is that models designed for specific tasks will outperform general-purpose models in those tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "traditional statistical and deep learning models consistently outperform them in anomaly detection and prediction tasks."
  - [section] "Statistical models like weighted XGBoost excel in anomaly detection and prediction due to their interpretability, using feature importance and ensemble methods..."
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence; the cited papers focus on adapting TSFMs for anomaly tasks, which indirectly supports the claim that traditional models are currently more effective.
- Break condition: This mechanism breaks if TSFMs are specifically optimized for anomaly detection tasks, potentially surpassing the performance of traditional models.

  - Why needed here: Interpretability is crucial for understanding and trusting anomaly detection results, especially in high-stakes applications.
  - Quick check question: Why is interpretability particularly important in anomaly detection, and how do traditional models achieve it better than TSFMs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  TSFM models (TimeGPT, FPT, Time-MOE, MOIRAI, Chronos) -> Traditional models (Weighted XGBoost, Autoencoder) -> Datasets (Pulp and Paper, Future Factories, MSL, SMD, ETTh1) -> Evaluation metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-score, RMSE, MSE, MAE)

- Critical path:
  1. Preprocess datasets to meet model requirements.
  2. Evaluate TSFMs for anomaly detection and prediction.
  3. Compare TSFMs with traditional models using evaluation metrics.
  4. Analyze computational costs and interpretability.
  5. Draw conclusions on model effectiveness and practicality.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - TSFMs offer strong forecasting capabilities but lack specialization for anomaly detection.
  - Traditional models are efficient and interpretable but may not generalize as well across diverse tasks.
  - Fine-tuning TSFMs provides marginal improvements, indicating limited adaptability.

- Failure signatures:
  - TSFMs miss subtle anomalies or misclassify normal variations as anomalies.
  - High computational costs and lack of interpretability limit TSFMs' practical deployment.
  - Traditional models may struggle with generalization across diverse datasets.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare the performance of TimeGPT and FPT on the Pulp dataset for anomaly detection, focusing on precision and recall.
  2. Evaluate the computational efficiency of Weighted XGBoost and Autoencoder on the MSL dataset for anomaly prediction, measuring inference times.
  3. Fine-tune TimeGPT on the Future Factories dataset and assess the impact on anomaly detection performance compared to zero-shot results.

## Next Checks

1. **Architectural Analysis**: Conduct detailed examination of how TimeGPT and FPT process sequential patterns compared to Autoencoder architectures, using attention visualization and feature importance analysis to identify specific failure modes in anomaly detection.

2. **Cross-domain Generalization**: Test the same models on financial time series (stock prices, trading volumes) and medical monitoring data to assess whether observed performance patterns hold across different application domains with varying anomaly characteristics.

3. **Optimization Impact**: Implement distributed computing and model pruning techniques for TSFMs, then rerun computational efficiency analysis to determine whether resource constraints could be significantly reduced without sacrificing anomaly detection performance.
