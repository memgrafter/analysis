# Contrastive Learning for Character Detection in Ancient Greek Papyri

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2409.10156
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10156
- **Reference count**: 0
- **Primary result**: SimCLR contrastive learning underperforms traditional cross-entropy models for Greek letter recognition

## Executive Summary
This thesis investigates the effectiveness of SimCLR, a contrastive learning technique, for Greek letter recognition tasks. The study compares SimCLR's performance against traditional baseline models using cross-entropy and triplet loss functions. Three training methods are examined: a baseline model with cross-entropy loss, a triplet model with triplet loss, and a SimCLR model with InfoNCE loss. Experiments are conducted using both the large Alpub dataset for pretraining and the smaller ICDAR dataset for fine-tuning. Results show that the baseline model using cross-entropy loss consistently outperforms both SimCLR and the triplet loss model. SimCLR's cropping strategies lead to a semantic shift in the input image, reducing training effectiveness despite the large pretraining dataset. The study highlights the limitations of SimCLR in letter recognition tasks and emphasizes the effectiveness of traditional supervised learning models.

## Method Summary
The research employs a comparative study design examining three distinct training methodologies for Greek letter recognition. The baseline model utilizes cross-entropy loss with standard supervised learning. The triplet model implements triplet loss to learn embeddings by comparing anchor-positive and anchor-negative pairs. The SimCLR model applies contrastive learning with InfoNCE loss, using data augmentation through random cropping to create positive pairs from the same image. All models undergo pretraining on the Alpub dataset (containing 170,000+ Greek letter images) followed by fine-tuning on the ICDAR dataset. The study evaluates model performance using standard accuracy metrics, with particular attention to how different loss functions and training strategies affect recognition capabilities in ancient Greek papyri.

## Key Results
- Baseline model with cross-entropy loss consistently outperforms both SimCLR and triplet loss models
- SimCLR's cropping strategies cause semantic shift in input images, reducing training effectiveness
- Despite large Alpub pretraining dataset, SimCLR fails to match traditional supervised learning performance
- Triplet loss model shows intermediate performance between baseline and SimCLR approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study reveals that traditional cross-entropy loss functions are better suited for Greek letter recognition tasks than contrastive learning approaches. The mechanism appears to stem from how character recognition requires precise preservation of letter features, which SimCLR's aggressive data augmentation disrupts. When images are randomly cropped for contrastive learning, the resulting semantic shift alters critical character features, making it difficult for the model to learn meaningful representations. Traditional supervised learning with cross-entropy loss maintains the integrity of character features while directly optimizing for classification accuracy. The triplet loss model, while attempting to learn more discriminative features, still struggles with the fine-grained distinctions required for accurate character recognition.

## Foundational Learning
- **Cross-entropy loss**: Standard classification loss measuring probability distribution divergence between predictions and labels; needed for direct optimization of classification accuracy in supervised learning
- **Triplet loss**: Metric learning loss that pulls similar examples together and pushes dissimilar examples apart in embedding space; required for learning discriminative features without explicit labels
- **InfoNCE loss**: Contrastive learning objective that maximizes mutual information between augmented views of the same image; essential for self-supervised representation learning
- **Data augmentation**: Technique of applying transformations to training data to improve generalization; critical for contrastive learning but problematic when it alters semantic content
- **Semantic shift**: Change in meaning or interpretation of data due to transformations; particularly harmful in character recognition where feature preservation is crucial
- **Pretraining and fine-tuning**: Two-stage training approach where models first learn general features on large datasets before adapting to specific tasks; standard practice for leveraging large unlabeled corpora

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Alpub Dataset -> Pretraining -> ICDAR Dataset -> Fine-tuning -> Evaluation

Critical Path: Data Augmentation -> Model Training -> Loss Computation -> Backpropagation -> Parameter Updates

Design Tradeoffs:
- SimCLR prioritizes representation learning through data augmentation but sacrifices feature preservation
- Cross-entropy baseline trades off generalization benefits of contrastive learning for direct classification optimization
- Triplet loss attempts middle ground but inherits limitations of both approaches

Failure Signatures:
- High variance in training accuracy indicates semantic shift from data augmentation
- Poor fine-tuning performance suggests pretraining learned non-transferable features
- Inconsistent character recognition reveals feature corruption during augmentation

First Experiments:
1. Compare character recognition accuracy across different augmentation strategies while keeping loss function constant
2. Measure feature similarity between original and augmented images using learned embeddings
3. Evaluate model performance on progressively smaller character datasets to test generalization limits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited exploration of alternative data augmentation methods that might preserve character semantics
- Restricted domain analysis (Greek papyri) without testing generalizability to other scripts
- Small ICDAR dataset for fine-tuning raises concerns about potential overfitting

## Confidence
- Traditional cross-entropy outperforms contrastive approaches: High
- Semantic shift from cropping causes performance degradation: Medium
- Results generalizable to other script recognition tasks: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test alternative data augmentation strategies (rotations, elastic distortions) that preserve character semantics while maintaining contrastive learning benefits
2. Evaluate model performance across multiple script recognition tasks (Latin, Arabic, Chinese) to assess domain generalizability
3. Conduct ablation studies varying batch size, temperature parameters, and projection head architecture in the SimCLR model to identify optimal configurations for character recognition
