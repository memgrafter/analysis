# Novel Representation Learning Technique using Graphs for Performance Analytics

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.10799
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10799
- Authors: Tarek Ramadan; Ankur Lahiry; Tanzima Z. Islam
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proposed PinG method achieves up to 61.67% and 78.56% improvement in MSE loss over DNN baseline for HPC and ML datasets respectively, even with up to 25% missing values.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces PinG (Performance analytics using Graphs), a novel representation learning technique that transforms tabular performance data into graph structures to improve regression models for HPC performance analytics. The approach leverages Graph Neural Networks with self-supervised learning to capture complex relationships between features and samples, addressing limitations of traditional tabular approaches. The method shows significant improvements over state-of-the-art techniques, particularly in handling missing data and capturing nuanced relationships in HPC workloads.

## Method Summary
The PinG approach transforms tabular performance data into graphs where nodes represent samples and edges are determined by feature similarity. Two construction methods are proposed: Single-graph Construction (SGC) using top-N cosine similarity and Batched-graph Construction (BGC) using HDBscan clustering. A Graph Neural Network with self-supervised learning generates embeddings from the graph structure, which are then fed to a simple feed-forward neural network for regression prediction. The method handles missing values through preprocessing imputation and shows robust performance even with significant data incompleteness.

## Key Results
- PinG outperforms DNN baseline by 61.67% MSE improvement on HPC datasets
- PinG achieves 78.56% MSE improvement over DNN baseline on ML benchmark datasets
- Method maintains effectiveness with up to 25% random missing values in features

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Transforming tabular performance data into graph structures improves regression effectiveness by explicitly modeling relationships between samples and features. The graph formulation captures sample-to-sample and feature-to-feature similarities through edge weights, allowing downstream models to leverage neighborhood information during training and inference. This works under the assumption that similar performance samples produce similar runtimes, and these relationships are more effectively captured in graph structures than raw tabular format. The method may fail if cosine similarity fails to identify meaningful relationships or if HPC applications are too diverse for similarity-based grouping to be useful.

### Mechanism 2
Self-supervised learning with automated edge inference optimizes the graph structure beyond initial similarity-based construction. A GNN model with self-supervision refines initial edge weights by propagating error signals through the graph, strengthening connections between truly similar samples and weakening connections between dissimilar ones. This relies on the assumption that the self-supervised loss function can effectively learn which edges represent meaningful relationships for the regression task without labeled data. The approach may break if self-supervised loss fails to converge or produces edge weights that degrade regression performance.

### Mechanism 3
Graph representation learning enables better handling of missing data compared to traditional tabular methods. The graph structure allows information propagation through neighboring nodes, effectively imputing missing values based on similarity to other samples while preserving learned relationships during inference. This assumes missing values are random and neighboring samples with similar features can provide meaningful substitutes for missing information. The mechanism may fail if missing data is systematic rather than random or if similarity-based imputation introduces significant bias.

## Foundational Learning

- **Graph Neural Networks and message passing**: Essential for understanding how PinG aggregates information from neighboring nodes to update representations. Quick check: Can you explain how a GraphSAGE layer aggregates neighbor features to update a node's representation?

- **Self-supervised learning objectives**: Critical for understanding how the edge refinement process optimizes graph structure without requiring labeled data. Quick check: What are the key differences between contrastive self-supervision and predictive self-supervision in graph contexts?

- **Cosine similarity and distance metrics**: Fundamental to the initial graph construction where edge weights are determined by feature vector similarity. Quick check: How does cosine similarity differ from Euclidean distance when measuring similarity between high-dimensional feature vectors?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Tabular data → Graph construction (SGC/BGC) → GNN training with self-supervision → Embedding extraction → Regression prediction

- **Critical path**: The end-to-end pipeline transforms raw performance data into graph representations, learns embeddings through GNN self-supervision, and uses these embeddings for accurate runtime prediction.

- **Design tradeoffs**: Single-graph vs batched-graph approaches balance memory efficiency against potential for better local structure capture. The number of neighbors (N) involves tradeoffs between graph density and computational cost. Different self-supervision objectives may optimize for different aspects of graph structure.

- **Failure signatures**: Poor performance despite correct implementation may indicate similarity metrics aren't capturing meaningful relationships in the specific HPC domain. Slow GNN training convergence suggests the self-supervision objective may not be well-suited to the regression task. Memory errors during graph construction may require reducing neighbors or switching from single-graph to batched-graph approach.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Implement single-graph construction with cosine similarity and a simple GCN without self-supervision, then evaluate regression performance on a small HPC dataset.
  2. Add the self-supervision component to the GCN and compare performance improvement.
  3. Compare single-graph approach with batched-graph approach on the same dataset, varying the number of neighbors to find optimal balance.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does PinG performance compare when applied to datasets with significantly different characteristics, such as high dimensionality or high class imbalance, beyond the ones tested in this study? The paper evaluates on specific HPC and ML datasets but doesn't explore generalizability to datasets with extreme characteristics. Testing on datasets with varying characteristics and comparing performance to other methods would resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
What is the impact of using different graph construction methods, such as random graph generation or community detection algorithms, on PinG performance? The paper proposes SGC and BGC but doesn't explore alternative graph construction techniques. Implementing and comparing PinG performance using different graph construction methods would address this question.

### Open Question 3
How does PinG perform in real-time streaming scenarios where new data arrives continuously and the graph needs to be updated dynamically? While the paper mentions potential for streaming performance analytics, it doesn't provide evaluation of real-time performance. Implementing PinG in a real-time streaming scenario and evaluating accuracy, latency, and resource utilization would resolve this question.

## Limitations
- Claims about edge refinement through self-supervision lack direct empirical validation through ablation studies
- Effectiveness of cosine similarity-based graph construction for diverse HPC applications remains uncertain without domain-specific validation
- Computational overhead of graph-based approach versus simpler tabular methods is not quantified

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Core mechanism of transforming tabular data into graphs for performance analytics is well-founded and reported MSE improvements over baselines are substantial
- **Medium confidence**: Effectiveness of self-supervised edge refinement mechanism is supported by overall results but lacks detailed ablation studies to isolate specific contribution
- **Low confidence**: Claim that graph representation inherently handles missing data better than traditional methods is not directly tested against imputation baselines

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify specific contribution of self-supervised edge refinement versus initial cosine similarity construction
2. Compare proposed method against strong missing data imputation baselines (MICE, k-NN imputation) to validate claimed advantage in handling missing values
3. Perform computational complexity analysis comparing graph construction and GNN training time versus traditional tabular regression methods
