# SplitVAEs: Decentralized scenario generation from siloed data for stochastic optimization problems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.12328
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12328
- Reference count: 39
- One-line primary result: Decentralized VAE framework generates scenarios statistically equivalent to centralized methods while reducing data transmission by up to 5×.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of generating high-quality, data-driven scenarios for stochastic optimization in large-scale, multi-stakeholder networked systems where data silos prevent centralized data aggregation. The proposed method, SplitVAEs, introduces a decentralized scenario generation framework that combines edge-based autoencoders with a server-driven variational autoencoder to jointly learn spatial and temporal interdependencies from siloed data without data movement. Experiments across diverse domains demonstrate that SplitVAEs generates scenarios statistically equivalent to centralized methods while significantly reducing data transmission requirements.

## Method Summary
SplitVAEs is a decentralized scenario generation framework that combines edge-based autoencoders with a server-driven variational autoencoder. The framework learns spatial and temporal interdependencies from siloed data without data movement by decomposing global backpropagation steps into edge and server-based sub-problems. Edge nodes process local time-series data using autoencoders to generate low-dimensional embeddings, which are sent to a central server. The server VAE models the joint spatial-temporal distribution and generates predicted embeddings sent back to edges. This enables bi-directional flow of learning insights while eliminating raw data transmission.

## Key Results
- Generates scenarios statistically equivalent to centralized methods (Gaussian copula, Central-VAE)
- Reduces data transmission by up to 5× compared to centralized approaches
- Achieves robust performance across varying dataset dimensions and architectures
- Evaluation metrics show FID scores of 2.105-2.814, ES scores of 0.092-0.310, RMSE of 0.201-0.462, and CRPS of 0.168-0.329

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The framework achieves high-fidelity scenario generation without centralized data aggregation by having edge-based autoencoders generate low-dimensional embeddings locally, which are then used by a server-based VAE to model joint spatial-temporal distributions. The core assumption is that local edge encoders can capture sufficient local temporal dynamics, and the server VAE can learn global spatial dependencies from the aggregated embeddings. If edge embeddings lose critical temporal features, or server VAE fails to learn cross-edge correlations, scenario quality degrades.

### Mechanism 2
Backpropagation can be decomposed to flow insights between edge and server without raw data transfer by computing reconstruction loss locally and sending gradients back to server, while KL loss is computed at server and gradients are sent to edges. The core assumption is that this split computation of reconstruction and KL loss allows training to proceed with only gradients and low-dimensional embeddings moving between components. If gradient communication is lossy or delayed, model convergence is impaired.

### Mechanism 3
The approach maintains robust performance comparable to centralized methods while reducing data transmission by sampling from the learned latent space distribution and validating against centralized benchmarks using metrics like FID, ES, RMSE, CRPS. The core assumption is that sampling from the server VAE's latent distribution can reconstruct realistic scenarios even without direct access to raw edge data. If latent space sampling does not capture the true data distribution, generated scenarios will be unrealistic.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and their training objectives
  - Why needed here: SplitVAEs relies on VAE architecture for latent space modeling and scenario generation
  - Quick check question: What are the two main loss components in VAE training, and what does each measure?

- Concept: Backpropagation and gradient flow in neural networks
  - Why needed here: The paper decomposes backpropagation across edge and server components
  - Quick check question: In a typical neural network, in which direction does gradient information flow during backpropagation?

- Concept: Data silos and privacy-preserving decentralized learning
  - Why needed here: The motivation and context for SplitVAEs is to avoid centralized data aggregation due to silos
  - Quick check question: What is a "data silo" in the context of multi-stakeholder networked systems?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Edge nodes (local autoencoders) -> Server node (central VAE) -> Edge nodes (decoded reconstructions)

- Critical path:
  1. Edge encoder forward pass → send embeddings to server
  2. Server VAE forward pass → send predicted embeddings to edges
  3. Edge decoder forward pass → compute local reconstruction loss
  4. Edge decoder backward pass → send gradients to server
  5. Server VAE backward pass → send gradients to edge encoders
  6. Edge encoder backward pass

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Embedding dimension vs. data transmission: Lower dimensions reduce transmission but may lose information
  - VAE latent dimension vs. scenario quality: Higher dimensions may improve fidelity but increase complexity
  - Number of edge nodes vs. scalability: More nodes increase communication overhead but improve coverage

- Failure signatures:
  - High FID/ES scores compared to benchmarks → poor scenario quality
  - Slow or unstable training loss decrease → gradient communication issues or poor model initialization
  - Edge reconstruction errors remain high → local AE not capturing temporal dynamics well

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train SplitVAEs on a small synthetic dataset with known spatial-temporal structure; compare generated scenarios to ground truth
  2. Measure data transmission volume for different embedding dimensions; verify the claimed 5× reduction
  3. Gradually increase number of edge nodes; observe training stability and scenario quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the performance of SplitVAEs scale with increasing numbers of stakeholders and data dimensionality beyond the tested cases? The paper mentions "robust performance across varying dataset dimensions" but does not provide comprehensive scaling analysis for extremely large networks. Extensive experiments testing SplitVAEs with progressively larger stakeholder networks and higher dimensional data, including performance metrics and computational resource requirements, would resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
How sensitive is SplitVAEs to the choice of hyperparameters, particularly latent space dimensions and autoencoder architecture configurations? The paper mentions hyperparameter tuning as crucial but does not provide comprehensive sensitivity analysis or guidelines for optimal configuration. Detailed sensitivity analysis across a wide range of hyperparameter combinations, including guidelines for configuration selection based on data characteristics, would resolve this question.

### Open Question 3
How does SplitVAEs perform under real-world conditions with non-stationary data distributions and concept drift? The experiments use historical datasets with fixed distributions, but real-world applications involve evolving data patterns over time. Experiments using streaming data with artificial concept drift or real-world datasets spanning extended time periods, measuring performance degradation and adaptation capabilities, would resolve this question.

## Limitations
- The exact neural network architectures and hyperparameter settings are not fully specified, making exact reproduction uncertain
- Scalability to extremely large numbers of edge nodes beyond the tested range remains unverified
- The claimed 5× data transmission reduction lacks detailed breakdown for direct comparison with centralized approaches

## Confidence

- **High confidence** in the core mechanism of decentralized training using decomposed backpropagation and low-dimensional embeddings - the algorithmic framework is clearly specified and the mathematical formulation is sound
- **Medium confidence** in the performance claims (FID, ES, RMSE, CRPS scores) - while results are presented, the lack of detailed architectural specifications and hyperparameter values makes exact reproduction uncertain
- **Low confidence** in the claimed 5× data transmission reduction - the paper does not provide a detailed breakdown of data volumes transmitted in both centralized and decentralized approaches for direct comparison

## Next Checks

1. **Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary the latent dimensions, learning rates, and batch sizes to identify their impact on scenario quality (FID, ES, RMSE, CRPS) and determine the sensitivity of performance to these parameters

2. **Scalability stress test**: Gradually increase the number of edge nodes beyond the tested range (e.g., from 16 to 64 or 128) while monitoring training stability, scenario quality, and communication overhead to identify the scalability limits of the approach

3. **Architecture ablation study**: Compare the performance of SplitVAEs with different neural network architectures (e.g., varying number of layers, activation functions, embedding dimensions) for both the edge autoencoders and server VAE to quantify the contribution of each architectural choice to the overall performance
