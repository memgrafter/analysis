# Intersymbolic AI: Interlinking Symbolic AI and Subsymbolic AI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.11563
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11563
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces Intersymbolic AI as a new field combining symbolic and subsymbolic AI paradigms

## Executive Summary
This perspective piece introduces Intersymbolic AI as a new field combining symbolic AI, whose building blocks carry inherent meaning, with subsymbolic AI, whose overall effect is significant despite individual components lacking clear meaning. The paper characterizes symbolic AI through logic, planning, and games where individual actions carry clear semantic significance, while subsymbolic AI includes neural networks and reinforcement learning where individual weights or actions lack direct interpretation but produce meaningful outcomes through composition. The core idea is to interlink these two paradigms strategically - using symbolic components where compositional meaning and correctness are crucial, and subsymbolic components where flexibility and implicit optimization are beneficial.

## Method Summary
The paper surveys existing approaches that combine symbolic and subsymbolic AI, identifying three successful patterns: Safe AI for cyber-physical systems using hybrid systems theorem proving with reinforcement learning and neural networks; automatic symbolic AI proof generation combining mathematical invariants with numerical optimization; and learning to prove theorems through combining symbolic nondeterministic programming with subsymbolic deep neural networks. These examples demonstrate Intersymbolic AI's potential across different domains and applications.

## Key Results
- Intersymbolic AI combines the precision of symbolic reasoning with the data-driven generalization of subsymbolic approaches
- The approach is particularly effective for safe autonomous cyber-physical systems where symbolic verification provides safety guarantees while subsymbolic learning handles complexity
- Intersymbolic AI can automate complex symbolic reasoning tasks by combining symbolic proof strategies with subsymbolic optimization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Intersymbolic AI combines the precision of symbolic reasoning with the data-driven generalization of subsymbolic approaches, achieving capabilities neither could reach alone.
- Mechanism: By using symbolic AI where compositional meaning and correctness are crucial (e.g., safety verification) and subsymbolic AI where flexibility and implicit optimization are beneficial (e.g., learning from experience), Intersymbolic AI creates synergistic effects that cancel out individual weaknesses.
- Core assumption: The respective advantages of symbolic and subsymbolic AI are additive while their respective weaknesses naturally cancel each other out when properly combined.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The way Intersymbolic AI combines both symbolic and subsymbolic AI to increase the effectiveness of AI compared to either kind of AI alone is likened to the way that the combination of both conscious and subconscious thought increases the effectiveness of human thought"
  - [section] "This complementary distribution of strengths and weaknesses calls for a synergy of symbolic AI with subsymbolic AI called Intersymbolic AI"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - only 5 related papers found with average FMR 0.531, suggesting limited prior research in this specific area
- Break condition: If the symbolic components cannot effectively constrain the subsymbolic learning, or if the subsymbolic components cannot provide the flexibility needed for complex domains, the synergy fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Intersymbolic AI enables safe autonomous cyber-physical systems by combining provably correct symbolic verification with flexible subsymbolic learning.
- Mechanism: Symbolic hybrid systems theorem proving verifies safety properties, while reinforcement learning or neural networks handle the complex control learning, with ModelPlex-style shielding ensuring runtime safety.
- Core assumption: Symbolic verification can provide safety guarantees that subsymbolic learning alone cannot achieve, while subsymbolic learning can handle the complexity that symbolic approaches struggle with.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Safe AI in CPS [24,78] has been made possible for the case of reinforcement learning with Justified Speculative Control [25,26] as well as for neural network control systems with VerSAILLE [100]"
  - [section] "This approach even works for (limited) uncertainty about the physical model [26]"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus neighbors, but this is a core claim of the paper
- Break condition: If the symbolic verification cannot scale to the complexity of the system, or if the subsymbolic learning cannot be adequately constrained by the symbolic safety requirements.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Intersymbolic AI can automate complex symbolic reasoning tasks by combining symbolic proof strategies with subsymbolic optimization.
- Mechanism: Symbolic nondeterministic programming describes high-level proof strategies, while deep neural networks trained via reinforcement learning optimize the search for concrete proofs.
- Core assumption: Symbolic strategies provide the structure needed for meaningful learning, while subsymbolic optimization can effectively search the space of possible proofs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Both use an AlphaZero agent [95] with Monte-Carlo Tree Search for a symbolic AI nondeterministic programming language to describe very high level generic proof search strategies"
  - [section] "The Looprl prover [49] circumvents the issue by providing both a student agent that learns how to prove theorems and a teacher agent that learns how to pose effective theorem proving challenges"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus neighbors, but this represents a novel application of the Intersymbolic AI concept
- Break condition: If the symbolic strategies are too rigid to allow meaningful learning, or if the subsymbolic optimization cannot effectively search the constrained space.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Symbolic AI and its characteristics
  - Why needed here: Understanding what makes symbolic AI "symbolic" (compositional meaning, interpretability, correctness) is essential for knowing when and how to apply it in Intersymbolic systems
  - Quick check question: What are the key characteristics that distinguish symbolic AI from subsymbolic AI according to the paper?
- Concept: Subsymbolic AI and its characteristics
  - Why needed here: Understanding the strengths and limitations of subsymbolic approaches (flexibility, implicit optimization, data hunger) is crucial for effective combination
  - Quick check question: How does the paper characterize the main advantages and disadvantages of subsymbolic AI approaches?
- Concept: Cyber-physical systems and safety requirements
  - Why needed here: The paper uses CPS as a key application domain, so understanding the safety challenges in autonomous systems is important
  - Quick check question: Why does the paper argue that autonomous CPS particularly benefit from Intersymbolic AI approaches?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Symbolic verification module -> Subsymbolic learning module -> Safety constraint interface -> Runtime execution controller
- Critical path: Ensuring symbolic constraints effectively guide subsymbolic learning without overly constraining it, while subsymbolic outputs can be meaningfully interpreted and verified
- Design tradeoffs: Choosing which components should be symbolic vs. subsymbolic requires careful consideration of where compositional meaning is essential versus where flexibility and implicit optimization are more valuable
- Failure signatures: Symbolic components becoming bottlenecks that prevent subsymbolic learning from being effective, or subsymbolic components violating symbolic constraints in ways that are difficult to detect or correct
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple symbolic verifier for a basic control system, then add a subsymbolic learner to handle more complex scenarios while the verifier ensures safety constraints
  2. Create a symbolic planning system for a game, then integrate a subsymbolic evaluation function learned from gameplay to improve strategic decisions
  3. Build a symbolic invariant generator for a simple differential equation, then use subsymbolic optimization to find parameter choices that make the invariants valid

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None explicitly stated in the provided content.

## Limitations
- The paper presents a conceptual framework rather than empirical results, limiting direct validation
- Evidence for claimed mechanisms is primarily illustrative through case studies rather than controlled experiments
- Practical implementation details and scalability considerations remain largely unaddressed

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in the characterization of symbolic vs. subsymbolic AI distinctions and their respective strengths/weaknesses
- **Medium confidence** in the proposed mechanisms for Intersymbolic AI synergy, as these are largely theoretical
- **Low confidence** in scalability claims and practical implementation guidance, as the paper provides limited empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. Implement a benchmark suite comparing pure symbolic, pure subsymbolic, and Intersymbolic approaches on safety-critical control tasks to quantify the claimed synergistic benefits
2. Conduct ablation studies on existing Intersymbolic systems to determine the marginal contribution of symbolic vs. subsymbolic components in different scenarios
3. Develop standardized metrics for evaluating the effectiveness of Intersymbolic interfaces in maintaining symbolic constraints while enabling subsymbolic flexibility
