# Semantic Prototypes: Enhancing Transparency Without Black Boxes

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.15871
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15871
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Semantic prototypes using concept-based descriptions outperform traditional prototype methods in facilitating human understanding and informativeness

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of making machine learning model explanations more interpretable and transparent by proposing semantic prototypes. Traditional prototype methods rely on raw data and opaque latent spaces, making them difficult to understand and potentially misleading. The proposed approach uses semantic descriptions to define prototypes, clustering data on a semantic level to ensure that prototypes represent underlying properties intuitively and are straightforward to interpret. The method leverages concept-based descriptions to create class cluster descriptions (CCDs) that explain why a data point is a prototype.

## Method Summary
The method computes Attribute Set Descriptions (ASDs) for all data samples, representing them as sets of entities where each entity is a set of attributes. For each class, it computes Class Cluster Descriptions (CCDs) by clustering data points based on their ASDs and filtering out descriptions that don't satisfy class criteria. Semantic prototypes are then selected based on CCDs using set edit distance, ensuring minimal redundancy. The approach eliminates the need for non-interpretable latent spaces by measuring distances directly on the semantic level, making each step transparent and interpretable.

## Key Results
- Semantic prototypes outperformed existing prototype methods in facilitating human understanding and informativeness
- User survey with 20 participants showed highest accuracy and preference for the proposed method
- Eliminated reliance on non-interpretable latent spaces by using semantic descriptions directly

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Semantic prototypes outperform traditional prototype methods in facilitating human understanding and informativeness.
- Mechanism: By clustering data on a semantic level using concept-based descriptions, prototypes represent underlying properties intuitively and are straightforward to interpret, bridging the gap between complex data structures and human cognitive processes.
- Core assumption: Semantic descriptions accurately reflect the contents of raw data points and are understandable to humans.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our approach outperforms existing widely-used prototype methods in facilitating human understanding and informativeness, as validated through a user survey."
  - [section] "Our approach leverages concept-based semantic descriptions to cluster data on the semantic level, ensuring that prototypes not only represent underlying properties intuitively but are also straightforward to interpret."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - only 5 related papers found, none directly discussing semantic prototypes or their effectiveness in human understanding.
- Break condition: If semantic descriptions do not accurately reflect the contents of raw data points or are not understandable to humans, the prototypes will not be interpretable.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Semantic prototypes eliminate the need to map data to a non-interpretable latent space.
- Mechanism: Distances are measured on the semantic level directly, avoiding the use of black-box models that transform features into a lower-dimensional latent space representation.
- Core assumption: Measuring distances on the semantic level is sufficient for identifying representative prototypes without the need for latent space transformations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our approach eliminates the reliance on non interpretable latent spaces by using semantic descriptions directly, making each step transparent and interpretable."
  - [section] "This process eliminates the need to map data to a non-interpretable latent space, as distances are measured on the more intuitive semantic level."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct evidence found in related papers regarding the elimination of latent space mappings.
- Break condition: If measuring distances on the semantic level is insufficient for identifying representative prototypes, the method may need to incorporate latent space transformations.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Semantic prototypes mitigate the issue of providing explanations solely in terms of raw sub-symbolic data.
- Mechanism: By providing both prototypical examples and the corresponding prototypical semantic description, the method offers insights into why a particular example is deemed a prototype.
- Core assumption: Combining prototypical examples with their semantic descriptions enhances interpretability and trustworthiness.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Furthermore, our approach mitigates the issue of providing explanations solely in terms of raw sub-symbolic data by providing both prototypical examples and the corresponding prototypical semantic description."
  - [section] "Each cluster's semantic description serves as the prototypical part of the data point on the semantic level, offering insights into why a particular example is deemed a prototype."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct evidence found in related papers regarding the combination of prototypical examples with semantic descriptions.
- Break condition: If combining prototypical examples with their semantic descriptions does not enhance interpretability and trustworthiness, the method may need to rely solely on one or the other.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Attribute Set Description (ASD)
  - Why needed here: ASDs provide a simple way to represent data samples semantically, as a set of entities, where an entity is represented as a set of attributes.
  - Quick check question: Given a set V of possible attributes, what is an ASD?
    Answer: An ASD is a set of the form {s1, s2, ..., sn} where each si is of the form {ai1, ai2, ..., aimi} ⊆ V.

- Concept: Class Cluster Description (CCD)
  - Why needed here: CCDs semantically describe a cluster of data points that belong to a specific class, and no other data points.
  - Quick check question: What is a CCD for a class c?
    Answer: A CCD for class c is an ASD r such that if r describes a datapoint d = (x, y, z) (i.e. r subsumes z), then y = c.

- Concept: Semantic Prototype
  - Why needed here: Semantic prototypes are data points that materialize all the semantic information of the class description and contain as little extra information as possible.
  - Quick check question: What is a semantic prototype for a class cluster description r?
    Answer: A semantic prototype p for a class cluster description r is a data point p = (x, y, z) that is described by r, and for which, given a distance metric dist, for every other data point d' that is described by r, it holds that dist(z, r) ≤ dist(z', r).

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Attribute Set Descriptions (ASDs) -> Class Cluster Descriptions (CCDs) -> Semantic Prototype Selection -> User Interface
- Critical path:
  1. Compute ASDs for all data samples
  2. Compute CCDs for each class using Algorithm 1
  3. Select semantic prototypes based on CCDs using set edit distance
  4. Present prototypes and their explanations to users
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using semantic descriptions vs. raw data for prototype selection
  - Number of CCDs to compute and their coverage of the class
  - Choice of distance metric for semantic prototype selection
- Failure signatures:
  - Semantic descriptions do not accurately reflect the contents of raw data points
  - Semantic descriptions are not understandable to humans
  - CCDs do not cover the entire class or include data points from other classes
  - Semantic prototypes do not represent the underlying properties of the class
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compute ASDs for a small dataset (e.g., CLEVR-Hans) and verify their accuracy
  2. Compute CCDs for a single class and check their coverage and correctness
  3. Select semantic prototypes based on CCDs and evaluate their interpretability compared to traditional prototypes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can semantic prototypes be effectively adapted for time-series data, such as speech signals or financial data, where the semantics may not be as clearly defined as in image data?

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the scalability of the semantic prototype framework be improved to handle large-scale datasets with millions of data points, and what are the computational trade-offs involved?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that finding CCDs is an instance of the set cover problem, which is NP-complete, indicating potential scalability challenges.

## Limitations

- The method relies heavily on the quality and completeness of semantic descriptions, which may not always be available or accurate
- The paper does not provide a thorough discussion of how to handle cases where semantic descriptions are unavailable or difficult to obtain
- The effectiveness of the method compared to traditional prototype methods is based on a relatively small user study (20 participants)

## Confidence

High Confidence: The overall concept of using semantic descriptions to create interpretable prototypes is well-founded and supported by the experimental results.

Medium Confidence: The effectiveness of the proposed method compared to traditional prototype methods is supported by the user survey results, but the sample size is relatively small.

Low Confidence: The method's ability to handle complex, high-dimensional data and its scalability to large datasets are not thoroughly evaluated in the paper.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a larger-scale user study with a more diverse participant pool to validate the effectiveness of semantic prototypes in enhancing interpretability and trust across different domains and user groups.

2. Evaluate the method's performance on more complex, high-dimensional datasets, such as ImageNet or COCO, to assess its scalability and ability to handle real-world data.

3. Investigate the impact of varying the quality and completeness of semantic descriptions on the resulting prototypes and their explanations. Conduct experiments with artificially degraded or incomplete semantic descriptions to understand the method's robustness and limitations.
