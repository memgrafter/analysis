# Efficient Prompting Methods for Large Language Models: A Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.01077
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01077
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Comprehensive survey of efficient prompting methods for LLMs focusing on reducing human and computational resource consumption

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive overview of efficient prompting methods for large language models (LLMs), addressing the challenges of high resource consumption in traditional prompting approaches. The paper introduces two main strategies: Automatic Prompt Engineering, which leverages LLMs to automatically design and optimize prompts, and Prompt Compression, which reduces long prompts to shorter vectors or text. These methods aim to improve efficiency while maintaining or enhancing model performance across various NLP tasks. The survey also identifies future research directions, including the integration of both strategies for synergistic solutions and improving prompt robustness and interpretability.

## Method Summary
The survey systematically reviews efficient prompting methods through two primary approaches. Automatic Prompt Engineering uses LLMs to iteratively generate, evaluate, and select optimal prompts through meta-prompts, search algorithms, and various feedback mechanisms. This includes instruction design and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) optimization. Prompt Compression reduces prompt length through two techniques: Text-to-Vector (T2V) compression, which converts text prompts to shorter vectors using encoding models, and Text-to-Text (T2T) compression, which employs pruning or summarization to create shorter text while preserving key information. The survey provides mathematical foundations for both approaches and discusses their applications across classification, generation, and reasoning tasks.

## Key Results
- Automatic Prompt Engineering can reduce human trial-and-error by using LLMs to search prompt space
- Prompt Compression maintains performance while significantly reducing computational resources
- Mathematical optimization objectives provide theoretical foundation for both approaches
- Future directions include combining both strategies for synergistic solutions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Automatic Prompt Engineering uses LLMs to search prompt space without human trial-and-error
- Mechanism: LLMs generate, evaluate, and select prompts via meta-prompts, mimicking search algorithms in discrete space
- Core assumption: LLMs have sufficient generative capability to expand prompt space and evaluation competency to assess quality
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Automatic Prompt Engineering, which uses LLMs to automatically design and optimize prompts"
  - [section] "LLMs may exactly know what kinds of prompts they want, so a wide range of LLM-driven prompt optimization methods have been proposed"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct citation showing LLM evaluation accuracy
- Break condition: If LLM evaluation is unreliable, generated prompts may not improve performance

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Prompt Compression reduces computational resources by shortening prompts without significant performance loss
- Mechanism: Convert long text prompts to shorter vectors (T2V) or compressed text (T2T) using information density measures
- Core assumption: LLMs can maintain task performance with reduced prompt length if essential information is preserved
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Prompt Compression, which compresses long prompts into shorter vectors or text"
  - [section] "T2V compression in continuous space compresses long text... into short vectors... Text-to-Text (T2T) compression in discrete space compresses long text... into short text"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no quantitative validation of performance preservation
- Break condition: If compression removes critical information, LLM performance degrades

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Mathematical optimization objectives provide theoretical foundation for both automatic prompt engineering and prompt compression
- Mechanism: Automatic prompt engineering maximizes performance over prompt space; prompt compression minimizes distribution divergence between original and compressed prompts
- Core assumption: Mathematical formulations accurately capture the relationship between prompt characteristics and LLM performance
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We provide mathematical expressions at a high level to deeply discuss Automatic Prompt Engineering... and Prompt Compression"
  - [section] "𝑝∗ = arg max 𝑝 ∈𝑃Hard P [𝑓 (𝑝𝑖𝑛𝑠, 𝑝𝑑𝑒𝑚 ; M)]" and "𝑝𝑠∗ 𝑐 = arg min 𝑝𝑠 ∼{𝜃M, 𝜃 Soft } D [𝑞(𝑦M | 𝑝ℎ 𝑜 ) ∥ 𝑞(𝑦M | 𝑝𝑠 𝑐 )]"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - mathematical models are high-level without detailed proofs
- Break condition: If mathematical models don't capture real-world prompt-LLM dynamics, optimization may not improve efficiency

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Search algorithms in discrete spaces
  - Why needed here: Understanding how automatic prompt engineering mimics search algorithms is crucial for grasping the iterative generation-evaluation-selection process
  - Quick check question: What are the three iterative steps in automatic prompt engineering's search algorithm approach?

- Concept: Knowledge distillation principles
  - Why needed here: Prompt compression using internalization relies on knowledge distillation concepts to transfer prompt knowledge into model parameters
  - Quick check question: How does prompt internalization differ from traditional knowledge distillation in terms of what's being transferred?

- Concept: Information theory and entropy
  - Why needed here: Prompt compression methods rely on measuring information density to determine what can be safely removed
  - Quick check question: What role does self-information play in selective context pruning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: LLM optimizer -> Evaluation mechanism -> Compression modules (T2V and T2T) -> Mathematical objective functions
- Critical path: For automatic prompt engineering: generate prompts → evaluate prompts → select optimal prompts. For prompt compression: measure informativeness → compress → validate performance
- Design tradeoffs: Trade accuracy for speed in compression; trade human control for automation in prompt engineering
- Failure signatures: Performance degradation after compression; prompt optimization loops that don't converge; evaluation metrics that don't correlate with actual performance
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement basic prompt generation using meta-prompts and evaluate with simple scoring function
  2. Apply selective context pruning to a sample prompt and measure performance change
  3. Combine instruction optimization with demonstration compression to test integrated approach

## Limitations

- Limited empirical validation within the survey itself, relying on cited papers without deep analysis
- High-level mathematical formulations lack detailed proofs or implementation specifications
- Primary focus on English-language NLP tasks with limited discussion of multilingual applications
- Does not provide evidence for the feasibility of combining automatic prompt engineering with prompt compression

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The fundamental categorization of efficient prompting methods into Automatic Prompt Engineering and Prompt Compression is well-supported and clearly articulated.
- **Medium Confidence**: The claim that LLMs can effectively evaluate and optimize their own prompts through automatic prompt engineering. While theoretically plausible, lacks direct evidence about reliability across domains.
- **Low Confidence**: The assertion that prompt compression can maintain task performance with minimal degradation across all types of prompts and tasks. Limited empirical evidence about conditions for success or failure.

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical Validation of LLM Self-Evaluation**: Conduct a controlled experiment comparing LLM-generated prompts optimized through automatic prompt engineering against human-designed prompts across multiple task types.

2. **Compression Performance Boundary Analysis**: Systematically test prompt compression methods across different prompt types and task complexities to identify compression ratio thresholds beyond which performance degradation becomes unacceptable.

3. **Integrated Approach Feasibility Study**: Implement a prototype system that combines automatic prompt engineering with prompt compression, then evaluate whether the integrated approach achieves better efficiency than either method alone while maintaining acceptable performance levels.
