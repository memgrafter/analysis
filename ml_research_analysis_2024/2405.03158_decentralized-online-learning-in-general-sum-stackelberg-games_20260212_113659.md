# Decentralized Online Learning in General-Sum Stackelberg Games

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03158

- The paper studies decentralized online learning in general-sum Stackelberg games, where a leader and follower act sequentially and strategically.

## Executive Summary
This paper explores decentralized online learning in general-sum Stackelberg games with two information settings: limited information (follower only sees its own reward) and side information (follower has access to leader's reward). The authors demonstrate that best response strategies are optimal for the follower under limited information, but not necessarily under side information where strategic manipulation becomes possible. They design new algorithms for both players in each setting and prove last-iterate convergence and sample complexity results, showing that a manipulative follower strategy can yield an intrinsic advantage over best response. Empirical results validate the theoretical findings.

## Method Summary
The paper considers general-sum Stackelberg games where a leader commits to a strategy first and a follower responds. For the leader, variants of no-regret learning algorithms (EXP3 with uniform exploration and UCB with extra exploration) are used. For the follower, UCB is employed in the limited information setting, while Follower's Best Manipulation (FBM) and FMUCB algorithms are used in the side information setting. The convergence of these algorithms to the optimal equilibrium or best manipulation pair is proven, and the intrinsic advantage of manipulation over best response is demonstrated.

## Key Results
- Best response is optimal for the follower under limited information, but not under side information
- Follower can strategically manipulate the leader's learning to induce a more favorable equilibrium
- Last-iterate convergence and sample complexity results are proven for the proposed algorithms
- Manipulation strategies yield an intrinsic advantage over best response strategies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The follower's best response strategy is optimal in the limited information setting because it cannot manipulate the leader without knowing the leader's reward structure.
- Mechanism: In limited information, the follower only observes its own reward, making it unable to influence the leader's reward signals. Thus, myopically best responding to the leader's action maximizes the follower's utility.
- Core assumption: The follower has no access to the leader's reward information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the follower can manipulate the leader's reward signals with strategic actions, and hence induce the leader's strategy to converge to an equilibrium that is better off for itself" - this shows manipulation is possible only with side information.
  - [section 4] "In the limited information setting, the follower is not able to manipulate the game without the leader's reward information. Hence, myopically learning the best response for each action a ∈ A is indeed the best strategy for the follower."
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers focus on regret minimization or side information settings, not limited information best response optimality.
- Break condition: If the follower gains access to leader's reward information, best response is no longer optimal.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: In the side information setting, the follower can strategically manipulate the leader's learning to induce a more favorable equilibrium.
- Mechanism: The follower uses its knowledge of both players' reward structures to design a response strategy that exaggerates differences in the leader's rewards, causing the leader's no-regret learning algorithm to converge to a suboptimal action for the leader but optimal for the follower.
- Core assumption: The follower knows or can learn the leader's exact reward function.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the follower can manipulate the leader's reward signals with strategic actions, and hence induce the leader's strategy to converge to an equilibrium that is better off for itself."
  - [section 5] "When the follower uses the response set F, the leader (who only observes its own reward signals) will take actions that maximize its own reward given F."
  - [corpus] Weak - most related work focuses on regret minimization or learning with side information, but doesn't explicitly detail the manipulation mechanism described here.
- Break condition: If the leader uses a centralized learning algorithm or has perfect information about the follower's strategy.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The combination of leader's EXP3/UCB and follower's UCB/FMUCB algorithms achieves last-iterate convergence to the optimal equilibrium in both settings.
- Mechanism: The leader's no-regret learning algorithm explores sufficiently to find the optimal action given the follower's strategy, while the follower's learning algorithm finds the best response or manipulation strategy. The interplay between exploration and exploitation leads to convergence.
- Core assumption: Both players use appropriate no-regret learning algorithms with sufficient exploration.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our main contribution is to derive last-iterate convergence and sample complexity results in both settings."
  - [section 4.2-4.3] "We next introduce a variant of EXP3 for the leader... Theorem 2. [Last-iterate convergence of EXP3-UCB under limited information]"
  - [section 6.2] "We also provide theoretical guarantees for the sample efficiency and convergence of this algorithm."
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers focus on regret minimization but don't explicitly prove last-iterate convergence for the specific algorithm combinations described here.
- Break condition: If either player uses an algorithm without sufficient exploration or if the game has multiple equilibria with equal payoffs.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Stackelberg games and leader-follower dynamics
  - Why needed here: The paper builds on the hierarchical structure where the leader commits to a strategy and the follower responds. Understanding this asymmetry is crucial for grasping why the follower can manipulate the leader in side information settings.
  - Quick check question: In a Stackelberg game, who moves first and who has the advantage?

- Concept: No-regret learning algorithms (EXP3, UCB)
  - Why needed here: The paper relies on these algorithms for both players to learn optimal strategies from noisy bandit feedback. Understanding their convergence properties is essential for analyzing the game's dynamics.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between EXP3 and UCB algorithms in terms of their exploration-exploitation tradeoff?

- Concept: Information asymmetry and its strategic implications
  - Why needed here: The paper distinguishes between limited information and side information settings precisely because information asymmetry enables the follower to manipulate the leader. This concept is central to understanding the paper's main contributions.
  - Quick check question: How does information asymmetry create strategic advantages in game theory?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Leader: EXP3 or UCBE algorithm with exploration parameter α
  - Follower: UCB algorithm (limited info) or FMUCB algorithm (side info)
  - Game environment: Provides noisy bandit feedback to both players
  - Convergence monitor: Tracks whether game reaches equilibrium

- Critical path:
  1. Leader commits to action using EXP3/UCBE
  2. Follower observes action and responds using UCB/FMUCB
  3. Both players receive noisy rewards
  4. Algorithms update strategies based on rewards
  5. Process repeats until convergence

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Exploration vs. exploitation: Higher exploration rates (α) lead to faster convergence but more regret in early rounds
  - Computational complexity: FMUCB requires solving an optimization problem vs. UCB's simpler argmax
  - Robustness: UCBE guarantees upper bounding true rewards vs. standard UCB which may not

- Failure signatures:
  - Non-convergence: Regret remains linear in T, indicating algorithms not finding equilibrium
  - Oscillation: Strategies keep changing without settling, suggesting insufficient exploration
  - Exploitation of leader: Follower's reward consistently exceeds theoretical bounds, indicating manipulation strategy working

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement EXP3-UCB for limited information setting and verify regret bounds
  2. Implement FMUCB for side information setting and compare follower's reward vs. best response strategy
  3. Test convergence speed with varying exploration rates (α) and compare EXP3 vs. UCBE for leader

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the intrinsic reward gap between the best manipulation strategy and the best response strategy scale with the size of the action space (A and B) in general-sum Stackelberg games?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates an intrinsic advantage for the follower using manipulation strategies over best responses, but does not provide a detailed analysis of how this advantage scales with the size of the action space.
- Why unresolved: The theoretical results focus on proving the existence of an advantage but do not delve into the quantitative relationship between the advantage and the action space dimensions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with varying action space sizes and analyzing the resulting reward gaps would provide insights into the scaling behavior.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do the convergence rates of the proposed algorithms (EXP3-UCB, UCBE-UCB, EXP3-FMUCB, UCBE-FMUCB) change under different reward function distributions or game structures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper provides convergence rates for the algorithms but does not explore how these rates vary with different game structures or reward function distributions.
- Why unresolved: The theoretical analysis focuses on specific assumptions about the reward functions and does not generalize to other distributions or structures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing the convergence rates of the algorithms under various reward function distributions and game structures would shed light on their robustness and adaptability.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the manipulation strategies be extended to handle more complex scenarios, such as games with multiple followers or dynamic reward functions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on two-player games with static reward functions, but real-world applications may involve more complex scenarios.
- Why unresolved: The theoretical framework and algorithms are tailored to the specific setting studied and do not address more general cases.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and analyzing algorithms for more complex game scenarios would demonstrate the potential for extending the manipulation strategies.

## Limitations

- The manipulation effectiveness depends critically on the follower having accurate knowledge of the leader's reward function, which may be noisy or incomplete in practice
- Convergence proofs rely on specific algorithm parameters that may not generalize well to all game structures
- The framework assumes static reward functions and doesn't address dynamic or time-varying scenarios

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The theoretical framework for limited information setting and best response optimality (Mechanism 1)
- **Medium Confidence:** The manipulation mechanism in side information setting (Mechanism 2) due to dependence on perfect reward knowledge
- **Medium Confidence:** Last-iterate convergence results (Mechanism 3) as they depend on specific algorithm implementations and parameter choices

## Next Checks

1. Test algorithm performance when follower has noisy or incomplete information about leader's reward function to assess robustness of manipulation strategies
2. Implement experiments with multiple equilibria to verify whether algorithms consistently converge to optimal ones
3. Compare convergence rates and final payoffs when leader uses different no-regret algorithms (EXP3 vs. UCB variants) to validate algorithm choice recommendations
