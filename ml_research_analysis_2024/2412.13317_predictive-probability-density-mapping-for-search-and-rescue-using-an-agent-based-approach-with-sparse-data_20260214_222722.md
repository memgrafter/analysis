# Predictive Probability Density Mapping for Search and Rescue Using An Agent-Based Approach with Sparse Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.13317
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13317
- Authors: Jan-Hendrik Ewers; David Anderson; Douglas Thomson
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Agent-based model J2 achieves KL divergence of 61.56, significantly improving upon previous approaches and reducing open ground prediction error from 27.22% to 2.44%

## Executive Summary
This research addresses the challenge of predicting lost person locations during search and rescue operations using limited data. The authors propose an agent-based model (J2) that simulates lost individual behavior across real-world landscapes using four distinct psychological behaviors. The model generates probability distribution maps through Monte Carlo simulations combined with mobility-time-based sampling. Validation using sparse real-world SAR data shows significant improvement over previous approaches, with J2 achieving a KL divergence score of 61.56 compared to 306.02 for the prior version and 159.16 for random distributions.

## Method Summary
The J2 model uses four behavioral modes (Head2Water, Head2Trees, Head2Paths, Head2Buildings) to simulate lost person movement across GIS-mapped terrain. Agents maintain a single behavior throughout each simulation run, with movement patterns generated using viewshed analysis for building/tree seeking, vector field following for water, and weighted path networks for roads. Starting points are sampled from sparse PLS data using a Gaussian Process model with Matern kernel, then converted to location distributions through mobility-time-based sampling using log-normal distributions fitted to historical movement patterns. Monte Carlo simulations generate probability distribution maps validated against historical location found data.

## Key Results
- J2 model achieves KL divergence of 61.56, substantially improving upon J1 (306.02) and random distributions (159.16)
- Open ground location prediction error reduced from 27.22% to 2.44% relative to historical data
- Gaussian Process modeling successfully handles sparse PLS data to improve starting point sampling
- Mobility-time-based sampling effectively converts agent paths to realistic location distributions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The agent-based model generates realistic search patterns by simulating four distinct psychological behaviors that mimic real lost person movement.
- Mechanism: Each agent maintains a single behavioral mode throughout simulation, using viewshed analysis for building/tree seeking, vector field following for water, and weighted path networks for roads.
- Core assumption: Lost persons maintain consistent behavioral modes rather than switching randomly during movement.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "simulated agents can be created to emulate the behavior of the lost person"; [section III-A1] "Throughout the simulation, the agent keeps the same behavior"
- Break condition: If real lost persons frequently switch behaviors mid-search, the model's accuracy would degrade significantly.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Gaussian Process modeling effectively handles sparse PLS data by learning smooth probability density functions that generalize across search areas.
- Mechanism: GP uses Matern kernel with KISS-GP approximation to create continuous probability distributions from discrete PLS locations, enabling infinite sampling of starting points.
- Core assumption: Spatial distribution of PLS locations follows smooth underlying patterns capturable by kernel methods.
- Evidence anchors: [section IV] "Using supervised machine learning in the form of a Gaussian Process (GP) model"; [section III-A] "The starting points are then sampled from the bivariate Gaussian probability distribution function"
- Break condition: If underlying PLS distribution has sharp discontinuities or multiple disconnected modes, GP smoothing would misrepresent true patterns.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Mobility-time-based sampling converts agent path distances into realistic location distributions by matching historical movement patterns.
- Mechanism: Agent paths generated at fixed speed, then sampled at distances corresponding to times drawn from log-normal distribution fitted to historical mobility data.
- Core assumption: Lost persons move at roughly constant speed with realistic fatigue patterns matching log-normal distribution.
- Evidence anchors: [section III-B] "M time samples were taken from Eqn. 12 for every path" and "A constant speed of 3.87h km−1...is used to convert time to distance"
- Break condition: If movement speeds vary significantly or follow different fatigue patterns, sampling would produce inaccurate location distributions.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Agent-based modeling
  - Why needed here: Enables simulation of complex human behaviors difficult to model with deterministic algorithms
  - Quick check question: How would the model change if we allowed agents to switch behaviors during a simulation?

- Concept: Gaussian Process regression
  - Why needed here: Handles sparse, noisy data by learning smooth probability density function for PLS sampling
  - Quick check question: What would happen to PLS sampling if we used bicubic interpolation instead of GP modeling?

- Concept: Log-normal distribution fitting
  - Why needed here: Models realistic movement time distributions based on historical SAR data
  - Quick check question: Why was log-normal distribution chosen over exponential or normal distributions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: GIS Data Layer -> Agent Simulation Engine -> GP Sampling Module -> Mobility Sampling Engine -> Validation Pipeline
- Critical path: PLS data → GP upsampling → Starting point generation → Agent path simulation → Mobility sampling → PDM generation → Validation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Fixed behavior mode vs. adaptive behavior switching (simpler but less realistic)
  - Fixed speed vs. variable speed modeling (computational efficiency vs. accuracy)
  - GP smoothing vs. raw data (better generalization vs. preserving sharp features)
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor KL divergence scores indicate behavior models don't match real patterns
  - Over-smoothed GP predictions suggest disconnected PLS clusters
  - Skewed mobility sampling indicates incorrect movement time assumptions
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare KL divergence scores using different behavior combinations
  2. Test GP kernel parameters (ν values) on PLS generalization quality
  3. Validate mobility sampling by comparing generated vs. historical movement time distributions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do viewshed-based behaviors (Head2Trees, Head2Buildings) impact overall PDM accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Both viewshed-based algorithms are substantially off the mark compared to source data, with Head2Buildings having low mean length of 5.62km versus largest of 11.04km
- Why unresolved: Paper identifies this as root cause of discrepancy but provides no detailed analysis or proposed solutions
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed comparative analysis of viewshed-based behaviors versus other approaches with proposed modifications

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can Gaussian Process model be effectively applied to other SAR datasets with different geographical characteristics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] GP model successfully up-sampled sparse PLS data for Isle of Arran, showing improved results over conventional methods
- Why unresolved: Paper focuses on single dataset without exploring generalizability to other regions or datasets with varying characteristics
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing GP model on multiple SAR datasets from diverse geographical areas comparing results to other up-sampling techniques

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does termination distance (Dmax) affect accuracy of generated PDM?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Authors mention upper limit of time traveled correlates to total time LP might be missing, with distribution becoming closer to matching historical data as Dmax approaches infinity
- Why unresolved: Paper does not explore optimal value of Dmax or its impact on PDM accuracy for different LP profiles or geographical areas
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic study varying Dmax analyzing effect on PDM accuracy for different LP profiles and geographical areas

## Limitations
- Model relies on strong assumptions about behavioral consistency that may not reflect real lost person behavior
- Validation limited to single geographic region (Isle of Arran) with sparse historical data, raising generalizability concerns
- Critical implementation details like exact viewshed algorithm parameters and Gaussian Process hyperparameters remain unspecified

## Confidence
- High Confidence: KL divergence improvement (61.56 vs 306.02) and open ground prediction error reduction (27.22% to 2.44%) are well-supported by reported metrics
- Medium Confidence: Gaussian Process modeling for PLS upsampling is theoretically sound but lacks direct validation of log-normal mobility fit and kernel parameter selection
- Low Confidence: Behavioral consistency assumption has no empirical support from corpus evidence and may significantly impact model accuracy

## Next Checks
1. Run the model with adaptive behavior switching (probability of behavior change every 30 minutes) and measure impact on KL divergence scores to test behavioral consistency assumption
2. Apply trained model to SAR data from different geographic region (different terrain type or climate) and compare KL divergence scores to assess generalizability beyond Isle of Arran
3. Compare generated mobility time distribution from model against separate validation dataset of historical movement times to verify log-normal fit quality and identify potential distribution mismatches
