# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Real-Time Ground Delay Program Revision and Corresponding Flight Delay Assignments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.08298
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08298
- Reference count: 13
- Key outcome: RL models (BC and CQL) failed to learn effectively for GDP optimization due to oversimplified environmental assumptions

## Executive Summary
This study applied Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize Ground Delay Programs (GDP) at airports by adjusting program rates to minimize delays. Two RL models, Behavioral Cloning (BC) and Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), were developed to enhance GDP efficiency by integrating ground and airborne delays and terminal area congestion into a reward function. The models were tested using 2019 data from Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) in a simulated environment (SAGDP_ENV) that included real operational data and predicted uncertainties. Despite thorough modeling, the models failed to learn effectively, likely due to oversimplified environmental assumptions that did not capture the complexity of actual airport operations. The study highlights the need for more comprehensive GDP modeling, inclusion of weather data, sensitivity analysis, and better handling of uncertainties in future research to improve RL applications in air traffic management.

## Method Summary
The study developed a simulated environment (SAGDP_ENV) using 2019 operational data from Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) to generate GDP scenarios. The environment applied a queuing diagram with ration-by-schedule and first-come-first-served rules to assign ground delays. Two RL models were trained: Behavioral Cloning (BC), which mimics historical expert actions, and Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), which learns a conservative Q-function to avoid overestimation errors. The reward function penalized ground delays, airborne delays (weighted more heavily), and terminal area congestion. Models were trained offline using historical GDP data but failed to learn effectively, likely due to oversimplified environmental assumptions that did not capture the full complexity of real airport operations.

## Key Results
- RL models (BC and CQL) failed to learn effectively for GDP optimization
- Failure attributed to oversimplified environmental assumptions excluding forecast weather and airline operational strategies
- Study identified need for more comprehensive modeling including weather data and sensitivity analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The SAGDP_ENV environment uses a queuing diagram with ration-by-schedule and first-come-first-served rules to assign ground delays, ensuring that flights are allocated arrival slots based on their scheduled times while respecting real-time airport capacity.
- Mechanism: By modeling the airport as a queue where flights wait for their assigned slots, the environment can simulate how ground delays are distributed when demand exceeds capacity. The combination of scheduled prioritization (ration-by-schedule) and FIFO ordering (first-come-first-served) mirrors actual air traffic control practices, allowing the RL agent to learn policies that balance delay costs against congestion penalties.
- Core assumption: The queuing model accurately reflects the dynamics of real airport operations, including the impact of weather, runway availability, and flight schedules on arrival rates.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "we developed a environment ( SAGDP EN V ) to generate next state at time t + 1 . At initial stage, SAGDP EN V input information from given the datasets... to assign the ground delay to the detected in-scope flights in the following 8 quarter hours as GDt to GDt+8"
  - [section]: "apply the queuing diagram based on ration-by-schedule and first-come-first-served rules, with inputs of at, ARR DEMANDt−1, and ENROUTEFLTt−1"
- Break condition: If the queuing model fails to capture the stochastic nature of flight arrivals or the dynamic adjustments made by air traffic controllers in response to real-time conditions, the agent's learned policy may not generalize to actual GDP operations.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The reward function penalizes both ground and airborne delays, with airborne delays weighted more heavily, incentivizing the agent to minimize airborne delays at the cost of longer ground delays.
- Mechanism: By assigning a higher cost to airborne delays (cair = 2.5 per minute) compared to ground delays (cgnd = 1 per minute), the reward function encourages the agent to shift as much delay as possible to the ground. This aligns with aviation safety principles, as airborne delays increase fuel consumption, controller workload, and the risk of in-flight incidents. The penalty for terminal area congestion (p = 10 per holding flight) further incentivizes the agent to avoid situations where too many flights are held in the air.
- Core assumption: The relative costs assigned to ground and airborne delays accurately reflect their real-world impacts on safety, efficiency, and operational costs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "reward at time t is defined as the negative sum of the ground delay and airborne delay of the arrival flights for the next n intervals in time t, and penalty for airspace congestion level with benchmark of 10 holding flights... cgnd = the cost of one unit of ground delay which is 1 per min, cair = the cost of one unit of ground delay which is 2.5 per min, p = the penalty of congestion due to holding flights which is 10 per flight"
- Break condition: If the cost parameters do not accurately represent the true costs of delays and congestion, or if they fail to capture other important factors such as airline equity or passenger satisfaction, the agent may learn suboptimal policies that do not translate well to real-world operations.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The offline RL approach using Behavioral Cloning (BC) and Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) enables the agent to learn from historical GDP data without requiring extensive online interaction with the environment.
- Mechanism: BC attempts to mimic the actions taken by human experts in past GDP scenarios, providing a baseline policy. CQL, on the other hand, learns a conservative Q-function that avoids overestimation errors common in offline RL, making it more suitable for learning from a fixed dataset. By combining these approaches, the agent can learn to make decisions that are both data-driven and robust to the limitations of the historical data.
- Core assumption: The historical data used for training is representative of the types of scenarios the agent will encounter in the future, and the offline RL algorithms can effectively learn from this data without requiring online exploration.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "We choose Behavioral Cloning (BC) and Conservative Q-Learning (CQL, [12]) as our Traffic Flow Management (TFM) agent. BC is one of the simplest forms of imitation learning... CQL mitigates overestimation error by minimizing action-values under the current policy and maximizing values under data distribution"
  - [section]: "For both BC and CQL, we use the generated offline dataset to train the agent"
- Break condition: If the historical data is not diverse enough to cover the range of scenarios the agent will face, or if the offline RL algorithms cannot effectively learn from this data due to issues such as distributional shift or insufficient exploration, the agent may fail to learn a useful policy.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Reinforcement Learning (RL) basics
  - Why needed here: The core of the study is to apply RL to optimize GDP operations, so a solid understanding of RL concepts like agents, environments, states, actions, and rewards is essential.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between on-policy and off-policy RL algorithms, and which type is being used in this study?

- Concept: Queuing theory and operations research
  - Why needed here: The SAGDP_ENV environment uses a queuing model to simulate airport operations, so knowledge of queuing theory and operations research techniques is necessary to understand how delays are assigned and managed.
  - Quick check question: How does the ration-by-schedule and first-come-first-served rule in the queuing model affect the distribution of ground delays among flights?

- Concept: Air Traffic Management (ATM) concepts
  - Why needed here: The study focuses on optimizing GDPs within the context of ATM, so familiarity with concepts like airport capacity, arrival rates, flight schedules, and traffic management initiatives is crucial.
  - Quick check question: What are the main factors that influence airport capacity, and how do they impact the need for GDPs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Data sources -> SAGDP_ENV environment -> RL agent (BC/CQL) -> Reward calculation -> State update

- Critical path:
  1. Preprocess data from ASPM and ATCSCC sources to extract relevant features
  2. Generate scenarios using SAGDP_ENV with real-world data and uncertainties
  3. Train RL agent (BC or CQL) on offline dataset
  4. Evaluate agent's performance on unseen GDP scenarios

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Offline vs. online learning: Offline learning allows the agent to learn from historical data without the need for extensive online interaction, but may limit its ability to adapt to new scenarios or handle distributional shift.
  - Simplicity vs. complexity of environment: A simpler environment is easier to implement and debug but may not capture the full complexity of real-world airport operations, potentially limiting the agent's ability to learn effective policies.

- Failure signatures:
  - If the agent fails to learn or improve, it may be due to oversimplified environmental assumptions, insufficient diversity in the training data, or issues with the offline RL algorithms.
  - If the agent's learned policy performs poorly on real-world GDP scenarios, it may indicate a mismatch between the simulated environment and actual airport operations, or a failure to account for important factors such as airline equity or passenger satisfaction.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simplified version of SAGDP_ENV with basic queuing rules and a simple reward function, and train a BC agent on a small subset of the data to verify that the environment and agent are functioning correctly.
  2. Expand the environment to include more realistic features such as weather data and flight cancellations, and train a CQL agent to compare its performance to the BC agent.
  3. Conduct sensitivity analysis by varying the cost parameters in the reward function and observing how the agent's learned policy changes, to identify which factors have the greatest impact on GDP optimization.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the inclusion of weather forecast data and enroute weather conditions impact the predictive accuracy and operational effectiveness of the RL models in GDP management?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors noted that their initial models did not utilize forecast weather data, which is a significant oversight given its crucial influence on GDP decisions.
- Why unresolved: The models were not tested with forecast weather data, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios where weather variability plays a critical role.
- What evidence would resolve it: Running the RL models with integrated forecast weather data and comparing their performance metrics (such as reduction in delays and improvements in airport throughput) against the current models that do not include such data.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the effect of incorporating airline operational strategies, such as flight cancellations and substitutions, into the RL models on the overall efficiency of GDP operations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors identified that current models do not account for airline operational strategies during GDP implementations, which could be crucial for a more holistic approach to traffic flow management.
- Why unresolved: The current models only optimize the program rate without considering other GDP parameters and airline strategies, potentially missing out on significant improvements in efficiency.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing enhanced RL models that include airline operational strategies and measuring their impact on GDP performance metrics such as total delay reduction and throughput enhancement.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do different weights assigned to ground delays, airborne delays, and terminal area congestion affect the performance of the RL models in optimizing GDP operations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors used a reward function that integrates these elements but did not explore the sensitivity of the model performance to changes in these weights.
- Why unresolved: Without a sensitivity analysis, it is unclear how critical each factor is to the model's effectiveness and which adjustments might lead to better outcomes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting a systematic sensitivity analysis by varying the weights of ground delays, airborne delays, and congestion penalties and evaluating the changes in GDP performance to identify the most impactful factors.

## Limitations
- Models failed to learn effectively due to oversimplified environmental assumptions
- Exclusion of forecast weather data and airline operational strategies from the model
- Use of 2019 data without incorporating more recent operational patterns or emerging air traffic management practices

## Confidence
**High Confidence**: The methodological framework for developing the SAGDP_ENV environment and the general approach of using RL for GDP optimization are well-established and theoretically sound.

**Medium Confidence**: The implementation of the queuing model and reward function, while reasonable, may not fully capture the stochastic nature of airport operations and the complex tradeoffs between different types of delays.

**Low Confidence**: The overall effectiveness of the proposed approach is uncertain due to the models' failure to learn.

## Next Checks
1. **Environmental Complexity Validation**: Implement a more sophisticated version of SAGDP_ENV that includes forecast weather data, airline operational strategies, and a wider range of GDP scenarios to assess whether increased environmental complexity enables the RL models to learn more effectively.

2. **Cost Parameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Conduct a systematic sensitivity analysis by varying the cost parameters in the reward function (ground delay cost, airborne delay cost, and congestion penalty) to identify which factors have the greatest impact on the agent's learned policy and overall GDP optimization performance.

3. **Cross-Airport Generalization Test**: Apply the trained RL models to GDP scenarios from a different airport (e.g., JFK or ORD) using similar 2019 data to evaluate whether the models can generalize beyond the specific conditions at EWR and identify any airport-specific limitations or biases in the learned policies.
