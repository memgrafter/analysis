# Explore-then-Commit Algorithms for Decentralized Two-Sided Matching Markets

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.08690
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08690
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: CA-ETC achieves sublinear player-optimal regret without communication or prior knowledge of arm preferences

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces CA-ETC, a novel explore-then-commit algorithm for decentralized two-sided matching markets where players compete to match with arms without assuming prior knowledge of arm preferences. The algorithm operates in epochs with exponentially increasing interaction rounds, using round-robin exploration to avoid collisions and confidence bounds for preference estimation. The authors prove that CA-ETC achieves player-optimal expected regret bounds that are sublinear in the learning horizon, while also presenting a blackboard communication-based baseline that achieves logarithmic regret. This work provides the first provable two-sided learning algorithm for decentralized matching markets without restrictive assumptions, addressing a significant gap between theory and practical applications.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes CA-ETC, an epoch-based explore-then-commit algorithm that learns stable matchings in decentralized two-sided matching markets without requiring communication between agents. The algorithm uses exponentially increasing epoch lengths (starting from initial length T₀) where each epoch consists of exploration rounds for learning preferences and a commit phase using Gale-Shapley matching. Players perform round-robin exploration to avoid collisions while building confidence intervals for preference rankings. When confidence intervals become disjoint, agents commit to stable matchings. The authors also propose a blackboard communication-based algorithm (ETGS) that achieves logarithmic regret by enabling agents to detect when all preferences have been learned.

## Key Results
- CA-ETC achieves player-optimal expected regret of O(T₀(K log T/(T₀ Δ²))^(1/γ) + T₀(T/T₀)^γ) without communication between agents
- The blackboard-based ETGS algorithm achieves logarithmic regret by enabling agents to detect when all preferences have been learned
- These are the first provable algorithms for decentralized two-sided matching markets without restrictive assumptions about known preferences or communication requirements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: CA-ETC achieves sublinear player-optimal regret without requiring communication between agents or prior knowledge of arm preferences.
- Mechanism: The algorithm uses an epoch-based structure where players and arms explore preferences independently, then commit to stable matchings once preferences are learned. Exploration uses round-robin assignment to avoid collisions, and preference learning is done via confidence interval checks.
- Core assumption: Arms have strict preference rankings over players and vice versa, with known subGaussian noise characteristics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "propose a multi-phase explore-then-commit type algorithm namely epoch-based CA-ETC... that does not require any communication across agents"
  - [section 3.2]: "CA-ETC is epoch based, with each epoch consisting of increasing interaction rounds, in which each individual performs round-robin exploration and commits using learned preferences"
- Break condition: If the initial epoch length T₀ is too small relative to problem gap Δ and horizon T, the regret bound no longer holds.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The blackboard-based ETGS algorithm achieves logarithmic regret by enabling agents to detect when all preferences have been learned.
- Mechanism: Agents communicate preference learning status via a shared boolean array. When all entries are set, agents enter exploitation phase and use Gale-Shapley matching.
- Core assumption: Communication medium (blackboard) exists and all agents can read/write to it.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1]: "The blackboard model of communication is standard in centralized multi-agent systems" and "ETGS is Explore-then-Commit type where each agent performs exploration in a round-robin manner"
  - [Theorem 3.2]: Regret bound shows logarithmic dependence on T for blackboard case
- Break condition: If agents cannot reliably write to or read from the blackboard, the monitoring mechanism fails.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The epoch structure with exponentially increasing rounds balances exploration and exploitation efficiently.
- Mechanism: Each epoch l has 2ˡT₀ exploration rounds and bˡT₀ total rounds (b=2^(1/γ)). This allows agents to gradually refine preference estimates while limiting regret accumulation.
- Core assumption: γ ∈ (0,1) is chosen appropriately to balance the two terms in the regret bound.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2]: "CA-ETC is epoch based, with each epoch consisting of increasing interaction rounds" and "we choose exponentially increasing rounds"
  - [Theorem 3.6]: Regret bound shows explicit dependence on T₀ and γ
- Break condition: If γ is too close to 0 or 1, the regret bound degrades significantly.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: SubGaussian distributions and confidence bounds
  - Why needed here: The algorithm uses UCB/LCB confidence bounds for preference estimation, which rely on SubGaussian assumptions for theoretical guarantees
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between SubGaussian with parameter σ vs parameter 1?

- Concept: Gale-Shapley stable matching algorithm
  - Why needed here: The exploitation phase uses Gale-Shapley to find stable matchings once preferences are learned
  - Quick check question: In Gale-Shapley, which side gets the optimal stable matching (proposing or reviewing)?

- Concept: Epoch-based learning and explore-then-commit strategies
  - Why needed here: The algorithm's regret guarantees depend on the epoch structure and when to switch from exploration to exploitation
  - Quick check question: Why does using exponentially increasing epoch lengths help balance exploration and exploitation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Index Estimation -> Round-robin Exploration -> Preference Verification -> Gale-Shapley Matching
- Critical path: Index estimation → Round-robin exploration → Preference verification → Gale-Shapley matching
- Design tradeoffs: Communication-free vs communication-based (blackboard) approaches; exponential vs polynomial epoch growth
- Failure signatures: 
  - Non-convergence: Confidence intervals never disjoint
  - High regret: Insufficient exploration rounds
  - Deadlock: Blackboard never fully set
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify index estimation produces distinct indices for all players
  2. Test preference verification works correctly with synthetic preferences
  3. Measure regret convergence with different γ values and T₀ choices

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can CA-ETC be made asynchronous, allowing subsets of the market to proceed independently while preserving stable matches?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state "One future direction is to make the algorithm asynchronous, which can be done when a subset of the market preserves the stable match."
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on synchronous algorithms where all agents enter the commit phase simultaneously. Asynchronous operation would require new mechanisms to ensure stability while allowing different subsets to progress at different rates.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified CA-ETC algorithm with theoretical regret bounds showing that asynchronous operation maintains player-optimal or arm-pessimal regret guarantees, along with empirical validation on synthetic and real-world matching markets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can structured collision and weak communication reduce the high regret terms in CA-ETC compared to one-sided learning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state "We believe with algorithms that allow structured collision and some weak form of communication, these high regret term can be cut down."
- Why unresolved: The current CA-ETC algorithm achieves worse regret than one-sided learning approaches due to the lack of collision resolution and communication. The paper suggests this gap could be narrowed but doesn't provide concrete solutions.
- What evidence would resolve it: A new algorithm that incorporates limited communication (e.g., periodic broadcasting of preference estimates) or structured collision resolution, with theoretical analysis showing improved regret bounds approaching those of one-sided learning while maintaining two-sided learning capability.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of dynamic preference changes on two-sided learning algorithms without restrictive assumptions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state "Furthermore, markets are seldom static, and the preference ranking changes over time and capturing the dynamic behavior of markets in an assumption free two-sided setting is certainly challenging."
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on static markets where preferences are fixed. Real-world markets experience preference drift, seasonality, and structural changes that would require algorithms to adapt without prior knowledge of these dynamics.
- What evidence would resolve it: A dynamic extension of CA-ETC or blackboard-based algorithms that tracks preference changes using change-point detection or adaptive confidence bounds, with theoretical guarantees on regret bounds in non-stationary environments and empirical validation on datasets with known preference drift patterns.

## Limitations

- The algorithm requires strict preference rankings between players and arms, which may not exist in real-world markets with ties or indifference
- The blackboard communication model assumes a reliable communication medium that may not be available in truly decentralized environments
- Performance heavily depends on choosing appropriate parameters T₀ and γ relative to the problem gap Δ and horizon T

## Confidence

- High confidence: The existence of the algorithm and its basic structure (epoch-based explore-then-commit)
- Medium confidence: The specific regret bounds and their dependence on T₀ and γ
- Medium confidence: The blackboard-based algorithm achieving logarithmic regret

## Next Checks

1. Implement the Index Estimation algorithm (Algorithm 1) and verify it produces distinct indices for all players in synthetic preference settings with varying problem gaps Δ
2. Test the preference verification mechanism (Lines 6-10 in Algorithm 4) with known synthetic preferences to confirm confidence intervals correctly identify when preferences are learned
3. Measure the algorithm's performance across different γ values and initial epoch lengths T₀ to empirically validate the tradeoff captured in the regret bound and identify optimal parameter settings for various problem regimes
