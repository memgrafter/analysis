# Together We Can: Multilingual Automatic Post-Editing for Low-Resource Languages

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.17973
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17973
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: Multilingual APE models outperform single-pair models by 2.5 and 2.39 TER points for English-Hindi and English-Marathi, respectively

## Executive Summary
This study addresses Automatic Post-Editing (APE) for low-resource Indo-Aryan languages by exploiting linguistic similarities between Hindi and Marathi. The authors develop a multilingual APE framework that leverages shared grammatical structures (SOV), vocabulary overlap, and script (Devanagari) to enable cross-linguistic transfer. Through a curriculum training strategy and multitask learning with Quality Estimation, the approach achieves significant improvements over single-pair models, demonstrating the potential of multilingual methods for resource-constrained language pairs.

## Method Summary
The approach employs a two-encoder, single-decoder architecture with IndicBERT initialization, using a curriculum training strategy (CTS) across three stages: training a multilingual NMT model, training on synthetic APE triplets, and fine-tuning on authentic data. The framework incorporates data augmentation through synthetic Hindi-Marathi and Marathi-Hindi triplets, and implements a QE-APE multitask learning framework. Domain adaptation is achieved through adapter layers, and multilingual models use language ID prefixes to distinguish target languages during training.

## Key Results
- Multilingual APE models outperform single-pair models by 2.5 and 2.39 TER points for English-Hindi and English-Marathi
- Multitask learning provides additional improvements of +1.29 and +1.44 TER points
- Data augmentation contributes +0.53 and +0.45 TER points
- Domain adaptation yields +0.35 and +0.45 TER points

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multilingual training exploits shared linguistic features between Hindi and Marathi to improve APE performance.
- Mechanism: The model leverages common grammatical structures (SOV), vocabulary overlap, and script (Devanagari) to transfer correction knowledge across language pairs.
- Core assumption: Linguistic similarities between Hindi and Marathi are sufficient to enable meaningful cross-linguistic transfer in the APE task.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we exploit the linguistic similarities to develop a robust multilingual APE model"
  - [section 1] "Such linguistic similarities enable cross-linguistic transfer and suggest that advancements in Multilingual APE (MAPE) could be particularly beneficial"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related papers focus on QE-APE but not specifically on linguistic transfer between Indo-Aryan languages
- Break condition: If linguistic similarities prove insufficient for meaningful knowledge transfer, or if error patterns differ significantly between language pairs.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Data augmentation through synthetic Hindi-Marathi and Marathi-Hindi triplets enhances cross-lingual transfer.
- Mechanism: By generating additional APE triplets in both translation directions between Hindi and Marathi, the model learns to correct errors specific to each language's characteristics.
- Core assumption: Creating synthetic post-editing data between target languages provides valuable training signals beyond what monolingual APE data offers.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.1] "For the data augmentation, we translate a randomly picked subset of 0.5M source sentences... into the 'cross-target-language'"
  - [section 5] "We use the quadruples to form Hindi-Marathi and Marathi-Hindi APE triplets"
  - [corpus] Moderate evidence - related work on data augmentation exists but not specifically for cross-lingual APE triplets
- Break condition: If synthetic data quality is poor or if the translation directions don't capture meaningful error patterns.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Joint training on APE and QE tasks through multitask learning improves model's ability to assess translation quality and avoid over-correction.
- Mechanism: The model learns to simultaneously predict correction needs (APE) and quality assessment (QE), creating a feedback loop that enhances both capabilities.
- Core assumption: APE and QE tasks are complementary, and joint training leads to better performance than separate training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "multitask learning (+1.29 and +1.44 TER points)"
  - [section 3] "This complementary nature of APE and QE tasks has been exploited in the QE-APE multi-task learning-based framework"
  - [section 6] "Similar to how joint training on QE and APE tasks has been shown to benefit APE in the case of single-pair APE models"
  - [corpus] Strong evidence - multiple related papers (paper_id 13458, 170446, 88642) explicitly focus on QE-assisted APE
- Break condition: If the model prioritizes one task over the other, or if task interference reduces overall performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cross-lingual transfer learning
  - Why needed here: The paper relies on transferring correction knowledge from English-Hindi to English-Marathi and vice versa
  - Quick check question: What linguistic features make cross-lingual transfer feasible between closely related languages?

- Concept: Curriculum learning strategy
  - Why needed here: The training approach progressively introduces more complex tasks to improve model performance
  - Quick check question: How does curriculum learning help in handling synthetic vs. authentic APE data differently?

- Concept: Multitask learning optimization
  - Why needed here: The model jointly trains on APE and QE tasks, requiring careful loss balancing and optimization
  - Quick check question: What are the trade-offs between simple loss addition vs. sophisticated multitask learning approaches like Nash-MTL?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Two-encoder, single-decoder architecture
  - Encoder 1: Source language representation
  - Encoder 2: Translation representation
  - Decoder: Post-edited translation generation
  - Optional QE task-specific heads for multitask learning
  - Adapter layers for domain adaptation

- Critical path:
  1. Input: Source sentence + machine translation
  2. Encoding: Two separate encoders process source and translation
  3. Shared representation: Encoded representations combined
  4. Decoding: Generate post-edited translation
  5. Optional: QE prediction heads for multitask learning

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Single vs. multilingual models: Multilingual offers better performance but increased complexity
  - Data augmentation: Additional synthetic data improves performance but requires quality translation models
  - Multitask learning: Joint training improves quality assessment but adds training complexity

- Failure signatures:
  - Over-correction: Model makes unnecessary changes to already good translations
  - Inconsistent post-edits: Different outputs for similar source-translation pairs
  - Domain-specific degradation: Performance drops significantly outside training domains
  - Language confusion: Model mixes Hindi and Marathi corrections

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement baseline APE models for English-Hindi and English-Marathi separately to establish performance baselines
  2. Create multilingual APE model without language ID tokens to test basic cross-lingual transfer capability
  3. Add language ID tokens to multilingual model to test impact of explicit target language information

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does multilingual APE training improve performance for low-resource language pairs with less closely related target languages?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper states "We observe more than 1 TER point improvement" when comparing single-pair APE models to MAPE models for closely related Hindi and Marathi, but does not test less closely related languages.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests two closely related Indo-Aryan languages (Hindi and Marathi) and does not explore other language pairs with varying degrees of linguistic similarity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing TER improvements (or lack thereof) when applying MAPE to other low-resource language pairs with less closely related target languages, such as English-Spanish and English-French.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal number of additional synthetic translation direction triplets needed to maximize MAPE performance gains?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions using 0.5M synthetic triplets for data augmentation but does not explore the relationship between the number of augmented triplets and performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests one specific number of augmented triplets (0.5M) and does not investigate how performance scales with different amounts of augmented data.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study varying the number of Hindi-Marathi and Marathi-Hindi synthetic triplets used for data augmentation, showing TER scores for each quantity to identify the point of diminishing returns.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the quality difference between baseline APE models affect the performance gains from MAPE training?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes that current work "does not explore the improvements MAPE can bring when the Baseline APE models of each pair have different qualities."
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests MAPE with baseline APE models of similar quality (20.85 and 20.58 TER points) and does not investigate scenarios where baseline models have significantly different performance levels.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments training MAPE with baseline APE models of varying quality differences, showing how the TER improvement scales with the baseline performance gap between language pairs.

## Limitations

- Dataset size constraints: The study relies on relatively small authentic APE datasets (9K for English-Hindi, 22K for English-Marathi), which may limit generalizability and increase the risk of overfitting during fine-tuning.
- Synthetic data quality: The quality of synthetic Hindi-Marathi and Marathi-Hindi APE triplets depends entirely on the translation quality of the underlying NMT system (IndicTrans2), potentially propagating errors.
- Linguistic similarity assumption: The extent to which shared script and grammatical structures translate to effective cross-linguistic transfer in the APE task is not fully validated, as error patterns may differ substantially between language pairs.

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The baseline finding that multilingual APE models outperform single-pair models by 2.5 and 2.39 TER points for English-Hindi and English-Marathi, respectively.
- Medium Confidence: The effectiveness of the three proposed enhancements (multi-task learning, data augmentation, and domain adaptation) with modest absolute gains reported.
- Low Confidence: The assumption that linguistic similarities between Hindi and Marathi are the primary driver of multilingual model performance without ablation studies to isolate this contribution.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study on linguistic similarity**: Train multilingual APE models using language pairs with varying degrees of linguistic similarity (e.g., English-Hindi and English-Bengali, or English-Hindi and English-Tamil) to quantify the actual contribution of linguistic similarity versus other factors like increased training data.

2. **Synthetic data quality analysis**: Conduct a systematic evaluation of the synthetic Hindi-Marathi and Marathi-Hindi APE triplets by manually annotating a subset for translation quality and post-editing appropriateness. Compare model performance when trained on high-quality versus low-quality synthetic data.

3. **Long-term stability assessment**: Implement a cross-domain evaluation framework where models trained on one domain (e.g., News) are evaluated on others (e.g., Tourism, Law, Education) to assess the robustness and generalizability of the proposed multilingual approach across different text types and error patterns.
