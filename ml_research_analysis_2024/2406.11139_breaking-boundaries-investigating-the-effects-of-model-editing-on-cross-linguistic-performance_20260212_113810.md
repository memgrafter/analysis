# Breaking Boundaries: Investigating the Effects of Model Editing on Cross-linguistic Performance

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.11139
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11139
- Reference count: 39
- This study evaluates cross-lingual performance of multilingual LLMs in knowledge editing tasks across eight languages.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates cross-lingual performance of multilingual LLMs in knowledge editing tasks across eight languages. Using model editing techniques ROME and MEMIT on CounterFact and ZsRE datasets, the research reveals significant disparities in cross-lingual consistency, particularly for low-resource languages. The findings demonstrate that while models show high reliability in self-inference settings, they exhibit poor generalization and locality scores across languages, with portability metrics consistently low. Even model merging fails to enhance cross-lingual consistency, highlighting fundamental limitations in current LLMs' ability to transfer edits across linguistic boundaries.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates cross-lingual performance of multilingual LLMs in knowledge editing tasks using CounterFact and ZsRE datasets with ~550 edit instances each. Eight languages are tested: English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Hindi, Tamil, and Kannada. Models include MISTRAL, TOWER INSTRUCT, OPEN HATHI, TAMIL-LLAMA, and KAN-LLAMA. Editing methods ROME and MEMIT are applied using strategies "each language for itself" (ELFI) and "each language for others" (ELFO). Models are edited in one language and tested across all languages, with evaluation metrics including reliability, generalization, locality, and portability. Datasets are translated using Google Translate and GPT-4 for sentence completion format.

## Key Results
- Models like MISTRAL and TOWER INSTRUCT show high reliability in self-inference settings but poor cross-lingual generalization
- Even model merging fails to enhance cross-lingual consistency across languages
- Editing methods encounter significant problems with morphologically rich or agglutinative languages

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Editing models in high-resource languages produces strong reliability scores, but these edits fail to generalize when inferencing in low-resource languages.
- Mechanism: High-resource language edits create stable embeddings and robust causal pathways in the model's learned representation space. Low-resource languages lack sufficient fine-tuning exposure, causing embeddings to diverge and edits to fail during inference.
- Core assumption: The model's ability to maintain factual consistency depends on the similarity of linguistic representation structures across languages.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Models like MISTRAL and TOWER INSTRUCT show high reliability in self-inference settings but exhibit poor generalization and locality scores, with portability metrics consistently low across languages."
  - [section 6.1] "Even strategies like model merging fail to close these gaps, highlighting fundamental deficiencies."
  - [corpus] "Cross-linguistic transfer has become a crucial aspect of multilingual NLP, as it allows for models trained on resource-rich languages to be applied to low-resource languages more effectively."
- Break condition: If cross-lingual parameter sharing or translation-based alignment mechanisms are introduced, the assumption about representation divergence may no longer hold.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Model merging improves individual language capabilities but does not resolve cross-lingual consistency issues after editing.
- Mechanism: Merged models combine language-specific task vectors, but the integration does not harmonize underlying representations across languages, leading to persistent inconsistencies when edits are applied.
- Core assumption: Language-specific adaptations in merged models operate independently rather than synergistically across linguistic boundaries.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Even model merging fails to enhance cross-lingual consistency, highlighting fundamental limitations in current LLMs' ability to transfer edits across linguistic boundaries."
  - [section 6.3] "Editing and inferencing in English yield high reliability scores... However, performance drops to near zero when editing in English and inferencing in Hindi, Tamil, or Kannada."
  - [corpus] "Multilingual automatic post-editing for low-resource languages" suggests potential, but merging alone is insufficient.
- Break condition: If advanced alignment techniques (e.g., TIES merging with cross-lingual regularization) are applied, the assumption about independent language adaptations may be invalidated.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Editing methods (ROME and MEMIT) encounter problems with morphologically rich or agglutinative languages, leading to poor generalization and locality scores.
- Mechanism: Editing techniques rely on identifying and modifying specific neural pathways. In languages with complex morphology, these pathways are less distinct or more distributed, making precise edits difficult.
- Core assumption: The effectiveness of editing methods is contingent on the linguistic simplicity and morphological transparency of the target language.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Editing methods ROME and MEMIT encounter problems with highly agglutinative or morphologically rich languages."
  - [section 7] "Lexical ambiguity... Syntactic ambiguity... Semantic ambiguity errors" highlight the complexity in morphologically rich languages.
  - [corpus] "LLMs struggle with NLI for perfect aspect: A cross-linguistic study in Chinese and Japanese" indicates challenges with complex linguistic features.
- Break condition: If editing methods are adapted to account for morphological complexity (e.g., through language-specific fine-tuning), the assumption about their ineffectiveness may no longer hold.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cross-lingual consistency
  - Why needed here: Understanding how factual edits propagate across languages is central to evaluating multilingual model performance.
  - Quick check question: If a model is edited in English to correct a fact, will the correction automatically apply when queried in Hindi?

- Concept: Morphological complexity
  - Why needed here: Languages like Tamil and Kannada have rich morphology that can affect how edits are processed and generalized.
  - Quick check question: How does the presence of agglutinative morphology in a language impact the effectiveness of neural editing techniques?

- Concept: Embedding alignment
  - Why needed here: The degree to which representations of different languages align in the model's embedding space affects cross-lingual edit propagation.
  - Quick check question: What role does embedding alignment play in the portability of factual edits across languages?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Pretrained multilingual LLMs (MISTRAL, TOWER INSTRUCT, OPEN HATHI, TAMIL-LLAMA, KAN-LLAMA)
  - Editing methods (ROME, MEMIT)
  - Datasets (CounterFact, ZsRE with translations)
  - Evaluation metrics (Reliability, Generalization, Locality, Portability)
  - Model merging technique (TIES)

- Critical path:
  1. Edit model in source language using ROME or MEMIT
  2. Test edited model across all languages for reliability
  3. Evaluate generalization and locality within each language
  4. Assess portability across languages
  5. Merge models if applicable and repeat evaluation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - High-resource language edits vs. low-resource language edits: High-resource edits yield better reliability but poor cross-lingual portability.
  - Model merging vs. single language models: Merging improves individual language performance but does not resolve cross-lingual consistency.
  - Editing method selection (ROME vs. MEMIT): Both methods struggle with morphologically rich languages, but MEMIT may offer slightly better performance in some cases.

- Failure signatures:
  - Low portability scores across all languages indicate failure in cross-lingual edit propagation.
  - High reliability in source language but poor performance in target languages suggests representation divergence.
  - Poor generalization and locality scores point to issues with morphological complexity or insufficient language-specific training.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Edit a model in English using ROME and test across all languages to establish baseline performance.
  2. Repeat the edit using MEMIT and compare results to assess method effectiveness.
  3. Merge language-specific models (e.g., OPEN HATHI, TAMIL-LLAMA, KAN-LLAMA) and evaluate cross-lingual consistency after editing.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can cross-lingual consistency in knowledge editing be achieved without compromising performance in low-resource languages?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights that current models struggle with cross-lingual consistency, especially in low-resource languages, and that model merging does not consistently improve performance.
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies the problem, it does not propose a definitive solution for achieving cross-lingual consistency without sacrificing low-resource language performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: A method that demonstrates improved cross-lingual consistency in low-resource languages without degrading performance in high-resource languages, validated across multiple datasets and model architectures.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What architectural modifications could enhance multilingual knowledge transfer in LLMs?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the limitations of current models in generalizing edits across languages and suggests that architectural biases contribute to these issues.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore specific architectural changes that could address these limitations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing that specific architectural modifications (e.g., cross-lingual parameter sharing, enhanced morphological analysis) lead to significant improvements in cross-lingual knowledge transfer.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the iterative editing approach impact the long-term stability of multilingual LLMs?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions continuous model editing as a potential strategy but does not investigate its long-term effects on model stability.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide data on the effects of iterative editing over extended periods or across diverse linguistic contexts.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies demonstrating the stability and performance of multilingual LLMs under iterative editing, with comparisons to baseline models over time.

## Limitations

- The analysis is constrained by the relatively small edit instance count (~550 per dataset) and potential translation artifacts from automated tools, which may affect the reliability of cross-linguistic comparisons.
- The study focuses on factual edits rather than broader semantic or contextual modifications, limiting generalizability to other types of knowledge updates.
- Significant uncertainties remain around the scalability of these findings to even lower-resource languages and the impact of different editing methodologies beyond ROME and MEMIT.

## Confidence

- High confidence: The core finding that cross-lingual consistency is significantly worse for low-resource languages, particularly in reliability, generalization, and locality scores.
- Medium confidence: The assertion that model merging fails to resolve cross-lingual consistency issues, as this is based on a limited set of merged models.
- Low confidence: The specific impact of morphological complexity on editing effectiveness, given the narrow range of morphologically rich languages tested.

## Next Checks

1. Replicate the study with a larger dataset (e.g., 1000+ edit instances) and manual translation verification for low-resource languages to assess the impact of data quality on cross-lingual consistency.

2. Test alternative editing methods (e.g., ARMANI, I-MERIT) and advanced alignment techniques (e.g., TIES merging with cross-lingual regularization) to determine if improved cross-lingual consistency is achievable.

3. Extend the evaluation to include semantic and contextual edits, not just factual updates, to understand the broader limitations of cross-lingual knowledge editing in multilingual LLMs.
