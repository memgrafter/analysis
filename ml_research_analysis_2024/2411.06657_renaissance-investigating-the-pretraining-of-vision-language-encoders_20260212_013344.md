# Renaissance: Investigating the Pretraining of Vision-Language Encoders

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2411.06657
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06657
- **Authors**: Clayton Fields; Casey Kennington
- **Reference count**: 14
- **Primary result**: Freezing pretrained vision or text encoders during VL pretraining saves compute with minimal downstream performance loss, and one-tower models perform comparably to two-tower models regardless of whether using pretrained or random initialization.

## Executive Summary
This paper systematically investigates best practices for pretraining vision-language (VL) transformer encoders, addressing the proliferation of VL models that lack standardized evaluation. The authors introduce Renaissance, a VL modeling platform, and conduct controlled experiments revealing that freezing pretrained encoder modules during VL pretraining enables significant compute savings with minimal performance degradation. Surprisingly, one-tower VL models perform equally well whether initialized with pretrained weights or randomly, with random initialization sometimes outperforming pretrained weights. The results suggest two-tower models offer better parameter efficiency than one-tower models under comparable conditions.

## Method Summary
The authors developed Renaissance, a VL modeling platform designed for creating, training, and evaluating transformer encoders. They conducted two primary experimental series: first, evaluating the impact of freezing pretrained encoder modules (text or vision) during VL pretraining on downstream task performance; second, comparing one-tower VL models using either text or vision encoders as the base, including randomly initialized baselines. The experiments measured compute efficiency, parameter efficiency, and downstream performance across multiple VL tasks to determine optimal pretraining strategies.

## Key Results
- Freezing pretrained encoder modules during VL pretraining saves significant compute with minimal downstream performance loss
- One-tower VL models perform comparably regardless of whether using text or vision encoders as base, with randomly initialized baselines sometimes outperforming pretrained weights
- Two-tower models demonstrate better parameter efficiency than one-tower models under comparable conditions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The mechanism behind these results relates to the complementary nature of vision and language representations during VL pretraining. When pretrained modules are frozen, the VL-specific cross-modal components learn to bridge the gap between frozen representations rather than modifying the foundational encoders. For one-tower models, random initialization may allow more flexible adaptation to the joint VL space without being constrained by potentially suboptimal pretrained initialization for the specific cross-modal tasks. The parameter efficiency advantage of two-tower models likely stems from maintaining separate, specialized representations for each modality rather than forcing them through a single tower.

## Foundational Learning

**Transformer Architecture**: The foundational building block for modern VL models; needed to understand cross-modal attention mechanisms. Quick check: Can you explain self-attention and cross-attention differences?

**Vision-Language Pretraining**: Joint training of visual and textual encoders; needed to grasp how models learn cross-modal alignment. Quick check: What objectives are typically used (contrastive, generative, or both)?

**Parameter Efficiency**: Ratio of model performance to parameter count; needed to evaluate architectural trade-offs. Quick check: How do FLOPs and parameter counts relate to inference efficiency?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Vision Encoder <- Cross-modal Adapter -> Language Encoder (two-tower); Vision Encoder -> Cross-modal Adapter -> Language Decoder (one-tower)

**Critical Path**: Image/text input → respective encoder → cross-modal attention → fused representation → task head

**Design Tradeoffs**: One-tower models offer simpler architecture but potentially suboptimal initialization; two-tower models maintain specialized representations but require more parameters and careful alignment

**Failure Signatures**: Random initialization outperforming pretrained weights may indicate hyperparameter misalignment or training instability; freezing encoders may limit task-specific adaptation

**First Experiments**:
1. Freeze vision encoder during VL pretraining, measure compute savings and downstream performance
2. Compare one-tower vs two-tower parameter efficiency across 1B, 3B, 8B parameter scales
3. Ablate learning rates for randomly initialized components in one-tower models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited downstream task diversity tested, potentially constraining generalizability of findings
- Counterintuitive random initialization results require careful validation to rule out experimental artifacts
- No systematic hyperparameter ablation for one-tower random initialization comparisons

## Confidence

**High confidence**: Compute savings from freezing pretrained encoder modules is well-established and consistently demonstrated
**Medium confidence**: Vision encoder freezing yielding slight improvements requires more rigorous statistical analysis
**Low confidence**: Randomly initialized baselines outperforming pretrained weights in one-tower models is surprising and potentially indicates experimental artifacts

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies systematically varying learning rates and weight decay for randomly initialized components to determine if initialization advantages persist under optimal hyperparameter settings.

2. Expand downstream evaluation to include diverse task types (localization, reasoning, multilingual) and model scales (1B, 3B, 8B parameters) to verify robustness of the one-tower vs two-tower findings.

3. Implement gradient-based attribution analysis to understand what aspects of the pretrained weights are being lost versus gained when using random initialization in one-tower architectures.
