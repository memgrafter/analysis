core_contribution: This work addresses the challenge of detecting speech disfluencies,
  such as hesitations, repetitions, or prolongations, which affect about 1% of the
  global population. Existing approaches primarily rely on audio data, but this paper
  proposes a novel multimodal approach that leverages both audio and video data.

# Missingness-resilient Video-enhanced Multimodal Disfluency Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.06964
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06964
- Reference count: 0
- This work proposes a multimodal approach to speech disfluency detection using both audio and video data, achieving significant improvements over audio-only methods.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of detecting speech disfluencies by leveraging both audio and video modalities. The authors propose a unified weight-sharing encoder that can handle missing video data during inference, making the approach more robust to real-world scenarios. They curate a custom audio-visual dataset from the FluencyBank corpus and evaluate their approach on five disfluency detection tasks. Results show that the multimodal approach significantly outperforms audio-only methods, achieving an average absolute improvement of 10% in balanced accuracy when both modalities are available, and 7% even when video is missing in half of the samples.

## Method Summary
The proposed method uses a unified weight-sharing modality-agnostic encoder to combine audio and video features for disfluency detection. The approach leverages wav2vec 2.0 for audio feature extraction and a custom pipeline for video feature extraction, including 3D CNNs and ResNet-18 encoder. The model employs modality dropout augmentation during training to improve resilience to missing video data. A classifier head with fully-connected layers is used for the final disfluency detection task, trained with a class-weighted sampler to handle class imbalance.

## Key Results
- The multimodal approach achieves an average absolute improvement of 10% in balanced accuracy compared to audio-only methods when both video and audio modalities are available.
- Even when video is missing in half of the samples, the approach maintains a 7% improvement over audio-only methods.
- The model shows robustness to missing video data, maintaining performance close to the full multimodal setup when trained with modality dropout augmentation.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Unified weight-sharing encoders enable robust multimodal learning even when video is missing during inference. By using a shared encoder for both audio and video modalities, the model learns common representations that are modality-agnostic. This allows the model to handle missing video data without retraining or switching architectures. The core assumption is that the shared encoder can effectively learn from partial modality availability during both training and inference.

### Mechanism 2
Video modality provides complementary visual cues that enhance disfluency detection beyond audio-only methods. Visual features from facial expressions and gestures provide additional information about speech disfluencies that audio alone cannot capture, improving overall detection accuracy. The core assumption is that facial expressions and gestures contain discriminative information about speech disfluencies.

### Mechanism 3
Modality dropout augmentation during training improves model robustness to missing video data. Randomly dropping video data during training forces the model to learn robust representations that can handle partial modality availability at inference time. The core assumption is that training with randomly dropped modalities improves generalization to missing modalities during inference.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input: Audio (3-second segments, 16kHz) and video (30fps)
  - Audio feature extraction: wav2vec 2.0 base architecture with 12 frozen transformer layers
  - Video feature extraction: Ma et al.'s preprocessing pipeline with 3D CNNs and ResNet-18 encoder
  - Shared encoder: Multi-head attention transformer with positional encoding
  - Fusion: Additive fusion with learnable scaling factors
  - Classifier: Fully-connected layers with cross-entropy loss

- Critical path: Audio/video preprocessing → Feature extraction → Shared encoder → Fusion → Classifier

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Weight-sharing vs. modality-specific encoders: Weight-sharing enables missingness resilience but may limit modality-specific feature learning
  - Full face vs. lip region ROI: Full face provides better performance but may include irrelevant information

- Failure signatures:
  - Significant performance drop when video is missing despite training with modality dropout
  - Poor generalization to unseen disfluency types or speakers

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare performance with and without modality dropout during training
  2. Evaluate performance on varying amounts of available video data during inference
  3. Test zero-shot transfer to a different dataset (SEP28k) with only audio input

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed unified weight-sharing encoder design generalize to other multimodal tasks beyond disfluency detection?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that their design can support missing modalities during both training and inference, suggesting broader applicability.
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates the approach on disfluency detection. Its performance on other multimodal tasks is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the unified encoder design on other multimodal tasks like emotion recognition or speech recognition, and comparing performance to other multimodal approaches.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of different pretrained foundation models for audio and video feature extraction on the performance of the multimodal disfluency detection system?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors mention using wav2vec 2.0 for audio and a specific pipeline for video, but do not explore the impact of using other pretrained models.
- Why unresolved: The choice of pretrained models can significantly impact feature quality and downstream task performance. The optimal models for this specific task are unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematically replacing the audio and video feature extractors with other pretrained models and measuring the impact on disfluency detection accuracy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed approach handle more severe missingness scenarios, such as when both audio and video data are missing for a significant portion of the dataset?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors evaluate resilience to missing video data but do not explore scenarios with missing audio data or more severe missingness.
- Why unresolved: Real-world data collection often results in missing data from multiple modalities. The approach's performance in these scenarios is unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating the system's performance when both audio and video data are missing for varying percentages of the dataset, and comparing it to imputation or other missing data handling strategies.

## Limitations
- The exact architecture details of the Faudio and Fvideo encoders are not fully specified, which may impact reproducibility
- Limited evaluation on diverse datasets beyond the curated FluencyBank corpus raises questions about generalizability
- The paper does not provide ablation studies on different ROI sizes for video processing, making it difficult to quantify the impact of using full face versus lip region

## Confidence
- **High**: The multimodal approach significantly outperforms audio-only methods when both modalities are available (10% improvement in balanced accuracy)
- **Medium**: The model maintains reasonable performance (7% improvement) even when video is missing in half of the samples
- **Low**: Claims about zero-shot transfer capabilities to SEP28k dataset with only audio input lack empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies comparing full face ROI versus lip region ROI for video feature extraction to quantify the impact on performance
2. Evaluate the model on additional disfluency datasets beyond FluencyBank to assess generalizability across different populations and speaking conditions
3. Perform extensive hyperparameter sensitivity analysis, particularly for the shared encoder architecture and modality dropout rate, to identify optimal configurations
