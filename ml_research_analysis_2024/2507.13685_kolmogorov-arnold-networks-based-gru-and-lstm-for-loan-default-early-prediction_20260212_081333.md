# Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks-based GRU and LSTM for Loan Default Early Prediction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2507.13685
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13685
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: GRU-KAN and LSTM-KAN achieve >92% accuracy for 3-month advance predictions and >88% for 8-month advance predictions on Freddie Mac dataset

## Executive Summary
This study introduces GRU-KAN and LSTM-KAN, novel architectures that integrate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for loan default prediction. The models demonstrate superior early prediction accuracy and enhanced capability to handle out-of-time (OOT) data compared to traditional baselines. Evaluated on the Freddie Mac dataset, these hybrid architectures achieve prediction accuracies exceeding 92% three months in advance and 88% eight months in advance, significantly outperforming conventional LSTM, GRU, LSTM-Attention, and LSTM-Transformer models across multiple evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and AUC scores.

## Method Summary
The proposed approach combines the sequential learning capabilities of GRU and LSTM networks with the nonlinear approximation power of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. KAN layers replace traditional activation functions in the recurrent architectures, enabling better capture of complex relationships in time series data. The models process historical loan performance data with configurable feature window lengths and early prediction intervals. Extensive experiments were conducted on the Freddie Mac dataset, testing various configurations to assess robustness across different sample sizes, feature windows, and prediction horizons. The hybrid architectures maintain the gating mechanisms of their parent models while leveraging KAN's piecewise linear approximation capabilities for improved feature representation.

## Key Results
- GRU-KAN and LSTM-KAN achieve >92% prediction accuracy three months before default occurrence
- Models maintain >88% accuracy eight months before default, outperforming all baseline models
- Significant performance improvements across accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and AUC metrics compared to LSTM, GRU, LSTM-Attention, and LSTM-Transformer baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The integration of KAN layers with recurrent architectures enhances the models' ability to capture complex nonlinear relationships in sequential loan performance data. KAN's universal approximation capability allows for more precise modeling of intricate patterns in borrower behavior and economic indicators over time. The hybrid approach maintains the temporal dependency learning of GRU/LSTM while adding KAN's superior nonlinear feature extraction, resulting in more robust predictions across varying time horizons and data conditions.

## Foundational Learning

**Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)**: Multi-layer networks using Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem for function approximation. Needed for capturing complex nonlinear relationships in loan performance data. Quick check: Verify KAN's universal approximation capability matches or exceeds traditional neural networks.

**Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)**: Simplified recurrent neural network variant with gating mechanisms for controlling information flow. Needed for capturing temporal dependencies in sequential loan data. Quick check: Ensure gating mechanisms effectively preserve relevant historical information while filtering noise.

**Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: Advanced recurrent architecture with memory cells and multiple gating mechanisms. Needed for handling long-term dependencies in loan performance trajectories. Quick check: Confirm memory cell effectiveness in maintaining information across extended prediction horizons.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input features -> KAN layer -> GRU/LSTM cells -> Output layer

**Critical Path**: Feature extraction through KAN layer → gated recurrent processing → prediction output

**Design Tradeoffs**: KAN integration improves nonlinear approximation but increases computational complexity; choice between GRU and LSTM affects temporal modeling capacity and resource requirements.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation under extreme feature sparsity, temporal misalignment, or when underlying data distributions shift significantly between training and deployment periods.

**First Experiments**: 1) Compare KAN-based models against traditional activation functions using identical network structures, 2) Test different feature window lengths to identify optimal temporal scope, 3) Evaluate model performance across various early prediction intervals (1-12 months) to establish robustness.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Single dataset reliance (Freddie Mac) may limit generalizability across different credit markets
- Computational complexity of KAN layers not addressed for real-world deployment scenarios
- No detailed hyperparameter tuning methodology or overfitting mitigation strategies discussed

## Confidence

## Next Checks
1. Test GRU-KAN and LSTM-KAN models on at least two additional loan default datasets from different geographic regions and economic contexts to assess generalizability.
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the specific contribution of KAN layers to performance improvements compared to traditional activation functions.
3. Perform computational efficiency analysis comparing inference times and resource requirements of KAN-based models versus traditional LSTM/GRU models under production workloads.
