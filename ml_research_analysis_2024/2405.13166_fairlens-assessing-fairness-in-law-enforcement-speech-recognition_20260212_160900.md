# FairLENS: Assessing Fairness in Law Enforcement Speech Recognition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.13166
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13166
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: A framework for evaluating fairness disparities in ASR models using Wilcoxon signed-rank test and comprehensive dataset

## Executive Summary
FairLENS is a fairness evaluation framework for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models, specifically designed for law enforcement applications. It addresses the critical need for fair ASR technology in scenarios where accuracy can have significant real-world consequences. The framework employs a novel statistical approach using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to assess fairness disparities between models and includes a comprehensive dataset with over 2,300 diverse speakers across multiple acoustic environments and demographic dimensions.

The framework was used to evaluate 12 state-of-the-art ASR models, revealing significant fairness differences across demographic groups including sex, age, race, and accent. The evaluation covered both transcription and dictation tasks in various acoustic environments (indoor/outdoor, monologue/dialogue). Results showed that some models exhibited more biases than others, particularly towards specific demographic groups and in noisy environments. These findings provide a fairness guideline for selecting ASR models and highlight the need for more diverse training data and improved model structures to mitigate biases.

## Method Summary
FairLENS employs a statistical approach using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to assess fairness disparities between ASR models. The framework evaluates models based on Word Error Rate (WER) across diverse demographic subgroups and acoustic environments. A comprehensive dataset of over 2,300 speakers was collected, covering multiple demographic dimensions (sex, age, race, accent) and acoustic scenarios (indoor/outdoor, monologue/dialogue). The framework evaluates both transcription and dictation tasks, providing a comprehensive assessment of model fairness across different use cases.

## Key Results
- Significant fairness disparities were found across ASR models, with some models showing more biases than others
- Demographic groups including Asian, African American, Teen, and Southern Accent speakers consistently showed higher WER across multiple models
- Background noise increased performance degradation for certain groups more than others, particularly in dialogue datasets
- The framework successfully ranked models by fairness, providing actionable guidance for model selection in law enforcement contexts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The Wilcoxon signed-rank test enables statistically robust comparison of fairness disparities between ASR models.
- Mechanism: By testing paired differences in average WER disparities across demographic subgroups, the method determines if one model is significantly fairer than another without being influenced by the number of models being compared.
- Core assumption: The differences in average WER disparities between two models are symmetrically distributed around zero under the null hypothesis.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We employ the Wilcoxon signed-rank test [Wilcoxon, 1945] to examine the difference in paired data, helping us determine if significantly different fairness disparities exist between two models."
  - [section 3.1] "Instead of the mean-rank test, Benavoli et al. [Benavoli et al., 2016] proposed to use the Wilcoxon signed-rank test [Wilcoxon, 1945] from which the results are irrelevant to other models, which meets the requirements of the fairness evaluation task."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus provides related papers on fairness benchmarking but not specific validation of this test for ASR.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: A comprehensive, balanced dataset covering multiple demographic groups and acoustic environments enables accurate fairness assessment.
- Mechanism: By including diverse speakers across sex, age, race, accent, and recording scenarios (indoor/outdoor, monologue/dialogue), the dataset captures the full range of performance variations that ASR models might exhibit.
- Core assumption: The dataset's demographic distribution accurately represents real-world diversity and is balanced enough to detect subgroup-specific biases.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We also collected a fairness evaluation dataset covering multiple scenarios and demographic dimensions."
  - [section 3.2] "We conducted multiple rounds of data collection while monitoring the amount of data for each demographic subgroup, and intentionally collected data for under-represented demographic groups and subgroups."
  - [corpus] Moderate evidence - corpus shows related work on fairness datasets, supporting the importance of balanced representation.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Evaluating ASR models across both transcription and dictation tasks provides a comprehensive view of model fairness.
- Mechanism: Different ASR use cases (batch transcription vs. streaming dictation) impose different constraints and may reveal different fairness issues, so testing both ensures a complete assessment.
- Core assumption: The fairness characteristics of ASR models are not identical across different task types.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "Our FairLENS dataset is composed of four independent datasets for two types of models: transcription and dictation."
  - [section 4.1] "6 models that support streaming conversion are evaluated on the solo dictation dataset."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus doesn't specifically address task-specific fairness evaluation.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Statistical hypothesis testing (specifically Wilcoxon signed-rank test)
  - Why needed here: To determine if differences in fairness between models are statistically significant rather than random variation.
  - Quick check question: What is the null hypothesis when comparing two models' fairness using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test?

- Concept: Demographic data collection and balancing
  - Why needed here: To create a dataset that accurately represents diverse populations and enables detection of subgroup-specific biases.
  - Quick check question: Why is intersectional coverage (representation of subgroup combinations) important for fairness evaluation?

- Concept: Acoustic environment variation
  - Why needed here: To assess how background noise and recording conditions affect model fairness across different demographic groups.
  - Quick check question: How might background noise differentially impact ASR performance for different demographic groups?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Data Collection Module -> Pre-processing Pipeline -> ASR Model Interface -> Evaluation Engine -> Reporting Module

- Critical path:
  1. Collect balanced dataset across all demographic and acoustic dimensions
  2. Run each ASR model on all dataset samples
  3. Calculate WER for each model-demographic pair
  4. Compute average WER disparities across subgroups
  5. Apply Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare models
  6. Generate fairness rankings and visualizations

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Dataset size vs. collection cost: Larger datasets provide more reliable results but are more expensive to collect
  - Demographic granularity vs. data sparsity: More granular subgroups provide finer analysis but may lack sufficient samples
  - Statistical rigor vs. interpretability: More complex statistical methods may be harder to explain to non-technical stakeholders

- Failure signatures:
  - Overlapping confidence intervals with no clear fairness ranking indicates models are statistically equivalent in fairness
  - Certain demographic subgroups consistently showing high WER across all models suggests dataset or evaluation issues
  - Statistical test failures (e.g., ties, zeros) may require alternative non-parametric tests

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run baseline evaluation on a small subset of the dataset to verify data collection and preprocessing pipeline
  2. Compare two ASR models with known performance differences to validate the Wilcoxon signed-rank test implementation
  3. Test how acoustic environment variations (indoor vs. outdoor) affect fairness across demographic groups on a representative sample

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the acoustic domain shift affect ASR model fairness across different demographic groups, and what specific training data or model architecture modifications would mitigate this effect?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper observed that background noise increases performance degradation for certain groups more than others, particularly in dialogue datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper hypothesizes this is due to lack of diverse training data in varying acoustic conditions but does not provide specific solutions or empirical validation of potential mitigations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing improved fairness in noisy conditions after augmenting training data with diverse acoustic environments or implementing noise-robust model architectures.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the underlying causes of consistent bias patterns across multiple ASR models, particularly towards Asian, African American, Teen, and Southern Accent speakers?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that bias patterns are similar across different models, suggesting shared structural issues or training data problems.
- Why unresolved: The paper cannot access model internals to identify root causes and only hypothesizes about potential issues with training data and model structures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of training data distributions and model architectures that identifies specific features or representations causing bias, or controlled experiments modifying these elements.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How generalizable is the FairLENS framework to other languages and cultural contexts beyond English and US demographics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The framework is described as "adaptable" but all evaluations are conducted on English speakers with US-specific demographic categories.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates framework effectiveness only within a narrow linguistic and cultural context without exploring cross-lingual or cross-cultural applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful application of FairLENS to ASR models in different languages, with demographic categories appropriate to those cultural contexts, showing comparable fairness assessment capabilities.

## Limitations

- The framework focuses on English speakers and US demographic categories, limiting generalizability to other languages and cultural contexts
- Dataset collection was constrained by practical limitations, potentially affecting intersectional coverage of all subgroup combinations
- The study evaluates only transcription and dictation tasks, potentially missing fairness issues in other ASR applications like voice commands or conversational AI

## Confidence

- Statistical methodology: Medium
- Dataset representativeness: Medium
- Framework generalizability: Low

## Next Checks

1. Conduct sensitivity analysis by systematically varying the dataset composition to test how robust the fairness rankings are to demographic distribution changes
2. Apply alternative statistical tests (e.g., bootstrap methods, permutation tests) to verify the stability of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test results
3. Evaluate the framework's performance on a held-out test set of models not used in the original study to assess generalizability
