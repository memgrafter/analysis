# Privacy-Preserving Race/Ethnicity Estimation for Algorithmic Bias Measurement in the U.S

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.04652
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04652
- Reference count: 40
- Addresses challenge of measuring AI fairness with respect to race/ethnicity for U.S. LinkedIn members while preserving privacy

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a privacy-preserving method for estimating race/ethnicity of U.S. LinkedIn members to enable algorithmic bias measurement. The proposed Privacy-Preserving Probabilistic Race/Ethnicity Estimation (PPRE) system combines the Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) model with a sparse LinkedIn survey sample of self-reported demographics, enhanced with privacy technologies including secure two-party computation and differential privacy. The method generates probabilistic race/ethnicity estimates without assigning individuals to specific categories, ensuring data minimization and privacy protection. The authors demonstrate the system's effectiveness through benchmarking and validation, showing that it enables meaningful fairness measurements while preserving member privacy and control over their race/ethnicity identity.

## Method Summary
The PPRE method combines multiple approaches to generate race/ethnicity estimates while preserving privacy. It uses the Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) model as a foundation, which leverages surname and geographic information to estimate demographic probabilities. This is enhanced with a sparse LinkedIn survey sample containing self-reported demographic information. Privacy-enhancing technologies including secure two-party computation and differential privacy are integrated to protect member data. The system generates probabilistic rather than deterministic estimates, avoiding the assignment of individuals to specific racial/ethnic categories. This approach enables algorithmic bias measurement while adhering to data minimization principles and maintaining member privacy controls.

## Key Results
- PPRE successfully combines BISG model, survey data, and privacy technologies to generate race/ethnicity estimates
- The method enables meaningful fairness measurements while preserving member privacy and control over race/ethnicity identity
- Benchmarking and validation demonstrate effectiveness through cross-entropy comparisons with BISG variants and sample fairness measurements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The PPRE method works by probabilistically estimating race/ethnicity rather than making deterministic assignments, which inherently preserves privacy by avoiding explicit disclosure of sensitive attributes. The combination of BISG (which uses publicly available surname and geographic data), survey samples (providing ground truth for model calibration), and privacy technologies creates a system that balances utility and privacy. Secure two-party computation allows computation on encrypted data, while differential privacy adds calibrated noise to protect individual information. The probabilistic nature means the system can measure aggregate fairness without revealing individual characteristics, enabling compliance with privacy regulations while still providing actionable insights for bias measurement.

## Foundational Learning

Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG):
- Why needed: Provides a statistically sound method to estimate demographic probabilities using surname and geographic information
- Quick check: Verify that BISG outputs valid probability distributions that sum to 1 across all categories

Differential Privacy:
- Why needed: Adds mathematical privacy guarantees by introducing calibrated noise to protect individual data points
- Quick check: Confirm that the privacy budget (epsilon) is appropriately set to balance utility and privacy

Secure Two-Party Computation:
- Why needed: Enables computation on encrypted data without revealing the underlying information to either party
- Quick check: Validate that the computation produces correct results without either party learning the other's input

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: BISG Model -> Survey Sample -> Privacy Technologies (DP + Secure Computation) -> Probabilistic Estimates

Critical Path: The system flows from surname/geographic data through BISG modeling, calibration with survey data, application of privacy protections, and generation of final probabilistic estimates for fairness measurement.

Design Tradeoffs: The primary tradeoff is between accuracy and privacy - stronger privacy guarantees through differential privacy introduce noise that may reduce estimation precision. The probabilistic approach sacrifices individual-level certainty for group-level privacy protection.

Failure Signatures: 
- High cross-entropy values compared to baseline BISG indicate privacy noise is degrading model performance
- Skewed probability distributions suggest survey sample bias or insufficient geographic granularity
- Computation failures in secure protocols indicate implementation issues or resource constraints

Three First Experiments:
1. Run PPRE on a small, known dataset to verify that probabilistic outputs sum to 1 and produce reasonable distributions
2. Measure cross-entropy between PPRE outputs and ground truth on the survey sample to establish baseline performance
3. Test differential privacy implementation by varying epsilon values and measuring impact on estimate accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations

- Privacy mechanisms introduce accuracy trade-offs through inherent noise addition, with unclear impact on practical fairness measurement utility
- Reliance on a sparse LinkedIn survey sample raises concerns about representativeness and generalizability to broader U.S. population
- Secure two-party computation effectiveness and scalability implications are not independently verified or discussed
- Method is limited to U.S. members only, restricting applicability to other regions with different demographic distributions

## Confidence

High: The PPRE method architecture combining BISG, survey data, and privacy technologies is technically coherent and aligns with established approaches in the field.

Medium: Claims about enabling meaningful fairness measurements are supported by benchmarking results, but real-world impact requires further empirical validation across diverse use cases.

Low: The assertion about providing meaningful fairness measurements lacks specific thresholds or benchmarks for what constitutes meaningful without full dataset access.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a controlled experiment comparing fairness measurement outcomes using PPRE versus traditional BISG on the same dataset to quantify the impact of privacy-preserving modifications on measurement accuracy.

2. Perform external validation of the PPRE system using independent demographic datasets to assess generalizability beyond the LinkedIn survey sample and test robustness across different racial/ethnic group sizes.

3. Evaluate the computational performance and scalability of the secure two-party computation implementation under realistic load conditions to identify potential bottlenecks in production deployment.
