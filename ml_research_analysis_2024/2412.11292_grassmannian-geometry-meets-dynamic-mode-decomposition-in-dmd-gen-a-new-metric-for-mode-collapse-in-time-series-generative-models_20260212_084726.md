# Grassmannian Geometry Meets Dynamic Mode Decomposition in DMD-GEN: A New Metric for Mode Collapse in Time Series Generative Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2412.11292
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11292
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** DMD-GEN metric detects mode collapse in time series generative models by comparing DMD modes between real and generated data using optimal transport and Grassmannian geometry

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces DMD-GEN, a novel metric for detecting mode collapse in time series generative models. The key innovation is using Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to capture dynamic patterns and optimal transport between DMD eigenvectors to measure discrepancies between real and generated data. The metric offers improved interpretability by decomposing dynamics into distinct modes and requires no additional training, making it computationally efficient. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that DMD-GEN consistently aligns with established metrics while offering unique advantages for dynamic data analysis.

## Method Summary
DMD-GEN combines Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Grassmannian geometry to detect mode collapse in time series generative models. The method computes DMD modes from both real and generated time series data, extracts the k dominant temporal modes, and measures the discrepancy between these modes using optimal transport. The optimal transport problem is formulated with geodesic distances on the Grassmannian manifold as the cost matrix, allowing for an efficient and interpretable measure of mode collapse. The metric requires no additional training and can be computed directly from the outputs of generative models.

## Key Results
- DMD-GEN successfully detects mode collapse across multiple time series datasets (sine waves, stock prices, energy, ETTh)
- The metric demonstrates superior sensitivity and stability compared to benchmark metrics like Context-FID and Predictive Score
- DMD-GEN provides interpretable results by decomposing temporal dynamics into distinct modes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The metric works by capturing the temporal dynamics of time series data through DMD modes, which represent the dominant oscillatory patterns in the data. By comparing the subspaces spanned by these modes between real and generated data using optimal transport on the Grassmannian manifold, DMD-GEN measures how well the generative model preserves the essential dynamic structures. The use of principal angles between subspaces provides a geometrically meaningful distance measure, while optimal transport finds the optimal alignment between modes from different datasets.

## Foundational Learning
- **Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD):** A data-driven method to extract dynamic patterns from time series by computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors that represent temporal modes. Needed because traditional metrics don't capture temporal dynamics effectively. Quick check: Verify that DMD modes capture known periodic patterns in synthetic data.
- **Grassmannian Geometry:** The study of subspaces as points on a manifold, where distances between subspaces are measured using principal angles. Needed to provide a geometrically meaningful comparison between DMD mode subspaces. Quick check: Confirm that principal angles between orthogonal subspaces are zero and between identical subspaces are π/2.
- **Optimal Transport:** A mathematical framework for finding the optimal mapping between probability distributions. Needed to align DMD modes from real and generated data in a way that minimizes overall discrepancy. Quick check: Verify that optimal transport finds the correct matching in a simple 2x2 cost matrix scenario.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Time Series Data → DMD Mode Extraction → Principal Angle Computation → Optimal Transport Problem → DMD-GEN Score

**Critical Path:** The computation follows: (1) Extract DMD modes from real and generated data, (2) Compute principal angles between mode subspaces, (3) Formulate optimal transport problem with geodesic distances, (4) Solve using Sinkhorn's algorithm, (5) Return DMD-GEN score as the optimal transport cost.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The choice of k dominant modes balances computational efficiency with capturing sufficient dynamics. Using optimal transport provides flexibility in mode alignment but adds computational complexity compared to simple distance metrics. Grassmannian geometry offers geometric interpretability but requires careful handling of numerical stability.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor DMD mode extraction (due to insufficient data or noise) leads to unreliable metrics. Numerical instability in principal angle computation occurs when eigenvalues are close to zero or one. Suboptimal transport solutions may arise from poor cost matrix scaling or insufficient Sinkhorn iterations.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Compute DMD-GEN on synthetic data where ground truth mode collapse is introduced at known severity levels
2. Compare DMD-GEN scores with traditional metrics (FID, Context-FID) on the same generated samples
3. Visualize the principal angles and optimal transport mapping for interpretable analysis of mode collapse

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How would incorporating DMD-GEN into the training process of generative models for time series affect their performance compared to using traditional metrics?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors suggest future work could explore integrating DMD-GEN into the training process to potentially use it as a guiding metric to improve model training dynamically.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper only demonstrates DMD-GEN's effectiveness as an evaluation metric and doesn't test its impact on training.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments comparing models trained with DMD-GEN as a loss component versus traditional metrics, measuring both diversity and temporal pattern preservation.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can DMD-GEN detect subtle mode collapse in time series data that other metrics like Context-FID or Predictive Score miss?
- **Basis in paper:** The authors show DMD-GEN demonstrates superior sensitivity in mode collapse detection and is more stable across different levels of mode collapse severity compared to benchmark metrics.
- **Why unresolved:** While the paper shows DMD-GEN is more robust, it doesn't demonstrate cases where other metrics completely fail to detect mode collapse that DMD-GEN catches.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A systematic study where DMD-GEN successfully identifies mode collapse at various severity levels while other metrics fail, including visualizations of the temporal modes.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How does the choice of k (number of dominant modes) affect DMD-GEN's ability to detect mode collapse, and what is the optimal selection strategy?
- **Basis in paper:** DMD-GEN uses the k-largest eigenvalues to capture dominant temporal dynamics, but the paper doesn't explore sensitivity to this hyperparameter.
- **Why unresolved:** The authors use a fixed k value but don't analyze how different choices affect metric performance or provide guidance on selection.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments varying k across datasets showing how detection performance changes, and analysis of the trade-off between capturing sufficient dynamics and avoiding noise.

## Limitations
- The choice of k (number of dominant modes) is not optimized and may affect metric sensitivity
- Performance on highly non-stationary or stochastic time series where DMD assumptions may be violated is unverified
- Implementation details for optimal transport parameters are not fully specified

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies varying the number of DMD modes (k) to determine its optimal value for different data characteristics and assess sensitivity to this hyperparameter.

2. Test the metric's performance on highly non-stationary or stochastic time series where DMD assumptions may be violated to establish its limitations.

3. Perform runtime benchmarking comparing DMD-GEN with existing mode collapse metrics on identical hardware to verify computational efficiency claims.
