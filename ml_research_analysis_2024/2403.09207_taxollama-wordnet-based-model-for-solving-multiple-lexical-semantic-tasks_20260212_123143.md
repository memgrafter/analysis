# TaxoLLaMA: WordNet-based Model for Solving Multiple Lexical Semantic Tasks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.09207
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09207
- Reference count: 30
- Key outcome: State-of-the-art performance in 11 out of 16 lexical semantic tasks requiring taxonomic knowledge

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TaxoLLaMA, a lightweight LLM model fine-tuned on WordNet-3.0 for multiple lexical semantic tasks requiring taxonomic knowledge. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance in 11 out of 16 tasks and ranks second in 4 tasks, including strong zero-shot results in Lexical Entailment and Taxonomy Construction. TaxoLLaMA uses 4-bit quantization and LoRA adapters for efficiency, enabling inference on GPUs with less than 6GB of memory. The study demonstrates the model's effectiveness across Hypernym Discovery, Taxonomy Enrichment, Lexical Entailment, and Taxonomy Construction, with multilingual and domain adaptation capabilities via few-shot learning.

## Method Summary
TaxoLLaMA fine-tunes LLaMA-2-7b on WordNet-3.0 hypernym-hyponym pairs with definitions as context, learning to generate hypernyms given hyponyms. The model employs 4-bit quantization and LoRA adapters for efficiency, achieving 4.8GB memory usage for inference. Two approaches are used: generative (producing comma-separated hypernym lists) and ranking (using perplexity ratios for confidence scoring). The model is evaluated across four task categories: Hypernym Discovery, Taxonomy Enrichment, Lexical Entailment, and Taxonomy Construction, using both zero-shot and few-shot learning settings.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance in 11 out of 16 evaluated tasks
- Ranks second in 4 tasks, including strong zero-shot performance in Lexical Entailment
- Demonstrates effective multilingual and domain adaptation via few-shot learning
- Maintains high efficiency with 4-bit quantization enabling inference on <6GB GPUs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: WordNet-based instruction tuning transfers implicit lexical knowledge into explicit task capability.
- Mechanism: The model is fine-tuned on hypernym-hyponym pairs from WordNet with definitions as context, learning to generate hypernyms given hyponyms.
- Core assumption: LLM representations of lexical relations are structured enough to generalize across tasks requiring taxonomic knowledge.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "TaxoLLaMA, the fine-tuned version of the LLaMA-2-7b model [...] that is capable of solving tasks requiring taxonomic knowledge."
  - [section 3.1] "We apply the algorithm [...] focusing on hyponym-hypernym relationships only. We sample both nouns and verbs from the WordNet-3.0 graph."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence linking WordNet instruction tuning to task performance; relies on experimental results.
- Break condition: If the LLM lacks sufficient pre-training coverage of the lexical domain, instruction tuning will fail to transfer knowledge effectively.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Generative approach enables flexible adaptation to multiple lexical semantic tasks.
- Mechanism: The same model trained to generate hypernyms can be directly applied to Hypernym Discovery and Taxonomy Enrichment via simple input formatting.
- Core assumption: Hypernym generation is sufficiently general to serve as a building block for diverse taxonomic tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3] "We assume that Taxonomy-related tasks can be solved within two approaches from our pipeline."
  - [section 4.1] "We test our model on the Hypernym Discovery task [...] using our generative approach."
  - [corpus] Weak - no corpus evidence on generalizability; performance depends on fine-tuning results.
- Break condition: If task-specific formats require complex context or output structures beyond simple hypernym generation.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Ranking approach via perplexity scoring captures hypernymy confidence for taxonomy construction and lexical entailment.
- Mechanism: The model evaluates both hypernymy and hyponymy directions, using the perplexity ratio as confidence score for ranking.
- Core assumption: Lower perplexity indicates stronger semantic relation, and the ratio provides robust confidence measurement.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3] "We apply this approach for the Taxonomy Construction and Lexical Entailment datasets."
  - [section 5.4] "We utilized the ratio of hypernym and hyponym ranking score, normalized via the L2 norm to represent the probability of entailment."
  - [corpus] Weak - no corpus evidence on the validity of perplexity ratios as confidence scores.
- Break condition: If the model's perplexity scoring is inconsistent across semantic relations or domain-specific vocabularies.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Hypernymy and hyponymy relations in lexical semantics
  - Why needed here: The model's core capability is predicting hypernyms, so understanding these relations is fundamental to all tasks.
  - Quick check question: Given "dog" and "animal", which is the hypernym and which is the hyponym?

- Concept: Perplexity as a measure of language model confidence
  - Why needed here: Ranking tasks rely on perplexity ratios to determine semantic relationships.
  - Quick check question: If a model assigns perplexity 2.0 to "dog → animal" and 10.0 to "animal → dog", which direction indicates stronger hypernymy?

- Concept: Instruction tuning methodology
  - Why needed here: The model is fine-tuned using WordNet-based instructions, requiring understanding of how to structure training data.
  - Quick check question: What format should training examples follow when fine-tuning a model to generate hypernyms from hyponyms with definitions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Base model -> 4-bit quantized LLaMA-2-7b -> LoRA adapter for fine-tuning -> WordNet-based instruction training -> Generative or ranking output

- Critical path:
  1. Load quantized LLaMA-2-7b model
  2. Apply LoRA adapter for fine-tuning
  3. Process WordNet data into instruction format
  4. Fine-tune on hypernym prediction task
  5. Apply to downstream tasks via generative or ranking approach

- Design tradeoffs:
  - 4-bit quantization reduces memory usage (enables 4.8GB inference) but may reduce model capacity
  - LoRA adapters enable efficient fine-tuning but may limit adaptation to highly specialized domains
  - WordNet-only training ensures broad coverage but may miss domain-specific taxonomic nuances

- Failure signatures:
  - Overly broad predictions (>75% of errors) indicate model overfitting to general WordNet structure
  - Low performance on MAG datasets suggests domain adaptation challenges
  - Zero-shot multilingual underperformance reveals limitations in cross-lingual transfer

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Fine-tune on full WordNet-3.0 dataset and evaluate on Hypernym Discovery benchmark
  2. Apply fine-tuned model to Taxonomy Enrichment via generative approach
  3. Test ranking approach on Taxonomy Construction using perplexity ratios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does TaxoLLaMA's performance change when trained on a more diverse set of lexical semantic tasks beyond taxonomy-related ones?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on TaxoLLaMA's performance on taxonomy-related tasks, but does not explore its capabilities on other lexical semantic tasks.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any experimental results or analysis on TaxoLLaMA's performance on non-taxonomy tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training and evaluating TaxoLLaMA on a diverse set of lexical semantic tasks, such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or question answering, would provide insights into its generalizability and potential limitations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of using different base LLM models (e.g., GPT-3, PaLM) on TaxoLLaMA's performance and efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that TaxoLLaMA is fine-tuned on LLaMA-2-7b, but does not explore the use of other base LLM models.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any experimental results or analysis on the performance of TaxoLLaMA when trained on different base LLM models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training and evaluating TaxoLLaMA on different base LLM models, such as GPT-3 or PaLM, and comparing their performance and efficiency would provide insights into the impact of the base model choice.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does TaxoLLaMA's performance scale with increasing dataset size and complexity?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that TaxoLLaMA is fine-tuned on WordNet-3.0, but does not explore its performance on larger or more complex datasets.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any experimental results or analysis on TaxoLLaMA's performance when trained on datasets of varying sizes or complexities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training and evaluating TaxoLLaMA on datasets of increasing size and complexity, such as larger versions of WordNet or other lexical resources, would provide insights into its scalability and potential limitations.

## Limitations

- Lack of direct corpus evidence linking WordNet instruction tuning methodology to task performance
- Underspecified sampling strategy for WordNet edges during training set creation
- Reliance on assumed relationships between training methodology and downstream performance without mechanistic validation

## Confidence

**High Confidence** in claims about model architecture and implementation (4-bit quantization, LoRA adapters, task application approaches)

**Medium Confidence** in performance claims (11/16 tasks state-of-the-art, 4 second-place rankings)

**Low Confidence** in claims about fundamental mechanisms (WordNet instruction tuning transferring knowledge, generative approach flexibility, perplexity ranking validity)

## Next Checks

1. **Mechanism Validation**: Conduct controlled experiments comparing TaxoLLaMA performance on tasks with and without WordNet definitions as context, to isolate the contribution of definition-based instruction tuning versus raw hypernym-hyponym relationships.

2. **Perplexity Scoring Validation**: Systematically test the perplexity ratio approach across diverse semantic relations (not just hypernymy/hyponymy) to establish whether the confidence scoring generalizes beyond the training domain.

3. **Domain Adaptation Testing**: Evaluate TaxoLLaMA performance on specialized domain taxonomies (medical, legal, scientific) to quantify the gap between general WordNet coverage and domain-specific requirements, and assess few-shot adaptation effectiveness.
