# Saliency-Based diversity and fairness Metric and FaceKeepOriginalAugment: A Novel Approach for Enhancing Fairness and Diversity

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.00831
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00831
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces FaceKeepOriginalAugment to reduce bias and enhance diversity in computer vision models, achieving up to 21x reduction in gender bias compared to baseline models.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces FaceKeepOriginalAugment, an advanced data augmentation technique that enhances diversity and fairness in computer vision models by strategically combining salient and non-salient regions of images. The method leverages saliency detection to identify key features and applies various augmentation strategies to improve dataset diversity without losing critical information. A novel Saliency-Based Diversity and Fairness Metric is also proposed to quantify both within-group diversity and inter-group fairness, effectively handling data imbalance. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate significant improvements in dataset diversity and reductions in gender bias, with the augment both strategy yielding optimal results.

## Method Summary
FaceKeepOriginalAugment is a data augmentation technique that detects salient regions in images and strategically places them in non-salient regions using Min-Area, Max-Area, or Random-Area strategies. Augmentation is applied to either the salient region, non-salient region, or both, preserving feature fidelity while introducing variation. The method uses OpenCV-based saliency detection and VGG16 for feature extraction. The Saliency-Based Diversity and Fairness Metric normalizes feature vectors and computes weighted Euclidean distances within and between groups to measure diversity and fairness, accounting for data imbalance.

## Key Results
- FaceKeepOriginalAugment achieves significant improvements in dataset diversity across multiple datasets, including FFHQ, WIKI, IMDB, LFW, and UTK Faces.
- The method reduces gender bias by 4 to 21 times compared to baseline models, as measured by the Image-Image Association Score (IIAS).
- The augment both strategy, which applies augmentation to both salient and non-salient regions separately, yields optimal diversity and debiasing effects.
- The Saliency-Based Diversity and Fairness Metric effectively quantifies diversity and fairness while handling data imbalance across various datasets.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: FaceKeepOriginalAugment reduces bias by strategically combining salient and non-salient regions to increase dataset diversity without losing key information.
- Mechanism: The method detects salient regions (e.g., faces, key features) using a saliency detection technique, then resizes and places these regions in non-salient areas using strategies like Min-Area, Max-Area, or Random-Area. Augmentation is applied to either the salient region, non-salient region, or both, preserving feature fidelity while introducing variation.
- Core assumption: Salient regions carry most of the discriminative information for classification; redistributing them into non-salient areas diversifies the dataset without losing key features.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This approach addresses issues like overfitting and domain shift found in previous techniques."
  - [section] "Our choice of this method is inspired by recent research [48], which thoroughly investigated different saliency detection methods for data augmentation."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence: The corpus includes related papers on saliency-based augmentation and bias mitigation, but does not directly confirm this specific mechanism.
- Break condition: If saliency detection fails to accurately identify key features, or if resizing distorts critical information, the augmentation may introduce noise or lose important data, reducing model performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The novel Saliency-Based Diversity and Fairness Metric quantifies both within-group diversity and inter-group fairness, addressing data imbalance.
- Mechanism: The metric normalizes feature vectors extracted from saliency-detected images, then computes Euclidean distances within and between groups (e.g., male vs. female). It weights these distances by group size to ensure minority groups contribute fairly to the final score.
- Core assumption: Normalized Euclidean distances in saliency-based feature space accurately reflect diversity and fairness across groups.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Additionally, we introduce a novel metric, Saliency-Based Diversity and Fairness Metric, which quantifies both diversity and fairness while handling data imbalance across various datasets."
  - [section] "The final metric, which combines both diversity within groups and diversity across groups, is given in equation. 4."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence: The corpus mentions related fairness metrics but does not confirm the specific design or effectiveness of this saliency-based approach.
- Break condition: If the saliency detection or feature extraction step introduces bias, or if the weighting scheme fails to account for extreme imbalances, the metric may misrepresent true diversity and fairness.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The augment both strategy (augmenting salient and non-salient regions separately, then combining) yields optimal diversity and debiasing effects.
- Mechanism: Separate augmentations on salient and non-salient regions introduce complementary variations, preventing overfitting from repeated salient features and avoiding domain shift from mixing regions.
- Core assumption: Independent augmentation of salient and non-salient regions introduces more diverse transformations than augmenting them jointly or individually.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We observed that the augment both strategy demonstrates greater diversity across various computer vision tasks... the augment both strategy enhances diversity, making it particularly effective for debiasing."
  - [section] "Our analysis revealed that the augmentation both strategy with the random area strategy yielded the optimal scores in both metrics."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence: The corpus includes related augmentation strategies but does not confirm the specific effectiveness of the augment both approach.
- Break condition: If the combined augmented regions introduce conflicting or unrealistic features, or if the augmentation operations are not well-matched, the strategy may reduce rather than increase diversity.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Saliency detection and feature extraction
  - Why needed here: Accurate identification and representation of salient regions is foundational to both the augmentation method and the diversity/fairness metric.
  - Quick check question: What feature extraction method is used to obtain feature vectors for the Saliency-Based Diversity and Fairness Metric?
- Concept: Data augmentation and bias mitigation
  - Why needed here: Understanding how augmentation strategies affect bias and diversity is key to designing and evaluating FaceKeepOriginalAugment.
  - Quick check question: What are the three strategies for placing the salient region in FaceKeepOriginalAugment?
- Concept: Fairness metrics and data imbalance
  - Why needed here: The proposed metric explicitly handles imbalanced datasets; understanding how it weights group contributions is essential.
  - Quick check question: How does the Saliency-Based Diversity and Fairness Metric ensure that minority groups are fairly represented in the final score?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Saliency detection -> Region selection and resizing -> Augmentation -> Feature extraction -> Diversity/fairness evaluation
- Critical path:
  1. Detect salient region in input image
  2. Choose placement strategy and resize salient region
  3. Apply augmentation (augment both strategy)
  4. Combine regions and generate augmented image
  5. Extract features for diversity/fairness evaluation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Saliency detection accuracy vs. computational cost
  - Resizing distortion vs. preservation of key features
  - Augmentation strength vs. risk of unrealistic features
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor saliency detection leading to loss of key information
  - Excessive resizing causing feature distortion
  - Augmentation producing unrealistic or conflicting features
  - Metric misestimating diversity/fairness due to feature extraction issues
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test saliency detection on a diverse set of images and verify key features are preserved after resizing.
  2. Compare diversity scores (ISS) for each placement and augmentation strategy on a benchmark dataset.
  3. Evaluate gender bias reduction (IIAS) for CNNs and ViTs using the augment both strategy with random area placement.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How does the placement strategy of salient regions (Min-Area, Max-Area, Random-Area) specifically affect the performance of FaceKeepOriginalAugment across different datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses different strategies for determining the placement of the salient region within non-salient regions and their potential impact on dataset diversity.
- Why unresolved: While the paper mentions these strategies, it does not provide detailed comparative results on their effectiveness across various datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments to compare the performance of each placement strategy on different datasets, analyzing metrics like ISS and IIAS for each strategy.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the long-term impact of using FaceKeepOriginalAugment on the generalization ability of models across diverse and unseen datasets?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates the method on specific datasets but does not address its effectiveness on datasets not included in the study.
- Why unresolved: The experiments focus on predefined datasets, and there is no mention of testing on entirely new or unseen datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the models trained with FaceKeepOriginalAugment on entirely new datasets to assess generalization capabilities and robustness.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the Saliency-Based Diversity and Fairness Metric handle extreme class imbalance, and what are its limitations in such scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces a novel metric designed to handle data imbalance while maintaining fairness and diversity across groups.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific case studies or results demonstrating the metric's performance in extreme imbalance scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with datasets exhibiting extreme class imbalance to evaluate the metric's effectiveness and identify any limitations or areas for improvement.

## Limitations
- The exact implementation details of the saliency detection method and RandAugment parameters are not specified, which may affect reproducibility.
- The corpus provides weak evidence for the specific effectiveness of the FaceKeepOriginalAugment method and the Saliency-Based Diversity and Fairness Metric.
- There is no explicit validation of the metric's sensitivity to different types of bias or its robustness to extreme data imbalances.

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The general approach of using saliency-based data augmentation to improve diversity and reduce bias is well-supported by prior work.
- **Medium confidence**: The specific effectiveness of the augment both strategy and the novel metric's ability to handle data imbalance are supported by experimental results but lack strong external validation.
- **Low confidence**: The claim that saliency detection accurately identifies key features in all cases is not universally validated, especially for diverse or challenging datasets.

## Next Checks

1. **Saliency Detection Validation**: Test the saliency detection method on a diverse set of images to ensure key features are consistently identified and preserved after resizing.
2. **Metric Robustness Testing**: Evaluate the Saliency-Based Diversity and Fairness Metric on datasets with known imbalances and biases to confirm its sensitivity and accuracy.
3. **Augmentation Strategy Comparison**: Conduct ablation studies comparing the augment both strategy with other augmentation approaches on multiple datasets to verify its superiority in enhancing diversity and reducing bias.
