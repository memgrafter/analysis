# Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning: A Comprehensive Analysis Across Applications

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.13506
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13506
- Reference count: 10
- Primary result: PEFT achieves parameter reductions of 0.022-16.66% while matching or exceeding full fine-tuning accuracy across multiple domains

## Executive Summary
This survey comprehensively reviews Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods across diverse applications including commonsense reasoning, video-text understanding, medical imaging, protein modeling, code review/generation, 3D models, and speech synthesis. The review demonstrates that PEFT techniques can significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters while maintaining or improving performance compared to traditional full fine-tuning approaches. The survey identifies key methods such as LoRA, adapters, and prefix tuning, providing a systematic analysis of their effectiveness across different domains.

## Method Summary
The survey synthesizes findings from multiple studies examining PEFT methods across various applications. It analyzes how different techniques like LoRA, adapters, and prefix tuning achieve parameter efficiency while maintaining or improving model performance. The review examines implementation details, evaluation metrics, and comparative results across domains, highlighting both the effectiveness and limitations of these approaches. The analysis focuses on the trade-off between parameter reduction and performance maintenance, identifying conditions under which PEFT methods are most effective.

## Key Results
- PEFT techniques achieve parameter reductions ranging from 0.022% to 16.66% across applications
- Performance matches or exceeds full fine-tuning accuracy in most evaluated tasks
- Different PEFT methods (LoRA, adapters, prefix tuning) show varying effectiveness across domains
- Significant efficiency gains without substantial performance degradation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
PEFT methods work by modifying a small subset of model parameters while keeping the majority of the original model weights frozen. LoRA achieves this through low-rank matrix decomposition, adapters insert small trainable modules between layers, and prefix tuning uses task-specific prompts. These approaches reduce computational overhead during training while preserving the knowledge encoded in the pre-trained model, allowing for efficient adaptation to new tasks without catastrophic forgetting of existing capabilities.

## Foundational Learning
- Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT): Why needed - reduces computational cost and memory requirements; Quick check - verify parameter count reduction vs performance
- LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation): Why needed - enables efficient adaptation through low-rank matrix decomposition; Quick check - confirm rank parameter selection impact
- Adapters: Why needed - modular approach for task-specific adaptation without modifying base model; Quick check - verify adapter layer placement effect
- Prefix Tuning: Why needed - allows task-specific conditioning without modifying model weights; Quick check - assess prompt length vs performance trade-off
- Full Fine-Tuning vs PEFT: Why needed - establishes baseline for comparison and efficiency gains; Quick check - measure parameter count and performance differential

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Input -> Base Model -> PEFT Layer (LoRA/Adapter/Prefix) -> Output

Critical Path:
1. Input processing through base model
2. PEFT layer adaptation
3. Task-specific output generation

Design Tradeoffs:
- Parameter reduction vs performance maintenance
- Training efficiency vs fine-tuning flexibility
- Model complexity vs inference speed

Failure Signatures:
- Performance degradation when task complexity exceeds PEFT capacity
- Convergence issues with improper hyperparameter selection
- Generalization problems when PEFT layer is insufficient for task adaptation

First Experiments:
1. Baseline comparison of full fine-tuning vs PEFT on standard benchmark task
2. Ablation study of different PEFT methods on same task
3. Transfer learning evaluation across related tasks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How to determine optimal PEFT method selection for specific task types and domains
- Impact of PEFT on long-term model performance and potential catastrophic forgetting
- Scalability of PEFT methods to larger, more complex model architectures
- Generalization capabilities of PEFT models across diverse and unseen tasks
- Computational overhead of PEFT during inference compared to full fine-tuning

## Limitations
- Coverage may not capture all emerging PEFT techniques or domain-specific variations
- Parameter reduction percentages are highly application-dependent and may not generalize uniformly
- Performance comparisons vary based on experimental protocols and evaluation metrics
- Limited analysis of PEFT effectiveness on extremely large-scale models
- Insufficient discussion of potential negative impacts on model interpretability and explainability

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: General effectiveness of PEFT in reducing trainable parameters while maintaining performance across multiple domains
- **Medium confidence**: Specific parameter reduction percentages and performance improvements are context-dependent
- **Medium confidence**: Identification of key challenges (data scarcity, generalizability) is supported by literature

## Next Checks
1. Conduct controlled experiments comparing PEFT methods (LoRA, adapters, prefix tuning) on identical tasks using standardized datasets and evaluation protocols
2. Perform ablation studies to quantify the contribution of individual components in PEFT methods across different application domains
3. Evaluate the transferability of PEFT models trained on one dataset/task to related tasks to assess generalizability claims
