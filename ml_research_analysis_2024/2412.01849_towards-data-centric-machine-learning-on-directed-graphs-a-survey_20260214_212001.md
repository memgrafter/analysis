- This paper provides the first comprehensive survey on data-centric machine learning for directed graphs, filling a critical gap in the field.

## Executive Summary
This survey addresses a significant gap in graph machine learning research by focusing on data-centric approaches for directed graphs. Unlike traditional model-centric methods, it emphasizes the importance of understanding and improving graph data quality to enhance model performance. The paper systematically categorizes directed graph neural networks (GNNs) into three main frameworks: message-passing, eigenpolynomial-based, and sequence-based approaches, providing a comprehensive taxonomy for the field.

The survey explores various techniques for topological and node feature enhancement across different graph types including directed multigraphs, acyclic graphs, and augmented graphs. It reviews diverse industrial applications spanning over 10 domains, from phishing detection to drug-drug interaction networks. The paper concludes by identifying key research opportunities and challenges for future work, emphasizing the need for scalable, robust, and interpretable directed GNN models to advance both academic and industrial applications.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a systematic literature review methodology to comprehensively analyze data-centric machine learning approaches for directed graphs. The authors collected and categorized 25 relevant papers, organizing them according to their proposed taxonomy of directed GNN frameworks. The review process involved identifying key techniques for topological and node feature enhancement, examining their applications across different graph types, and synthesizing findings into a coherent framework that bridges the gap between data quality and model performance.

## Key Results
- Introduces a novel taxonomy for directed GNNs, categorizing them into message-passing, eigenpolynomial-based, and sequence-based approaches
- Provides comprehensive coverage of data quality improvement techniques from topological, spectral, and sequential perspectives
- Reviews diverse industrial applications across 10+ domains including phishing detection, traffic flow prediction, and drug-drug interaction networks
- Identifies critical research opportunities and challenges for advancing directed graph machine learning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper's approach works by recognizing that graph data quality fundamentally impacts model performance in directed graph learning. By focusing on data-centric improvements rather than solely model architecture modifications, it addresses the root causes of performance limitations. The systematic categorization of methods into three distinct frameworks (message-passing, eigenpolynomial-based, and sequence-based) provides a clear conceptual structure that helps researchers understand the landscape of directed GNN approaches and identify appropriate techniques for specific problems.

## Foundational Learning
**Directed Graph Neural Networks**: Neural networks designed to handle directed graph structures where edge direction matters for information propagation. Needed to capture asymmetric relationships in data; quick check: verify edge directionality affects message passing in implementations.

**Message-Passing Frameworks**: Methods where node representations are updated by aggregating messages from neighbors. Essential for capturing local graph structure; quick check: confirm aggregation functions preserve directional information.

**Eigenpolynomial-based Methods**: Approaches leveraging spectral graph theory and eigen-decompositions for graph representation learning. Important for global structural understanding; quick check: verify spectral properties are preserved during transformations.

**Sequence-based Approaches**: Techniques treating graph structures as sequences for processing. Useful for capturing temporal or ordered relationships; quick check: ensure sequence ordering reflects graph topology.

**Topological Enhancement**: Methods for improving graph structure quality through augmentation, pruning, or transformation. Critical for robust learning; quick check: validate enhancement preserves meaningful graph properties.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Quality Assessment -> Enhancement Techniques -> Directed GNN Framework -> Application Domain

**Critical Path**: The survey identifies that improving graph data quality (through topological and feature enhancement) is the critical path to achieving better model performance, rather than solely focusing on model architecture improvements.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The paper highlights tradeoffs between computational complexity of enhancement techniques versus performance gains, and between preserving original graph structure versus applying aggressive augmentation methods.

**Failure Signatures**: Common failure modes include over-smoothing in message-passing approaches, spectral instability in eigenpolynomial methods, and loss of structural information in sequence-based approaches when enhancement techniques are not properly applied.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Apply topological enhancement techniques to a standard directed graph dataset and measure performance improvements in node classification tasks
2. Compare message-passing and eigenpolynomial-based approaches on directed acyclic graphs to understand their relative strengths
3. Implement a sequence-based approach on temporal graph data and evaluate how well it captures directional relationships

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None provided in the source material.

## Limitations
- Focuses primarily on node-level data quality issues with limited discussion of higher-level graph structure and relational integrity concerns
- Some methods may span multiple categories in the taxonomy, creating potential classification ambiguities
- Evaluation of "data-centric" approaches is somewhat subjective due to lack of standardized metrics for measuring data quality improvements

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The comprehensive coverage of directed GNN frameworks (message-passing, eigenpolynomial-based, sequence-based) and their categorization

**Medium confidence**: The survey's treatment of industrial applications, as some domain-specific implementations may not be fully representative of current practice

**Medium confidence**: The identified research opportunities and challenges, which represent reasonable projections but may not capture all emerging directions

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a citation analysis of the 25 related papers identified to verify the survey's claim of comprehensiveness and identify any potentially overlooked key contributions

2. Perform a systematic review of benchmark datasets and evaluation protocols used for directed GNNs to assess whether current practices adequately capture data quality considerations

3. Survey leading researchers in the field to validate the proposed taxonomy and identify any missing methodological approaches or application domains
