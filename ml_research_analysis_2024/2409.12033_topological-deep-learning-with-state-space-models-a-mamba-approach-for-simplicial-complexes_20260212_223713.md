# Topological Deep Learning with State-Space Models: A Mamba Approach for Simplicial Complexes

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.12033
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12033
- Reference count: 40
- TopoMamba achieves 86.50% accuracy on Cora dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art models

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces TopoMamba, a novel architecture for processing simplicial complexes that combines state-space models with topological deep learning. The key innovation is using Mamba to process sequences constructed from neighboring cells ordered by rank, enabling direct communication between cells of different ranks without complex higher-order message-passing schemas. The approach is validated across multiple datasets, showing either superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art models while being significantly faster.

## Method Summary
TopoMamba processes simplicial complexes by first converting graph datasets to simplicial complexes using clique lifting. For each node, it constructs sequences by aggregating representations of neighboring cells ordered by rank, then processes these sequences through Mamba blocks. The model uses a node incidence matrix to enable efficient batching, allowing neighborhood sampling algorithms from graph neural networks to be directly applied. A feature encoder transforms input features, Mamba blocks process the sequences, and a task head produces final predictions for node classification or regression tasks.

## Key Results
- Achieves 86.50% accuracy on Cora dataset versus 85.58% for SCCNN
- Demonstrates 1.5x faster training times compared to state-of-the-art models
- Shows robust performance across multiple datasets (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, Minesweeper, Amazon Ratings, US-county-demos)
- Ablation study reveals benefits from skip connections when increasing layers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The model achieves direct communication between cells of different ranks by ordering neighboring cells by rank and processing them as sequences.
- Mechanism: By constructing sequences of neighboring cells ordered by their rank and passing them through Mamba, the model allows earlier elements in the sequence to influence later ones. This creates a directional flow of information from higher-order cells to lower-order cells (and vice versa in the inverse sequence), enabling direct interaction across ranks in a single step.
- Core assumption: The Mamba model's inherent sequence processing capabilities can effectively capture the hierarchical relationships between cells of different ranks when they are ordered appropriately.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our approach generates sequences for the nodes based on the neighboring cells, enabling direct communication between all higher-order structures, regardless of their rank."
  - [section 4.1] "This equation demonstrates how cells of different ranks can directly influence one another. In sequential models, earlier elements in a sequence affect those that follow."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The node incidence matrix enables efficient batching by allowing neighborhood sampling algorithms from graph neural networks to be directly applied.
- Mechanism: The node incidence matrix B* captures the relationship between nodes and all higher-order structures in a single matrix. This allows existing graph-based neighborhood sampling techniques to be used, ensuring that all cells belonging to higher-order structures adjacent to a node are included when sampling.
- Core assumption: The node incidence matrix adequately represents the neighborhood structure of simplicial complexes in a way that is compatible with graph-based sampling algorithms.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.2] "By utilizing the node incidence matrix, we can directly apply existing neighborhood sampling algorithms developed for graphs to our model."
  - [section 4.2] "This method is efficient because it relies on a single incidence matrix and enables the use of well-optimized, graph-based libraries."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The Mamba model's ability to handle long-range dependencies makes it well-suited for capturing complex relationships in topological structures.
- Mechanism: Mamba's selective state spaces allow it to dynamically adapt parameters based on input data and efficiently model long sequences. This enables the model to capture complex dependencies between cells that may be far apart in the topological structure.
- Core assumption: The long-range dependency modeling capabilities of Mamba are beneficial for understanding the complex relationships inherent in simplicial complexes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The paper demonstrates that Mamba's ability to handle long-range dependencies makes it well-suited for capturing complex relationships in topological structures"
  - [section 2] "State Space Models (SSMs) have proven to be effective for sequence modeling and have recently been adapted for graph data by encoding the neighborhood of a node as a sequence"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Simplicial Complexes and Topological Deep Learning
  - Why needed here: Understanding the structure of simplicial complexes and how they differ from graphs is crucial for grasping why traditional GNNs are insufficient and why TDL is necessary.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between a graph and a simplicial complex, and why does this difference matter for modeling complex systems?

- Concept: Message Passing and its Limitations
  - Why needed here: Recognizing the limitations of traditional message-passing GNNs in capturing higher-order interactions is essential for understanding the motivation behind this work.
  - Quick check question: What is the main limitation of message-passing GNNs when it comes to modeling systems with n-body relations?

- Concept: State Space Models and Mamba
  - Why needed here: Understanding how SSMs, particularly Mamba, work and why they are effective for sequence modeling is key to grasping the core innovation of this approach.
  - Quick check question: How do State Space Models differ from traditional recurrent neural networks, and what advantage does Mamba have over other SSMs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Feature Encoder -> Mamba Block (sequence construction, Mamba processing, aggregation) -> Task Head
- Critical path: Feature Encoder → Mamba Block (sequence construction, Mamba processing, aggregation) → Task Head
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using Mamba instead of traditional message-passing allows for direct communication between cells of different ranks but requires constructing appropriate sequences
  - The node incidence matrix enables efficient batching but may not capture all complex neighborhood relationships
  - The AGG function choice (sum in this case) affects the model's expressive power
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on datasets with very long chains or simple graph structures (like the Roman dataset mentioned)
  - Memory issues when dealing with simplicial complexes with large cliques
  - Ineffective batching leading to slow training or memory overflow
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare TopoMamba's performance on a simple graph dataset (like Cora) against traditional GNNs to verify it captures at least as much information
  2. Test the batching efficiency by comparing training times and memory usage on a medium-sized dataset with and without batching
  3. Evaluate the impact of the AGG function choice by comparing performance using sum, mean, and max aggregation on a dataset with varying cell sizes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the text provided.

## Limitations
- The node incidence matrix batching approach may not scale efficiently to extremely large simplicial complexes with dense connectivity patterns
- The method assumes that ordering cells by rank preserves meaningful hierarchical relationships, which may not hold for all types of topological structures
- The performance on certain datasets (like Roman) suggests the model may struggle with simple graph structures or very long chains

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The core architectural claims about Mamba's effectiveness for sequence modeling and the node incidence matrix batching strategy
- Medium Confidence: The generalizability of results across different topological domains and the robustness of the model to architectural changes
- Medium Confidence: The comparative performance claims against state-of-the-art models, given that exact hyperparameter configurations are not fully specified

## Next Checks
1. Test the model's performance on additional graph datasets (e.g., Citeseer, Pubmed) to verify the claimed robustness and generalizability across different domains
2. Conduct a more extensive ablation study varying the AGG function (sum, mean, max) and sequence construction strategies to identify the most critical architectural components
3. Evaluate the memory efficiency and training time of the node incidence matrix batching approach on increasingly large simplicial complexes to determine its practical scalability limits
