# ReACT: Reinforcement Learning for Controller Parametrization using B-Spline Geometries

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.05251
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05251
- Authors: Thomas Rudolf; Daniel Flögel; Tobias Schürmann; Simon Süß; Stefan Schwab; Sören Hohmann
- Reference count: 20
- Key outcome: Novel DRL approach for efficient controller parametrization using B-spline geometries, outperforming baseline algorithms in convergence speed and control performance on parameter-varying systems.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ReACT, a deep reinforcement learning method for automated controller parametrization of parameter-varying systems. The approach uses B-spline geometries to efficiently represent high-dimensional controller parameter spaces and incorporates actor regularizations to improve robustness. The ReACT agent autonomously adapts controller parameters based on closed-loop system observations to optimize control performance. Experiments on a parameter-varying first-order plus dead time system demonstrate faster convergence and lower variance compared to baseline DRL algorithms, with improved tracking performance under varying operating conditions.

## Method Summary
The method formulates controller parametrization as a Markov Decision Process, where the agent observes closed-loop system signals and operating conditions, then outputs incremental adjustments to B-spline control points that define controller parameters. An LSTM encoder processes time-series observations into a latent state, which feeds into an actor-critic TQC network. The agent is trained using a reward function combining tracking performance, action penalties, and self-competition rewards. B-spline geometries enable efficient representation of parameter dependencies across operating conditions, while actor regularizations (dropout and layer normalization) improve robustness.

## Key Results
- ReACT agent outperformed baseline DRL algorithms on parameter-varying FOPDT system
- Faster convergence and lower variance in control performance achieved
- Learned policy successfully adapted controller parameters to varying operating conditions
- Improved tracking performance compared to baseline parametrization methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: B-spline geometries reduce the effective dimensionality of the parameter space while preserving continuity across operating points.
- Mechanism: By structuring controller gains as CPs of B-spline surfaces, the agent only needs to adapt a sparse set of CPs rather than a full high-resolution lookup table. The B-spline basis functions ensure smooth interpolation across the parameter space.
- Core assumption: The true controller parameter mapping is smooth enough to be well-approximated by B-spline surfaces.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We make the adaptation process more efficient by introducing BSGs to map the controller parameters which may depend on numerous operating conditions."
  - [section III] "To reduce the parameter search-space dimension, we use B-spline CPs which efficiently approximate the controller parameter mappings ϕl."
- Break condition: If the controller parameter dependencies exhibit sharp discontinuities or highly localized features, the B-spline approximation error becomes prohibitive.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Actor regularization via dropout and layer normalization improves policy robustness in closed-loop deployment.
- Mechanism: Dropout layers during training force the actor network to learn redundant, noise-tolerant representations. Layer normalization stabilizes gradient flow, reducing variance in learned Q-values and policy gradients.
- Core assumption: The trained policy will face environmental disturbances not seen during training (e.g., sensor noise, model mismatch).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we apply dropout layer normalization to the actor and critic networks... to improve training under high variance."
  - [section III] "We propose to apply the dropout Q-function (DroQ) network regularization from [10] by dropout and layer normalization... to the actor A."
- Break condition: If the environment is deterministic and perfectly matched to the training setup, the added regularization may slow convergence without performance benefit.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Self-competition reward encourages continual policy improvement by preventing premature convergence.
- Mechanism: The agent receives a reward only if its current performance exceeds the EMA of past performances, pushing it to explore beyond previously discovered good policies.
- Core assumption: There exists a policy space with progressively better performance than any single fixed policy baseline.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section III] "We discourage parameter oscillations by penalizing unnecessary actions... and apply a self-competition reward: rsc = 1 if rJ > EMA(r̄J) else 0."
  - [abstract] "This encourages the ReACT agent to improve continuously."
- Break condition: If the policy performance plateaus at a local optimum with no accessible better policies, the self-competition reward becomes zero, halting further learning.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Markov Decision Process formulation of controller parametrization
  - Why needed here: The sequential nature of parameter adaptation and the need for reward-based learning require a formal decision-making framework.
  - Quick check question: What is the state space in this MDP? (Answer: Observations including control signals, system outputs, and operating conditions)

- Concept: B-spline basis functions and knot vectors
  - Why needed here: Understanding how B-spline surfaces interpolate CPs is critical for designing the agent's action space and interpreting adaptation results.
  - Quick check question: How does changing a single CP affect the entire B-spline surface? (Answer: It affects only the local region due to the compact support of basis functions)

- Concept: Actor-critic RL algorithm structure
  - Why needed here: The agent must balance exploration (actor) with value estimation (critic) to efficiently learn parametrization strategies.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the entropy term in soft actor-critic? (Answer: Encourages exploration by penalizing deterministic policies)

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Environment: Closed-loop simulation with parameter-varying plant
  - Agent: LSTM encoder → latent state → actor-critic TQC network
  - B-spline interface: CP grids as actor outputs, B-spline surfaces as parameter mappings

- Critical path:
  1. LSTM processes time-series observations into latent state z
  2. Actor network outputs CP adjustments (actions)
  3. B-spline surfaces evaluate new controller parameters
  4. System runs with updated parameters, produces new observations
  5. Reward is computed from tracking performance
  6. TQC critic updates Q-value estimates, actor updates policy

- Design tradeoffs:
  - B-spline degree vs. surface smoothness: Higher degree allows more complex surfaces but increases sensitivity to CP changes
  - CP grid density vs. sample efficiency: Finer grids better approximate parameter space but require more training samples
  - Dropout rate vs. training stability: Higher dropout improves robustness but may slow convergence

- Failure signatures:
  - High variance in episode rewards during training: May indicate insufficient regularization or unstable B-spline parameterization
  - B-spline CPs oscillating without convergence: Suggests reward shaping issues or inappropriate action scaling
  - Poor tracking performance despite policy convergence: Could indicate B-spline approximation error or reward function misalignment

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify B-spline surface interpolation: Fix CPs to known values, evaluate surface at test points, confirm smooth transitions
  2. Validate reward shaping: Run agent with only rJ term, observe if it converges; then add regularization terms incrementally
  3. Test LSTM feature extraction: Disable actor/critic, train LSTM to reconstruct input signals from latent state, verify information preservation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the ReACT approach scale to higher-dimensional parameter spaces with more complex dependencies on operating conditions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state "BSGs with N ≥ 3 can be used [14]" and mention future work to leverage the flexibility of BSGs for higher-dimensional parameter spaces.
- Why unresolved: The paper only demonstrates the approach on a 2D parameter space (proportional and integral gains). The effectiveness and limitations of ReACT for higher-dimensional spaces remain untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying ReACT to systems with 3+ dimensional parameter spaces, showing convergence rates, control performance, and computational requirements compared to lower-dimensional cases.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the inclusion of dropout regularization in the actor network affect the stability and robustness of the closed-loop control system during real-world deployment?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors propose applying dropout and layer normalization to the actor network "to improve the agent's learning and inference behavior for a successful transition toward real-world applications."
- Why unresolved: The paper evaluates the approach in simulation only. The impact of actor regularization on system stability under real-world disturbances, sensor noise, and model uncertainties is not demonstrated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Hardware-in-the-loop or field tests showing the closed-loop system's response to disturbances with and without actor regularization, measuring metrics like overshoot, settling time, and controller gain variations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the training process incorporate stability constraints to ensure the learned controller parameters always produce a stable closed-loop system?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors mention that "traditional stability analysis can be applied on plant approximations together with the known fixed-structure control law" but note this could be implemented as a verification step. They also suggest "the control system stability or robustness may already be considered during the training process."
- Why unresolved: The current approach optimizes control performance without explicit stability guarantees. Incorporating stability constraints into the reward function or training process is not explored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing ReACT with and without stability constraints in the reward function, showing whether the constrained approach produces more stable controllers and how it affects control performance.

## Limitations
- Limited empirical validation - only one test system evaluated
- No discussion of scalability to higher-dimensional parameter spaces
- Missing analysis of computational overhead for training and deployment

## Confidence
- **Medium**: The evaluation is limited to a single parameter-varying FOPDT system, which may not generalize to more complex industrial systems
- **Low**: The paper lacks comparison with established controller parametrization methods beyond baseline DRL algorithms
- **Low**: The computational requirements and training time for the ReACT agent are not discussed, which is critical for industrial adoption

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-domain validation**: Test ReACT on at least two additional parameter-varying systems (e.g., aircraft control, robotic manipulator) to assess generalizability
2. **Baseline comparison**: Implement and compare against traditional gain-scheduling methods (e.g., linear interpolation, polynomial fitting) on the same test systems
3. **Computational profiling**: Measure training time, memory requirements, and inference latency across different B-spline resolutions to evaluate industrial feasibility
