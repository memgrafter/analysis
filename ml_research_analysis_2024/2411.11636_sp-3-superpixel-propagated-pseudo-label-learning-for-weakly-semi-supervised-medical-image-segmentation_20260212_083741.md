# SP${ }^3$ : Superpixel-propagated pseudo-label learning for weakly semi-supervised medical image segmentation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.11636
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11636
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves ~80% Dice score with only 3% annotation workload in weakly semi-supervised medical image segmentation

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of medical image segmentation with limited annotations by proposing a superpixel-propagated pseudo-label (SP$^3$) learning method for weakly semi-supervised segmentation. The core idea is to use superpixels to propagate scribble annotations and refine pseudo-labels, addressing insufficient supervision and noisy pseudo-labels. Specifically, the method expands scribbles using superpixel-based propagation, filters high-quality superpixels with dynamic thresholding, and incorporates superpixel-level uncertainty to guide pseudo-label supervision. The SP$^3$ method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both tumor and organ segmentation datasets under weakly semi-supervised settings, using only 3% of the annotation workload compared to fully supervised methods and attaining approximately 80% Dice score. The method also outperforms eight other weakly and semi-supervised methods under both weakly supervised and semi-supervised settings.

## Method Summary
The SP$^3$ method introduces a novel approach for weakly semi-supervised medical image segmentation by leveraging superpixel-based annotation propagation. The method begins by expanding scribble annotations using superpixel-based propagation, where scribbles are extended to encompass entire superpixels. High-quality superpixels are then filtered using a dynamic thresholding mechanism that evaluates the confidence of pseudo-labels within each superpixel. Additionally, superpixel-level uncertainty is incorporated to guide the supervision of pseudo-labels, ensuring that regions with higher uncertainty receive appropriate attention during training. This approach effectively addresses the challenges of insufficient supervision and noisy pseudo-labels, leading to improved segmentation performance.

## Key Results
- Achieves approximately 80% Dice score with only 3% annotation workload
- Outperforms eight other weakly and semi-supervised methods
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both tumor and organ segmentation datasets under weakly semi-supervised settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The SP$^3$ method works by leveraging the spatial coherence of superpixels to propagate scribble annotations and refine pseudo-labels. Superpixels group pixels with similar characteristics, allowing the method to extend sparse scribble annotations to larger regions. The dynamic thresholding mechanism filters high-quality superpixels, ensuring that only reliable pseudo-labels are used for training. By incorporating superpixel-level uncertainty, the method can adaptively adjust the supervision of pseudo-labels, focusing on regions with higher uncertainty. This combination of superpixel propagation, dynamic thresholding, and uncertainty guidance effectively addresses the challenges of limited annotations and noisy pseudo-labels in weakly semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

## Foundational Learning
- **Superpixel Segmentation**: Grouping pixels into perceptually meaningful regions (SLIC algorithm). Why needed: Provides spatial coherence for annotation propagation. Quick check: Verify superpixel boundaries align with anatomical structures.
- **Dynamic Thresholding**: Adaptive filtering of high-quality superpixels based on confidence scores. Why needed: Ensures reliable pseudo-labels for training. Quick check: Analyze threshold sensitivity across different datasets.
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Measuring uncertainty at the superpixel level. Why needed: Guides supervision of pseudo-labels in uncertain regions. Quick check: Validate uncertainty estimates correlate with segmentation errors.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Images -> Superpixel Generation -> Scribble Expansion -> Dynamic Thresholding -> Uncertainty Estimation -> Pseudo-Label Refinement -> Segmentation Network

**Critical Path**: The core pipeline involves superpixel generation, scribble expansion, dynamic thresholding, and uncertainty-guided pseudo-label refinement, which collectively enhance the quality of pseudo-labels used for training the segmentation network.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades computational overhead from superpixel generation and propagation for improved pseudo-label quality and segmentation performance. The dynamic thresholding mechanism introduces hyperparameters that require tuning for different medical imaging modalities.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor superpixel segmentation quality can lead to incorrect annotation propagation, while suboptimal dynamic thresholding may result in noisy pseudo-labels. Uncertainty estimation errors can misguide the supervision process.

**First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate superpixel segmentation quality on diverse medical imaging modalities to assess generalizability.
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of superpixel propagation, dynamic thresholding, and uncertainty guidance.
3. Analyze computational complexity and inference times compared to standard semi-supervised methods.
