# IME: Integrating Multi-curvature Shared and Specific Embedding for Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2403.19881
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19881
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on TKGC tasks with 9.4% improvement on ICEWS14 and 0.6% on ICEWS05-15 under MRR metric

## Executive Summary
IME introduces a novel approach for Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion (TKGC) by modeling knowledge graphs in multiple curvature spaces simultaneously - hyperspherical, hyperbolic, and Euclidean. The method incorporates two key properties: space-shared (capturing common features across spaces) and space-specific (capturing unique characteristics of each space). An Adjustable Multi-curvature Pooling (AMP) approach is proposed to retain important information effectively. Evaluated on ICEWS14, ICEWS05-15, and GDELT datasets, IME achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements over previous methods.

## Method Summary
IME models temporal knowledge graphs in multi-curvature spaces (hyperspherical, hyperbolic, and Euclidean) to capture diverse geometric structures. The method employs a quadruplet distributor for information aggregation and distribution across curvature spaces, learns space-shared and space-specific properties to balance common and unique features, and uses Adjustable Multi-curvature Pooling (AMP) to adaptively select important features. The model is trained with multiple loss functions including similarity, difference, and structure losses to optimize performance on TKG completion tasks.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ICEWS14 and ICEWS05-15 datasets
- Improves MRR by 9.4% on ICEWS14 compared to previous best method
- Improves MRR by 0.6% on ICEWS05-15 compared to previous best method
- Demonstrates effectiveness of multi-curvature approach over single-space methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
IME improves TKG completion by simultaneously modeling TKGs in hyperspherical, hyperbolic, and Euclidean spaces. Different geometric structures in TKGs (ring, hierarchical, chain) are better captured by different curvature spaces. By using multi-curvature embeddings, IME can represent these diverse structures more accurately than single-space methods.

### Mechanism 2
The space-shared property reduces spatial gaps among different curvature spaces. By learning commonalities across curvature spaces through shared parameters in encoding functions, IME mitigates the heterogeneity between spaces, allowing for more coherent representations.

### Mechanism 3
Adjustable Multi-curvature Pooling (AMP) effectively retains important information while reducing computational complexity. AMP learns appropriate pooling weights based on positional encoding and Bi-GRU, allowing it to adaptively select important features from the sorted multi-curvature representations.

## Foundational Learning

- **Multi-curvature spaces (hyperspherical, hyperbolic, Euclidean)**: Understanding how different geometric spaces model different types of structures is fundamental to grasping why IME uses multiple curvature spaces. *Quick check: What type of graph structure is best captured by hyperbolic space, and why?*

- **Knowledge graph embedding techniques**: IME builds on knowledge graph completion methods, so understanding embedding strategies and scoring functions is crucial. *Quick check: How does the TransE method model relationships between entities in knowledge graphs?*

- **Temporal knowledge graphs and link prediction**: The task of TKGC involves predicting missing temporal facts, so understanding the problem setup and evaluation metrics is essential. *Quick check: What is the difference between static KGs and temporal KGs in terms of representation?*

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Multi-curvature Embeddings (Euclidean, hyperbolic, hyperspherical) → Quadruplet Distributor → Space-shared and Space-specific Encoding → Adjustable Multi-curvature Pooling (AMP) → Prediction

- **Critical path**: Multi-curvature Embeddings → Space-shared and Space-specific Representations → Adjustable Multi-curvature Pooling → Prediction

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Multi-curvature vs. single space: Better structure capture vs. increased complexity
  - Fixed pooling (average/max) vs. AMP: Simplicity vs. adaptability
  - Space-shared vs. space-specific: Generalization vs. specialization

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Poor performance on datasets with simple structures: May indicate multi-curvature approach is unnecessary
  - Sensitivity to loss weights: May indicate difficulty in balancing shared vs. specific features
  - Overfitting with high dimensions: May indicate need for regularization or dimension reduction

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Ablation study removing multi-curvature embeddings to test single-space performance
  2. Comparison of AMP vs. average pooling and max pooling on validation set
  3. Sensitivity analysis of similarity loss weight (α) to find optimal balance between spaces

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the proposed IME model perform when applied to large-scale temporal knowledge graphs with billions of quadruplets, considering its computational complexity? The paper only evaluates IME on three datasets with a maximum of 2.7 million training quadruplets, and the computational complexity and scalability on large-scale TKGs are not addressed.

### Open Question 2
Can the space-shared and space-specific properties learned by IME be effectively transferred to other temporal knowledge graph completion tasks or related domains? The paper does not investigate the transferability of the learned properties to other tasks or domains.

### Open Question 3
How sensitive is the IME model to the choice of curvature spaces and the number of spaces used for modeling temporal knowledge graphs? The paper does not explore the impact of using different combinations of curvature spaces or varying the number of spaces on IME's performance.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to three specific TKG datasets which may not represent full diversity of graph structures
- Computational complexity of multi-curvature modeling not fully addressed for scalability to larger graphs
- Assumption that different regions require different geometric spaces needs validation across broader dataset types

## Confidence
- **Multi-curvature approach effectiveness**: High confidence - Strong empirical results show consistent improvements over baselines
- **Space-shared and space-specific properties**: Medium confidence - Theoretical justification is sound, but direct evidence is limited
- **AMP approach superiority**: Medium confidence - Claims of superiority lack specific comparative results

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation study on curvature spaces**: Systematically evaluate IME performance when using only Euclidean, only hyperbolic, or only hyperspherical spaces on each dataset to quantify the contribution of multi-curvature modeling.

2. **Cross-dataset generalization test**: Train IME on one TKG dataset and evaluate on another (e.g., train on ICEWS14, test on GDELT) to assess whether the multi-curvature approach provides robust generalization.

3. **Complexity and scalability analysis**: Measure training time, inference time, and memory usage for IME compared to single-space baselines as graph size scales from small to large datasets.
