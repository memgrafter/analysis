core_contribution: This paper investigates the identifiability of comparative deep
  generative models (DGMs), which aim to learn modular representations from data generated
  by multiple sources. The authors prove that these models are identifiable under
  the assumption of a piecewise affine mixing function (e.g., a ReLU neural network),
  building on recent advances in non-linear ICA theory.

# Toward the Identifiability of Comparative Deep Generative Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.15903
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15903
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proves identifiability of comparative deep generative models under piecewise affine mixing functions

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the identifiability of comparative deep generative models (DGMs), which learn modular representations from data generated by multiple sources. The authors establish theoretical guarantees showing that these models are identifiable when the mixing function is piecewise affine (e.g., ReLU neural networks), building on recent advances in non-linear ICA theory. They demonstrate that identifiability is lost when the number of latent variables is misspecified, but existing regularization techniques can help mitigate this issue. The paper also introduces a novel multi-objective and constrained optimization framework for fitting comparative DGMs, improving the treatment of multiple data sources and enabling interpretable hyperparameter selection.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a theoretical framework for analyzing the identifiability of comparative deep generative models by extending non-linear ICA results to the multi-group setting. The method involves using variational inference with multi-objective optimization to fit contrastive DGMs, where the latent variables are encouraged to be independent through regularization. The authors introduce a constrained optimization approach for hyperparameter selection, ensuring optimal performance across all data sets simultaneously. They evaluate their methods using synthetic data with known ground truth and a real-world single-cell RNA sequencing dataset.

## Key Results
- Comparative DGMs are identifiable under piecewise affine mixing functions but not for general mixing functions
- Identifiability is lost when the number of latent variables is misspecified, but regularization helps mitigate this
- Multi-objective optimization improves the treatment of multiple data sources and enables interpretable hyperparameter selection

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Comparative deep generative models are identifiable when the mixing function is piecewise affine (e.g., ReLU neural network) but not for general mixing functions.
- Mechanism: Under piecewise affine mixing, the model satisfies block-wise identifiability - meaning the subspaces corresponding to different latent variable blocks can be recovered up to linear transformation. This builds on Kivva et al.'s result that such functions preserve identifiability properties.
- Core assumption: The mixing function is piecewise affine and injective, and the latent variables follow isotropic Gaussian distributions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "surprisingly become identifiable when the mixing function is piece-wise affine (e.g., parameterized by a ReLU neural network)"
  - [section]: "we propose a theory of identifiability for comparative DGMs by extending recent advances in the field of non-linear independent component analysis"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus neighbors discuss identifiability but not specifically for comparative models with piecewise affine functions
- Break condition: If the mixing function is not piecewise affine, or if the number of latent variables is misspecified

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Existing regularization techniques help mitigate identifiability issues when the number of latent variables is misspecified.
- Mechanism: Regularization constraints (like independence penalties) restrict the function class during inference, helping to constrain the space of admissible mixing functions and reducing entanglement between latent spaces.
- Core assumption: The variational inference procedure with regularization can effectively constrain the function class even when the model is misspecified.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "empirically show that previously proposed regularization techniques for fitting comparative DGMs help with identifiability when the number of latent variables is not known in advance"
  - [section]: "we illustrate that identifiability guarantees are lost when the numbers of latent variables in each block are misspecified... In numerical experiments, we assess that existing regularization strategies considerably help mitigate this effect"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus neighbors don't specifically discuss regularization for identifiability in comparative models
- Break condition: If regularization is too weak or misspecified, or if the misspecification is too severe

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multi-objective optimization improves identifiability by ensuring the learned parameters are optimal across all data sets simultaneously.
- Mechanism: By framing inference as a multi-objective optimization problem rather than a single composite ELBO, the method ensures better treatment of multiple data sources and avoids negative transfer between objectives.
- Core assumption: The multi-objective optimization approach converges to a Pareto-optimal solution that better respects the identifiability requirements across data sets.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "we advocate for framing this problem of inference across multiple data sets as a multi-objective optimization problem"
  - [section]: "In our experiments, we use the Adam optimizer... We refer to this method as the Multiple Objective cV AE (MO-cV AE)"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus neighbors don't specifically discuss multi-objective optimization for comparative models
- Break condition: If the multi-objective optimization fails to converge or if the weighting between objectives is inappropriate

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Variational Inference
  - Why needed here: The paper uses variational inference to approximate the posterior distributions of latent variables in comparative deep generative models
  - Quick check question: What is the evidence lower bound (ELBO) and how does it relate to the true likelihood in variational inference?

- Concept: Non-linear Independent Component Analysis (ICA)
  - Why needed here: The paper builds on recent advances in non-linear ICA theory to establish identifiability results for comparative models
  - Quick check question: What is the fundamental difference between linear and non-linear ICA, and why does identifiability become more challenging in the non-linear case?

- Concept: Piecewise Affine Functions
  - Why needed here: The paper proves identifiability results specifically for piecewise affine mixing functions, which include ReLU neural networks
  - Quick check question: What mathematical properties make piecewise affine functions special for identifiability, and how do they differ from general non-linear functions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Encoder networks -> Mixing function -> Decoder network -> Regularization modules -> Optimization modules

- Critical path:
  1. Data preprocessing and encoding
  2. Variational inference to approximate posteriors
  3. Regularization application
  4. Multi-objective optimization of ELBOs
  5. Constrained optimization for hyperparameter tuning
  6. Evaluation of identifiability metrics

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model complexity vs identifiability: More complex mixing functions may capture data better but can hurt identifiability
  - Regularization strength vs disentanglement: Stronger regularization may improve disentanglement but could hurt reconstruction quality
  - Number of latent variables vs model fit: Too few latent variables may underfit, while too many can cause entanglement

- Failure signatures:
  - High cross-MCC scores between latent spaces indicate entanglement
  - Poor clustering performance in latent space suggests the model isn't capturing meaningful structure
  - Instability in optimization may indicate issues with the multi-objective approach

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify basic functionality with synthetic data where ground truth is known, checking that the model can recover the correct latent structure
  2. Test the impact of regularization strength on disentanglement metrics with misspecified latent dimensions
  3. Compare multi-objective vs single-objective optimization on a benchmark dataset to validate performance improvements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does the identifiability of comparative DGMs generalize to more than two data sources?
- Can the identifiability results be extended to non-piecewise affine mixing functions with additional assumptions?
- What is the impact of model misspecification beyond the number of latent variables on identifiability?
- How does the performance of the proposed MO-CO-cV AE method scale with the dimensionality of the data and the number of latent variables?

## Limitations
- The identifiability proof relies heavily on the piecewise affine assumption, which may not hold in real-world applications with more complex mixing functions
- The empirical validation is limited to synthetic data and one real-world dataset, which may not fully capture the generalization properties of the proposed methods
- The computational complexity of multi-objective optimization may become prohibitive for larger-scale problems

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The theoretical framework for identifiability under piecewise affine mixing functions, as it builds on established results in non-linear ICA theory and provides rigorous mathematical proofs.
- **Medium Confidence**: The empirical benefits of regularization and multi-objective optimization approaches, as they are demonstrated on limited datasets and may not generalize to all applications.
- **Low Confidence**: The claim that the proposed methodology is broadly applicable to all comparative DGM problems, given the specific assumptions and limited empirical validation.

## Next Checks
1. Broader empirical validation: Test the proposed methods on a wider range of real-world datasets with different characteristics to assess generalization performance and robustness to violations of the piecewise affine assumption.
2. Ablation studies: Systematically evaluate the contributions of each component (regularization, multi-objective optimization, constrained optimization) to the overall performance to better understand their individual effects.
3. Scalability analysis: Investigate the computational complexity and memory requirements of the proposed methods as the size of the data and the number of data sources increase, and develop strategies for scaling to larger problems.
