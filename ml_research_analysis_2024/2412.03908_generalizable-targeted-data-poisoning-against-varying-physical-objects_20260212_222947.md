- Key outcome: This work studies generalizable targeted data poisoning (G-TDP) against physical objects under realistic threat models with viewpoint, background, and lighting variations. Existing TDP methods optimize only gradient direction, achieving limited generalization. The proposed method jointly optimizes gradient direction and magnitude, enabling more generalizable gradient matching. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with multi-view car targets show 19.49% improvement over state-of-the-art. On a handmade dataset with diverse variations, the method achieves 54.92% success rate versus 0% without poisoning. The approach also outperforms baselines in subpopulation data poisoning and maintains effectiveness under standard TDP settings.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of generalizable targeted data poisoning (G-TDP) against physical objects under realistic threat models. The key innovation is optimizing both gradient direction and magnitude for more effective gradient matching across physical variations like viewpoint, background, and lighting changes. The method demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 19.49% better performance on established benchmarks and 54.92% success rate on a diverse handmade dataset. The approach maintains effectiveness across different architectures and threat models while using clean-label poisoning with imperceptible perturbations.

## Method Summary
The proposed method optimizes both gradient direction and magnitude for generalizable targeted data poisoning against physical objects. It employs a gradient matching framework that uses cosine similarity (direction) and Euclidean distance (magnitude) to measure the difference between model gradients of poison samples and target samples. The optimization process includes retraining steps to dynamically capture the effect of current perturbations. The method operates under a clean-label threat model with imperceptible perturbations (L∞-norm) and demonstrates effectiveness across CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and specialized datasets with controlled physical variations.

- Demonstrates 54.92% poisoning success rate on handmade dataset with diverse variations versus 0% without poisoning
- Outperforms baselines in subpopulation data poisoning scenarios
- Maintains effectiveness under standard TDP settings while improving generalization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Optimizing both gradient direction and magnitude (via Euclidean distance) improves poisoning generalization across physical variations.
- **Mechanism**: When physical objects appear under varying conditions, their gradients naturally change magnitude. Matching only cosine similarity (direction) fails because poison samples need sufficient gradient magnitude to counteract the influence of clean samples while maintaining correct labels. The Euclidean distance component ensures poison gradients are large enough to influence semantically similar targets.
- **Core assumption**: Physical variations of the same object produce gradients with similar directions but varying magnitudes in the model's parameter space.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] "We propose optimizing both the gradient direction and magnitude for more generalizable gradient matching, thereby leading to higher poisoning success rates."
  - [section 4.1] "Why the Magnitude of Gradients Matters? DED measures the magnitude difference between the model gradients of data poisons and the known target samples. Gradients with larger magnitudes exert a more significant influence on the model's parameters during gradient descent."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence found about gradient magnitude effects in poisoning literature.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Data augmentation on target samples reduces poisoning effectiveness because digital transformations don't simulate physical object variations.
- **Mechanism**: The poisoner constructs samples using digital augmentations, but these don't correspond to real physical variations the model will encounter during inference. This creates a mismatch where the poison samples optimize for irrelevant variations, wasting the poisoning impact.
- **Core assumption**: Digital transformations (flips, crops, etc.) are fundamentally different from physical object variations in how they affect model gradients.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section B.1] "We find that the SR decreases [when applying data augmentation on target samples]. We believe this result reveals the gap between the physical domain and the digital domain."
  - [section 4.1] "Such a novel design enables us to achieve higher poisoning success for generalizable targeted data poisoning (G-TDP)."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence found about augmentation's negative impact on physical poisoning.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Retraining the victim model during poisoning optimization dynamically captures the evolving influence of poison samples on model parameters.
- **Mechanism**: As poison samples are optimized, they gradually influence the model's decision boundaries. By periodically retraining the model during the poisoning process, the poisoner can better align the gradients with the current state of the poisoned model rather than a static reference model.
- **Core assumption**: The model's gradients evolve significantly during the poisoning process, making static gradient matching suboptimal.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [section 4.2] "Algorithm 1 shows the pseudocode of our proposed poisoning method. We also incorporate a retraining step [31] to dynamically capture the effect of current perturbations."
  - [section 6.3] "Figure 6d shows that the more retraining times, the better performance our method can achieve, consistent with the result of Souri et al. [31]."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence found about retraining benefits in physical poisoning scenarios.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Bi-level optimization in machine learning security
  - Why needed here: The paper's threat model is formalized as a bi-level optimization problem where the poisoner optimizes perturbations subject to the constraint that the victim model is trained using poisoned data.
  - Quick check question: In the TDP objective, what represents the outer optimization problem and what represents the inner optimization problem?

- **Concept**: Gradient matching in adversarial machine learning
  - Why needed here: The core attack methodology relies on matching gradients between poison samples and target samples to influence model behavior on specific targets.
  - Quick check question: Why does matching only gradient direction (cosine similarity) potentially fail for physical object variations?

- **Concept**: Physical vs digital domain transformations
  - Why needed here: Understanding why data augmentation on digital images doesn't effectively simulate physical object variations is crucial for the attack's design.
  - Quick check question: What fundamental difference between physical object variations and digital augmentations causes the poisoning performance degradation observed in the paper?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Target samples → Gradient computation → Adversarial loss calculation (Dmul) → Gradient update → Projection → Retraining → Output poisoned dataset

- **Critical path**: The poisoning optimization process flows from target samples through gradient computation, adversarial loss calculation using the combined Dmul loss function, gradient updates with projection, periodic retraining, and finally outputs the poisoned dataset.

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Magnitude matching vs computational cost: Larger perturbation budgets improve success but increase detectability
  - Retraining frequency vs optimization speed: More frequent retraining improves alignment but increases computation time
  - Surrogate model selection vs transferability: Choosing models with better transferability improves cross-architecture attacks

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Poisoning success rate remains near zero despite optimization: Indicates gradient matching is not effective for the target variations
  - Validation accuracy drops significantly: Suggests the poison samples are too aggressive and affecting overall model performance
  - Transferability fails across architectures: Indicates the poison samples are too specific to the surrogate model architecture

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Implement basic gradient matching with only cosine similarity on CIFAR-10 with single-view target, verify it works as baseline
  2. Add Euclidean distance component to the loss function, measure improvement on single-view target
  3. Test on multi-view car dataset, measure generalization across viewpoints compared to baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the improved performance of Dmul over DED on ImageNet (but not CIFAR-10) indicate a fundamental difference in how these datasets respond to gradient magnitude optimization?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes "DED consistently achieves a high SR when the training dataset is CIFAR-10, while its SR has plunged when the training dataset is ImageNet. The same phenomenon also occurs with Dadd, where the Euclidean distance accounts for a larger proportion than Dmul. Dmul achieves the best poisoning results in various settings, except when the victim model is ConvNet64."
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't investigate why dataset size, class diversity, or image complexity in ImageNet versus CIFAR-10 leads to different performance characteristics for the loss functions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments varying dataset size, class diversity, and image complexity while holding model architecture constant to isolate which factor(s) drive the performance differences.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the effectiveness of gradient matching-based TDP scale with model size and depth, particularly for architectures with attention mechanisms versus pure convolutional networks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper shows transferability to LeViT-384 and Swin V2 (both attention-based) but doesn't systematically study how performance varies across architectures of increasing size/complexity.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates success on a range of architectures, it doesn't explore the relationship between model capacity and susceptibility to gradient matching attacks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic evaluation of TDP effectiveness across models ranging from small CNNs to large ViTs, measuring success rates as a function of parameter count and depth.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the precise mechanism by which retraining during the poisoning optimization process improves generalization across target variations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] "We also incorporate a retraining step [31] to dynamically capture the effect of current perturbations" and "Adding a retraining step does not help boost TDP's performance in this scenario" under previous threat model.
- Why unresolved: The paper shows retraining helps under G-TDP but not under standard TDP, without explaining why this difference exists or what retraining accomplishes mechanistically.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of model parameters and loss landscapes during poisoning with/without retraining, particularly examining how gradients evolve and whether retraining helps maintain gradient consistency across varying target samples.

## Limitations

- Evaluation relies heavily on controlled synthetic datasets rather than real-world physical object deployments
- Magnitude matching mechanism lacks direct empirical validation of gradient magnitude evolution during physical variations
- Computational expense of frequent retraining (R=4 for CIFAR-10) may limit practical deployment in resource-constrained environments
- Transferability claims across different architectures remain somewhat limited, with VGG11 showing superior performance without clear explanation

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The gradient matching framework and its superiority over direction-only methods (19.49% improvement on established benchmarks) are well-supported by controlled experiments with clear statistical significance.

**Medium Confidence**: The mechanism explanations (gradient magnitude importance, digital vs physical domain gaps) are plausible but rely on indirect evidence and reasonable assumptions rather than direct empirical validation of the proposed mechanisms.

**Low Confidence**: Claims about physical world deployment effectiveness and real-world transferability across diverse threat models require field validation beyond the controlled laboratory conditions reported.

## Next Checks

1. **Physical Deployment Validation**: Test the poisoning method on real physical objects under varying environmental conditions (weather, lighting, viewing angles) to validate laboratory findings translate to field conditions.

2. **Magnitude Evolution Analysis**: Conduct controlled experiments measuring how gradient magnitudes actually evolve across physical object variations, directly validating the core assumption behind magnitude matching.

3. **Transferability Stress Test**: Systematically evaluate poisoning effectiveness when transferring between increasingly dissimilar model architectures (different depths, attention mechanisms, training objectives) to establish robustness bounds.
