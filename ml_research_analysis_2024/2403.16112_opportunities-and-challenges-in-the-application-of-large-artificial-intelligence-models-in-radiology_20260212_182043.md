## Executive Summary
This paper reviews the development and application of large artificial intelligence models in radiology, focusing on their potential to transform medical education, report generation, and diagnostic imaging.

## Key Results
- Large language models can provide real-time, context-aware explanations for imaging findings, supporting trainees in developing diagnostic skills through on-demand questioning and feedback.
- Multimodal large models enhance radiology report generation by integrating visual and textual information, enabling generation of detailed and contextually relevant radiology reports.
- Large models in unimodal radiology applications improve diagnostic performance in segmentation, classification, and detection tasks, reducing manual workload and enhancing accuracy.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Large language models improve radiology education by providing real-time, context-aware explanations.
- Mechanism: LLMs trained on extensive medical datasets can generate accurate and interactive explanations for imaging findings, supporting trainees in developing diagnostic skills through on-demand questioning and feedback.
- Core assumption: The model has been fine-tuned with high-quality radiology-specific data and aligned with professional diagnostic standards.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "young radiologists can pose questions on demand...Differential diagnosis and sign analysis will equip young radiologists with valuable insights for their daily clinical practice."
  - [section 3.1] "AI large models can analyze imaging reports in real time, assisting radiologists in employing suitable descriptive language and enhancing the quality management of report documents."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus; weak anchor.
- Break condition: Model hallucinations or use of outdated medical content lead to inaccurate guidance, eroding trust and potentially misinforming trainees.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multimodal large models enhance radiology report generation by integrating visual and textual information.
- Mechanism: By combining visual encoders (e.g., vision transformers) with language models and adapter modules, these models align imaging features with text embeddings, enabling generation of detailed and contextually relevant radiology reports.
- Core assumption: The adapter module effectively bridges the modality gap and the model is fine-tuned on paired image-report datasets.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.3] "Multimodal large models offer numerous advantages...They comprise three fundamental components: a visual encoder, a language model, and an adapter module."
  - [section 3.2] "AI large models can assimilate vast amounts of imaging data to ensure prompt processing of patients' diagnostic needs, alleviate the diagnostic burden on radiologists, and enhance diagnostic efficiency and accuracy."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus; weak anchor.
- Break condition: Failure of the alignment process between visual and language modalities leads to mismatched or nonsensical report content.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Large models in unimodal radiology applications improve diagnostic performance in segmentation, classification, and detection tasks.
- Mechanism: Deep learning architectures (e.g., CNNs, transformers) trained on large annotated datasets can automatically delineate structures, classify lesions, and detect abnormalities, reducing manual workload and enhancing accuracy.
- Core assumption: Access to high-quality, labeled medical imaging datasets and robust model architectures.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3] "Deep learning is commonly employed in classification tasks to categorize radiological images, yielding enhanced diagnostic outcomes...Deep learning models can automatically delineate structures, classify lesions, and detect abnormalities, reducing manual workload and enhancing accuracy."
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus; weak anchor.
- Break condition: Poor generalization due to dataset bias or lack of diverse training examples results in reduced performance on unseen patient populations.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Transformer architecture and attention mechanisms
  - Why needed here: Transformers are the backbone of modern large models; understanding their encoder/decoder structure and attention is essential to grasp how LLMs and multimodal models function.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between self-attention and cross-attention in a transformer model?

- Concept: Multimodal data fusion techniques
  - Why needed here: Integrating visual and textual data is critical for multimodal radiology applications; knowledge of fusion methods (e.g., adapter modules, cross-modal transformers) is required.
  - Quick check question: How does an adapter module bridge the gap between vision and language modalities in a multimodal model?

- Concept: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)
  - Why needed here: RLHF is used to align model outputs with human preferences and safety standards, especially important in clinical contexts to avoid hallucinations.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the reward model in RLHF training?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Visual encoder (e.g., vision transformer or CNN) -> Adapter module -> Language model (e.g., GPT-style decoder) -> Output generator
- Critical path:
  1. Data ingestion and preprocessing
  2. Model training or fine-tuning on domain-specific data
  3. Alignment and evaluation against clinical standards
  4. Deployment into radiology workflow (e.g., PACS integration)
  5. Monitoring and iterative improvement
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model size vs. inference speed (larger models may be more accurate but slower)
  - Generalist vs. specialist models (broad vs. domain-specific fine-tuning)
  - Transparency vs. performance (interpretable models may be less accurate)
  - Data privacy vs. model performance (local vs. cloud deployment)
- Failure signatures:
  - Hallucinations or factually incorrect outputs
  - Poor generalization on rare or underrepresented conditions
  - Mismatch between visual features and textual descriptions
  - Slow inference times impacting clinical workflow
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate baseline model performance on a held-out radiology report generation dataset using BLEU, ROUGE, and RadCliQ metrics.
  2. Conduct ablation study removing the adapter module to quantify its impact on multimodal alignment quality.
  3. Test model robustness by evaluating on datasets from multiple institutions to detect overfitting or bias.
