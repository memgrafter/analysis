# MM-Vet v2: A Challenging Benchmark to Evaluate Large Multimodal Models for Integrated Capabilities

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.00765
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00765
- Reference count: 33
- Key outcome: MM-Vet v2 extends the original MM-Vet benchmark to evaluate large multimodal models on their ability to process interleaved image-text sequences, addressing a key limitation of the original benchmark.

## Executive Summary
MM-Vet v2 extends the original MM-Vet benchmark to evaluate large multimodal models on their ability to process interleaved image-text sequences, addressing a key limitation of the original benchmark. It introduces a new capability called "image-text sequence understanding" alongside the six core vision-language capabilities from MM-Vet. The benchmark includes 517 high-quality evaluation samples covering various domains from daily life to expert applications. Using MM-Vet v2, the authors found that Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieved the highest score of 71.8, slightly outperforming GPT-4o at 71.0. Among open-weight models, InternVL2-Llama3-76B led with a score of 68.4.

## Method Summary
The MM-Vet v2 benchmark extends the original MM-Vet by introducing "image-text sequence understanding" capability and expanding the evaluation set from 217 to 517 samples. The benchmark accepts open-ended responses and uses GPT-4 as an automated evaluator with a carefully designed few-shot prompt template. The data creation process involves expert-designed questions with AI-assisted ground truth generation and human correction. Models are evaluated on their ability to process both single image-text pairs and interleaved image-text sequences, with scores ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 based on GPT-4 evaluation of model outputs.

## Key Results
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieved the highest score of 71.8 on MM-Vet v2
- GPT-4o scored 71.0, slightly lower than Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Among open-weight models, InternVL2-Llama3-76B led with a score of 68.4
- The benchmark successfully evaluates models on both single image-text pairs and interleaved image-text sequences

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The new "image-text sequence understanding" capability directly addresses a gap in MM-Vet by evaluating models on interleaved image-text sequences, which are prevalent in real-world scenarios but missing from the original benchmark.
- Mechanism: By introducing this capability, MM-Vet v2 forces models to process and reason about temporal relationships and context across multiple images and text, rather than treating each image-text pair in isolation.
- Core assumption: Models that perform well on single image-text pairs may not generalize to handling interleaved sequences without specific architectural adaptations for temporal understanding.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "However, its question format is restricted to single image-text pairs, lacking the interleaved image and text sequences prevalent in real-world scenarios."
  - [section 2] "Different from MM-Vet, the input format of MM-Vet v2 is not only an image-text pair, it can also be image-text sequences."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The expansion from 217 to 517 evaluation samples while maintaining quality through expert curation and GPT-4-assisted ground truth generation improves the reliability and coverage of the benchmark.
- Mechanism: By breaking down sample creation into expert-designed questions and AI-assisted answer generation with human correction, the benchmark can cover more diverse scenarios without sacrificing the high-quality standard that made MM-Vet effective.
- Core assumption: Quality can be maintained at scale through a hybrid approach of human expertise for question design and AI assistance for answer generation, with human oversight.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Furthermore, we maintain the high quality of evaluation samples while further expanding the evaluation set size."
  - [section 1] "For questions that need long paragraphs to answer, we first employ the GPT-4V [20] to draft the response. Next, our experts correct draft if there is any error and then rephrase it into final ground truth."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using GPT-4 as an automated evaluator with a carefully designed few-shot prompt provides consistent scoring that aligns with human judgment for open-ended multimodal responses.
- Mechanism: The few-shot prompt template standardizes how model outputs are compared to ground truth by using structured scoring criteria (0.0 to 1.0) and handling both binary (AND/OR) and continuous scoring requirements.
- Core assumption: GPT-4's evaluation of multimodal model outputs is sufficiently consistent and aligned with human judgment when provided with the structured prompt format.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The benchmark accepts open-ended responses and takes GPT-4 [ 19] to score model predictions, which better align with real-world scenarios."
  - [section 2] "Although the temperature is set to 0, we observe some variance in GPT-4’s outputs. To address this, we evaluate the outputs of the LLMs using GPT-4 five times."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multimodal model evaluation methodologies
  - Why needed here: Understanding how benchmarks like MM-Vet v2 are designed, validated, and used to compare models is essential for interpreting results and designing better evaluation approaches.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between automated evaluation (using models like GPT-4) and human evaluation for multimodal tasks, and when might each be appropriate?

- Concept: Vision-language (VL) capabilities and their integration
  - Why needed here: MM-Vet v2 defines six core VL capabilities plus a new sequence understanding capability. Understanding what each capability measures and how they integrate is crucial for analyzing model performance breakdowns.
  - Quick check question: How would you distinguish between a model failing at "spatial awareness" versus "recognition" when it misidentifies objects in an image?

- Concept: Open-weight vs. closed-source multimodal models
  - Why needed here: The paper compares both types of models. Understanding their differences in architecture, training data, and accessibility is important for contextualizing performance comparisons.
  - Quick check question: What are the practical implications of using an open-weight model like InternVL2-Llama3-76B versus a closed model like Claude 3.5 Sonnet for real-world applications?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Question collection (expert-designed) → Ground truth generation (AI-assisted + human correction) → Evaluation set (517 samples) → Model interface (image-text sequences with <image> markers) → Model prediction → Output evaluation → Few-shot prompt template → GPT-4 scoring (5 runs for variance estimation) → Aggregate scores by capability and integration
- Critical path: Question design → Ground truth generation → Model evaluation → Score aggregation → Leaderboard update
- Design tradeoffs: Expert-designed questions ensure quality but limit scale; AI-assisted ground truth generation enables scale but requires human oversight; automated GPT-4 evaluation enables consistency but introduces variance that must be managed.
- Failure signatures: High variance in GPT-4 evaluations suggests prompt/template issues; poor correlation between original and expanded dataset scores suggests quality degradation; models scoring high without sequence-specific architecture suggests benchmark issues.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run a subset of 50 samples through three different evaluators (human, GPT-4, another LLM) to measure inter-rater reliability and calibrate the automated scoring system.
  2. Evaluate a model with known limitations (e.g., single-image only) on the new sequence understanding tasks to verify the benchmark is measuring what it claims.
  3. Perform an ablation study where you evaluate models on the original 217 MM-Vet samples versus the full 517 to quantify the impact of the expanded dataset.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do models perform when processing image-text sequences with varying levels of complexity and length, beyond what is tested in MM-Vet v2?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper introduces "image-text sequence understanding" as a new capability but only tests it on a limited set of 517 evaluation samples.
- Why unresolved: The current benchmark provides a standardized evaluation but doesn't systematically vary sequence length, complexity, or types of interleaving patterns to understand model limitations and strengths.
- What evidence would resolve it: Additional experiments testing models on sequences ranging from simple to highly complex, with varying lengths and different types of interleaving patterns, would provide insights into model capabilities and limitations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of open-weight models compare to closed-source models when processing image-text sequences of increasing difficulty?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieved the highest score of 71.8, slightly outperforming GPT-4o at 71.0, while InternVL2-Llama3-76B, an open-weight model, scored 68.4.
- Why unresolved: While the overall scores are reported, the paper doesn't analyze performance differences across varying levels of sequence complexity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed performance analysis of open-weight and closed-source models on sequences categorized by difficulty levels would reveal whether the performance gap changes with sequence complexity.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What specific aspects of image-text sequence understanding are most challenging for current LMMs, and how do different models approach these challenges?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper introduces "image-text sequence understanding" but doesn't analyze which aspects of this capability are most challenging for models or how different models approach these challenges.
- Why unresolved: While the benchmark tests sequence understanding, it doesn't provide insights into which specific aspects of this capability are most difficult for models or how different models' architectures influence their approach to these challenges.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed error analysis categorizing mistakes by type of sequence understanding and comparing performance across different model architectures would reveal the most challenging aspects and how models approach them.

## Limitations

- Automated Evaluation Reliability: While the paper uses GPT-4 as an automated evaluator with five runs to estimate variance, there's uncertainty about whether this approach provides consistent, reliable scores across diverse multimodal responses.
- Dataset Quality at Scale: The expansion from 217 to 517 samples relies on a hybrid approach of expert-designed questions and AI-assisted ground truth generation, with uncertainty about whether quality is maintained at this scale.
- Sequence Understanding Measurement: The new "image-text sequence understanding" capability introduces interleaved image-text sequences, but there's uncertainty about whether the benchmark truly measures temporal understanding or if models can achieve high scores through pattern matching.

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The technical specification of the benchmark extension (adding 300 samples and a new capability) and the comparison results between models are well-supported by the methodology described.
- Medium Confidence: The automated evaluation mechanism using GPT-4 is described in detail, but the reliability and consistency of this approach across diverse scenarios remains uncertain.
- Medium Confidence: The quality maintenance claims for the expanded dataset are reasonable given the described methodology, but would benefit from independent validation of inter-rater reliability.

## Next Checks

1. **Inter-rater Reliability Test**: Evaluate a stratified sample of 100 MM-Vet v2 questions using three independent evaluators (human experts, GPT-4, and another state-of-the-art LLM) to quantify agreement rates and calibrate the automated scoring system.

2. **Sequence Understanding Ablation**: Test a model with known limitations in temporal processing (e.g., models that only accept single images) on the new sequence understanding tasks to verify that the benchmark genuinely measures sequence comprehension rather than single-image performance.

3. **Dataset Quality Correlation**: Perform statistical correlation analysis between model performance on the original 217 MM-Vet samples versus the full 517 to identify any quality degradation or systematic differences in the expanded dataset.
