# RAR-b: Reasoning as Retrieval Benchmark

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.06347
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06347
- Reference count: 26
- Primary result: Introduces RAR-b benchmark to evaluate reasoning capabilities of embedding models through retrieval tasks, showing current models struggle with reasoning-intensive tasks

## Executive Summary
RAR-b introduces a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning abilities of embedding models by transforming reasoning tasks into retrieval tasks. The authors argue that traditional semantic textual similarity and information retrieval benchmarks are insufficient for assessing advanced language understanding in embedding models, especially in the context of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). RAR-b includes three levels of tasks—commonsense, temporal, spatial, numerical, and symbolic reasoning—constructed from 17 datasets. The authors evaluate state-of-the-art bi-encoders and rerankers across two settings: Multiple-choice Retrieval (MCR) and Full-dataset Retrieval (Full). Results show that current models struggle with reasoning-intensive tasks, with instruction-aware models often performing worse with instructions. However, decoder-based models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large show promise. Fine-tuning rerankers achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks. RAR-b highlights the need for embedding models to develop reasoning-level language understanding and provides a framework for future research.

## Method Summary
The authors construct RAR-b by transforming 17 existing datasets containing reasoning tasks into retrieval format. The benchmark includes three levels of reasoning tasks: commonsense, temporal, spatial, numerical, and symbolic reasoning. Two evaluation settings are used: Multiple-choice Retrieval (MCR), where models must retrieve the correct answer from multiple choices, and Full-dataset Retrieval (Full), where models retrieve relevant information from the entire dataset. State-of-the-art bi-encoders and rerankers are evaluated across these settings, with additional analysis of instruction-aware models and decoder-based approaches. Fine-tuning of rerankers is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance.

## Key Results
- Current embedding models struggle significantly with reasoning-intensive retrieval tasks
- Instruction-aware models often perform worse when provided with instructions
- Decoder-based models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large show superior performance on reasoning tasks
- Fine-tuned rerankers achieve state-of-the-art performance across all RAR-b task categories

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
RAR-b works by reframing reasoning problems as retrieval tasks, allowing evaluation of embedding models' ability to understand and retrieve information relevant to complex reasoning. The transformation preserves the logical structure of reasoning problems while adapting them to a retrieval framework, enabling assessment of whether embedding models can capture semantic relationships beyond simple keyword matching. The dual evaluation settings (MCR and Full) provide complementary perspectives on model performance, with MCR testing discrimination between closely related options and Full testing broad retrieval capabilities.

## Foundational Learning

**Semantic Textual Similarity (STS)**: Understanding how models measure semantic similarity between text pairs - needed because RAR-b builds on but extends beyond traditional STS evaluation; quick check: verify model performance on standard STS benchmarks

**Information Retrieval (IR)**: Core principles of ranking and retrieving relevant documents - needed as RAR-b transforms reasoning into IR tasks; quick check: confirm retrieval metrics (MRR, Recall) are properly computed

**Reasoning Task Categories**: Classification of reasoning types (commonsense, temporal, spatial, numerical, symbolic) - needed to understand the diverse challenge spectrum; quick check: validate task categorization through human annotation

**Bi-encoder Architecture**: Understanding dual-encoder models for efficient similarity scoring - needed as primary model class evaluated; quick check: confirm model architecture matches published specifications

**Reranking Models**: Sequential refinement of retrieval results - needed for understanding fine-tuned model performance; quick check: verify reranking improves over initial retrieval

**Instruction-tuning Effects**: How instruction-following capability affects model performance - needed to interpret instruction-aware model results; quick check: compare performance with and without instructions

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Datasets -> Transformation Pipeline -> Retrieval Models (Bi-encoders/Rerankers) -> Evaluation Metrics (MRR, Recall) -> Analysis

**Critical Path**: Task transformation → Model encoding → Similarity scoring → Ranking → Performance evaluation → Analysis of reasoning capabilities

**Design Tradeoffs**: Balancing task authenticity vs. retrieval format compatibility; computational efficiency vs. reasoning depth; model simplicity vs. performance

**Failure Signatures**: Poor performance on symbolic reasoning tasks indicates limitations in abstract reasoning; degraded performance with instructions suggests overfitting to specific formats; inconsistent performance across task types reveals reasoning gaps

**First Experiments**:
1. Baseline evaluation on transformed commonsense reasoning tasks to establish performance floor
2. Ablation study removing instructions from instruction-aware models to test format sensitivity
3. Cross-task generalization test to assess transfer of reasoning capabilities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but the results raise several implicit questions about the nature of reasoning in embedding models, the relationship between instruction-following and reasoning capabilities, and the generalizability of current approaches to complex reasoning tasks.

## Limitations

- Benchmark construction relies on adapting existing datasets, which may introduce artifacts not present in original reasoning tasks
- Focus on bi-encoders and rerankers may not fully capture reasoning capabilities of other model architectures
- Interpretation of instruction-aware model performance requires careful consideration of potential artifacts from instruction-tuning

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The benchmark construction methodology and its distinction from existing STS/IR benchmarks
- **Medium confidence**: The interpretation of model performance differences across reasoning types and settings
- **Medium confidence**: The conclusion that current models struggle with reasoning-intensive tasks

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies on the dataset transformation process to verify that reasoning task characteristics are preserved when converting to retrieval format
2. Test additional model architectures (e.g., sequence-to-sequence, chain-of-thought) on RAR-b to determine if results generalize beyond bi-encoders and rerankers
3. Perform human evaluation on a subset of benchmark tasks to establish ground truth difficulty levels and validate the automated evaluation methodology
