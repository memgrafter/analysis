# Games for AI Control: Models of Safety Evaluations of AI Deployment Protocols

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.07985
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07985
- Reference count: 40
- This paper presents AI-Control Games, a formal model for evaluating safety protocols for untrusted AI systems through a red-teaming framework

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces AI-Control Games, a formal game-theoretic framework for evaluating safety protocols when deploying untrusted AI systems. The core contribution is a partially observable, multi-objective, leader-follower stochastic game that models the interaction between protocol designers (Blue) and red team adversaries (Red). By reducing this multi-objective problem to single-objective zero-sum partially observable stochastic games, the framework enables finding optimal deployment protocols that balance safety and usefulness.

The authors apply their framework to Trusted Monitoring protocols for programming assistant deployment, demonstrating improvements over existing empirical protocols. The approach allows for efficient evaluation of memoryless threshold policies and provides the first Pareto frontiers for the protocol space. The framework captures the key tradeoffs between safety and usefulness in AI deployment while providing a computationally tractable method for protocol evaluation.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a game-theoretic framework where Blue (protocol designers) and Red (adversaries) interact in a partially observable environment. The game is modeled as a leader-follower stochastic game with multiple objectives: minimizing Blue's cost while maximizing Red's utility. To make the problem computationally tractable, the authors restrict strategies to memoryless threshold policies and reduce the multi-objective problem to a zero-sum partially observable stochastic game (POMDP) by summing objectives with appropriate weights.

The key insight is that under threshold policies, the belief state can be represented as a single scalar, allowing the POMDP to be solved efficiently. The framework finds Pareto optimal policies by solving the POMDP for different objective weightings, generating the entire Pareto frontier of optimal deployment protocols. This approach enables systematic evaluation of safety-usefulness tradeoffs in AI deployment protocols.

## Key Results
- The framework demonstrates improvements over existing empirical protocols for Trusted Monitoring in programming assistant deployment
- First Pareto frontiers for the protocol space are generated, showing optimal safety-usefulness tradeoffs
- The model evaluates performance in novel settings and analyzes how modeling assumptions affect safety-usefulness tradeoffs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by formalizing the adversarial interaction between protocol designers and red teamers as a game with well-defined objectives and constraints. The reduction to POMDPs with threshold policies makes the problem computationally tractable while preserving the essential safety-usefulness tradeoff structure. By solving the POMDP for different objective weightings, the framework systematically explores the entire Pareto frontier of optimal protocols.

## Foundational Learning

**Partially Observable Stochastic Games (POSGs)**: Models sequential decision-making under uncertainty where players have incomplete information about the state. Why needed: Captures the uncertainty in AI system behavior and limited observability of protocol effectiveness. Quick check: Verify that the belief state representation is correct for the specific protocol being evaluated.

**Leader-Follower Games**: Models hierarchical decision-making where one player (leader) commits to a strategy that the other player (follower) observes before acting. Why needed: Represents the real-world scenario where protocol designers establish rules that adversaries must work within. Quick check: Ensure the follower's best response computation is correctly implemented.

**Multi-Objective Optimization**: Finding solutions that optimize multiple conflicting objectives simultaneously. Why needed: AI deployment requires balancing safety (minimizing harm) against usefulness (maintaining system capabilities). Quick check: Verify that the Pareto frontier generation correctly identifies all non-dominated solutions.

**Threshold Policies**: Decision rules that depend only on whether a belief state exceeds a certain threshold. Why needed: Restricts the strategy space to make the problem computationally tractable while still capturing essential tradeoffs. Quick check: Confirm that threshold policies are sufficient to achieve optimal performance for the given problem structure.

**POMDP Reduction**: Converting a POSG with specific constraints into a single-agent POMDP. Why needed: Enables efficient solution methods for finding optimal policies in the multi-objective setting. Quick check: Validate that the POMDP solution correctly maps back to the original game's optimal strategies.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Protocol Designers (Blue) -> Multi-Objective POSG -> Red Teamers (Red) -> POMDP Reduction -> Threshold Policies -> Pareto Frontier Optimization

**Critical Path**: The essential sequence is defining the game structure, applying the POMDP reduction, solving for threshold policies, and generating the Pareto frontier through weight variation.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades expressiveness (allowing only threshold policies) for computational tractability. This makes finding optimal protocols feasible but may miss more sophisticated adaptive strategies that adversaries could employ.

**Failure Signatures**: The framework may fail when threshold policies are insufficient to capture optimal strategies, when the POMDP reduction assumptions don't hold, or when the multi-objective tradeoff structure is more complex than captured by linear weight combinations.

**First Experiments**:
1. Verify the POMDP reduction by comparing solutions from the reduced POMDP against brute-force solutions for small-scale versions of the original game
2. Test threshold policy optimality by comparing against solutions from the full strategy space for simple protocol scenarios
3. Validate the Pareto frontier generation by confirming that all solutions on the frontier are non-dominated and that no better solutions exist

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- The framework assumes memoryless threshold policies which may not capture sophisticated adaptive strategies
- The POMDP reduction relies on threshold policies, limiting expressiveness of achievable strategies
- Evaluation focuses on a specific use case (programming assistant deployment) with particular attack vectors, potentially limiting generalizability

## Confidence

**Claim: AI-Control Games can efficiently find optimal deployment protocols** - Medium confidence, depends on validity of POMDP reduction and threshold policy assumptions

**Claim: This framework provides "first Pareto frontiers for the protocol space"** - High confidence within context of Trusted Monitoring protocols for programming assistants, Low confidence regarding broader literature

**Claim: Improvements over existing protocols demonstrated** - Medium confidence, based on simulations rather than real-world deployments

## Next Checks

1. Test the framework's predictions against real-world red-teaming exercises with actual AI systems to validate model assumptions and threshold policy effectiveness

2. Evaluate the framework's performance across different AI deployment contexts (e.g., language models, autonomous systems) to assess generalizability

3. Compare computational efficiency of finding optimal protocols using proposed POMDP reduction versus direct solution methods for original leader-follower game structure
