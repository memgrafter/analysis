# GraphSL: An Open-Source Library for Graph Source Localization Approaches and Benchmark Datasets

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2405.03724
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03724
- **Reference count**: 18
- **Primary result**: Open-source library with six real-world datasets and multiple source localization methods

## Executive Summary
GraphSL is an open-source library designed to address the inverse problem of identifying information sources in networks from observed diffusion patterns. The library implements both traditional heuristic methods (LPSI, NetSleuth, OJC) and modern GNN-based approaches (GCNSI, IVGD, SLVAE) that can handle various diffusion models like Independent Cascade and Linear Threshold. GraphSL provides six real-world benchmark datasets including Karate, Dolphins, Jazz, Network Science, Cora-ML, and Power Grid networks, enabling researchers to evaluate algorithms on meaningful network structures rather than synthetic ones.

The library standardizes evaluation by returning a Metric object containing five performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F-score, and area under ROC curve. All methods operate without requiring prior assumptions about source characteristics (single vs. multiple sources). GraphSL fills a critical gap by combining real-world datasets with state-of-the-art source localization methods, allowing researchers to easily evaluate new techniques against appropriate baselines.

## Method Summary
GraphSL provides a comprehensive framework for graph source localization that includes both prescribed heuristic methods and learned GNN-based approaches. The library implements diffusion generation using Independent Cascade and Linear Threshold models, applies source localization algorithms to identify infection sources, and returns standardized performance metrics. Methods are designed to operate without prior assumptions about the number of sources, supporting both single-source and multi-source scenarios. The library is publicly available under MIT license on GitHub and can be installed via pip, making it accessible for both research and practical applications.

## Key Results
- GraphSL standardizes evaluation across different source localization methods by returning a unified Metric object with five performance metrics
- The library includes six real-world benchmark datasets spanning social networks (Karate, Dolphins, Jazz), citation networks (Cora-ML), and infrastructure networks (Power Grid)
- Both traditional heuristic methods (LPSI, NetSleuth, OJC) and modern GNN-based approaches (GCNSI, IVGD, SLVAE) are implemented with consistent interfaces

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GraphSL enables source localization by standardizing both diffusion simulation and source detection methods within a unified framework.
- Mechanism: The library provides standardized interfaces for generating diffusion patterns (via IC/LT models) and applying multiple source localization algorithms, returning consistent metric objects for evaluation.
- Core assumption: Different source localization algorithms can be fairly compared when applied to the same diffusion simulations on identical benchmark datasets.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "GraphSL facilitates the exploration of various graph diffusion models for simulating information diffusions and enables the evaluation of cutting-edge source localization approaches on established benchmark datasets."
  - [section] "Our GraphSL library is standardized: for instance, tests of all source inference methods return a Metric object, which provides five performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F-score, and area under ROC curve) for performance evaluation."
- Break condition: If diffusion simulation parameters vary between methods or if algorithms require incompatible preprocessing steps, the standardized comparison becomes invalid.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The library bridges the gap between theoretical research and practical implementation by providing real-world datasets alongside state-of-the-art algorithms.
- Mechanism: By including six real-world benchmark datasets (Karate, Dolphins, Jazz, Network Science, Cora-ML, Power Grid) with established node and edge counts, researchers can test algorithms on meaningful networks rather than synthetic ones.
- Core assumption: Real-world network topologies provide more challenging and realistic testbeds for source localization than purely synthetic graphs.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "we also release six benchmark graph datasets to facilitate the research of graph source localization, whose statistics are shown in Table 1."
  - [section] "GraphSL fills a critical gap by combining real-world datasets with state-of-the-art source localization methods"
- Break condition: If the included datasets don't represent the diversity of real-world network structures relevant to the researcher's application domain.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: GraphSL supports both prescribed heuristic methods and learned GNN-based approaches, covering the spectrum of current source localization techniques.
- Mechanism: The library implements hand-crafted methods (LPSI, NetSleuth, OJC) alongside GNN-based approaches (GCNSI, IVGD, SLVAE), allowing comparison between traditional heuristics and modern deep learning methods.
- Core assumption: Different algorithmic paradigms (rule-based vs. learned) have complementary strengths and weaknesses that can be evaluated on the same problems.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Existing methods can be categorized into two groups: Prescribed methods and Graph Neural Networks (GNN)-based methods."
  - [section] "GNN-based methods learn rules from graph data in an end-to-end manner by capturing graph topology and neighboring information."
- Break condition: If the implementation of one method class (e.g., GNN-based) requires significantly different data preprocessing than the other, fair comparison becomes difficult.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph diffusion models (Independent Cascade, Linear Threshold)
  - Why needed here: Source localization algorithms must operate on diffusion patterns generated by these models, understanding their mechanics is essential for proper usage
  - Quick check question: What's the fundamental difference between how Independent Cascade and Linear Threshold models propagate information through a network?

- Concept: Source localization as inverse problem
  - Why needed here: Understanding that source localization reverses the diffusion process is key to grasping why different methods are needed compared to forward diffusion prediction
  - Quick check question: If graph diffusion predicts {b,c,d,e} from source node b, what does graph source localization need to predict from {b,c,d,e}?

- Concept: Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F-score, AUC-ROC)
  - Why needed here: The Metric object standardizes evaluation across methods, so understanding what each metric measures is crucial for interpreting results
  - Quick check question: When would high precision but low recall be preferable in source localization compared to balanced F-score?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: GraphSL consists of three main layers: (1) Diffusion generation module for creating synthetic infections, (2) Algorithm implementation layer containing both prescribed and GNN-based methods, (3) Evaluation module that returns standardized Metric objects. The library also includes dataset loading utilities and documentation via Read the Docs.

- Critical path: To run a source localization experiment: (1) Load or generate a graph, (2) Use diffusion_generation() to create infection patterns, (3) Select and configure a source localization method, (4) Execute the method on the diffusion data, (5) Collect results from the returned Metric object.

- Design tradeoffs: The library prioritizes standardization over flexibility - all methods must return the same Metric format, which may require method-specific wrappers. This simplifies comparison but could limit the ability to capture method-specific nuances in results.

- Failure signatures: Common issues include: (1) Diffusion generation failing due to disconnected graphs, (2) Methods returning empty source sets when the diffusion pattern is too sparse, (3) Metric calculation errors when ground truth sources aren't properly specified.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run LPSI on the Karate dataset with IC diffusion, compare accuracy vs. random guessing
  2. Execute GCNSI on the Cora-ML dataset, examine the difference in F-score compared to NetSleuth
  3. Test OJC on the Power Grid dataset with varying diffusion sizes, plot recall vs. number of observed infected nodes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does GraphSL handle multi-source localization compared to single-source scenarios in terms of accuracy and computational complexity?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions methods "do not require prior assumptions about the source (e.g. single source or multiple sources)" but doesn't provide comparative performance analysis
- Why unresolved: The paper introduces various methods but lacks systematic evaluation of their performance differences across single vs. multiple source scenarios
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing all six implemented methods' performance on datasets with varying numbers of true sources, measuring both accuracy and computational time

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of network topology characteristics (diameter, clustering coefficient, degree distribution) on the effectiveness of different source localization algorithms in GraphSL?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper provides six benchmark datasets with varying sizes and structures but doesn't analyze how network topology affects algorithm performance
- Why unresolved: While GraphSL provides standardized evaluation metrics, there's no systematic study of how specific topological properties influence different algorithms' success rates
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive experiments correlating topological metrics of the six benchmark datasets with each algorithm's performance across multiple diffusion patterns

### Open Question 3
- Question: How scalable are the GNN-based methods in GraphSL compared to prescribed methods for large-scale networks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions "scalable deep learning" as a direction but doesn't provide scalability analysis of the implemented GNN methods versus prescribed ones
- Why unresolved: The library includes both GNN-based and prescribed methods, but lacks comparative analysis of their performance and resource requirements as network size increases
- What evidence would resolve it: Performance benchmarks showing runtime, memory usage, and accuracy trade-offs for each method across networks of increasing size, particularly focusing on the largest Power Grid dataset versus Cora-ML and smaller graphs

## Limitations

- Dataset Coverage Uncertainty: The six included datasets may not adequately represent all network types relevant to source localization research, potentially limiting generalizability
- Implementation Parity Confidence: Without access to exact implementations, it's uncertain whether all methods operate under truly comparable conditions, which could bias comparisons
- Method Comprehensiveness Gap: The library may not capture the full methodological diversity in source localization research, as some recent approaches are not included

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The library's core functionality of providing standardized interfaces for diffusion generation and source localization methods. The existence of six real-world benchmark datasets and the MIT licensing model are verifiable facts.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that GraphSL enables fair comparison between prescribed and GNN-based methods through standardization. While the interface standardization is documented, the actual fairness of comparisons depends on implementation details not fully visible in the paper.

**Low Confidence**: The assertion that GraphSL fills a critical gap in the research ecosystem. While the library addresses a known need, the extent to which it solves the problem comprehensively cannot be fully assessed without broader community adoption and usage patterns.

## Next Checks

1. **Benchmark Replication Check**: Replicate results for LPSI on the Karate dataset with Independent Cascade diffusion using multiple random seeds to verify consistency with reported metrics and assess sensitivity to stochastic factors.

2. **Method Comparison Validation**: Compare performance distributions of NetSleuth (prescribed) versus GCNSI (GNN-based) on the Cora-ML dataset across multiple diffusion runs to determine if standardized interfaces produce genuinely comparable results.

3. **Dataset Diversity Assessment**: Apply the same source localization method to all six datasets and analyze performance variance to quantify whether the included networks provide sufficient diversity for robust algorithm evaluation.
