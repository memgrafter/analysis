# OmnixR: Evaluating Omni-modality Language Models on Reasoning across Modalities

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.12219
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12219
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Current OLMs show significant performance drops when processing non-text inputs, with accuracy decreasing by up to 50% on image and video tasks compared to text

## Executive Summary
OmnixR introduces a comprehensive benchmark suite for evaluating Omni-modality Language Models (OLMs) across multiple input types including text, images, audio, and video. The benchmark includes both synthetic data generated via the Omnify! method and real-world YouTube video datasets. The evaluation reveals substantial performance gaps when OLMs process non-text inputs, with accuracy dropping by up to 50% on image and video tasks. Additionally, smaller models like Gemini-1.5-Flash generate reasoning paths for only 23.4% of video inputs versus 98.9% for text. These results highlight significant challenges in cross-modal information integration and reasoning for current OLMs.

## Method Summary
The OmnixR benchmark suite evaluates OLMs using two datasets: a synthetic version created through the Omnify! method that converts text questions into various modalities, and a real-world set manually curated from YouTube videos. The evaluation framework tests models across multiple input types (text, images, audio, video) on reasoning tasks, measuring both accuracy and reasoning path generation rates. This approach allows for controlled comparisons between modalities while also capturing real-world complexity through the YouTube dataset.

## Key Results
- Current OLMs show accuracy decreases of up to 50% on image and video tasks compared to text
- Smaller models like Gemini-1.5-Flash generate reasoning paths for only 23.4% of video inputs versus 98.9% for text
- OLMs struggle significantly with cross-modal information integration and reasoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
None

## Foundational Learning
1. **Multimodal reasoning**: Understanding how language models process and reason across different input modalities (text, image, audio, video) - needed for designing effective evaluation benchmarks, quick check: model can answer questions about content in each modality
2. **Cross-modal information integration**: Ability to combine and reason about information from multiple input types simultaneously - needed for real-world reasoning tasks, quick check: model can solve problems requiring information from both text and images
3. **Reasoning path generation**: The process by which models create step-by-step logical chains to arrive at answers - needed for transparency and debugging, quick check: model outputs intermediate reasoning steps before final answer
4. **Benchmark design methodology**: Creating controlled synthetic data and curating real-world datasets for comprehensive evaluation - needed for reliable model assessment, quick check: dataset covers diverse reasoning scenarios across modalities
5. **Performance metrics for multimodal systems**: Defining appropriate evaluation criteria beyond simple accuracy - needed for nuanced understanding of model capabilities, quick check: metrics capture both accuracy and reasoning quality

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Text/Image/Audio/Video inputs -> Pre-processing modules -> OLM core -> Reasoning path generator -> Final answer
Critical path: Input processing → Feature extraction → Multimodal fusion → Reasoning generation → Answer prediction
Design tradeoffs: Synthetic vs. real-world data (control vs. authenticity), single vs. multi-step reasoning tasks (simplicity vs. complexity), accuracy vs. reasoning path generation (correctness vs. transparency)
Failure signatures: Large accuracy drops on non-text inputs, low reasoning path generation rates for complex modalities, inability to integrate cross-modal information
First experiments: 1) Test baseline accuracy on synthetic text questions, 2) Evaluate performance drop when same questions are presented in image/video format, 3) Measure reasoning path generation rates across different input modalities

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Potential bias in manual curation process for real-world YouTube video dataset may not represent broader range of reasoning tasks
- Synthetic Omnify! method may not accurately capture complexity of real-world multimodal reasoning scenarios
- Evaluation focuses on accuracy and reasoning path generation, potentially overlooking other important aspects like robustness to noise

## Confidence
High confidence: The observed performance drops of OLMs on non-text inputs compared to text, particularly the 50% accuracy decrease on image and video tasks, are well-supported by the experimental results presented in the paper.

Medium confidence: The claim that smaller models like Gemini-1.5-Flash generate reasoning paths for only 23.4% of video inputs versus 98.9% for text is based on the specific evaluation setup and may not generalize to all video reasoning tasks or model configurations.

Low confidence: The paper's conclusion that current OLMs struggle with cross-modal information integration and reasoning, while supported by the presented results, may not fully capture the potential of these models when fine-tuned or adapted for specific multimodal reasoning tasks.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a more diverse and extensive manual curation of real-world YouTube videos to ensure broader representation of multimodal reasoning tasks and reduce potential bias in the dataset.
2. Develop and apply additional evaluation metrics beyond accuracy and reasoning path generation rates, such as robustness to noise, handling of ambiguous inputs, and computational efficiency, to provide a more comprehensive assessment of OLM performance.
3. Investigate the impact of model size, architecture, and fine-tuning strategies on multimodal reasoning performance by testing a wider range of OLM configurations and comparing their results on the OmnixR benchmark suite.
