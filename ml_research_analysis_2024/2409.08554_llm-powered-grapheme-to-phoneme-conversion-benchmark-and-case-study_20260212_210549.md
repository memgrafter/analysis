# LLM-Powered Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion: Benchmark and Case Study

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.08554
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08554
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: LLMs outperform traditional G2P models with PER of 8.30% and Ezafe F1 of 88.33% on Persian

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a framework for enhancing large language models (LLMs) in grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion, achieving significant improvements over traditional G2P models. The authors introduce innovative prompting and post-processing techniques that leverage LLMs' embedded linguistic knowledge to improve phonetic accuracy without additional training or labeled data. They create a benchmarking dataset "Sentence-Bench" and develop an Ezafe prediction metric to evaluate G2P models on sentence-level challenges in Persian. The results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively handle context-sensitive phonemes and polyphone words when guided by appropriate prompting strategies and dictionary-based corrections.

## Method Summary
The method employs a multi-stage pipeline: (1) LLM-based phonetic generation using specialized prompting strategies, (2) Finglish-to-IPA mapping to convert Latin-script phonetic approximations to standard phonetic notation, and (3) dictionary-based post-processing for validation and correction. The authors introduce "Kaamel-Dict," a comprehensive Persian G2P dictionary with over 120K entries, which is used for both validation and correction steps. The approach leverages LLMs' inherent linguistic knowledge through carefully designed prompts, then refines the output using rule-based and LLM-based dictionary correction mechanisms to achieve high accuracy in phoneme prediction and Ezafe detection.

## Key Results
- LLMs achieve PER of 8.30% and Ezafe F1 of 88.33% on Persian G2P conversion
- The proposed methods outperform traditional G2P tools in underrepresented languages like Persian
- Finglish prompting strategy significantly improves LLM phonetic output consistency
- Dictionary-based post-processing effectively corrects minor spelling errors and improves polyphone accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs possess embedded linguistic and phonetic knowledge that can be leveraged for G2P conversion.
- Mechanism: LLMs trained on diverse text data inherently learn phoneme-grapheme mappings and contextual cues through exposure to language patterns, allowing them to generate phonetic transcriptions when prompted appropriately.
- Core assumption: The LLM's training corpus included sufficient phonetic and linguistic examples to encode implicit G2P knowledge.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated significant linguistic and phonetic capabilities [2], making them promising candidates for G2P tasks."
  - [section IV] "While LLMs have demonstrated an understanding of the phonemic representations of languages, the effectiveness of their output heavily depends on the quality of the prompting techniques employed."

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Specialized prompting techniques can significantly improve LLM G2P output accuracy without additional training.
- Mechanism: By framing the task as generating Finglish (phonetic Latin transliteration) instead of direct IPA, the LLM produces more consistent outputs that can be reliably mapped back to the target phonetic representation using linguistic rules.
- Core assumption: LLMs have greater exposure to Latin-script phonetic approximations than formal IPA in their training data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section IV] "3) Finglish: Persian speakers sometimes type Persian (Farsi) words using the Latin alphabet, a practice known as Finglish... Since LLMs likely have more exposure to Finglish data than to IPA phonetic representation, they may be better at generating Finglish text than producing standard phonetic forms."
  - [section IV] "This approach achieved a PER of 10.86% on the converted phonetic representation, leading us to use Finglish as the preferred output format in subsequent methods."

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Post-processing using dictionary lookups can correct LLM phonetic output errors and improve G2P accuracy.
- Mechanism: The LLM's phonetic predictions are validated and corrected by matching them against a comprehensive dictionary of grapheme-phoneme pairs, either through word similarity metrics or re-prompting the LLM with dictionary alternatives.
- Core assumption: The dictionary contains sufficient coverage of the vocabulary encountered in the test sentences, including polyphone words and context-sensitive phonemes like Ezafe.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section IV] "4) Rule-based Dictionary Correction: In this step, we aimed to correct minor spelling errors in the LLM output. First, we searched the grapheme words in the dictionary to retrieve their exact phonetic representations."
  - [section IV] "5) LLM-based Dictionary Correction: Despite improvements, the rule-based method using word similarity metrics is not always reliable. To enhance accuracy, we implemented a method to correct the LLM's phonetic output by re-prompting the model, including potential phonetic representations of words in the prompt."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Phoneme Error Rate (PER) metric
  - Why needed here: PER provides a quantitative measure of G2P model accuracy by calculating the edit distance between predicted and reference phonetic sequences, normalized by sequence length.
  - Quick check question: If a predicted sequence "kæt" differs from the reference "kæt" by one substitution, what is the PER for a single word of length 3?

- Concept: Context-sensitive phonemes and polyphone words
  - Why needed here: Persian and other languages have words that change pronunciation based on context, requiring G2P systems to have contextual awareness beyond simple grapheme-to-phoneme rules.
  - Quick check question: In Persian, the written form "gol" can be pronounced as /gol/ (flower) or /gel/ (mud). What type of linguistic phenomenon does this represent?

- Concept: Ezafe phoneme prediction
  - Why needed here: The Ezafe is a context-dependent short vowel in Persian that connects related words and changes meaning based on its presence or absence, making it a critical challenge for G2P systems.
  - Quick check question: The sentences "in gol-e zibA ast" (/ this flower beautiful is /) and "in gol zibA ast" (/ this flower beautiful is /) differ only in the presence of Ezafe. What semantic difference does this create?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input sentences -> LLM prompt generation -> LLM inference -> Finglish-to-IPA mapping -> Dictionary validation/correction -> Output phonetic sequence

- Critical path: Input → LLM prompt generation → LLM inference → Finglish-to-IPA mapping → Dictionary validation/correction → Output phonetic sequence

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Single LLM call vs. multi-step prompting: Simpler implementation vs. better accuracy
  - Rule-based vs. LLM-based dictionary correction: Deterministic vs. potentially more accurate but less predictable
  - Dictionary size vs. lookup efficiency: Larger dictionaries provide better coverage but slower lookups

- Failure signatures:
  - High PER with low Ezafe F1: Indicates the LLM struggles with context-dependent phonemes but handles basic G2P reasonably well
  - Low polyphone accuracy: Suggests the dictionary correction mechanism fails to disambiguate words with multiple pronunciations
  - Inconsistent Finglish mapping: Points to ambiguous or non-standard Finglish representations generated by the LLM

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run baseline LLM with naive phonetic prompting on Sentence-Bench test set, measure PER, polyphone accuracy, and Ezafe F1
  2. Implement Finglish prompting approach and compare performance against baseline across all three metrics
  3. Add rule-based dictionary correction to the Finglish approach and measure improvement in PER and polyphone accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of LLM-based G2P models vary across different underrepresented languages with context-sensitive phonemes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights that LLMs perform poorly in underrepresented languages, but it only tests Persian as a case study.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses solely on Persian, leaving open the question of how well the proposed methods generalize to other underrepresented languages with similar phonetic complexities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the proposed methods on multiple underrepresented languages with context-sensitive phonemes, such as Arabic or Turkish, and comparing performance metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the limitations of the proposed post-processing techniques when applied to languages with more complex phonetic rules than Persian?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper introduces post-processing methods tailored to Persian, but does not explore their effectiveness in languages with more intricate phonetic structures.
- Why unresolved: The study does not address whether the post-processing techniques can handle languages with more complex phonetic rules, such as tonal languages or those with extensive vowel harmony.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the post-processing techniques to languages with complex phonetic rules and evaluating their impact on G2P accuracy.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the size of the G2P dictionary affect the performance of LLM-based G2P models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces "Kaamel-Dict," the largest Persian G2P dictionary, but does not investigate how dictionary size influences LLM performance.
- Why unresolved: The study does not explore whether increasing the dictionary size beyond a certain point yields diminishing returns or if it consistently improves performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with varying dictionary sizes and analyzing the correlation between dictionary size and G2P accuracy.

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can the proposed methods be adapted to improve LLM performance in other speech processing tasks beyond G2P conversion?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on G2P conversion but suggests that LLMs have broader linguistic capabilities that could be leveraged in other tasks.
- Why unresolved: The study does not explore the applicability of the proposed methods to other speech processing tasks, such as speech recognition or machine translation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the prompting and post-processing techniques to other speech processing tasks and evaluating their impact on task performance.

## Limitations

- The results are based on a single language (Persian) and may not generalize to other languages with different orthographic systems
- The study relies heavily on dictionary coverage, which may not scale effectively to languages with more complex morphological systems
- The exact prompt templates for the final method are not fully specified, making reproduction challenging

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The general framework of using LLMs for G2P conversion with dictionary-based post-processing is sound and well-supported by the results presented.
- **Medium confidence**: The specific performance metrics (PER, Ezafe F1) are accurate for the Persian language and the Sentence-Bench dataset, but generalizability to other languages remains uncertain.
- **Low confidence**: Claims about LLM "understanding" phonemic representations are overstated; the models appear to perform pattern matching rather than true linguistic comprehension.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-linguistic validation**: Test the complete pipeline (Finglish prompting + dictionary correction) on at least two additional languages with different orthographic systems (e.g., a non-Latin script language and a language with irregular orthography like English) to assess generalizability.

2. **Ablation study on prompt components**: Systematically remove or modify each prompting strategy (in-context examples, Finglish format, dictionary hints) while keeping other factors constant to isolate which components contribute most to performance improvements.

3. **Dictionary coverage analysis**: Quantify the impact of dictionary coverage on final performance by systematically removing entries from Kaamel-Dict and measuring the degradation in PER and Ezafe F1, particularly for polyphone words and Ezafe-containing phrases.
