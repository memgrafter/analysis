# Why Only Text: Empowering Vision-and-Language Navigation with Multi-modal Prompts

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.02208
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02208
- Authors: Haodong Hong; Sen Wang; Zi Huang; Qi Wu; Jiajun Liu
- Reference count: 15
- Key outcome: Proposes VLN-MP task integrating visual and textual prompts, achieving significant navigation performance improvements across four VLN benchmarks while maintaining text-only compatibility.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces VLN-MP, a novel approach to Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) that enhances traditional text-based instructions with visual prompts. The authors develop a comprehensive framework including a data generation pipeline that transforms textual instructions into multi-modal forms using large pre-training models, and a Multi-modal Prompts Fusion (MPF) module that effectively integrates visual and textual features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that incorporating visual prompts significantly improves navigation performance across multiple VLN benchmarks while maintaining compatibility with text-only prompts.

## Method Summary
The method consists of a training-free pipeline that transforms textual VLN instructions into multi-modal forms using GPT-4 for landmark phrase extraction, GLIP/GroundingDINO for detection, and ControlNet for augmentation. The MPF module processes visual prompts and text tokens separately, then combines them in a unified embedding space using dual position encodings. Baseline VLN models (HAMT, DUET) are adapted to use MPF for processing multi-modal instructions. Agents are trained with a combination of original and augmented data, with augmented data selected with probability γ = 0.2.

## Key Results
- Significant performance improvements across all four VLN benchmarks (R2R, RxR, REVERIE, CVDN) when incorporating visual prompts
- MPF module successfully integrates visual and textual features, outperforming text-based models in pre-explore settings
- Three distinct settings (Aligned, Related, Terminal) demonstrate varying levels of visual prompt relevance and effectiveness
- Text-only prompts remain functional, ensuring backward compatibility while offering enhanced performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Integrating visual prompts into VLN instructions reduces ambiguity in landmark identification and improves navigation accuracy.
- Mechanism: Visual prompts provide concrete references for landmark phrases, reducing reliance on abstract language interpretation and aligning agent perception with human expectations.
- Core assumption: Visual prompts accurately represent the landmark phrases and are aligned with the actual environment views.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the same textual instruction can be associated with different visual signals, causing severe ambiguity"
  - [section] "a photo of a wicker chair provides a clear, direct reference to help the agent accurately identify the target object"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; no direct citations in corpus papers for this specific mechanism.
- Break condition: Visual prompts are misaligned with landmark phrases or do not accurately represent the environment, leading to confusion and navigation errors.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Multi-modal Prompts Fusion (MPF) module effectively integrates visual and textual features for seamless navigation.
- Mechanism: MPF processes visual prompts and text tokens separately, then combines them in a unified embedding space using dual position encodings to maintain sequence relationships.
- Core assumption: The dual position encoding approach (VPE and MPE) correctly preserves the relationships between visual and textual tokens.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "a novel module designed to process various image prompts for seamless integration with state-of-the-art VLN models"
  - [section] "position encoding is applied twice for each token: the first to mark the sequence of the images and texts separately and the second to match these two types of tokens"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in corpus papers for this specific module design.
- Break condition: The position encoding fails to preserve token relationships, causing the agent to misinterpret the multi-modal instruction.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The data generation pipeline effectively transforms textual instructions into multi-modal forms using landmark images.
- Mechanism: The pipeline uses GPT-4 for landmark phrase extraction, GLIP/GroundingDINO for detection, and ControlNet for augmentation to create diverse visual prompts.
- Core assumption: Large pre-training models (GPT-4, GLIP, GroundingDINO) accurately perform their respective tasks (extraction, detection, augmentation).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "a training-free pipeline to transform textual instructions into multi-modal forms with landmark images"
  - [section] "Utilizing the advanced GPT-4 model... to perform the extraction" and "use the chosen model in a zero-shot manner to scan all images"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence; no direct citations in corpus papers for this specific pipeline.
- Break condition: Pre-training models fail to accurately extract phrases, detect landmarks, or generate appropriate augmentations, resulting in poor quality visual prompts.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data Generation Pipeline -> Multi-modal Prompts Fusion (MPF) Module -> Baseline VLN Models (HAMT, DUET)

- Critical path:
  1. Transform textual instructions into multi-modal forms using the data generation pipeline.
  2. Process visual prompts and text tokens separately using the MPF module.
  3. Combine features in a unified embedding space with dual position encodings.
  4. Use the integrated features for navigation decision-making in baseline VLN models.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. Efficiency: Using more complex models (GPT-4, GLIP) for the pipeline increases accuracy but also computational cost.
  - Backward Compatibility vs. Enhanced Performance: VLN-MP maintains compatibility with text-only prompts while offering improved performance with visual prompts.
  - Number and Relevance of Visual Prompts: Balancing the quantity and quality of visual prompts to maximize performance without overwhelming the agent.

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor navigation performance: Indicates issues with the MPF module or the integration of visual prompts.
  - Misaligned visual prompts: Suggests problems with the data generation pipeline or landmark detection.
  - Agent confusion with multi-modal instructions: Points to issues with position encoding or feature integration in the MPF module.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the effectiveness of the data generation pipeline by comparing the similarity of extracted phrases and landmark images with human-annotated data.
  2. Test the MPF module's ability to integrate visual and textual features by measuring navigation performance with different position encoding configurations.
  3. Assess the impact of visual prompts on navigation performance by comparing agents trained and evaluated with text-only prompts versus multi-modal prompts in different settings (Aligned, Related, Terminal).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper relies on landmark detection as a critical step in generating multi-modal instructions, with some errors noted in phrase extraction and detection.
  - Why unresolved: The paper does not deeply investigate the consequences of detection inaccuracies or propose robust methods to handle such errors in diverse environments.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of navigation performance with varying levels of landmark detection accuracy, and development of error-correction mechanisms or alternative detection strategies to improve robustness.

- Question: How can the proposed MPF module be adapted for real-time navigation tasks where computational resources are limited?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The MPF module is designed to integrate visual and textual features but may require significant computational resources, especially with large-scale visual prompts.
  - Why unresolved: The paper does not address the computational efficiency of MPF in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios, which is critical for practical deployment.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking MPF's performance and resource usage in real-time navigation tasks, and developing optimized versions or lightweight alternatives for efficient deployment.

## Limitations
- Heavy reliance on large pre-trained models (GPT-4, GLIP, GroundingDINO) introduces computational cost and accessibility barriers
- Visual prompt quality depends entirely on accuracy of pre-trained models, which may vary across environments and languages
