## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.06423
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06423
- Reference count: 40
- Authors: Nga Pham; Minh Kha Do; Tran Vu Dai; Pham Ngoc Hung; Anh Nguyen-Duc
- One-line primary result: FAIREDU achieves up to 96.7% reduction in |1-DI| and 88.55% reduction in SPD while maintaining model performance

## Executive Summary
FAIREDU addresses the challenge of fairness across multiple sensitive features in educational machine learning models, where existing methods often focus on individual features. The method uses multivariate regression to detect and remove dependencies between non-sensitive features and multiple sensitive features simultaneously. Through extensive experiments across seven educational datasets and three ML models (LR, RF, DT), FAIREDU demonstrates superior fairness improvement compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining model performance with minimal trade-offs.

## Method Summary
FAIREDU is a preprocessing fairness enhancement method that uses multivariate regression to identify and remove dependencies between non-sensitive features and multiple sensitive features simultaneously. For each non-sensitive feature, the method builds a multivariate regression model with all sensitive features as predictors, applies statistical significance testing (Wald test), and removes the bias-related components from feature values. The algorithm is applied to both training and test data, preserving the predictive components while eliminating bias. FAIREDU was evaluated on seven educational datasets using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree models, measuring both fairness metrics (Disparate Impact, Statistical Parity Difference) and performance metrics (Accuracy, Recall).

## Key Results
- FAIREDU achieves up to 96.7% reduction in |1-DI| (Disparate Impact) and 88.55% reduction in SPD (Statistical Parity Difference)
- The method maintains model performance with minimal trade-offs, outperforming or matching baseline models in accuracy and recall in the majority of cases
- FAIREDU successfully addresses intersectionality across features while preserving predictive effectiveness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: FAIREDU achieves fairness across multiple sensitive features by using multivariate regression to detect and remove dependencies between non-sensitive features and all sensitive features simultaneously.
- Mechanism: The method constructs a multivariate regression model for each non-sensitive feature, regressing it on all sensitive features. It then removes the estimated dependency (the regression part) from the non-sensitive feature values, creating a bias-reduced dataset.
- Core assumption: Dependencies between features and sensitive features are linear and can be accurately captured by linear regression.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "The method uses multivariate regression to detect and remove dependencies between non-sensitive features and multiple sensitive features (e.g., gender, race, age) simultaneously." [section] "For each non-sensitive feature xi, k+1 ≤ i ≤ d, we evaluate the association between the sensitive features x1, . . . , xk and xi in the training dataset... If 'p-value < 0.05' holds, we calculate the estimates ˆai and ˆbi of the Multivariate-regression model... xinew = xi − (β0 + β1 · x1 + · · · + βk · xk)"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: FAIREDU maintains model performance while improving fairness by selectively removing only the bias-related components of features, preserving predictive relationships.
- Mechanism: The algorithm only removes the part of each non-sensitive feature that is dependent on sensitive features (as determined by statistical significance via Wald test). The independent components, which may contain predictive signal, are preserved.
- Core assumption: The bias-related component of a feature is separable from its predictive component.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "FAIREDU demonstrates superior fairness improvement... while maintaining model performance with minimal trade-offs, outperforming or matching baseline models in accuracy and recall in the majority of cases." [section] "In this step, for any training sample, we perform the following two operators to remove bias: remove sensitive features... and modify insensitive feature values... Apply the same modification on the testing samples"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: FAIREDU's effectiveness stems from addressing intersectionality of sensitive features, which single-feature methods cannot handle.
- Mechanism: By regressing each non-sensitive feature on all sensitive features simultaneously, FAIREDU captures and removes the combined effect of multiple sensitive attributes (e.g., being both female and minority), rather than addressing each feature in isolation.
- Core assumption: Fairness issues arise from the combined effect of multiple sensitive features, not just individual features.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "FAIREDU addresses the problem of fairness across multiple sensitive features in educational machine learning models, where existing methods often focus on individual features." [section] "Current research predominantly focuses on fairness for individual sensitive features, which limits the comprehensiveness of fairness assessments. This paper introduces FAIREDU, a novel and effective method designed to improve fairness across multiple sensitive features."

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multivariate regression and statistical significance testing (Wald test)
  - Why needed here: FAIREDU relies on multivariate regression to model dependencies between features and sensitive features, and uses Wald tests to determine which dependencies are statistically significant and should be removed.
  - Quick check question: If you have a non-sensitive feature x4 and sensitive features x1 (gender) and x2 (race), how would you set up the multivariate regression equation to detect dependencies?

- Concept: Fairness metrics (Disparate Impact, Statistical Parity Difference, etc.)
  - Why needed here: The paper evaluates FAIREDU's effectiveness using multiple fairness metrics, and understanding these metrics is crucial for interpreting results and comparing with baseline methods.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between Disparate Impact (DI) and Statistical Parity Difference (SPD), and when might they give different results?

- Concept: Preprocessing vs. in-processing vs. post-processing fairness methods
  - Why needed here: FAIREDU is a preprocessing method, and understanding the differences between these categories helps in comparing FAIREDU to other fairness enhancement techniques.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between preprocessing methods like FAIREDU and in-processing methods like Adversarial Debiasing?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preparation -> Dependency detection -> Statistical filtering -> Bias removal -> Model training -> Evaluation
- Critical path: Dependency detection → Statistical filtering → Bias removal → Model training → Evaluation
  The statistical filtering step is critical - if dependencies are incorrectly identified as significant/non-significant, bias removal will be ineffective.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Linear vs. non-linear dependency modeling: FAIREDU uses linear regression, which is simple but may miss non-linear relationships
  - Statistical threshold selection: p-value < 0.05 is used, but this could be adjusted based on desired sensitivity
  - Feature preservation vs. bias removal: Removing too much may hurt performance, removing too little may not improve fairness sufficiently
- Failure signatures:
  - Performance degradation without corresponding fairness improvement: Suggests over-removal of predictive components
  - Minimal fairness improvement: Suggests under-removal or that dependencies weren't properly detected
  - Statistical test failures: Could indicate data quality issues or inappropriate threshold selection
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run FAIREDU on Adult dataset with Gender as sensitive feature using Logistic Regression, compare |1-DI| before and after
  2. Test FAIREDU on COMPAS dataset with both Gender and Race as sensitive features, evaluate performance on multiple fairness metrics
  3. Compare FAIREDU vs. LTDD on Default dataset with Age as sensitive feature, measuring both fairness improvement and accuracy changes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does FAIREDU perform when applied to more than three sensitive features simultaneously?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors note that most experiments used datasets containing only two or three sensitive features, and suggest extending the work to a broader range of datasets with a greater number of sensitive features.
- Why unresolved: The current study's limited scope prevents conclusions about FAIREDU's effectiveness with higher-dimensional sensitive feature spaces.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying FAIREDU to datasets with 4+ sensitive features, measuring fairness improvements and performance trade-offs across various ML models.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can FAIREDU maintain its performance advantages when applied to modern ML/AI approaches like Neural Networks and Deep Learning models?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors acknowledge that their study relies on traditional ML algorithms (LR, RF, DT) and note that the generalizability of their findings to more modern ML/AI approaches is limited.
- Why unresolved: The current study only evaluates FAIREDU with classical ML models, leaving uncertainty about its effectiveness with more complex architectures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments applying FAIREDU to neural networks, deep learning models, and other modern ML approaches, measuring both fairness improvements and model performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of FAIREDU on the interpretability and utility of machine learning models when dependencies between features are modified?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors mention that modifying the dataset to remove dependencies may inadvertently alter other important relationships within the data, potentially impacting the interpretability and utility of resulting models.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on fairness and performance metrics but does not thoroughly investigate how feature modification affects model explainability and practical usability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of model interpretability metrics (e.g., feature importance, SHAP values) before and after FAIREDU application, along with assessments of how feature modifications affect decision-making processes and user trust.

## Limitations
- The method relies on linear regression assumptions, which may not capture complex non-linear relationships between sensitive and non-sensitive features
- Effectiveness is constrained by the assumption that bias components are separable from predictive components
- Requires careful feature engineering and may not generalize well to datasets with high-dimensional or highly correlated features

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The fairness improvement claims (up to 96.7% reduction in |1-DI| and 88.55% reduction in SPD) are supported by the methodology and experimental setup.
- **Medium Confidence**: The performance preservation claims are supported but may be dataset-dependent, as the trade-off between fairness and accuracy is known to vary across different educational datasets.
- **Low Confidence**: The generalization claims across all educational contexts require further validation, particularly in domains with different data characteristics than those tested.

## Next Checks
1. Test FAIREDU on non-linear synthetic datasets where ground truth bias relationships are known to evaluate its ability to capture complex dependencies.
2. Conduct ablation studies by varying the statistical significance threshold (p-value cutoff) to understand its impact on the fairness-performance trade-off.
3. Evaluate FAIREDU on additional educational datasets with different characteristics (e.g., smaller sample sizes, different feature distributions) to assess generalizability.
