# Directed Domain Fine-Tuning: Tailoring Separate Modalities for Specific Training Tasks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.16346
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16346
- Authors: Daniel Wen; Nafisa Hussain
- Reference count: 13
- Primary result: 2% accuracy improvement on YouCook2 dataset using 2.5% and 23.76% the size of baseline training datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Directed Domain Fine-Tuning, a method for fine-tuning Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) on distinct tasks within a specific domain. The authors fine-tune Video-LLaVA for recipe generation from cooking videos by training its image, video, and text encoders on separate cooking-related datasets. Despite using significantly smaller training datasets, the approach achieves a 2% accuracy improvement on the YouCook2 dataset compared to the baseline model, while generating more precise and concise recipes.

## Method Summary
The method involves using LoRA parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) on Video-LLaVA's multimodal architecture, with each encoder trained on domain-specific datasets: FoodX-251 for images, Tasty for videos, and generated cooking questions for text. LanguageBind maps visual features into the textual feature space, enabling unified learning across modalities. The model is evaluated on the YouCook2 dataset using GPT-3.5-turbo scoring.

## Key Results
- 2% accuracy improvement on YouCook2 dataset compared to baseline Video-LLaVA
- Model trains on image dataset 2.5% the size and video dataset 23.76% the size of baseline
- Generates more precise and concise recipes despite smaller training data
- Struggles with temporal understanding and timestamp association in videos

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Fine-tuning separate encoders on task-specific datasets reduces noise and improves precision in recipe generation
- Core assumption: Each modality's encoder can independently learn and specialize on its task without significant interference from other modalities

### Mechanism 2
- LoRA parameter-efficient fine-tuning allows for effective model adaptation with minimal computational resources
- Core assumption: The low-rank decomposition can capture the necessary adjustments for the target task without losing the general knowledge learned during pre-training

### Mechanism 3
- Using LanguageBind to map visual features into the textual feature space enables unified learning across modalities
- Core assumption: The textual feature space can adequately represent both visual and textual information without significant loss of semantic meaning

## Foundational Learning

- Multimodal learning
  - Why needed here: The model must integrate information from images, videos, and text to generate accurate recipes
  - Quick check question: What are the advantages of using a multimodal approach over single-modality models in this context?

- Fine-tuning vs. training from scratch
  - Why needed here: Fine-tuning leverages the pre-trained knowledge of Video-LLaVA, making it more efficient than training a new model
  - Quick check question: Why is fine-tuning generally preferred over training from scratch when adapting pre-trained models?

- Temporal understanding in videos
  - Why needed here: The model needs to understand the sequence of actions in cooking videos to generate step-by-step instructions
  - Quick check question: How does the model handle the temporal aspect of videos when generating recipes?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Image Encoder -> Video Encoder -> Text Encoder -> LanguageBind -> LLM (Vicuna) -> Output (recipe)
- Critical path: Input (image/video/text) → Encoder → LanguageBind → LLM → Output (recipe)
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using separate datasets for each modality reduces noise but may miss cross-modal interactions
  - LoRA fine-tuning is efficient but may limit the model's flexibility
  - Mapping visual features to textual space simplifies processing but may introduce information loss
- Failure signatures:
  - Inability to generate accurate ingredient lists or measurements
  - Failure to understand the sequence of actions in cooking videos
  - Generation of irrelevant or incorrect recipes
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Fine-tune only the image encoder on FoodX-251 and evaluate on recipe generation
  2. Fine-tune only the video encoder on Tasty dataset and evaluate on recipe generation
  3. Fine-tune all three encoders simultaneously and compare performance with the previous experiments

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- How does Directed Domain Fine-Tuning perform on other domains beyond cooking, such as medical procedures or manufacturing instructions?
- What is the impact of using larger training datasets on the performance of Directed Domain Fine-Tuning?
- How can Video-LLaVA be extended to better understand and reason about timestamps in videos?

## Limitations

- Temporal Understanding Deficit: Model consistently struggles with timestamp comprehension in cooking videos
- Dataset Size Disparity: Model trains on significantly smaller datasets (2.5% and 23.76% of baseline) raising scalability questions
- Evaluation Methodology: Reliance on GPT-3.5-turbo scoring introduces potential subjectivity and may not capture nuanced failures

## Confidence

**High Confidence** (well-supported by evidence):
- Separation of fine-tuning across modalities reduces noise and improves precision
- LoRA parameter-efficient fine-tuning enables effective adaptation with minimal computational overhead
- LanguageBind successfully maps visual features into textual feature space for unified learning

**Medium Confidence** (some gaps in evidence):
- The 2% improvement on YouCook2 represents meaningful real-world improvement
- The approach generalizes to other domains beyond cooking videos
- The trade-off between reduced dataset size and maintained performance is optimal

**Low Confidence** (significant unknowns):
- Long-term performance stability across extended video sequences
- Model behavior with significantly different cooking styles or cuisines
- Impact of the temporal understanding deficit on real-world usability

## Next Checks

1. **Temporal Understanding Stress Test**: Evaluate the model on videos with complex, overlapping cooking actions and rapid sequence changes to quantify the severity of timestamp comprehension limitations and identify failure patterns.

2. **Cross-Domain Generalization Test**: Apply the same fine-tuning methodology to a different procedural video domain (e.g., DIY home repair or craft tutorials) to validate whether the approach's success transfers beyond cooking videos.

3. **Ablation Study on Dataset Size**: Systematically reduce the training dataset sizes below the current 2.5%/23.76% thresholds to determine the minimum viable dataset size while maintaining the 2% accuracy improvement, establishing practical limits of the approach.
