- One-line primary result: PROFILE framework reveals that LLMs consistently over-prioritize output length while showing better factor-level alignment in evaluation versus generation settings, with improvement possible through self-refinement and feedback-driven approaches.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces PROFILE, a framework that automatically uncovers and measures factor-level preferences of humans and large language models (LLMs). PROFILE identifies how individual quality factors like fluency, conciseness, and factual accuracy influence overall preference decisions, enabling systematic comparison between human and model priorities. Experiments across summarization, instruction-following, and document-based QA tasks reveal that while humans prioritize different factors depending on context, models consistently over-prioritize output length regardless of task. The analysis shows significantly lower factor-level alignment in generation compared to evaluation settings. By leveraging this gap between generation and evaluation capabilities, the study demonstrates improved alignment through self-refinement and feedback-driven generation, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4o.

## Method Summary
PROFILE is a framework that quantifies the influence of individual quality factors on overall preference decisions by computing factor scores that measure concordance between response-level preferences and factor-level manifestations. The method extracts pairwise factor manifestations from responses and compares them with overall preference labels to calculate Kendall's τ correlation (τ14), producing a factor score that indicates how strongly each factor drives preference. The framework uses automated methods (rule-based, UniEval-based, or LLM-based) to extract factors like fluency, conciseness, and factual accuracy from text responses. Factor-level alignment is then measured by comparing human and model factor scores across generation and evaluation settings, with improvements achieved through self-refinement and feedback-driven generation approaches.

## Key Results
- LLMs consistently over-prioritize output length across all tasks regardless of human preferences
- Factor-level alignment is significantly stronger in evaluation settings compared to generation settings
- Self-refinement and feedback-driven generation approaches improve factor-level alignment to levels comparable with GPT-4o
- Different tasks show varying factor priorities for humans, but models exhibit consistent over-prioritization of length

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: PROFILE quantifies the influence of individual quality factors on overall preference decisions by computing factor scores that measure concordance between response-level preferences and factor-level manifestations.
- Mechanism: PROFILE extracts pairwise factor manifestations from responses and compares them with overall preference labels to calculate Kendall's τ correlation (τ14), producing a factor score that indicates how strongly each factor drives preference.
- Core assumption: Individual factors can be reliably extracted and quantified from text responses using automated methods (rule-based, UniEval-based, or LLM-based).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Using PROFILE, we analyze preference alignment across three key tasks: summarization, instruction-following, and document-based QA."
  - [section]: "To quantify the influence of a given factor f, we calculate its factor score, τ(f), by analyzing the concordance between response-level preferences and factor-level manifestations."
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus doesn't provide direct evidence for this mechanism
- Break condition: If factor extraction methods produce noisy or inconsistent measurements, the computed factor scores will not accurately reflect true factor influence on preferences.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: LLMs exhibit different factor-level alignment patterns between generation and evaluation settings, with stronger alignment during discrimination tasks.
- Mechanism: By comparing factor scores computed from generation data versus evaluation data, PROFILE reveals that models consistently over-prioritize certain factors (like length) during generation but show better alignment with human preferences during evaluation.
- Core assumption: The same model's factor-level preferences remain stable across different task settings (generation vs evaluation).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "while LLMs show poor factor-level alignment with human preferences when generating texts, they demonstrate strong alignment in discrimination tasks."
  - [section]: "Interestingly, we observe that these same LLMs demonstrate notably better factor-level alignment during discrimination tasks."
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus doesn't provide direct evidence for this mechanism
- Break condition: If evaluation tasks fundamentally change the model's internal reasoning about factors, the alignment gap may not be exploitable for improvement.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The generation-evaluation alignment gap can be leveraged to improve generation alignment through self-refinement and feedback-driven approaches.
- Mechanism: Using the model's stronger evaluation alignment as a training signal, supervised fine-tuning with self-evaluation or real-time feedback from an evaluator can improve the generation model's factor-level alignment with human preferences.
- Core assumption: Models' superior evaluation capabilities can be effectively transferred to improve their generation capabilities through appropriate training methods.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "By leveraging this gap between generation and evaluation capabilities, the study demonstrates improved alignment through self-refinement and feedback-driven generation."
  - [section]: "Using this framework, we investigate three key research questions: ... 3. Can insights from observed alignment differences between these settings be leveraged to improve the less aligned setting?"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus doesn't provide direct evidence for this mechanism
- Break condition: If the model's evaluation and generation processes are too disconnected, improvements in evaluation alignment may not transfer to generation performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Factor-level analysis vs. aggregate evaluation
  - Why needed here: Understanding that overall preference scores can mask important misalignments at the factor level is crucial for identifying where models diverge from human preferences
  - Quick check question: If humans prefer conciseness but models prefer length, what would an aggregate evaluation score show versus a factor-level analysis?

- Concept: Kendall's τ correlation for factor scoring
  - Why needed here: The τ14 variant handles ties appropriately for preference data and provides a principled way to measure how strongly factor manifestations correlate with overall preferences
  - Quick check question: Why might τ14 be preferred over Pearson correlation for measuring factor influence on preferences?

- Concept: Automated factor extraction methods
  - Why needed here: Reliable extraction of factors like fluency, coherence, and intent alignment is essential for PROFILE to work at scale across different tasks
  - Quick check question: What are the three main approaches used for automated factor extraction in PROFILE?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input processing -> Factor extraction module -> Pairwise comparison engine -> Score calculation -> Alignment analysis -> Improvement pipeline
- Critical path: Response pair → Factor extraction → Pairwise concordance calculation → Factor score computation → Alignment correlation → Model improvement
- Design tradeoffs: Granularity vs. computational cost (more factors provide better insight but increase extraction complexity), automation vs. accuracy (LLM-based extraction is flexible but expensive)
- Failure signatures: Low correlation between extracted factors and human preferences suggests extraction methods need refinement; inconsistent factor scores across similar responses indicate instability
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run PROFILE on a small summarization dataset to verify factor extraction accuracy and score computation
  2. Compare generation vs evaluation alignment on the same model to confirm the alignment gap
  3. Implement self-refinement on one model and measure improvement in generation alignment

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we systematically incorporate factor-level preferences as training signals during the LLM training stage rather than relying on post-hoc correction methods?
- Basis in paper: Explicit
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions that exploring how to embed these signals within datasets used for preference optimization represents a promising direction for future work, but does not provide concrete approaches or evaluate such methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing models trained with factor-level preference signals versus standard training methods across multiple tasks, showing improved alignment while maintaining performance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of different factor extraction methods (rule-based, UniEval-based, LLM-based) on the accuracy and reliability of factor-level preference alignment measurements?
- Basis in paper: Inferred
- Why unresolved: While the paper describes using multiple extraction methods, it doesn't systematically compare their effectiveness or analyze how extraction method choice affects the resulting alignment measurements and conclusions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis showing how different extraction methods affect factor scores, alignment measurements, and downstream conclusions across various tasks and model types.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the generation-discrimination gap observed in factor-level alignment be leveraged to create more effective training paradigms that improve both generation and evaluation capabilities simultaneously?
- Basis in paper: Explicit
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates that models show better alignment in evaluation than generation settings, and that leveraging evaluation for generation improvement is promising, but does not explore comprehensive training approaches that target both capabilities together.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training methodologies that simultaneously optimize for both generation and evaluation alignment, with experiments showing whether improvements in one setting transfer to the other and lead to better overall factor-level alignment.

## Limitations

- Factor extraction accuracy depends heavily on the reliability of automated methods, which may vary across different domains and tasks
- The study's conclusions about specific factor misalignments may change with different prompt formulations or extraction implementations
- Improvement methods show promising results but lack comprehensive ablation studies to identify which components are most critical

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The empirical finding that LLMs demonstrate stronger factor-level alignment in evaluation versus generation settings is robust and supported by multiple model comparisons across different tasks.

**Medium Confidence**: The characterization of specific factor-level misalignments (e.g., length over-prioritization) is likely accurate but may vary with different factor extraction implementations and prompt formulations.

**Low Confidence**: The proposed improvement methods (self-refinement and feedback-driven generation) show promising results but the paper doesn't provide sufficient ablation studies to isolate which components of the improvement pipeline are most critical for achieving better alignment.

## Next Checks

1. **Factor Extraction Validation**: Conduct a systematic evaluation of factor extraction accuracy by comparing automated extractions against human annotations on a held-out subset of the data, measuring precision, recall, and inter-annotator agreement.

2. **Prompt Sensitivity Analysis**: Test whether the reported factor-level misalignments persist across different prompt formulations for both generation and factor extraction, to establish robustness to prompt engineering variations.

3. **Improvement Mechanism Isolation**: Perform controlled experiments that isolate the effects of self-evaluation versus external feedback in the improvement pipeline to determine which components drive the observed alignment gains.
