# Multi-View Conformal Learning for Heterogeneous Sensor Fusion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.12307
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12307
- Authors: Enrique Garcia-Ceja
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Multi-view models outperform single-view models in both accuracy and uncertainty measures for heterogeneous sensor fusion

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of multi-view conformal learning models for heterogeneous sensor fusion. The study addresses the challenge of assessing confidence in individual predictions when combining data from multiple sensor types, which is crucial for safety-critical applications. Three multi-view models (MV-A, MV-S, MV-I) are proposed and tested on HTAD and Berkeley-MHAD datasets, showing superior performance compared to single-view approaches in both traditional accuracy metrics and conformal uncertainty measures. The multi-view stacking approach (MV-S) achieved the best overall performance with prediction set sizes of 1.17 and 0.95 for the respective datasets.

## Method Summary
The method employs three multi-view conformal learning approaches: Multi-View Aggregation (MV-A) concatenates features from different sensors, Multi-View Stacking (MV-S) uses stacked generalization with first-level learners and a meta-learner, and Multi-View Intersection (MV-I) creates prediction sets by intersecting individual conformal sets. Random Forest serves as the underlying classifier, with the LAC method for non-conformity functions and a confidence level of 0.95. The data is split into 50% training, 25% test, and 25% calibration sets. Performance is evaluated using both traditional metrics (accuracy, F1-score) and conformal measures (set size, coverage, Jaccard index).

## Key Results
- Multi-view models consistently outperform single-view models across both HTAD and Berkeley-MHAD datasets
- MV-S achieves the best performance in most measures with set sizes of 1.17 (HTAD) and 0.95 (Berkeley-MHAD)
- Multi-view approaches produce predictions with less uncertainty while maintaining coverage guarantees
- Coverage guarantee of at least 95% is achieved across all tested models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multi-view models produce predictions with less uncertainty than single-view models
- Mechanism: By aggregating complementary information from multiple heterogeneous sensors, multi-view models can reduce prediction set size (uncertainty) while maintaining coverage guarantees via conformal prediction framework
- Core assumption: Different sensors provide independent or complementary information about the same phenomenon
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Results show that multi-view models outperform single-view models... in conformal measures that provide uncertainty estimation"
  - [section 2.2]: "Multi-view learning aims to optimize the way several views are combined with the objective of increasing the final performance of a model"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no direct citations matching this claim, though related multi-view learning papers exist
- Break condition: If sensors are highly correlated or redundant, the benefit of multi-view fusion diminishes

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-view stacking (MV-S) outperforms other multi-view approaches in both accuracy and uncertainty measures
- Mechanism: Stacked generalization combines first-level learners from each view with a meta-learner that learns optimal combination weights, outperforming simple feature concatenation (MV-A) and intersection (MV-I)
- Core assumption: A meta-learner can learn better combinations of view-specific predictions than simple aggregation methods
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Specifically, MV-S achieved the best performance in most measures"
  - [section 3.2]: Details the MV-S algorithm using first-level learners and meta-learner
  - [corpus]: No direct citations for MV-S superiority, but stacking is a well-established ensemble method
- Break condition: If first-level learners are highly correlated or if the meta-learner overfits to training data

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Conformal prediction framework provides marginal confidence guarantees for individual predictions
- Mechanism: Uses non-conformity scores and p-values to create prediction sets that contain the true label with probability at least 1-ϵ
- Core assumption: Calibration set is independent from training set and drawn from same distribution
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our models provide theoretical marginal confidence guarantees since they are based on the conformal prediction framework"
  - [section 2.3]: Detailed explanation of conformal prediction algorithm and coverage guarantees
  - [corpus]: No direct citations for this specific framework application, but conformal prediction is well-established
- Break condition: If calibration set is not representative of test distribution or if independence assumption is violated

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Conformal prediction framework
  - Why needed here: Provides theoretical guarantees for confidence quantification in individual predictions
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between the error tolerance ϵ and the coverage guarantee 1-ϵ?

- Concept: Multi-view learning approaches
  - Why needed here: Different methods (aggregation, stacking, intersection) offer different tradeoffs for combining heterogeneous sensor data
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between MV-A, MV-S, and MV-I approaches?

- Concept: Performance metrics for conformal prediction
  - Why needed here: Traditional accuracy metrics don't capture uncertainty; conformal measures like set size and coverage are essential
  - Quick check question: Why is smaller prediction set size preferred in conformal prediction?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data preprocessing → Feature extraction (per view) → Base model training (per view or aggregated) → Conformal calibration → Prediction set generation
  - Three multi-view architectures: MV-A (feature concatenation), MV-S (stacked generalization), MV-I (intersection of conformal sets)

- Critical path:
  - Feature extraction → Base model training → Conformal calibration → Evaluation
  - The calibration step is critical as it determines the p-values and prediction set boundaries

- Design tradeoffs:
  - MV-A: Simple but may lose view-specific information in concatenation
  - MV-S: More complex but potentially better performance; risk of overfitting
  - MV-I: Guarantees conservative predictions but may be too restrictive

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor coverage: Calibration set not representative of test distribution
  - Large prediction sets: Base models not confident; may need better feature extraction or more training data
  - MV-S overfitting: High variance in cross-validation results

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare set sizes and F1-scores of single-view vs multi-view models on HTAD dataset
  2. Test coverage guarantee by checking if prediction sets contain true labels in at least 95% of cases
  3. Analyze co-occurrence patterns between classes in prediction sets to understand model behavior

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of multi-view conformal models change as the number of sensor views increases beyond three, and is there an optimal number of views for maximizing prediction accuracy and minimizing uncertainty?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the models were tested with 2 and 3 views and suggests exploring the behavior as more views are added as future work.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tested the models with up to 3 views, leaving the performance characteristics with more views unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing the models with 4 or more sensor views, comparing their performance in terms of accuracy and uncertainty metrics to determine the optimal number of views.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the choice of underlying machine learning model (e.g., neural networks, support vector machines) for each view affect the overall performance of multi-view conformal models compared to using a single model type like Random Forest?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper used Random Forest for all experiments and mentions that different models may be more suitable for each type of view as future work.
- Why unresolved: The paper did not explore the impact of using different underlying models for each view on the overall performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments using various combinations of underlying models (e.g., neural networks, SVMs) for different views and comparing their performance to the Random Forest-based models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can sensor selection be optimized using techniques like Bayesian optimization to improve the performance of multi-view conformal models, and how does this compare to using all available sensors?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests using Bayesian optimization for sensor selection as future work.
- Why unresolved: The paper did not implement or test sensor selection optimization techniques.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the performance of multi-view conformal models using all available sensors versus models with optimized sensor subsets selected using Bayesian optimization or similar techniques.

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to relatively small datasets (HTAD and Berkeley-MHAD) which may not generalize to larger-scale applications
- Random Forest used as base classifier without exploring other architectures that might yield different performance characteristics
- Confidence guarantees are marginal (1-ϵ) rather than conditional on specific input features
- MV-S superiority based on single dataset split, may vary with different partitions

## Confidence
- Multi-view models outperform single-view: Medium
- MV-S superiority: Medium
- Conformal framework provides valid confidence guarantees: High

## Next Checks
1. Test the multi-view models on additional heterogeneous sensor datasets with larger sample sizes to verify generalizability
2. Evaluate the impact of different base classifiers (CNN, LSTM) on multi-view performance
3. Assess the robustness of coverage guarantees under distribution shift by testing on out-of-distribution sensor data
