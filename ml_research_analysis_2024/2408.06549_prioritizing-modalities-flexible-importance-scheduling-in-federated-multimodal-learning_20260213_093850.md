# Prioritizing Modalities: Flexible Importance Scheduling in Federated Multimodal Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2408.06549
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06549
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: FlexMod achieves faster convergence than conventional MFL while maintaining comparable accuracy

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses computational efficiency in multimodal federated learning (MFL) by proposing FlexMod, which adaptively allocates training frequencies to modality encoders based on their importance and training complexity. The method uses prototype learning to assess encoder quality, Shapley values to quantify modality importance, and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to optimize resource allocation. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that FlexMod achieves faster convergence compared to conventional MFL approaches while maintaining comparable accuracy to methods that train all modalities equally.

## Method Summary
FlexMod improves computational efficiency in multimodal federated learning by adaptively scheduling training resources across modality encoders. The method operates through three main steps: first, it quantifies modality combination factors using prototype learning to assess encoder quality and Shapley values to quantify modality importance; second, it formulates an optimization problem using DDPG to determine training frequency for each modality combination; and third, it organizes training order based on cardinality in descending order. At each global round, the server computes global prototypes from local prototypes, calculates modality importance via Shapley values, determines a weighting factor βr using DDPG, and solves a convex optimization problem to allocate training frequencies to modality combinations.

## Key Results
- FlexMod achieves faster convergence compared to conventional MFL approaches on three real-world datasets
- The method maintains comparable accuracy to approaches that train all modalities equally
- FlexMod outperforms two baselines (Entire Update and Partial Update) in convergence speed while achieving similar final accuracy

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
FlexMod achieves faster convergence by adaptively allocating training frequencies to modality encoders based on their importance and training complexity. The method uses prototype learning to assess encoder quality, Shapley values to quantify modality importance, and DDPG to optimize resource allocation. This allows prioritization of critical modalities while reducing training time for less important ones.

### Mechanism 2
Prototype learning provides an effective way to assess modality encoder quality by measuring the distinctiveness of global prototypes across classes. Local prototypes are computed at each client, aggregated to global prototypes at the server, and cosine similarity is used to quantify encoder quality. Lower cosine similarity indicates better-trained encoders requiring less frequent updates.

### Mechanism 3
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DDPG) effectively determines the optimal weighting factor between modality importance and encoder quality for resource allocation decisions. DDPG agent takes as input modality importance and quality vectors, outputs a continuous weighting factor βr, and is trained using rewards based on validation accuracy improvement.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Federated Learning (FL) basics**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how FL differs from centralized learning is crucial for grasping why modality scheduling is important in distributed settings
  - Quick check question: In FL, what key privacy benefit is achieved compared to centralized learning?

- **Concept: Prototype learning**
  - Why needed here: Prototypes are used to assess encoder quality and guide resource allocation decisions
  - Quick check question: How are global prototypes computed from local prototypes in this work?

- **Concept: Shapley values**
  - Why needed here: Shapley values quantify modality importance by measuring marginal contribution to model performance
  - Quick check question: What is the range of normalized Shapley values used in this work?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Client side (modality encoders, local prototype computation, local training) -> Server side (global prototype aggregation, Shapley value computation, DDPG agent, convex optimization) -> Communication (local prototypes and model updates)

- **Critical path**:
  1. Clients compute local prototypes after training
  2. Clients send local prototypes to server
  3. Server aggregates global prototypes
  4. Server computes modality importance (Shapley) and quality (prototype similarity)
  5. Server uses DDPG to determine weighting factor βr
  6. Server solves convex optimization to determine training frequencies
  7. Server broadcasts allocation decisions to clients
  8. Clients execute training according to allocation

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Communication overhead vs. accuracy: Sending local prototypes adds communication but enables better resource allocation
  - Training time vs. convergence speed: Allocating more time to important modalities may slow individual rounds but accelerate overall convergence
  - Model complexity vs. performance: More sophisticated encoders may extract better features but require more training resources

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Slow convergence despite high resource allocation suggests incorrect importance or quality assessment
  - High variance in performance across clients indicates non-IID issues not properly handled
  - DDPG training instability (oscillating βr) suggests poor reward signal or insufficient exploration

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Run baseline Entire Update method with fixed training frequencies on UCI-HAR dataset
  2. Implement prototype-based quality assessment and verify cosine similarity values make sense
  3. Train DDPG agent to determine βr values and validate they adapt to changing state conditions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- The paper explicitly states as a limitation that extending FlexMod to handle client partial participation scenarios is a future research direction, requiring new theoretical analysis and experimental validation.

## Limitations
- Claims about faster convergence and comparable accuracy are based on experiments with three specific datasets, which may not generalize to all multimodal learning scenarios.
- The computational overhead of the prototype learning and Shapley value calculations at the server side is not explicitly discussed, potentially offsetting some efficiency gains.
- The method's behavior under highly non-IID data distributions or with a large number of modalities remains unclear.

## Confidence
- Mechanism 1 (adaptive allocation): Medium confidence - supported by experimental results but relies on accurate assessment of importance and quality
- Mechanism 2 (prototype quality assessment): Medium confidence - prototype learning is established but its use for encoder quality assessment is novel
- Mechanism 3 (DDPG for weighting factor): Low confidence - reinforcement learning approach is complex and sensitive to implementation details

## Next Checks
1. Perform ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each component (prototype learning, Shapley values, DDPG) to overall performance
2. Test the method with synthetic data where ground truth modality importance is known to validate the Shapley value calculations
3. Analyze the communication overhead of sending local prototypes compared to traditional MFL approaches to verify claimed efficiency gains
