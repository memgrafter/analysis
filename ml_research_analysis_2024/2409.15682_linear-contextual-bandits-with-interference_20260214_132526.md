# Linear Contextual Bandits with Interference

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.15682
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15682
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: First framework addressing interference in Linear Contextual Bandits with sublinear regret bounds O(√T log T)

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel framework for handling interference in Linear Contextual Bandits (LinCB) by explicitly modeling how actions on one unit affect rewards for other units through an interference matrix. The authors extend three classical LinCB algorithms (Epsilon-Greedy, UCB, Thompson Sampling) to interference-aware versions (LinEGWI, LinUCBWI, LinTSWI) by transforming covariates to incorporate interference effects. The framework provides comprehensive theoretical guarantees including sublinear regret bounds, finite-sample upper bounds, and asymptotic properties such as the asymptotic normality of the online OLS estimator and optimal value function estimator.

## Method Summary
The proposed framework addresses interference in LinCB by introducing a transformed covariate vector that captures how actions on other units affect a unit's reward. The key innovation is using a known interference matrix W_t to construct this transformation, allowing the algorithms to account for spillover effects. The paper extends three classical LinCB algorithms by modifying their exploration mechanisms and reward estimation procedures to work with the transformed covariates. Theoretical analysis establishes that under proper exploration conditions (p_t > O(N̄_t^(-1/2))), the online OLS estimator achieves asymptotic normality, and the optimal value function estimator also converges to a normal distribution. The framework provides both finite-sample and asymptotic regret bounds, with the latter showing O(√T log T) regret under appropriate conditions.

## Key Results
- Proposed algorithms achieve sublinear regret bounds of O(√T log T) in the presence of interference
- Asymptotic normality established for both the online OLS estimator and optimal value function estimator
- Simulation studies show significant performance improvement over classical LinCB algorithms under interference scenarios
- Synthetic MovieLens data experiments demonstrate effectiveness in recommendation system settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by explicitly modeling interference through a transformation of the contextual features. By incorporating the interference matrix W_t into the covariate representation, the algorithms can account for how actions on one unit affect rewards for other units. This transformation allows the same linear bandit machinery to be applied while capturing the complex dependencies introduced by interference. The theoretical guarantees stem from showing that under sufficient exploration (via the clipping rate p_t), the transformed covariate space maintains the properties needed for standard linear bandit analysis, including concentration inequalities and asymptotic normality.

## Foundational Learning
- **Interference modeling in bandits**: Essential for extending classical bandit algorithms to networked or multi-agent settings where actions have spillover effects
  - Quick check: Verify that the interference matrix W_t correctly captures the known dependencies between units
- **Transformed covariate construction**: Critical for incorporating interference effects while maintaining linear structure
  - Quick check: Confirm that the transformation preserves the linearity assumption needed for the bandit algorithms
- **Asymptotic normality in online settings**: Key for establishing the statistical properties of the estimators
  - Quick check: Ensure the clipping rate p_t satisfies p_t > O(N̄_t^(-1/2)) for sufficient exploration
- **Sublinear regret analysis**: Fundamental for proving the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms
  - Quick check: Verify that the regret bounds scale as O(√T log T) in the simulation results

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Context features X_ti -> Interference matrix W_t -> Transformed covariates -> Bandit algorithm (LinEGWI/LinUCBWI/LinTSWI) -> Action selection -> Reward feedback

**Critical Path:**
1. Generate contextual features and interference matrix for each round
2. Transform covariates using the interference matrix
3. Apply exploration mechanism based on algorithm type
4. Select action using bandit policy
5. Receive reward and update estimators
6. Repeat for T rounds and compute regret

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Known vs. unknown interference matrix: The framework assumes W_t is known, which enables precise modeling but limits applicability
- Exploration rate vs. asymptotic properties: Higher exploration ensures theoretical guarantees but may reduce short-term performance
- Linear vs. nonlinear modeling: The linear assumption simplifies analysis but may miss complex interference patterns

**Failure Signatures:**
- Regret curves showing linear growth instead of sublinear behavior indicates incorrect implementation of the transformed covariates or exploration mechanism
- Violation of asymptotic normality suggests insufficient exploration (p_t too small) or model misspecification
- Poor performance relative to classical algorithms may indicate incorrect interference matrix construction or inappropriate parameter settings

**First Experiments:**
1. Implement LinEGWI with simple synthetic data (2-3 units, known W) and verify that regret grows sublinearly
2. Test LinUCBWI on MovieLens data with the provided preprocessing steps and compare against standard LinUCB
3. Validate asymptotic normality of the OLS estimator by checking if the normalized estimator follows a standard normal distribution in simulation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
1. How does the choice of interference matrix W affect the asymptotic variance of the optimal value function estimator V*?
2. Can the proposed framework be extended to handle unknown interference matrices W?
3. How robust are the proposed algorithms to model misspecification when the true reward function is not linear in the transformed covariates?

## Limitations
- Assumes known interference matrix W_t, which may not be available in real-world applications
- Computational complexity may increase significantly with the number of units and context dimensions
- Theoretical guarantees rely on specific structural conditions on W_t that may not hold in practice
- Simulation results use simplified interference patterns that may not capture real-world complexity

## Confidence
- Theoretical guarantees and regret bounds: High
- Simulation results demonstrating improved performance: Medium
- Asymptotic normality claims: Medium
- Practical applicability and scalability: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test the algorithms on real-world datasets with more complex interference structures, such as social network data or multi-agent systems, to validate practical performance beyond synthetic scenarios
2. Conduct sensitivity analysis on the clipping rate p_t and exploration parameters to determine their impact on regret bounds and asymptotic properties in different interference regimes
3. Evaluate computational efficiency and scalability by testing the algorithms with increasing numbers of units and context dimensions to identify potential bottlenecks in practical deployment
