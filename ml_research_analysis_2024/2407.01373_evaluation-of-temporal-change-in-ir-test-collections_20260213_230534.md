# Evaluation of Temporal Change in IR Test Collections

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2407.01373
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01373
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Proposed methodology quantifies temporal changes in IR test collections using CRUD classification and adapted reproducibility measures

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the temporal reliability of IR test collections by proposing a methodology to systematically quantify changes over time. Changes in document collections, topics, and relevance labels are classified using CRUD operations, and adapted reproducibility measures (RBO, RMSE, RΔ, ΔRI) are used to assess retrieval effectiveness changes. Experiments on three evolving test collections (TripClick, TREC-COVID, LongEval) with five state-of-the-art systems show that retrieval effectiveness strongly depends on the evaluation scenario and time span. While bpref appears more stable than other measures, no single system consistently outperforms others over time. The results highlight that IR evaluations are not temporally persistent and that the proposed methodology enables deeper insights into system robustness under evolving conditions.

## Method Summary
The methodology classifies temporal changes in IR test collections using CRUD operations (Create, Update, Delete) to systematically categorize changes in documents, topics, and relevance labels. This classification enables controlled experimentation across different evaluation scenarios. Adapted reproducibility measures (RBO for ranking similarity, RMSE for effectiveness differences, RΔ for raw effectiveness changes, ΔRI for relative effectiveness changes) are applied to compare retrieval results across time points. The approach is validated using three evolving test collections (TripClick, TREC-COVID, LongEval) with five state-of-the-art retrieval systems, examining how temporal changes affect retrieval effectiveness at multiple levels of granularity.

## Key Results
- Retrieval effectiveness strongly depends on evaluation scenario and time span, with no single system consistently outperforming others
- bpref measure shows greater stability across time points compared to other evaluation measures
- Adapted reproducibility measures successfully capture temporal changes, with RBO showing clear ranking degradation over time
- The ΔRI measure using BM25 as pivot provides nuanced insights into system adaptation to temporal changes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Using CRUD classification of changes allows systematic design of temporal IR experiments without deep content analysis.
- **Mechanism:** By mapping changes in documents, topics, and qrels to CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE operations, researchers can categorize and isolate the impact of each type of change on retrieval effectiveness. This abstraction enables controlled experimentation and clear attribution of performance differences.
- **Core assumption:** The high-level CRUD operations sufficiently capture the nature of changes affecting retrieval performance, and finer-grained content analysis is unnecessary for isolating effects.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "We generalize Cranfield-type experiments to the temporal context by classifying the change in the essential components according to the create, update, and delete operations of persistent storage known as CRUD."
  - [section 3] "For a high-level classification, to distinguish how the components change, we align the changes to the basic operations of persistent storage CREATE, UPDATE, and DELETE known as CRUD."
  - [corpus] Found related work on synthetic test collections and temporal evaluation, supporting the relevance of change classification in IR.
- **Break condition:** If certain types of content changes (e.g., semantic drift, topical shifts) are not adequately represented by CRUD operations, the classification may fail to isolate critical effects on retrieval performance.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Adapting reproducibility measures (RBO, RMSE, RΔ, ΔRI) enables quantification of temporal changes in retrieval effectiveness without requiring identical test collections over time.
- **Mechanism:** These measures compare retrieval results or effectiveness scores across different time points, accounting for changes in document rankings (RBO), relevance labels (RMSE), and relative system performance (RΔ, ΔRI). They provide multiple lenses to assess how effectiveness changes as the evaluation environment evolves.
- **Core assumption:** The adapted measures can meaningfully capture changes in retrieval effectiveness despite differences in test collections, and their behavior is interpretable in the temporal context.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "From the different types of change different evaluation scenarios are derived and it is outlined what they imply. Based on these scenarios, renowned state-of-the-art retrieval systems are tested and it is investigated how the retrieval effectiveness changes on different levels of granularity."
  - [section 4] "We show that the proposed measures can be well adapted to describe the changes in the retrieval results."
  - [section 6] "The RBO is determined for rankings of the top 100 documents and clearly decreases over time... The difference in effectiveness measured by the RMSE generally agrees with the ranking similarity described by the RBO."
- **Break condition:** If the measures are overly sensitive to changes in the evaluation environment that do not reflect actual user experience (e.g., minor document reordering), or if they fail to account for specific types of temporal dynamics (e.g., gradual semantic shifts), their interpretability and usefulness may break down.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Using a pivot system (e.g., BM25) in ΔRI calculations helps isolate environmental effects from system performance changes over time.
- **Mechanism:** By comparing the relative improvement of an experimental system against a pivot system at different time points, ΔRI dampens the influence of changes in the evaluation environment, making effectiveness changes more attributable to the system's adaptation to temporal dynamics.
- **Core assumption:** The pivot system's performance is stable enough across time points to serve as a meaningful baseline, and the relative improvement metric captures relevant aspects of system behavior.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 4] "The ΔRI can be seen as the reproducibility approach to the RΔ... First, the Relative Improvement (RI) is calculated as the per-topic delta between the measured effectiveness given a measure 𝑀 for the experimental system 𝑆 and the pivot system 𝑃, separately on EE and EE'."
  - [section 7] "Like before on TripClick, the ΔRI indicates less strong changes, especially if based on bpref but also for P@10 and nDCG... The more nuanced differences between the ΔRIs, compared to the dynamic R𝑒 Δ, can be interpreted as an initial validation of the ΔRI comparison strategy."
  - [corpus] Related work on pivot evaluation strategies supports the approach of using a baseline system to account for environmental changes.
- **Break condition:** If the pivot system's performance degrades significantly over time or if the relative improvement metric does not capture the aspects of system performance most relevant to users, the ΔRI may not provide meaningful insights into system adaptation to temporal changes.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Information Retrieval (IR) evaluation using the Cranfield paradigm.
  - **Why needed here:** The work builds upon and extends the Cranfield paradigm to account for temporal changes, so understanding the traditional setup is crucial.
  - **Quick check question:** What are the three core components of a Cranfield test collection, and how are they typically used to evaluate IR systems?

- **Concept:** Reproducibility and replicability in IR experiments.
  - **Why needed here:** The work adapts measures originally designed for reproducibility assessments to quantify temporal changes, so familiarity with these concepts is necessary.
  - **Quick check question:** How do reproducibility measures like RBO and RMSE differ in their approach to comparing retrieval results, and what aspects of the results do they capture?

- **Concept:** CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and their application in data management.
  - **Why needed here:** The work uses CRUD as a high-level classification schema for temporal changes in IR test collections, so understanding this concept is essential.
  - **Quick check question:** How can the CRUD operations be mapped to changes in the components of an IR test collection (documents, topics, qrels), and what evaluation scenarios do these mappings imply?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Test Collections (TripClick, TREC-COVID, LongEval) -> Retrieval Systems (BM25, MonoT5, ColBERT, Doc2Query, RRF) -> Evaluation Measures (RBO, RMSE, RΔ, ΔRI) -> Codebase (repro_eval toolkit, PyTerrier, Ranx)

- **Critical path:** 1. Select test collection and define evolving evaluation environments based on CRUD classification 2. Run retrieval systems on each environment to generate results 3. Apply adapted reproducibility measures to compare results across time points 4. Analyze results to understand temporal effects on effectiveness

- **Design tradeoffs:** Using high-level CRUD classification simplifies analysis but may miss nuanced semantic changes; adapting reproducibility measures enables temporal analysis but may not fully capture user-perceived quality changes; relying on pivot system in ΔRI calculations helps isolate environmental effects but assumes pivot stability

- **Failure signatures:** Inconsistent or counterintuitive results from adapted measures indicating assumption violations; results not aligning with known collection/system characteristics suggesting experimental issues; analysis failing to provide clear insights into system adaptation suggesting limitations in approach

- **First 3 experiments:** 1. Run all systems on initial EE of test collection and record baseline effectiveness 2. Apply adapted RBO measure to compare document rankings between initial EE and first evolved EE for single system 3. Calculate RMSE for same system and EE comparison using single measure (e.g., P@10) to assess effectiveness changes while accounting for relevance labels

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can we quantify the relative importance of different types of changes (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE) in the document collection on retrieval effectiveness?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper states "how the results change over time depends on the type and degree of changes in the collection" and notes that "not all changes are equally important."
- **Why unresolved:** The paper only classifies changes using CRUD operations but does not provide a principled way to measure or compare the impact of different change types on retrieval effectiveness.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Experiments measuring the effect of each CRUD operation type separately and in combination, along with correlation analysis between change statistics and effectiveness measures.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What is the optimal pivot system for measuring temporal changes in retrieval effectiveness using the ΔRI measure?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper discusses the choice of pivot system as a "key question" and notes that different characteristics might be necessary compared to reproducibility evaluations.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper uses BM25 as a default pivot system but acknowledges that the quality of the pivot system affects the interpretability of ΔRI scores, particularly in temporal settings.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Systematic comparison of different pivot system choices across multiple test collections and evaluation scenarios, measuring their stability and effectiveness at capturing true system performance changes.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How do temporal changes in retrieval effectiveness translate to user experience and perceived search quality?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The paper notes "we notice changes in retrieval effectiveness but what does this actually mean for the users?" and discusses the gap between system-oriented measures and user perception.
- **Why unresolved:** The experiments focus on system-oriented measures (RBO, RMSE, RΔ, ΔRI) without directly measuring user satisfaction or perceived quality changes across different time periods.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** User studies measuring satisfaction and perceived search quality across evolving document collections, correlating these perceptions with system effectiveness metrics.

## Limitations

- The CRUD classification may not adequately capture complex semantic or topical shifts in document collections that significantly impact retrieval performance
- Adapted reproducibility measures may be overly sensitive to environmental changes that don't reflect actual user experience, particularly RMSE with evolving relevance labels
- Conclusions about system stability are based on only three test collections, limiting generalizability to other temporal dynamics and domains

## Confidence

- **CRUD-based change classification:** High - Well-established data management concept effectively applied to IR temporal analysis
- **Adapted reproducibility measure effectiveness:** Medium - Successfully captures temporal changes but sensitivity to environmental factors requires careful interpretation
- **System stability conclusions:** Medium - Results demonstrate clear temporal effects but limited test collection diversity constrains generalizability

## Next Checks

1. Test the methodology on additional test collections with different temporal dynamics (e.g., news corpora, social media streams) to assess generalizability across domains
2. Conduct user studies to validate whether observed effectiveness changes align with perceived retrieval quality changes over time
3. Compare the adapted reproducibility measures against alternative temporal evaluation approaches, such as time-aware IR metrics or drift detection algorithms, to assess relative effectiveness and identify potential improvements
