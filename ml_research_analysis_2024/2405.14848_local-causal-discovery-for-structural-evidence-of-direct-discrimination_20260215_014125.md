# Local Causal Discovery for Structural Evidence of Direct Discrimination

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.14848
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14848
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: LD3 detects evidence of direct discrimination while running 42× to 5870× faster than baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces LD3, a local causal discovery method designed to detect structural evidence of direct discrimination in fairness analysis. LD3 efficiently identifies the causal parents of an outcome variable through a linear number of conditional independence tests, enabling the assessment of the structural direct criterion (SDC) and valid adjustment for weighted controlled direct effect (CDE) estimation. Applied to liver transplant allocation data, LD3 detected evidence of direct sex-based discrimination and outperformed baseline methods (PC and LDECC) in efficiency, running 42× to 5870× faster while returning more plausible causal structures. The work bridges the gap between causal fairness theory and practice by enabling scalable, interpretable analysis in complex real-world domains.

## Method Summary
LD3 is a local causal discovery algorithm that identifies the causal parents of an outcome variable to enable structural direct criterion (SDC) assessment and valid adjustment for weighted controlled direct effect (CDE) estimation. The method performs a linear number of conditional independence tests relative to the number of variables, using a partition-based approach to efficiently determine which variables are parents of the outcome. Under assumptions that the outcome has no descendants and all its parents are observed, LD3 returns an adjustment set ADE that blocks all backdoor and frontdoor paths for valid CDE identification. The algorithm is specifically designed for fairness analysis where the goal is to detect direct discrimination through structural evidence rather than global causal discovery.

## Key Results
- LD3 runs 42× to 5870× faster than baseline methods (PC and LDECC) on real-world liver transplant allocation data
- The method detected evidence of direct sex-based discrimination in the liver transplant dataset
- LD3 returned more plausible causal structures than baselines, avoiding spurious edges and correctly identifying the absence of outcome descendants

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LD3 identifies causal parents of the outcome efficiently through a linear number of conditional independence tests.
- Mechanism: LD3 uses a constrained set of independence tests based on the causal partition taxonomy, avoiding the exponential search space of global methods. By only considering variables that could be parents of the outcome and using efficient partition-based filtering, it limits unnecessary tests.
- Core assumption: All parents of the outcome are observed (Assumption A2) and the outcome has no descendants in the observed set (Assumption A1).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "LD3 performs a linear number of conditional independence tests relative to variable set size"
  - [section] "The number of independence tests performed scales linearly with the number of nodes"
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct citations on test complexity, but aligns with constraint-based discovery literature.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The adjustment set returned by LD3 is valid for estimating the weighted controlled direct effect (CDE).
- Mechanism: The adjustment set ADE contains exactly the parents of the outcome (confounders and mediators). This blocks all backdoor paths for {X,Y} and {M,Y}, and frontdoor paths for {X,Y}, ensuring identifiability of the weighted CDE under the specified conditions.
- Core assumption: The structural conditions for CDE identification are met, specifically that no confounders for {M,Y} are descendants of X.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We prove that this criterion is satisfied by the structural knowledge returned by LD3"
  - [section] "We prove that this criterion is satisfied by the structural knowledge returned by LD3, enhancing the accessibility of this causal fairness measure"
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct citations on the weighted CDE graphical criterion, but follows from established causal inference theory.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: LD3 provides more interpretable and plausible causal structures than global discovery baselines.
- Mechanism: By focusing only on the local subgraph relevant to the exposure-outcome pair, LD3 avoids including spurious or untrustworthy edges that can appear in global methods. The partition-based approach ensures that only causally relevant variables are considered for adjustment.
- Core assumption: The causal Markov, faithfulness, and acyclicity assumptions hold for the local subgraph.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "LD3 was more time-efficient and returned more plausible results on real-world data than baselines"
  - [section] "LD3 predicts that the outcome has children, which is known to be untrue" (contrast with baseline behavior)
  - [corpus] Weak: No direct citations on interpretability advantages, but consistent with local discovery literature.

## Foundational Learning

- Causal inference basics (DAGs, d-separation, backdoor criterion):
  - Why needed here: Understanding how causal graphs encode independence relationships and how adjustment sets work is fundamental to LD3's approach.
  - Quick check question: In a DAG where X → Y ← Z, what set of variables must be conditioned on to estimate the causal effect of X on Y?

- Causal discovery concepts (constraint-based methods, faithfulness, Markov property):
  - Why needed here: LD3 is a constraint-based method that relies on testing conditional independencies to infer causal structure.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between constraint-based and score-based causal discovery methods?

- Mediation analysis and direct/indirect effects:
  - Why needed here: The weighted CDE that LD3 enables estimation of is a measure of direct causal effect in the presence of mediators.
  - Quick check question: How does the controlled direct effect differ from the natural direct effect in mediation analysis?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Independence test engine -> Causal partition classifier -> Parent set extractor -> SDC evaluator -> Adjustment set builder
- Critical path: Independence test → Partition classification → Parent extraction → SDC evaluation → Adjustment set construction
- Design tradeoffs: Linear vs. quadratic vs. exponential test complexity; local vs. global structure discovery; strict vs. relaxed assumptions on unobserved variables
- Failure signatures: High runtime despite linear complexity (test implementation issue); incorrect parent identification (assumption violation); unstable SDC results across significance thresholds (sample size or test sensitivity issues)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test on a simple DAG with known parents to verify correct identification and runtime scaling
  2. Compare LD3's ADE with baseline methods on a benchmark dataset to verify validity and efficiency
  3. Apply to a synthetic dataset with direct discrimination to verify SDC detection and weighted CDE estimation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Open Question 1: Does LD3 maintain its efficiency advantage over baselines when applied to datasets with significantly higher dimensionality (e.g., 100+ variables)?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper notes LD3's linear complexity but only validates on datasets up to 18 variables. Efficiency claims are based on comparisons with baselines that scale exponentially/worst-case quadratically.
  - Why unresolved: The current evaluation focuses on relatively small feature sets (18 variables maximum). Scalability to high-dimensional domains remains untested.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Empirical runtime comparisons of LD3 vs. PC/LDECC on datasets with 50+ variables, showing whether the linear scaling advantage persists.

- Open Question 2: How robust is LD3's structural discovery to violations of the assumption that all parents of the outcome are observed?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors acknowledge this is a "sufficient but not necessary" condition for CDE identification and note that unobserved parents could lead to false positives in direct discrimination detection.
  - Why unresolved: The paper assumes (A2) holds but doesn't explore performance degradation when it's violated. This is critical since latent confounders are common in real-world data.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Simulation studies where some true outcome parents are hidden, measuring false positive/negative rates for both SDC detection and valid adjustment set recovery.

- Open Question 3: Does the weighted CDE provide more actionable insights than the natural direct effect (NDE) in practical fairness interventions?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors argue weighted CDE requires fewer assumptions and less prior structural knowledge than NDE, but acknowledge NDE has useful properties for certain forms of analysis.
  - Why unresolved: The paper favors weighted CDE for its practicality but doesn't empirically compare its utility for policy interventions against NDE-based approaches.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Case studies where both metrics are computed on the same real-world fairness problem, with domain experts evaluating which provides clearer guidance for intervention design.

## Limitations
- Assumes all parents of the outcome are observed (A2), which may not hold in real-world scenarios with latent confounders
- Assumes the outcome has no descendants in the observed set (A1), a strong condition that limits applicability
- Efficiency comparisons based on a single real-world dataset may not generalize to all domains

## Confidence
- High confidence: The linear complexity claim and basic algorithm mechanics (Mechanism 1)
- Medium confidence: The validity of the adjustment set for weighted CDE estimation (Mechanism 2)
- Medium confidence: The interpretability and plausibility advantages over baselines (Mechanism 3)

## Next Checks
1. Test LD3 on synthetic datasets with known causal structures where some parents of the outcome are unobserved to quantify how violations of assumption A2 affect SDC detection accuracy
2. Apply LD3 to multiple real-world fairness datasets beyond liver transplants to verify consistent efficiency gains and compare with additional baseline methods (e.g., FCI, GES)
3. Conduct ablation studies varying the significance threshold α for independence tests to understand its impact on both runtime and the stability of SDC results
