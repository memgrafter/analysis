## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Medical Video Generation (MVG) framework, the first approach to simulate disease progression in medical imaging using a zero-shot setting without requiring longitudinal data. The framework addresses the critical challenge of modeling disease trajectories by generating realistic, clinically plausible disease progressions from single medical images. By combining large language models for prompt generation, controllable diffusion models for disease state simulation, and video transition generation for interpolating between states, MVG achieves significant improvements in disease classification confidence while preserving patient identity across all three tested medical imaging domains.

## Method Summary
MVG employs a two-stage approach to simulate disease progression. First, it uses Progressive Image Editing (PIE) with diffusion models, region-of-interest masks, and GPT-4 re-captioning to generate distinct disease states from a single medical image. Second, it applies the SEINE transition generation model to interpolate between these disease states, creating smooth video sequences that represent disease progression. The framework was validated across chest X-ray, fundus photography, and skin image datasets, demonstrating superior performance over baseline models in generating coherent disease trajectories while maintaining high CLIP-I scores for identity preservation.

## Key Results
- Achieved 76.2% physician agreement rate with physician expectations for generated disease progression sequences
- Significant improvements in disease classification confidence scores across all three medical imaging domains
- Maintained high CLIP-I identity preservation scores (>0.75) across chest X-ray, fundus photography, and skin image datasets
- Demonstrated superior performance over baseline models in generating coherent and clinically plausible disease trajectories

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages the complementary strengths of diffusion models for controlled image editing and large language models for semantic understanding of disease progression. By using GPT-4 to generate disease-specific prompts and region masks to constrain edits, the approach ensures that generated disease states are both visually realistic and clinically meaningful. The SEINE model then bridges these discrete states with smooth transitions, creating natural-looking progression sequences that preserve patient identity while showing clear disease evolution.

## Foundational Learning
- **Diffusion Models**: Generate new data by reversing a noise-adding process; needed for controlled image editing with disease progression; quick check: validate that generated images show consistent disease manifestations
- **CLIP-I Score**: Measures identity preservation between images using vision-language embeddings; needed to ensure patient identity remains consistent across progression; quick check: verify CLIP-I scores exceed 0.75 threshold
- **Region-of-Interest Masking**: Constrains image edits to specific anatomical areas; needed to focus disease progression on relevant regions; quick check: confirm masks accurately align with disease-affected areas
- **SEINE Transition Generation**: Interpolates between discrete states to create smooth video sequences; needed to make disease progression appear natural; quick check: validate temporal coherence of generated videos
- **GPT-4 Prompt Generation**: Creates semantically meaningful disease progression descriptions; needed to guide diffusion models toward clinically accurate edits; quick check: verify generated prompts align with medical terminology
- **Zero-shot Learning**: Simulates disease progression without longitudinal training data; needed to address data scarcity in medical imaging; quick check: confirm framework works across diverse medical imaging modalities

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Single Medical Image + Clinical Report -> GPT-4 Prompt Generation -> Region Mask Extraction -> Progressive Image Editing (Diffusion) -> SEINE Transition Generation -> Disease Progression Video

Critical Path:
Clinical Report -> GPT-4 Re-captioning -> Region Mask Generation -> Diffusion-based Disease State Editing -> SEINE Interpolation -> Final Video Output

Design Tradeoffs:
- Precision vs. Creativity: Region masks constrain edits for clinical accuracy but may limit natural disease variation
- Identity vs. Progression: CLIP-I preservation ensures patient consistency but must allow meaningful disease manifestation changes
- Computational Cost vs. Quality: Multiple diffusion steps improve realism but increase generation time and resource requirements

Failure Signatures:
- No disease progression: Poor region mask accuracy or inadequate GPT-4 prompt specificity
- Unrealistic images: Excessive noise strength or inappropriate diffusion parameters
- Identity loss: Insufficient CLIP-I preservation or aggressive editing parameters
- Inconsistent progression: Poor SEINE interpolation or incompatible disease state generation

First Experiments:
1. Validate CLIP-I preservation by generating disease states with minimal progression changes
2. Test region mask accuracy by comparing generated edits against ground truth disease locations
3. Evaluate GPT-4 prompt quality by having clinicians rate semantic accuracy of generated descriptions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Framework performance relies heavily on subjective physician assessment, potentially introducing confirmation bias
- Zero-shot approach may generate plausible-looking but clinically inaccurate disease trajectories without longitudinal validation
- CLIP-I identity preservation metric does not account for semantic drift in disease manifestations across progression stages

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Disease classification confidence improvements | High |
| CLIP-I identity preservation scores | High |
| Physician user preference study results | Medium |
| Clinical plausibility of generated progressions | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Compare generated disease trajectories against actual longitudinal medical imaging datasets to validate clinical accuracy of progression patterns
2. Conduct double-blind physician evaluation where clinicians must distinguish between real patient progression sequences and MVG-generated sequences
3. Implement ablation studies testing the framework's sensitivity to GPT-4 prompt variations and different region-of-interest mask specifications to establish robustness boundaries
