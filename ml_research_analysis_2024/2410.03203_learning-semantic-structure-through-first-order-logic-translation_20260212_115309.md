# Learning Semantic Structure through First-Order-Logic Translation

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2410.03203
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03203
- **Reference count**: 8
- **Primary result**: Encoder models overfit to training patterns while LLMs show better generalization but still struggle with complex predicate-argument structures

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates whether transformer-based language models can learn predicate argument structure from simple sentences using two approaches: question answering (Q/A) and first-order logic (FOL) translation. The authors find that encoder models overfit to training patterns and fail to generalize to more complex sentences, while larger language models show better generalization but still have significant limitations. FOL translation proves more effective than Q/A prompting as it makes hallucinatory content obvious and fully determines predicate argument structure. The study concludes that finetuning on FOL translation is more effective than prompting for learning semantic structure, though both methods have significant limitations.

## Method Summary
The authors create synthetic datasets of increasing complexity (D1,1 through D3,3) containing sentences with multiple predicates and arguments. They test several models including BERT, RoBERTa, and large language models (Mistral-7B, Llama-2 variants, Llama-3-8B) using two approaches: finetuning on Q/A and FOL translation tasks, and prompting for Q/A. Evaluation uses accuracy metrics for both tasks, measuring exact matches for FOL and question-answering accuracy for Q/A. The experiments compare performance on simple training datasets versus more complex test datasets to assess generalization ability.

## Key Results
- Encoder models overfit to training patterns and fail to generalize to sentences with multiple predicates
- FOL translation yields better results than Q/A prompting as it makes hallucinatory content obvious and fully determines predicate argument structure
- Larger LLMs (Llama-2-13B, Llama-3-8B) show better generalization but still struggle with complex sentences, achieving only double-digit accuracy on most complex datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Encoder models overfit to training patterns and fail to generalize to more complex sentences involving multiple predicates. When finetuned on simple datasets, they memorize specific syntactic patterns rather than learning underlying predicate-argument mapping rules, leading to perfect performance on similar training patterns but random accuracy on novel combinations.

### Mechanism 2
FOL translation task is more effective than Q/A prompting for learning predicate-argument structure because it forces complete specification of logical relationships. Q/A prompting allows models to take shortcuts by computing simple patterns, while FOL translation requires explicit generation of all logical relationships, making it harder to cheat the system.

### Mechanism 3
Larger LLMs with more parameters show better generalization ability on complex predicate-argument structure tasks. Increased model capacity allows learning more abstract representations of predicate-argument relationships that can transfer to novel sentence structures, though still with limitations.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Predicate-argument structure** - Understanding how predicates (verbs, adjectives) relate to their arguments (subjects, objects) is fundamental to semantic interpretation. Quick check: Given "The red car was in front of the blue house," can you identify which predicate applies to which argument?

- **Concept: First-order logic representation** - FOL provides an unambiguous way to represent semantic relationships that can be used as training targets. Quick check: How would you translate "A big red car was in front of a small blue house" into FOL?

- **Concept: Generalization vs. overfitting** - The study examines whether models learn underlying patterns or just memorize training examples. Quick check: If a model achieves 99% accuracy on training data but 50% on test data with similar but novel patterns, is this good generalization?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Synthetic dataset generation → Model selection (BERT/RoBERTa/LLM) → Task selection (Q/A or FOL) → Training/finetuning → Evaluation on simple and complex datasets → Analysis of generalization

- **Critical path**: Dataset creation → Model selection → Task selection → Training/finetuning → Evaluation on simple and complex datasets → Analysis of generalization

- **Design tradeoffs**: Q/A is easier to implement but less rigorous; FOL translation is more complete but harder for models; finetuning gives better results than prompting but requires more resources

- **Failure signatures**: Overfitting (perfect training accuracy but poor test performance), glueing predicates together instead of using conjunctions, hallucination of unrelated content, treating semantically equivalent questions differently

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Test a pretrained encoder model on the simple D1,1 dataset to establish baseline performance
  2. Finetune the same encoder model on D1,1 and test on both D1,1 and more complex datasets to measure overfitting
  3. Prompt an LLM on D1,1 and compare performance with the finetuned encoder model to assess prompting effectiveness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Why do LLMs with more parameters (like Llama-2-13B and Llama-3-8B) generalize better to complex datasets but also hallucinate more frequently? The paper notes this trade-off but doesn't explain why larger models generalize better yet hallucinate more.

### Open Question 2
What specific aspects of question formulation cause LLMs to treat semantically equivalent questions differently? The paper finds LLMs are sensitive to surface-level differences in question phrasing but doesn't investigate the underlying reasons.

### Open Question 3
Can retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) effectively reduce hallucination in FOL translation without sacrificing generalization performance? The paper suggests RAG as a potential direction but doesn't test or validate this approach.

### Open Question 4
How would the inclusion of logical operators (e.g., negation, conjunction) in synthetic datasets affect models' ability to capture predicate argument structure? The paper explicitly avoids this complexity due to current model limitations.

## Limitations

- The synthetic nature of datasets may not capture full complexity of natural language, limiting real-world applicability
- Evaluation focuses on controlled, rule-based transformations that may not reflect true semantic understanding
- Comparison between Q/A and FOL translation assumes FOL is inherently more rigorous without exploring alternative evaluation approaches

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Encoder models overfit to training patterns and fail to generalize to more complex sentences
- **Medium confidence**: FOL translation is more effective than Q/A for learning predicate-argument structure
- **Medium confidence**: Larger LLMs show better generalization ability

## Next Checks

1. Test findings on naturalistic datasets with naturally occurring predicate-argument structures to assess real-world applicability

2. Implement semantic similarity metrics (like BERTScore or BLEURT) for FOL translation to capture partial credit and assess whether exact match is too stringent

3. Conduct ablation study on dataset complexity by systematically varying number and type of predicates, argument distances, and sentence structures to identify specific factors causing generalization failures
