core_contribution: The paper introduces a framework to assess the reliability, fairness,
  and diversity of text-to-image generative models by applying controlled perturbations
  to text encoder embeddings. Reliability is evaluated by measuring how small global
  and local perturbations in the embedding space affect the generated images; higher
  sensitivity indicates lower reliability.

# On the Fairness, Diversity and Reliability of Text-to-Image Generative Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2411.13981
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13981
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Novel framework using embedding perturbations to evaluate reliability, fairness, and diversity in text-to-image models

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for evaluating text-to-image generative models across three critical dimensions: reliability, fairness, and diversity. The authors propose using controlled perturbations to text encoder embeddings to systematically assess how models respond to minor input variations. Reliability is measured by the sensitivity of image generation to embedding perturbations, fairness by observing how token removal affects outputs, and diversity by measuring similarity across single-token prompts. The framework successfully identifies unreliable behaviors, detects intentional biases, and traces provenance of biases in various Stable Diffusion models, including intentionally biased variants.

## Method Summary
The framework evaluates text-to-image generative models by applying controlled perturbations to text encoder embeddings. For reliability assessment, both global and local perturbations are introduced to measure the resulting changes in generated images. Fairness is quantified by removing specific tokens from prompts under low guidance conditions to observe their influence on image generation. Diversity is assessed by measuring the similarity among images generated from a single-token prompt. The approach works in both grey-box and black-box settings, providing interpretable quantitative insights into model behavior. The methodology is validated on various Stable Diffusion models, including intentionally biased variants, demonstrating its effectiveness in revealing unreliable behavior and identifying bias triggers.

## Key Results
- Perturbed embeddings consistently reveal unreliable behavior across tested models
- Fairness and diversity evaluations effectively identify bias triggers in intentionally biased models
- The framework provides interpretable quantitative insights into model behavior in both grey-box and black-box settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework leverages the sensitivity of text-to-image models to input perturbations as a diagnostic tool. By systematically varying text embeddings and observing the resulting image changes, the authors create measurable indicators for model behavior. Reliability is directly related to the stability of the generation process - more sensitive models produce significantly different outputs from small input changes, indicating lower reliability. Fairness assessment works by isolating the contribution of individual tokens, revealing whether certain concepts or groups are systematically privileged or suppressed. Diversity measurement through single-token prompts exposes whether the model produces varied outputs or collapses to limited representations.

## Foundational Learning
- **Text encoder embeddings**: Vector representations of textual prompts that guide image generation - needed to understand the perturbation targets
- **Guidance scale**: Parameter controlling the trade-off between prompt adherence and output diversity - critical for interpreting fairness measurements
- **Latent diffusion process**: The core mechanism in Stable Diffusion where embeddings influence the denoising process - essential for understanding reliability sensitivity
- **Backdoor triggers**: Intentional biases embedded in models that can be activated by specific inputs - relevant for understanding fairness detection capabilities
- **Image similarity metrics**: Quantitative measures for comparing generated images - needed for diversity assessment
- **Grey-box vs black-box settings**: Different levels of model access for evaluation - important for practical applicability

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Text prompt -> Text encoder -> Embedding space -> Perturbation module -> Diffuser model -> Generated images
- **Critical path**: The flow from text input through embedding generation to final image output, with perturbations introduced at the embedding stage
- **Design tradeoffs**: Balance between perturbation magnitude (too small yields no signal, too large loses interpretability) and guidance scale (affects sensitivity and reliability detection)
- **Failure signatures**: High sensitivity to perturbations indicates unreliable models; consistent token removal effects reveal systematic biases; low diversity across single-token prompts indicates mode collapse
- **First experiments**: 1) Apply small Gaussian noise to embeddings and measure output variation; 2) Remove specific tokens from diverse prompts and compare outputs; 3) Generate multiple images from single-token prompts and compute similarity scores

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Framework's generalizability to non-diffusion architectures remains untested
- Perturbation magnitude thresholds require systematic calibration across different model families
- Fairness metric based on token removal may not capture complex intersectional biases
- Diversity metric using single-token prompts may not reflect multi-concept real-world scenarios

## Confidence
- **Reliability measurement**: High confidence in methodology and experimental validation
- **Fairness assessment**: Medium confidence due to simplified token removal approach
- **Diversity evaluation**: Medium confidence in single-token prompt methodology
- **Generalizability**: Low confidence in applicability to non-diffusion models

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on diffusion models with different architectural designs (latent diffusion vs pixel-space diffusion) to assess generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies to determine optimal perturbation magnitudes and guidance scales for different model families
3. Validate the framework against known benchmark datasets with documented biases to verify detection capabilities
