# Attributed Graph Clustering in Collaborative Settings

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12329

- First unsupervised method for attributed graph clustering in vertical collaborative settings, reducing communication from O(n) to O(k³)

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces kCAGC, the first unsupervised method for attributed graph clustering in vertical collaborative settings where different participants hold distinct features of the same data. The method leverages local clustering results to reduce the communication sample space from O(n) to O(k³), where k is the number of local clusters and n is the dataset size. By using secure aggregation for privacy protection, kCAGC achieves comparable accuracy to centralized methods on four public datasets (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, Wiki) while significantly reducing communication costs. The approach is theoretically analyzed under a "restricted proximity condition" and experimentally validated, showing training times within minutes even for large-scale graphs.

## Method Summary
kCAGC operates in vertical collaborative settings where L participants each hold a subset of features for the same graph data. The method applies graph convolution to smooth features, performs local k-means clustering on each participant's data to obtain local clusters, then exchanges cluster IDs to compute intersections. These intersections define a reduced sample space of virtual nodes (cluster centers) that are used for secure aggregation-based distance computations. Lloyd's algorithm is then applied to these virtual nodes to produce global clusters. The approach theoretically guarantees privacy through secure aggregation and achieves comparable clustering accuracy to centralized methods while reducing communication complexity from O(n) to O(k³).

## Key Results
- Reduces communication sample space from O(n) to O(k³) by using local cluster intersections
- Achieves comparable clustering accuracy to centralized methods on Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, and Wiki datasets
- Training times within minutes even for large-scale graphs with multiple participants
- Secure aggregation protects privacy while computing distances between virtual nodes and cluster centers

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Reducing sample space from O(n) to O(k³) by using local cluster intersections improves communication efficiency without harming clustering accuracy.
- Mechanism: Each participant performs k-means locally to obtain local clusters, then exchanges only cluster IDs to compute intersections. These intersections define a reduced sample space of virtual nodes (cluster centers), which are used for secure aggregation.
- Core assumption: Local clustering results preserve sufficient structural information to approximate centralized clustering when combined via intersections.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "leverages local clustering results to reduce the communication sample space from O(n) to O(k³)"
  - [section]: "we leverage local clusters on the sample space to help identify global clusters, thus reducing the sample space"
  - [corpus]: Weak - related works focus on augmentation and embedding but not intersection-based communication reduction.
- Break condition: If local clusters are poor quality (high misclustering rate), intersections will not capture true global structure, causing accuracy loss.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Secure aggregation protects privacy during distance computation between virtual nodes and cluster centers.
- Mechanism: Cryptographic operations compute sums of distances without revealing individual feature values, preventing participants from learning others' raw data.
- Core assumption: Secure aggregation protocols (like Bonawitz et al.) provide computational indistinguishability against semi-honest adversaries.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "By using secure aggregation for privacy protection"
  - [section]: "The privacy protection schemes for kCAGC are two-fold, incorporating both local data distortion methods and cryptographic algorithms"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus mention of secure aggregation in related works; focus is on augmentation/contrastive learning.
- Break condition: If participants collude beyond threshold t, they can break security guarantees.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Restricted proximity condition ensures theoretical correctness of kCAGC compared to centralized methods.
- Mechanism: Nodes satisfying the condition have sufficient separation from other cluster centers after local clustering and intersection, enabling correct global assignment.
- Core assumption: Local center separation assumption and restricted proximity condition hold for the dataset.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We compare our method to its centralized counterpart under a proximity condition"
  - [section]: "The restricted proximity condition is a compromise between the conditions proposed by [36] and [37]"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no corpus evidence of proximity condition usage in related works.
- Break condition: If data violates the restricted proximity condition (e.g., clusters are too close), misclustering increases significantly.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: k-means clustering algorithm and Lloyd's iteration
  - Why needed here: kCAGC builds upon k-means by running it locally and globally; understanding assignment and update steps is crucial.
  - Quick check question: In k-means, what triggers the termination of Lloyd's iteration?

- Concept: Graph Fourier transform and graph filtering
  - Why needed here: Graph filter G is used to smooth node features based on graph structure before clustering; understanding eigenvalues/eigenvectors of Laplacian is key.
  - Quick check question: Why do smaller eigenvalues in the graph Laplacian correspond to smoother graph signals?

- Concept: Secure multi-party computation and threshold secret sharing
  - Why needed here: Secure aggregation relies on cryptographic protocols to compute sums without revealing inputs; understanding the security model is essential.
  - Quick check question: In secure aggregation, what happens if more than t participants collude?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Local clustering module -> Intersection computation -> Secure aggregation layer -> Global clustering module
- Critical path:
  1. Each participant filters features using graph convolution
  2. Local k-means produces cluster assignments and centers
  3. Cluster IDs exchanged to compute intersections
  4. Virtual nodes created from intersection centers
  5. Secure aggregation computes distances between virtual nodes and cluster centers
  6. Global k-means assigns virtual nodes to clusters
  7. Final cluster assignments distributed to all participants

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Communication vs accuracy: Larger ˆk increases communication cost but may improve accuracy
  - Security vs performance: Secure aggregation adds computational overhead but ensures privacy
  - Local vs global clustering quality: Depends on how well local clusters approximate global structure

- Failure signatures:
  - Accuracy drops sharply when ˆk is too small relative to true cluster structure
  - Communication cost explodes when ˆk approaches n (no reduction achieved)
  - Training time increases significantly with more participants or larger ˆk
  - Privacy leakage occurs if secure aggregation threshold is violated

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline comparison: Run kCAGC with ˆk=k on Cora dataset and compare accuracy to centralized AGC
  2. Communication efficiency test: Measure secure aggregations needed for kCAGC vs basic kCAGC on Pubmed
  3. Privacy evaluation: Test information leakage by attempting to reconstruct features from aggregated outputs on Citeseer

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed method perform when different participants have entirely different graph structures, not just different features?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses "split graph structures" in Appendix D, showing experiments where participants have different graph structures.
- Why unresolved: The experiments only consider two participants and gradually increasing shared graph data. The performance with more participants or completely different graph structures remains unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing the method with multiple participants having completely different graph structures, varying the degree of overlap in graph data.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal number of local clusters (ˆk) relative to the number of final clusters (k) for different datasets and numbers of participants?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses different values of ˆk in experiments but doesn't provide a clear rule for choosing the optimal value.
- Why unresolved: The paper shows that ˆk = 2k or 4k usually yields better results, but the optimal choice depends on the dataset and number of participants, which isn't fully explored.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study varying ˆk across different datasets, numbers of participants, and graph characteristics to identify patterns for optimal ˆk selection.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the convergence speed of the proposed method compare to centralized methods for larger graphs with more nodes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that convergence speed depends on basic kCAGC and Protocol 1, and mentions that k-means converges within a polynomial number of iterations.
- Why unresolved: While the paper shows comparable convergence speed for tested datasets, it doesn't explore how this scales with larger graphs containing significantly more nodes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing the method on larger graphs with orders of magnitude more nodes than the current datasets to analyze convergence speed and resource requirements.

## Limitations

- Restricted proximity condition may not hold for datasets with overlapping or non-spherical clusters
- Secure aggregation requires careful parameter tuning (prime p, modulus N) that isn't fully specified
- Evaluation focuses on traditional clustering metrics without examining actual privacy guarantees under various attack scenarios

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The communication complexity reduction from O(n) to O(k³) and the overall clustering accuracy claims are well-supported by experimental results across four datasets. The secure aggregation mechanism follows established cryptographic protocols.

**Medium Confidence**: The theoretical analysis under restricted proximity condition appears sound, but the practical applicability depends heavily on dataset characteristics that aren't fully characterized. The privacy guarantees assume semi-honest adversaries and threshold t, which may not reflect real-world threat models.

**Low Confidence**: The claim that kCAGC achieves "comparable accuracy to centralized methods" is somewhat ambiguous - while NMI and F1-scores are reported, the absolute differences aren't quantified, and the comparison doesn't account for potential trade-offs in different privacy regimes.

## Next Checks

1. **Proximity Condition Stress Test**: Systematically evaluate kCAGC's performance on synthetic datasets with varying cluster separation distances to quantify the impact of violating the restricted proximity condition. Measure accuracy degradation as cluster centers move closer together.

2. **Security Parameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Test the secure aggregation protocol with different values of prime p and modulus N to determine the minimum parameter sizes needed to prevent information leakage while maintaining computational efficiency. Attempt to reconstruct feature distributions from aggregated outputs.

3. **Scalability Boundary Characterization**: Measure the break-even point where communication costs of kCAGC exceed those of basic kCAGC as dataset size n grows. Identify the relationship between true cluster count k, local cluster count ˆk, and participant count L that optimizes both communication and accuracy.
