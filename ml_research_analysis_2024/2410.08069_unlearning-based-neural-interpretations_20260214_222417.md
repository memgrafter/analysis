core_contribution: This paper identifies that current gradient-based interpretability
  methods suffer from poor baseline choices that inject harmful post-hoc biases (color,
  texture, frequency) and high-curvature decision boundaries leading to unreliable

# Unlearning-based Neural Interpretations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.08069
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08069
- Reference count: 39
- This paper identifies that current gradient-based interpretability methods suffer from poor baseline choices that inject harmful post-hoc biases (color, texture, frequency) and high-curvature decision boundaries leading to unreliable attributions.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses fundamental limitations in gradient-based interpretability methods by identifying how poor baseline choices inject harmful biases and create high-curvature decision boundaries. The authors propose UNI (Unlearning-based Neural Interpretations), a method that learns adaptive baselines by perturbing inputs toward an unlearning direction in model space. This approach erases salient features to create featureless references, resulting in more reliable attributions that preserve completeness and reduce path curvature.

## Method Summary
UNI addresses gradient-based interpretability issues by learning adaptive baselines through an unlearning process. The method perturbs inputs toward the unlearning direction of steepest ascent in model space, effectively erasing salient features and creating featureless reference points. This learned baseline is then used in a Riemann approximation path integration to compute attributions. The approach aims to eliminate post-hoc biases (color, texture, frequency) and reduce high-curvature decision boundaries that plague traditional methods like Integrated Gradients.

## Key Results
- UNI achieves higher faithfulness with MuFidelity scores up to 0.18 versus 0.08 for Integrated Gradients
- Greater robustness to adversarial attacks with Spearman correlation 0.319 versus 0.018 for ViT-B_16
- Improved stability across Riemann approximation steps compared to baselines like IG, BlurIG, and GIG
- Visual results demonstrate more semantically meaningful and localized attributions on ImageNet-1K and ImageNet-C

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
UNI works by fundamentally addressing the baseline selection problem in gradient-based interpretability. Traditional methods use static baselines (like zero images or blurred versions) that introduce biases and create high-curvature paths. UNI's adaptive baselines are learned through unlearning, which systematically removes features that the model relies on for classification. This creates a more natural starting point for attribution paths, resulting in smoother integration curves and more reliable feature importance scores.

## Foundational Learning
- **Integrated Gradients**: Path-based attribution method requiring baselines; needed to understand the foundation UNI builds upon
- **Unlearning in ML**: Concept of removing learned information from models; critical for understanding UNI's baseline generation approach
- **Riemann approximation**: Numerical integration technique for path-based methods; essential for computing attributions along learned paths
- **Spearman correlation**: Rank-based correlation metric; used for evaluating robustness to adversarial perturbations
- **MuFidelity**: Faithfulness metric for attribution methods; key evaluation criterion for comparing UNI against baselines
- **Decision boundary curvature**: Measure of path smoothness; directly relates to attribution reliability and UNI's improvements

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Input Image -> Baseline Learning (UNI) -> Riemann Integration -> Attribution Map

**Critical Path:**
1. Input image selection and preprocessing
2. Unlearning process to generate adaptive baseline (T=10 steps)
3. Riemann approximation integration (B=15 steps)
4. Attribution map computation and visualization

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Computational cost vs. attribution quality: UNI requires additional unlearning steps but produces more reliable attributions
- Model dependency: Baselines are learned per model, requiring separate computation for different architectures
- Parameter sensitivity: Performance depends on unlearning hyperparameters (η, ε, µ) and integration steps (B)

**Failure Signatures:**
- Attribution saturation: If baseline confidence is too low, attributions may become meaningless
- High path curvature: Indicates poor baseline choice or inadequate unlearning
- Inconsistent attributions: Suggests instability in the Riemann approximation or unlearning process

**First Experiments to Run:**
1. Verify baseline learning by checking confidence scores of learned baselines versus static baselines
2. Test path monotonicity by plotting confidence changes along integration paths
3. Compare curvature metrics between UNI and baseline methods to quantify improvements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Effectiveness relies heavily on unlearning process quality, which may not generalize to all model architectures
- Computational overhead could be prohibitive for real-time or large-scale applications
- Primary evaluation focuses on ImageNet classification; performance on other vision tasks remains unclear

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Identification of baseline issues in gradient methods and UNI's mathematical formulation
- **Medium Confidence**: Experimental results showing improved faithfulness and robustness
- **Low Confidence**: "One-size-fits-all" claims without extensive validation across diverse tasks

## Next Checks
1. Cross-architecture validation: Test UNI on architectures not included in original study (e.g., MobileNet, EfficientNet-L2)
2. Computational efficiency analysis: Measure runtime overhead versus baseline methods across different input resolutions
3. Domain transfer evaluation: Apply UNI to non-ImageNet tasks such as medical imaging or satellite imagery
