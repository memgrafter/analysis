# WildChat: 1M ChatGPT Interaction Logs in the Wild

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2405.01470
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01470
- **Reference count**: 14
- **Primary result**: Dataset of 1M real-world user interactions with ChatGPT/GPT-4, including 2.5M conversation turns and demographic metadata

## Executive Summary
WildChat is the first large-scale dataset capturing authentic user interactions with ChatGPT and GPT-4, containing 1 million conversations with over 2.5 million turns. The dataset was collected through a chatbot service with explicit user consent and enriched with demographic information including geographic metadata and hashed IP addresses. This real-world dataset enables detailed analysis of user behavior patterns and demonstrates utility in fine-tuning instruction-following models, achieving competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art open-source chatbots. However, the dataset contains higher toxicity levels than curated alternatives, highlighting the need for improved safeguarding mechanisms.

## Method Summary
The WildChat dataset was collected through a chatbot service deployed on Hugging Face Spaces using GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 APIs. Users provided explicit consent through a two-step mechanism before their interactions were recorded. The dataset includes chat transcripts, IP addresses, and request headers, which were processed to link turns into complete conversations while removing personally identifiable information using Presidio framework and custom rules. Geographic metadata was added by mapping IP addresses to countries and states using GeoLite2 database. The dataset underwent linguistic analysis to identify 68+ languages and toxicity classification using multiple tools including OpenAI Moderation API and Detoxify.

## Key Results
- Dataset contains 1 million conversations with 2.5 million interaction turns
- Fine-tuned Llama-2 7B model on WildChat achieved competitive performance vs state-of-the-art open-source chatbots
- Dataset includes 68 languages and shows significant geographic concentration (88.9% from United States)
- Toxicity levels exceed those found in curated datasets, with limited agreement between classification tools

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Real user interaction logs improve instruction-following model performance compared to synthetic datasets.
- Mechanism: Fine-tuning on diverse, real-world prompts exposes the model to natural language variability, topic switching, and multi-turn reasoning that synthetic prompts often miss.
- Core assumption: Real user behavior distribution is more complex and representative of actual deployment scenarios than expert-curated or model-generated examples.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we demonstrate the dataset's potential utility in fine-tuning instruction-following models"
  - [section]: "Table 9 presents the Likert scores from LLM Judge for each model. W ILD LLAMA outperforms other open-source models of the same size..."
  - [corpus]: Weak. No direct performance comparison against purely synthetic datasets in the corpus results.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Including demographic and geographic metadata enables more targeted analysis of user behavior patterns.
- Mechanism: Metadata allows filtering and segmenting conversations by region, language, or time, revealing cultural or regional differences in chatbot use.
- Core assumption: User behavior varies meaningfully across demographics and temporal dimensions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "In addition to timestamped chat transcripts, we enrich the dataset with demographic data, including state, country, and hashed IP addresses..."
  - [section]: "Geographically, the majority of data originates from users based in the United States, Russia, and China, as depicted in Table 3."
  - [corpus]: Weak. No analysis in corpus results showing behavioral differences by region or time.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Large-scale, multi-turn conversations expose long-tail user needs and complex interaction patterns.
- Mechanism: Capturing multi-turn dialogues reveals context persistence, topic evolution, and nuanced user intents not visible in single-turn datasets.
- Core assumption: User needs in real applications are rarely addressed in single interactions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "This augmentation allows for more detailed analysis of user behaviors across different geographical regions and temporal dimensions."
  - [section]: "On average, each conversation includes 2.52 user-chatbot interaction rounds (turns)."
  - [corpus]: Weak. No specific analysis in corpus results quantifying complexity or diversity of multi-turn patterns.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multi-turn dialogue modeling
  - Why needed here: Real user interactions span multiple exchanges, requiring models to maintain context and coherence.
  - Quick check question: Can the model retain key facts across at least 3 conversation turns without losing track?

- Concept: Toxicity detection and mitigation
  - Why needed here: The dataset contains high levels of toxic content; safe deployment requires robust filtering.
  - Quick check question: Does the system correctly flag at least 90% of toxic prompts without over-censoring benign content?

- Concept: Cross-lingual instruction understanding
  - Why needed here: The dataset includes 68 languages; models must generalize beyond English.
  - Quick check question: Can the model accurately interpret and respond to instructions in at least 5 non-English languages?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data ingestion pipeline → Preprocessing (PII removal, anonymization) → Storage (timestamped, geo-tagged) → Fine-tuning module → Evaluation harness (LLM Judge)
- Critical path: Data collection → Consent validation → Anonymization → Dataset release → Model fine-tuning → Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Broad data collection improves diversity but increases toxicity; anonymization protects privacy but limits traceability.
- Failure signatures: High false-positive toxicity flags, loss of conversational context in preprocessing, biased demographic representation.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Fine-tune Llama-2 7B on WildChat subset and measure perplexity drop vs. baseline.
  2. Test multi-turn coherence by feeding model sequential turns and evaluating consistency.
  3. Evaluate toxicity classifier performance on WildChat examples vs. curated test sets.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Geographic skew: 88.9% of conversations originate from the United States, limiting global insights
- High toxicity levels compared to curated datasets, raising safety concerns
- Reliance on proprietary LLM Judge for evaluation limits standardization
- Incomplete geographic metadata for many countries affects regional analysis accuracy

## Confidence

- **High confidence** in collection methodology and basic statistics
- **Medium confidence** in fine-tuning results and toxicity analysis
- **Low confidence** in generalizability due to geographic and demographic biases

## Next Checks

1. Conduct blind human evaluation of fine-tuned models on held-out WildChat conversations to verify LLM Judge scores
2. Perform geographic and demographic subgroup analyses to quantify representation biases and their impact on model performance
3. Test model generalization by evaluating fine-tuned models on established benchmarks (e.g., MT-Bench, AlpacaEval) to assess real-world applicability beyond the training distribution
