# Are Large Language Models a Good Replacement of Taxonomies?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.11131
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11131
- Reference count: 40
- Large language models show promise on common taxonomies but struggle with specialized domains and leaf-level entities

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether large language models can effectively replace traditional taxonomies through comprehensive benchmarking. The researchers constructed TaxoGlimpse, a benchmark featuring 18 state-of-the-art LLMs evaluated across ten representative taxonomies spanning common to specialized domains. LLMs were tested under zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thoughts prompting settings. Results demonstrate that while LLMs perform well on common taxonomies, they struggle significantly with specialized domains and entities near leaf levels, indicating they are not yet reliable replacements for traditional taxonomies.

## Method Summary
The researchers built TaxoGlimpse, a comprehensive benchmark containing ten representative taxonomies across eight domains ranging from common (Google Product Category, Amazon Product Type) to specialized (NCBI Taxonomy, SNOMED CT). They developed a taxonomy-agnostic question generation engine that creates three question types at each hierarchical level. The benchmark was evaluated using 18 state-of-the-art LLMs under three prompting settings: zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thoughts. Performance was measured using accuracy and miss rate metrics, with additional analysis of domain-specific fine-tuning effects and computational costs.

## Key Results
- LLMs achieve 85.2% accuracy on common taxonomies but only 72.4% on specialized ones
- Performance degrades progressively from root to leaf levels in most taxonomies
- Domain-specific instruction fine-tuning improves accuracy by 12.9-17.0% on specialized taxonomies
- Increasing model size from 1B to 13B parameters does not consistently improve taxonomy performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs perform well on common taxonomies because their training data covers widely known concepts.
- Mechanism: During pre-training, LLMs are exposed to large amounts of text from the web, which includes popular shopping and general domain entities that appear frequently in everyday contexts.
- Core assumption: The frequency of taxonomy concepts in the training corpus correlates with LLM knowledge of those concepts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "LLMs perform well on common taxonomies but struggle with specialized ones"
  - [section] "The domain knowledge of common taxonomies tends to be covered by the pre-training data of LLMs"
- Break condition: If a common taxonomy concept is rare in the pre-training corpus (e.g., due to cultural differences or data sparsity), the LLM may perform poorly on it.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Performance degrades near leaf levels because leaf entities are more specific and less frequently mentioned.
- Mechanism: The hierarchical nature of taxonomies means that leaf-level entities are more granular and domain-specific, making them less likely to appear in general web text used for pre-training.
- Core assumption: Leaf-level entities are less likely to be mentioned in general web text compared to root-level entities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "LLMs perform well on common taxonomies but struggle with specialized ones and entities near the leaf levels"
  - [section] "LLMs roughly achieve progressively worse performance from root to leaf in most taxonomies"
- Break condition: If leaf-level entities are highly similar in form to their parent entities (e.g., species-genus in NCBI), LLMs can infer relationships despite limited explicit mentions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Domain-specific instruction fine-tuning improves performance by aligning LLM knowledge with taxonomy-specific patterns.
- Mechanism: Fine-tuning on taxonomy-related tasks teaches the LLM the structure and relationships specific to taxonomic data, even if the raw concepts were not well-represented in pre-training.
- Core assumption: The LLM can learn to apply taxonomic reasoning patterns even when the underlying domain knowledge is limited.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The domain-specific instruction tuning leads to stable and significant performance improvements"
  - [section] "LLMs4OL largely outperforms its backbone model Flan-T5-3B" with accuracy boosts of 12.9-17.0%
- Break condition: If the fine-tuning data is insufficient or not representative of the target taxonomy domain, the improvement may be limited or non-existent.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Taxonomy structure and hierarchical relationships
  - Why needed here: Understanding how taxonomies organize knowledge hierarchically is essential for evaluating whether LLMs can capture these relationships
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a parent-child relationship and a sibling relationship in a taxonomy?

- Concept: Zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thoughts prompting
  - Why needed here: The study evaluates LLM performance under different prompting settings, requiring understanding of how these approaches work
  - Quick check question: How does few-shot prompting differ from zero-shot prompting in terms of the information provided to the LLM?

- Concept: Evaluation metrics for classification tasks (accuracy, miss rate)
  - Why needed here: The study uses accuracy and miss rate to assess LLM performance on taxonomy questions
  - Quick check question: If an LLM answers 80 out of 100 questions correctly and says "I don't know" to 15 questions, what are its accuracy and miss rate?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: TaxoGlimpse benchmark -> Taxonomy data (10 taxonomies) -> Question generation engine -> LLM evaluation pipeline -> Result analysis
- Critical path: Load taxonomy -> Generate questions at each level -> Evaluate LLMs under three prompting settings -> Aggregate results by taxonomy/domain/level
- Design tradeoffs: Comprehensive coverage (8 domains, 10 taxonomies) vs. manageable evaluation scope; automated question generation vs. potential bias in sampling
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on specialized taxonomies indicates domain knowledge gap; root-to-leaf decline indicates granularity issues; high miss rates indicate uncertainty calibration problems
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run LLM evaluation on Google Product Category (common domain) to establish baseline performance
  2. Evaluate the same LLM on NCBI taxonomy (specialized domain) to observe performance degradation
  3. Test the effect of domain-specific fine-tuning on a specialized taxonomy to validate the mechanism

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can domain adaptation techniques improve LLM performance on specialized taxonomies without extensive labeled data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies the limitation of LLMs in specialized domains and mentions that domain-specific instruction fine-tuning requires high-quality labeled data. It suggests domain adaptation techniques as a possible solution.
- Why unresolved: While the paper suggests domain adaptation techniques, it does not explore their effectiveness on taxonomies specifically. The authors acknowledge that the effectiveness of these techniques on taxonomies is not yet validated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the performance of LLMs on specialized taxonomies with and without domain adaptation techniques, using limited labeled data.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the integration of LLMs with traditional taxonomies impact scalability and inference time in real-world applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the potential integration of LLMs with traditional taxonomies to create novel neural-symbolic taxonomies. It mentions analyzing the scalability of different LLM series by recording GPU RAM and average time costs.
- Why unresolved: While the paper presents a case study on the feasibility of integrating LLMs with traditional taxonomies, it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the impact on scalability and inference time in real-world applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments measuring the scalability and inference time of integrated LLM-taxonomy systems compared to traditional taxonomies in real-world applications with varying data sizes and query loads.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can prompt engineering techniques beyond few-shot and Chain-of-Thought prompting further improve LLM performance on taxonomy-related tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper evaluates the impact of few-shot and Chain-of-Thought prompting on LLM performance but notes that the performance changes are minimal for the best-performing models.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on two prompting techniques and finds limited improvement, suggesting that other techniques might be more effective. However, it does not explore alternative prompt engineering methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the performance of LLMs on taxonomy-related tasks using various prompt engineering techniques, including advanced methods like tree-of-thought prompting or dynamic prompt generation.

## Limitations

- Study only evaluates one domain-specific fine-tuned model (LLMs4OL), limiting generalizability of fine-tuning results
- Tests a relatively narrow range of model sizes (1B-13B parameters) when examining scaling effects
- Does not explore alternative prompt engineering techniques beyond few-shot and Chain-of-Thoughts

## Confidence

- LLMs are not yet reliable replacements for taxonomies: High confidence
- Common taxonomies yield better LLM performance than specialized ones: High confidence
- Domain-specific fine-tuning improves performance: Medium confidence
- Increasing model size does not consistently improve results: Medium confidence
- Performance degrades at leaf levels: Medium confidence

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate additional domain-specific fine-tuned models beyond LLMs4OL to determine whether the observed improvements generalize across different fine-tuning approaches and domains.

2. Test the hypothesis about training data frequency by conducting ablation studies where LLMs are fine-tuned on taxonomies with varying degrees of pre-training overlap, measuring performance changes.

3. Investigate whether hierarchical prompting strategies (explicitly encouraging consideration of parent-child relationships) can mitigate the observed performance decline at leaf levels across specialized taxonomies.
