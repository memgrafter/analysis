- Pythia's modular approach maintains competitive performance while being more cost-effective than LynxQA

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates hallucination detection systems for large language models using diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and cost-effectiveness metrics. The study compares three strategies—Pythia, LynxQA, and a baseline "Grading" approach—across automatic summarization and retrieval-augmented generation tasks. Pythia, which uses claim extraction and classification, achieves competitive performance with LynxQA while maintaining better cost-effectiveness. The research demonstrates that distributed task complexity between LLM, extractor, and checker components can balance effectiveness and cost, providing practical guidance for developers choosing hallucination detection systems aligned with specific application needs and resource constraints.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates hallucination detection strategies on seven datasets (three summarization and four RAG-QA) using DOR and cost metrics. Three strategies are tested: LynxQA uses a single LLM prompt for direct evaluation, Pythia employs claim extraction with entailment/contradiction/neutral classification, and the baseline Grading strategy uses an A-F grading system. The evaluation compares GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini models, calculating DOR as (TP/FP)/(FN/TN) to measure detection effectiveness while accounting for class imbalance. Cost per million tokens is measured to assess economic efficiency across strategies.

## Key Results
- LynxQA achieves DOR 1.91× higher than baseline but costs 16.85× more when using GPT-4o vs GPT-4o-mini
- Pythia maintains competitive performance
