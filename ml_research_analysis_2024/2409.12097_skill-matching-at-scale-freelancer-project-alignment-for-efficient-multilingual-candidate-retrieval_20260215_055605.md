# Skill matching at scale: freelancer-project alignment for efficient multilingual candidate retrieval

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.12097
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12097
- Authors: Warren Jouanneau; Marc Palyart; Emma Jouffroy
- Reference count: 37
- One-line primary result: Novel neural retriever architecture improves freelancer-project matching efficiency in multilingual context, achieving 60% faster response times and 18% higher response rates in production.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of efficiently matching freelancers with project proposals at scale in a multilingual context. The authors propose a novel neural retriever architecture that leverages pre-trained multilingual language models to encode project descriptions and freelancer profiles. The method preserves the structure of documents and is trained with a contrastive loss on historical data. Experiments show that this approach effectively captures skill matching similarity and facilitates efficient retrieval, outperforming traditional methods. In production, the model significantly improved response times and conversion rates, demonstrating its practical value in real-world recommender systems.

## Method Summary
The proposed method uses a two-tower architecture with a frozen multilingual E5 backbone to encode project descriptions and freelancer profiles while preserving document structure. Each section is encoded independently with categorical information, then processed through a transformer head for document-level context. A weighted average pooling based on section length combines section embeddings into final document representations. The model is trained using contrastive learning with InfoNCE loss on historical interactions, incorporating weak negatives from job category differences. Precomputed freelancer embeddings are stored in a vector database for efficient retrieval.

## Key Results
- Production deployment achieved 60% reduction in response time
- Response rate increased by 18% in production environment
- Model outperforms traditional methods on recall metrics and skill matching similarity

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multilingual E5 backbone with frozen weights preserves language alignment while enabling domain-specific adaptation.
- Mechanism: By freezing the pretrained multilingual backbone and only training the transformer head, the model retains the semantic space organization from pretraining and aligns it with the freelancer-project domain data.
- Core assumption: The frozen multilingual backbone maintains its language alignment properties even when used as a sequence-to-sequence encoder without pooling.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our method encodes project descriptions and freelancer profiles by leveraging pre-trained multilingual language models."
  - [section]: "The choice of a multilingual similarity backbone has been made considering the need for a latent space that is both organized based on semantic similarity, and possesses language alignment."
- Break condition: If the frozen backbone loses language alignment during domain adaptation, or if the transformer head cannot effectively adapt the embeddings to the specific domain.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Weighted average pooling based on section length balances document representation and prevents bias from lengthy sections.
- Mechanism: By assigning lower weights to longer sections (inversely proportional to length), the model ensures that tokens from lengthy sections like descriptions don't dominate the final document representation.
- Core assumption: Section length correlates with information density and relevance, so longer sections should be downweighted.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Different sections within a document may vary significantly in length and relevance, making some tokens, such as those from a lengthy description, less significant than others, like those from a job title."
- Break condition: If the assumption about section length and relevance is incorrect, or if important information is consistently found in longer sections.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Contrastive learning with dual A-triplet loss effectively structures the latent space for skill matching.
- Mechanism: The model uses historical interactions to create positive and negative pairs, then applies a dual A-triplet loss that considers both project-to-freelancer and freelancer-to-freelancer relationships, enriched with weak negatives from job categories.
- Core assumption: Historical interaction data accurately reflects skill matching, and the transitive freelancer-to-freelancer similarity is a valid proxy for shared skill sets.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "For past interactions, we consider a recommended freelancer as a negative match for a project if either the company or the freelancer himself declares that the freelancer does not have the skills."
  - [section]: "When training a model at the batch level, a subset of projects and the corresponding set of selected freelancers can be sampled, and the relevant portion of the adjacency matrix can be extracted."
- Break condition: If the historical data is biased or incomplete, or if the freelancer-to-freelancer similarity doesn't accurately reflect skill overlap.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multilingual language models and language alignment
  - Why needed here: The platform operates across Europe with multiple languages, requiring a model that can handle and align embeddings across different languages.
  - Quick check question: How does the E5 model ensure language alignment without a projection layer?

- Concept: Contrastive learning and triplet loss
  - Why needed here: The model needs to learn to distinguish between freelancers with matching skills and those without, using historical interactions as training data.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between the triplet loss and the InfoNCE loss, and when would you use each?

- Concept: Document structure and section-level processing
  - Why needed here: Freelancer profiles and project proposals have different sections with varying lengths and relevance, requiring specialized handling.
  - Quick check question: How does the model use section type information, and why is this important for skill matching?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Frozen multilingual E5 backbone -> Categorical encoding -> Transformer head -> Weighted average pooling -> Vector database (Qdrant)

- Critical path:
  1. New project arrives → compute embedding on the fly
  2. Perform approximate nearest neighbors search in vector database
  3. Apply hard filters (geography, etc.)
  4. Pass candidates to legacy ranking system

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Frozen backbone vs. full fine-tuning: Frozen maintains language alignment but may limit domain adaptation
  - Section-level vs. document-level processing: Section-level preserves structure but adds complexity
  - Contrastive learning vs. supervised learning: Contrastive better handles unlabeled data but requires careful negative sampling

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor retrieval performance: May indicate issues with backbone freezing, pooling strategy, or contrastive learning setup
  - Slow response times: Could be due to inefficient vector database queries or on-the-fly embedding computation
  - Language misalignment: May occur if the frozen backbone loses its alignment properties during domain adaptation

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare frozen vs. fully fine-tuned backbone on language alignment metrics
  2. Test different pooling strategies (average vs. weighted average) on retrieval performance
  3. Evaluate the impact of weak negatives from job categories on unsupervised metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the model's performance scale with the number of freelancers and projects in the database, particularly in terms of retrieval latency and accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions the need for efficient retrieval at scale but does not provide detailed analysis of performance as the dataset grows.
- Why unresolved: The experiments were conducted on a fixed dataset without varying the size of the freelancer and project pools to observe scalability effects.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with datasets of increasing sizes and measuring retrieval latency and accuracy metrics would provide insights into the model's scalability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of incorporating additional profile sections (e.g., references, portfolios) on the model's performance and retrieval quality?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses a predefined set of profile sections but does not explore the effect of adding or removing sections.
- Why unresolved: The current model is optimized for the existing sections, and the contribution of each section to the overall performance is not quantified.
- What evidence would resolve it: Performing ablation studies by training models with different combinations of profile sections and comparing their performance would reveal the impact of each section.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the model handle ambiguous or poorly structured job titles and descriptions, and what is the effect on retrieval accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions the challenge of varying vocabularies and expertise levels but does not address the handling of ambiguous or poorly structured text.
- Why unresolved: The experiments use well-structured historical data, and the model's robustness to noisy or ambiguous input is not evaluated.
- What evidence would resolve it: Introducing synthetic noise or using real-world data with ambiguous text and measuring the impact on retrieval accuracy would assess the model's robustness.

## Limitations
- Reliance on historical interaction data assumes past matches reflect optimal skill alignment, which may not capture evolving market needs or niche skill requirements.
- Frozen backbone approach preserves language alignment but may limit domain adaptation to specialized terminology and concepts.
- Weighted average pooling assumption about section length and relevance lacks empirical validation across different document structures.

## Confidence
- High confidence: Production deployment results showing 60% reduction in response time and 18% increase in response rate are well-documented and directly measurable.
- Medium confidence: Contrastive learning approach's effectiveness relies on quality and representativeness of historical interaction data, introducing potential bias.
- Low confidence: Assumption that weighted average pooling based on section length optimally balances document representation lacks empirical validation.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct an ablation study comparing frozen vs. fully fine-tuned backbone performance across different language pairs to quantify trade-off between language alignment and domain adaptation.
2. Test model performance on newly created projects (cold start scenario) where no historical interaction data exists, to evaluate generalization to unseen skill combinations.
3. Implement controlled experiment varying weighted average pooling strategy (different weighting schemes, dynamic vs. static weights) to determine optimal approach for balancing section contributions.
