# KaPQA: Knowledge-Augmented Product Question-Answering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.16073
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16073
- Reference count: 40
- Introduces two product QA datasets for Adobe Acrobat and Photoshop

## Executive Summary
This work introduces two product QA datasets focused on Adobe Acrobat and Photoshop products to help evaluate the performance of existing models on domain-specific product QA tasks. A novel knowledge-driven RAG-QA framework is proposed to enhance the performance of models in the product QA task. The framework leverages comprehensive knowledge bases for query expansion, thereby enhancing both retrieval and generation in domain-specific QA tasks. Experiments demonstrate that inducing domain knowledge through query reformulation allowed for increased retrieval and generative performance when compared to standard RAG-QA methods, but the improvement is slight, illustrating the challenge posed by the datasets introduced.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a knowledge-driven RAG-QA framework that enhances product question-answering by leveraging comprehensive knowledge bases for query expansion. The approach involves constructing domain-specific knowledge bases from product documentation, using these to reformulate user queries, and then applying the reformulated queries in both retrieval and generation phases. The framework aims to improve performance on domain-specific QA tasks by incorporating relevant product knowledge during the query processing stage.

## Key Results
- Introduced two product QA datasets for Adobe Acrobat and Photoshop
- Proposed a knowledge-driven RAG-QA framework for domain-specific QA tasks
- Demonstrated increased retrieval and generative performance compared to standard RAG-QA methods
- Showed that improvements, while statistically present, are relatively modest

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by leveraging comprehensive knowledge bases to reformulate user queries, which enhances both retrieval and generation in domain-specific QA tasks. By expanding queries with relevant domain knowledge, the system can better match user questions to appropriate product documentation and generate more accurate answers. This approach addresses the challenge of understanding and responding to specific product-related queries that may contain technical terminology or require deep product knowledge.

## Foundational Learning
- **RAG-QA Framework**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Question-Answering; needed for integrating retrieval and generation in QA tasks; quick check: understand how retrieval and generation components interact
- **Query Expansion**: Technique of reformulating queries with additional terms; needed to improve retrieval accuracy; quick check: evaluate impact of different expansion strategies
- **Knowledge Bases**: Structured repositories of domain-specific information; needed to provide context for query reformulation; quick check: assess coverage and relevance of knowledge base content
- **Domain-Specific QA**: QA systems tailored to particular domains; needed to address specialized terminology and concepts; quick check: measure performance on domain-specific vs. general QA tasks

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: User Query -> Query Reformulation (Knowledge Base) -> Retrieval -> Generation -> Answer
- **Critical Path**: The knowledge base-driven query reformulation is the critical path, as it directly impacts both retrieval and generation performance
- **Design Tradeoffs**: Using comprehensive knowledge bases improves accuracy but may increase computational overhead and latency
- **Failure Signatures**: Poor knowledge base coverage or irrelevant expansions can lead to degraded retrieval and generation performance
- **First Experiments**:
  1. Test query reformulation with a small, focused knowledge base
  2. Compare retrieval performance with and without knowledge base augmentation
  3. Evaluate generation quality using different knowledge base expansion strategies

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance improvements are relatively modest, suggesting the approach may not fully address inherent challenges
- Datasets represent only two Adobe products, potentially limiting generalizability
- Scalability to other domains or larger product ecosystems is not demonstrated

## Confidence
- **High**: Methodology for constructing knowledge bases and overall RAG-QA framework are well-defined and reproducible
- **Medium**: Reported performance improvements are small, suggesting limited practical impact
- **Low**: Long-term effectiveness in dynamic product environments and scalability to other domains remain uncertain

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the framework on a broader range of product domains and document types to assess generalizability beyond Adobe products
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the specific contributions of different knowledge base components to performance improvements
3. Test the framework's robustness to concept drift in product documentation and user queries over extended periods
