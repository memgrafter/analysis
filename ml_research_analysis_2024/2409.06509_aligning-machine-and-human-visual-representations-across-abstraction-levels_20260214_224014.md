# Aligning Machine and Human Visual Representations across Abstraction Levels

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.06509
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06509
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: AligNet fine-tuning improved odd-one-out accuracy by up to 73.35% and downstream task performance by up to 2.7x

## Executive Summary
This work addresses a fundamental misalignment between deep learning vision models and human cognition: models fail to capture the multi-level conceptual structure of human perception. The authors developed a surrogate teacher model trained to imitate human similarity judgments, which was used to generate a large synthetic dataset (AligNet) of human-like judgments. By fine-tuning state-of-the-art vision foundation models on AligNet, they achieved significantly improved alignment with human judgments across diverse cognitive tasks and abstraction levels, while also enhancing generalization and out-of-distribution robustness.

## Method Summary
The authors developed AligNet, a framework for aligning vision foundation models with human conceptual judgments. They first created a surrogate teacher model by aligning neural representations to human triplet odd-one-out choices using uncertainty distillation and affine transformations. This teacher was then used to generate a large synthetic dataset of human-like similarity judgments. The framework clusters teacher representations into superordinate categories and samples triplets to capture both fine-grained and coarse-grained semantic relationships. Finally, student models are fine-tuned using a KL-divergence based objective that transfers the teacher's human-aligned structure while preserving pretrained features through weight decay.

## Key Results
- AligNet fine-tuning increased odd-one-out accuracy on the THINGS dataset by up to 73.35% (ViT-B)
- Improved downstream task performance by up to 2.7x compared to baseline models
- Human-aligned models showed enhanced generalization and out-of-distribution robustness across various machine learning tasks
- The framework works across diverse model architectures and training objectives

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The surrogate teacher model generates human-like similarity judgments that preserve multi-level conceptual structure.
- Mechanism: By linearly aligning model representations to human triplet odd-one-out choices using uncertainty distillation, the teacher captures the hierarchical organization of concepts (from fine- to coarse-grained distinctions). This alignment is then transferred to student models via KL-divergence based distillation.
- Core assumption: Human conceptual knowledge is hierarchically organized and can be approximated by affine transformations of neural representations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "human conceptual knowledge is hierarchically organized from fine- to coarse-scale distinctions, model representations do not accurately capture all these levels of abstraction"
  - [section] "we used an affine transformation to align neural network model representations with human semantic judgments"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct match in neighbors, but aligned with "Human-Aligned Image Models Improve Visual Decoding from the Brain" which suggests similar alignment approaches
- Break Condition: If human judgments are not hierarchically organized or if affine transformations cannot adequately capture the necessary structure.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The cluster-based triplet sampling ensures the generated dataset captures both local and global semantic relationships.
- Mechanism: By clustering teacher representations into superordinate categories and sampling triplets with two images from one cluster and one from another, the framework creates training examples that reflect both fine-grained distinctions within categories and coarse-grained relationships between categories.
- Core assumption: Clustering representations produces semantically meaningful superordinate categories that align with human conceptual groupings.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "we cluster the transformed teacher representations into meaningful superordinate categories... We use these clusters to sample triplets—two objects from one cluster and one from a different cluster"
  - [section] "the clustering process that we use to sample the triplets also reflects this hierarchical structure"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct match, but conceptually similar to "Do Sparse Subnetworks Exhibit Cognitively Aligned Attention?" which explores how network structure relates to cognitive alignment
- Break Condition: If clustering fails to produce semantically meaningful categories or if the sampled triplets don't reflect human conceptual relationships.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The KL-divergence based objective function effectively transfers the human-aligned structure from teacher to student models.
- Mechanism: The objective function minimizes the KL divergence between the teacher's probability distribution over triplet similarities and the student's distribution, encouraging the student to adopt the teacher's human-aligned structure while preserving its own pretrained features through weight decay.
- Core assumption: The teacher's human-aligned similarity structure can be effectively distilled into student models through probability distribution matching.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "we introduce a novel Kullback-Leibler divergence based objective function similar to Eq. 2 that facilitates the distillation process"
  - [section] "To distill the pairwise similarity structure of the teacher into a different student network, we introduced a novel Kullback-Leibler divergence based objective function"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct match, but related to "Abstraction Alignment: Comparing Model-Learned and Human-Encoded Conceptual Relationships" which suggests KL divergence is a valid alignment metric
- Break Condition: If the KL divergence optimization fails to converge or if the student's representation space becomes too distorted during distillation.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA)
  - Why needed here: RSA provides a standardized way to compare human and model representations by measuring similarity between pairs of examples, enabling systematic evaluation of alignment across different cognitive tasks
  - Quick check question: What kernel function is used in RSA to compute the representational similarity matrix between human and model representations?

- Concept: Uncertainty calibration in neural networks
  - Why needed here: Proper uncertainty calibration is essential for models to reflect human response uncertainty, which is critical for building trust and ensuring the models' confidence matches their accuracy
  - Quick check question: How does the framework ensure that model uncertainties correspond to human uncertainties in triplet judgments?

- Concept: Knowledge distillation and surrogate models
  - Why needed here: Since collecting human similarity judgments is expensive and limited in scale, the framework uses a teacher model to generate synthetic human-like judgments, enabling training on much larger datasets
  - Quick check question: What role does the surrogate teacher model play in the AligNet framework and why is it necessary?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Teacher model (aligned to human judgments via uncertainty distillation) -> Clustering module (groups representations into superordinate categories) -> Triplet sampling module (generates human-like triplet datasets) -> Student model (pretrained foundation model to be aligned) -> KL-divergence loss function (transfers teacher structure to student) -> Weight decay regularization (preserves pretrained features)

- Critical path: Align teacher → Cluster representations → Sample triplets → Generate AligNet dataset → Fine-tune student models via KL-divergence loss

- Design tradeoffs: The framework trades off between preserving the pretrained model's local structure (via weight decay) and adopting the teacher's global human-aligned structure (via KL-divergence loss). The balance is controlled by the regularization parameter λ.

- Failure signatures: Poor alignment with human judgments, minimal improvement over baseline models, degraded performance on downstream tasks, or failure to converge during fine-tuning.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate that the uncertainty distillation process improves teacher model alignment with human triplet judgments on the THINGS dataset
  2. Test that cluster-based triplet sampling produces semantically meaningful triplets by manually inspecting a sample
  3. Verify that fine-tuning a simple student model on AligNet improves its alignment with human judgments on a small evaluation dataset before scaling up

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What specific structural properties of the representation space contribute most to the improved generalization observed in AligNet models?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper shows that AligNet models exhibit improved generalization and out-of-distribution robustness. However, it does not explicitly identify which structural properties of the representation space are most responsible for this improvement.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on demonstrating the effectiveness of AligNet, but does not delve into the specific mechanisms by which the aligned representations lead to better generalization.
- What evidence would resolve it: Further analysis of the representation spaces, such as studying the impact of different types of semantic relations (e.g., same superordinate category, same basic category) on the generalization performance.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the alignment with human judgments affect the models' ability to handle complex, multi-modal tasks that require reasoning across different modalities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that AligNet models improve performance on various machine learning tasks, but it does not specifically investigate the impact of alignment on multi-modal reasoning.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the visual domain and does not explore the implications of alignment for tasks that involve multiple modalities, such as vision-language tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments evaluating the performance of AligNet models on multi-modal tasks, such as visual question answering or image captioning, and comparing their performance to non-aligned models.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do the benefits of AligNet alignment vary across different model architectures and training objectives?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper demonstrates that AligNet improves alignment and generalization for a diverse set of vision foundation models with different architectures and training objectives. However, it does not provide a detailed analysis of how the benefits vary across these different settings.
- Why unresolved: The paper shows that AligNet is effective across different models, but does not explore the specific factors that contribute to the varying degrees of improvement observed.
- What evidence would resolve it: A more systematic study of the impact of AligNet on different model architectures and training objectives, potentially involving a larger set of models and a more comprehensive evaluation of their performance.

## Limitations
- The framework relies heavily on synthetic human-like judgments from the teacher model, which may not fully capture the complexity of human conceptual organization, particularly at fine-grained abstraction levels
- The effectiveness of affine transformations for aligning model representations with human judgments is assumed but not rigorously tested across different model architectures
- The method's performance improvements are primarily demonstrated on vision tasks, leaving open questions about its applicability to other sensory modalities or more abstract cognitive domains

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core mechanism of using KL-divergence for distillation is theoretically sound and supported by related work in knowledge distillation
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that fine-tuning on AligNet improves downstream task performance is supported by results but could benefit from more diverse benchmark datasets
- **Medium confidence**: The assertion that human-aligned models show improved out-of-distribution robustness needs further validation across more challenging distribution shifts

## Next Checks
1. **Generalization Test**: Evaluate the aligned models on a broader set of out-of-distribution datasets, including natural adversarial examples and cross-domain transfer tasks, to verify robustness claims
2. **Multi-Modal Extension**: Apply the AligNet framework to language and multimodal models to assess whether the alignment approach generalizes beyond vision
3. **Fine-Grained Alignment Analysis**: Conduct detailed RSA analysis to measure alignment at different levels of abstraction (object, scene, attribute) and identify which levels benefit most from the fine-tuning process
