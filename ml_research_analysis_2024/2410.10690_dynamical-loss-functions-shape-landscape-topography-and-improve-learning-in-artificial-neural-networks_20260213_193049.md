# Dynamical loss functions shape landscape topography and improve learning in artificial neural networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.10690
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10690
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Dynamical loss functions improve neural network learning by modulating class weights during training

## Executive Summary
This work investigates how dynamical loss functions can improve neural network learning by periodically modulating the weight of each class during training. The authors derive several variants based on cross-entropy and mean squared error, with oscillating factors that change the loss landscape without altering its global minima. Experiments on a 2D spiral classification task reveal that these functions induce a sequence of bifurcations, leading to increased exploration and reduced curvature in parameter space. Crucially, smaller networks can be trained effectively, shifting the under-to-overparameterization threshold. Validation accuracy improves significantly for networks of varying sizes compared to static loss functions. The method connects to edge-of-stability minimization and may help reduce computational costs while enhancing generalization.

## Method Summary
The method introduces dynamical loss functions that periodically modulate class weights during training. The authors derive variants based on cross-entropy and mean squared error, incorporating oscillating factors that change the loss landscape topography without affecting global minima. These functions use amplitude A and period T parameters to control the oscillation of class weightings. The approach leverages bifurcation theory and edge-of-stability dynamics, where the system bounces between valley walls when Hessian eigenvalues approach critical thresholds, enhancing exploration in parameter space.

## Key Results
- Dynamical loss functions induce sequential bifurcations that increase exploration and reduce curvature in parameter space
- Smaller networks can be trained effectively, shifting the under-to-overparameterization threshold
- Validation accuracy improves significantly compared to static loss functions across networks of varying sizes
- The method connects to edge-of-stability minimization theory

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Oscillating class weights reshape the loss landscape without changing global minima.
- Mechanism: Each class's contribution to the loss periodically increases and decreases, causing the loss valleys to shift position and width while keeping the global minima fixed.
- Core assumption: The global minima remain unchanged under periodic modulation of class weights.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "These oscillations globally alter the loss landscape without affecting the global minima."
  - [section]: "Depending on the values of Γi, the topography of the loss function will change, but the loss function will still vanish at the same global minima, which are unaffected by the values of Γi."
- Break condition: If the oscillation amplitude becomes too large (A≫1), the network may output only the currently emphasized class regardless of input, breaking meaningful learning.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Dynamical loss functions induce sequential bifurcations that enhance exploration.
- Mechanism: As the landscape changes during oscillations, eigenvalues of the Hessian cross the critical value 2/η, triggering bifurcations where the system bounces between valley walls, increasing gradient magnitude and exploration in directions perpendicular to maximum curvature.
- Core assumption: The critical curvature threshold for instabilities remains at 2/η as in edge-of-stability minimization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Experiments on a 2D spiral classification task reveal that these functions induce a sequence of bifurcations, leading to increased exploration and reduced curvature in parameter space."
  - [section]: "There are additional bifurcations each time another eigenvalue reaches 2/η, forming a period-doubling cascade."
- Break condition: If the learning rate η is too small, the critical eigenvalue threshold becomes too low, preventing meaningful bifurcations.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Dynamical loss functions shift the under-to-overparameterization threshold, enabling smaller networks to generalize effectively.
- Mechanism: By enhancing exploration through bifurcations and instabilities, smaller networks can find better minima than they could with static loss functions, effectively reducing the number of parameters needed for good generalization.
- Core assumption: Enhanced exploration through bifurcations allows smaller networks to find minima that would normally require larger network sizes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Crucially, smaller networks can be trained effectively, shifting the under-to-overparameterization threshold."
  - [section]: "Fig. 4 shows how dynamical loss functions improve validation accuracy over their corresponding standard static loss... This difference is greatest for small network sizes—dynamical loss functions shift the under to over-parameterized transition."
- Break condition: If oscillation parameters (amplitude and period) become too extreme, catastrophic forgetting may occur, negating the benefits.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Loss landscape topography and its relationship to optimization
  - Why needed here: Understanding how valley shapes, sharpness, and curvature affect gradient descent is crucial for grasping why dynamical loss functions work
  - Quick check question: How does valley sharpness relate to the likelihood of edge-of-stability behavior?

- Concept: Edge-of-stability minimization and its connection to Hessian eigenvalues
  - Why needed here: The dynamical loss functions leverage instabilities that occur when Hessian eigenvalues approach 2/η, which is central to their mechanism
  - Quick check question: What happens to the optimization trajectory when the largest Hessian eigenvalue exceeds 2/η?

- Concept: Bifurcation theory and period-doubling cascades in dynamical systems
  - Why needed here: The paper shows that dynamical loss functions induce bifurcations that enhance exploration, requiring understanding of how such cascades work
  - Quick check question: How does a period-doubling cascade affect the system's exploration of parameter space?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Standard neural network architecture with modified loss function computation → oscillation mechanism that periodically modulates class weights → monitoring system that tracks Hessian eigenvalues and accuracy metrics
- Critical path: Forward pass → loss computation with dynamical weights → backpropagation → parameter update → stability/bifurcation monitoring → accuracy evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Tradeoff between oscillation amplitude (larger = more exploration but risk of forgetting) and learning rate (higher = faster descent but more instability). Need to balance exploration enhancement against training stability.
- Failure signatures: Catastrophic forgetting when amplitude is too large, failure to converge when period is too short, reduced performance when amplitude/period are poorly tuned for the specific task.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement DCE with a simple 2-class classification problem using a small network, varying only the amplitude parameter A while keeping period fixed
  2. Compare Hessian eigenvalue evolution between static and dynamical loss functions on the same problem, plotting the eigenvalue trajectories
  3. Test different period values with fixed amplitude on the spiral classification task, measuring final validation accuracy and training stability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do dynamical loss functions interact with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) compared to full-batch gradient descent?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note they used full-batch gradient descent to isolate effects, but suggest investigating the interplay with SGD would be interesting.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests dynamical loss functions with full-batch gradient descent, leaving the interaction with SGD unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing dynamical loss functions with both full-batch and SGD on various datasets and network architectures.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal period and amplitude for dynamical loss function oscillations across different tasks and network architectures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention they selected specific parameters for their experiments and show a phase diagram in supplementary materials, but acknowledge this is an open question.
- Why unresolved: The paper uses specific parameters that work well for their simple classification task, but doesn't explore how these parameters generalize to other tasks or architectures.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying amplitude and period across multiple tasks, network sizes, and architectures to identify optimal parameter ranges.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we design new dynamical loss functions that are optimal for other supervised classification tasks beyond the ones presented?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state "Other dynamical loss functions could be designed in many different ways" and call for research on designing optimal functions for other tasks.
- Why unresolved: The paper only presents three specific types of dynamical loss functions and doesn't provide a general framework for designing new ones.
- What evidence would resolve it: A theoretical framework or empirical methodology for systematically designing and evaluating new dynamical loss functions for various machine learning tasks.

## Limitations
- The exact mathematical form of oscillating factors Γᵢ(t) beyond amplitude A and period T parameters is not specified
- Specific amplitude and period values used in validation experiments are not provided
- Claims about threshold shifting across different architectures are based on a single synthetic dataset

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The theoretical framework connecting dynamical loss functions to loss landscape modulation and edge-of-stability behavior is well-established in optimization theory.
- **Medium confidence**: The experimental demonstration on the 2D spiral classification task is convincing, though limited to a single synthetic dataset.
- **Low confidence**: Claims about shifting the under-to-overparameterization threshold across different network architectures and real-world datasets are not directly supported by the presented experiments.

## Next Checks
1. Verify the specific mathematical form of Γᵢ(t) and implement it to reproduce the Swiss Roll classification results with varying network sizes.
2. Test the dynamical loss functions on a standard benchmark dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10) with multiple network architectures to validate generalization beyond the synthetic spiral task.
3. Conduct ablation studies varying amplitude A and period T systematically to identify optimal ranges and understand failure modes like catastrophic forgetting.
