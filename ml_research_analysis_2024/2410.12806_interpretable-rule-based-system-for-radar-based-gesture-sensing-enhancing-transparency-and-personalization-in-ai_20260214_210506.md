# Interpretable Rule-Based System for Radar-Based Gesture Sensing: Enhancing Transparency and Personalization in AI

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.12806
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12806
- Reference count: 9
- Primary result: MIRA achieves 88.4% training accuracy and 83.9% out-of-distribution accuracy using transparent if-then rules for radar-based gesture classification.

## Executive Summary
This work introduces MIRA, a rule-based system for radar-based gesture sensing that addresses the challenge of interpretability in AI. Unlike opaque neural networks, MIRA uses transparent if-then rules derived from radar data to classify gestures, enabling clear understanding of decision-making. The system employs a novel weighted Silhouette score and F-Beta score to develop and optimize rules for multi-class classification, outperforming traditional binary rule-based systems. Experiments on a dataset of 21,000 gestures show MIRA achieving 88.4% training accuracy and 83.9% out-of-distribution accuracy. The system also supports personalized rules tailored to individual users, improving accuracy by up to 9.6% with minimal calibration gestures. MIRA offers a balance between high interpretability and strong performance, making it ideal for safety-critical applications requiring transparent AI.

## Method Summary
MIRA is a rule-based system for multi-class radar-based gesture classification using Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar data. The system processes 5 radar features (range, Doppler, azimuth, elevation, peak) averaged over 10 gesture frames from a dataset of 21,000 gestures across 8 users and 6 locations. Rule induction uses sequential covering with a weighted Silhouette score to select optimal gesture classes and an F-Beta score (β=0.3) to evaluate rule literals, prioritizing precision over recall. The system develops foundational rules from the training set, then creates personalized rules using up to 200 calibration gestures per user. MIRA achieves 88.4% training accuracy and 83.9% out-of-distribution accuracy while maintaining complete interpretability through transparent if-then rules.

## Key Results
- MIRA achieves 88.4% training accuracy and 83.9% out-of-distribution accuracy on radar-based gesture classification
- Personalized rules improve accuracy by up to 9.6% using only 5 calibration gestures per gesture class
- MIRA outperforms traditional binary rule-based systems and provides complete interpretability through transparent if-then rules

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Weighted Silhouette Score (SC) with cluster size weighting balances multi-class rule development.
- Mechanism: The weighted SC combines intra-cluster cohesion (a(xi)) and inter-cluster separation (b(xi)) with cluster size normalization (nj/Nleft) and an adjustable weight λ1. This prevents the algorithm from over-focusing on small, well-separated clusters.
- Core assumption: Gesture classes have distinct feature distributions that can be captured by cluster-based metrics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "To prevent biased rule development towards classes with fewer samples, a weighted SC method, incorporating cluster size and sample distribution, is proposed."
  - [abstract] "We showcase the system's adaptability through personalized rule sets that calibrate to individual user behavior."
- Break condition: If gesture classes are highly overlapping in feature space, the Silhouette-based separation becomes meaningless and rule quality degrades.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: F-Beta score with β < 1 prioritizes precision over recall to reduce false positives in sequential covering.
- Mechanism: By setting β = 0.3, the rule induction process penalizes false positives more heavily than false negatives, ensuring that once a gesture is classified by a rule, it is likely correct. False negatives can be caught by later rules.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "In this work, we prioritize False Positives (FP), i.e., precision, over False Negatives (FN), i.e., recall by setting β < 1 to 0.3."
  - [section] "Falsely negative predicted gestures, which are not being covered by a rule, can be correctly classified by a subsequent rule, whereas the opposite is not achievable."
- Break condition: If the dataset has severe class imbalance or rare gestures, strict precision prioritization may leave many samples unclassified.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Personalized rule sets derived from foundational rules improve accuracy for individual users without sacrificing interpretability.
- Mechanism: Foundational rules capture general gesture patterns; personalized rules are learned from a small set of user-specific calibration gestures and appended to the foundational set, refining the decision boundaries for that user.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Personalized rules, tailored to individual users, accommodate unique gesture execution nuances stemming from anatomical differences, motor skills, personal preferences, and even cultural influences."
  - [section] "The study found that a small set of personalized rules, developed using only five gestures per gesture class, was sufficient to achieve this performance improvement."
- Break condition: If user-specific gestures are too noisy or inconsistent, personalization may overfit and reduce generalizability.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Rule induction via sequential covering
  - Why needed here: Enables transparent multi-class gesture classification by building an interpretable rule set that covers all samples.
  - Quick check question: What stopping criteria prevent overfitting in the rule induction loop?

- Concept: Weighted Silhouette Score for cluster selection
  - Why needed here: Balances the influence of different gesture classes during rule development, avoiding bias toward small or large classes.
  - Quick check question: How does the cluster size weight (λ2) modify the selection of the next class to rule?

- Concept: F-Beta score for rule optimization
  - Why needed here: Provides a tunable balance between precision and recall during literal selection within a rule.
  - Quick check question: Why is β set below 1, and what effect does that have on false positive vs. false negative rates?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing -> Feature extraction (5 radar features averaged over gesture frames) -> Rule induction engine (sequential covering + weighted SC + F-Beta) -> Foundational rule set -> Personalized rule refinement -> Prediction layer (rule matching -> gesture class)

- Critical path: Feature extraction -> Rule induction (weighted SC -> F-Beta) -> Prediction

- Design tradeoffs:
  - High interpretability vs. predictive accuracy (RBS vs. NN)
  - Rule complexity (number of literals) vs. generalization
  - Calibration effort (number of personalized gestures) vs. accuracy gain

- Failure signatures:
  - Low training accuracy -> Poor feature separability or inadequate rule stopping criteria
  - High training but low OOD accuracy -> Overfitting to training distribution
  - Inconsistent predictions -> Rule conflicts or ambiguous feature thresholds

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train MIRA on training set only; measure training accuracy and rule count.
  2. Evaluate foundational rules on ID and OOD test sets; compare to baseline RBS.
  3. Generate personalized rules with 5 calibration gestures per class; measure accuracy improvement for each user.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors introduce a novel weighted Silhouette score method to address potential biases in rule development towards classes with fewer samples.
- Why unresolved: The paper presents the weighted Silhouette score but does not provide a detailed comparison with traditional methods like information gain in terms of handling class imbalance.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparative study showing the effectiveness of the weighted Silhouette score versus traditional methods in handling class imbalance in multi-class classification tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of the number of calibration gestures on the performance of personalized rules for individual users?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors discuss the development of personalized rules using a small set of calibration gestures but do not provide a detailed analysis of the impact of the number of gestures on performance.
- Why unresolved: While the paper mentions the use of calibration gestures for personalized rules, it does not explore the optimal number of gestures needed for effective personalization.
- What evidence would resolve it: An experiment varying the number of calibration gestures and measuring the resulting performance of personalized rules for individual users.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the interpretability of MIRA compare to other interpretable models like decision trees or linear models in radar-based gesture sensing?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper emphasizes the interpretability of MIRA through transparent if-then rules but does not compare it to other interpretable models.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the interpretability of MIRA but does not provide a comparative analysis with other interpretable models in the context of radar-based gesture sensing.
- What evidence would resolve it: A study comparing the interpretability and performance of MIRA with other interpretable models like decision trees or linear models in radar-based gesture sensing tasks.

## Limitations

- Performance heavily dependent on quality and separability of radar features; overlapping distributions may degrade rule quality
- Personalization assumes five calibration gestures per class is sufficient, which may not generalize across all users or gesture types
- Weighted Silhouette score parameters (λ1, λ2, λ3) and F-Beta score (β=0.3) lack theoretical justification for specific values chosen
- Out-of-distribution accuracy (83.9%) shows reasonable generalization but leaves room for improvement in highly variable real-world environments

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The basic rule-based architecture and sequential covering mechanism are well-established in the literature and function as described.
- **Medium Confidence**: The weighted Silhouette score and F-Beta score optimization work as intended within the tested dataset, but their generalizability to other radar datasets or gesture sets is uncertain.
- **Medium Confidence**: The personalization mechanism improves accuracy by up to 9.6%, but the exact improvement varies by user and may depend on factors not fully characterized in the study.

## Next Checks

1. **Feature Robustness Test**: Evaluate MIRA's performance when radar features are intentionally degraded (added noise, reduced resolution) to determine the minimum feature quality required for reliable classification.

2. **Personalization Calibration Study**: Systematically vary the number of calibration gestures (from 1 to 50 per class) to identify the optimal trade-off between calibration effort and accuracy improvement for different user groups.

3. **Cross-Environment Generalization**: Test MIRA on radar data collected from environments not represented in the original dataset (e.g., outdoor, different lighting conditions, with obstacles) to assess true OOD performance and identify failure patterns.
