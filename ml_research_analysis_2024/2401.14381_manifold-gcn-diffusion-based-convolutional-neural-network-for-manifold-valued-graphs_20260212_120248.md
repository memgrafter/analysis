- Primary result: Introduces diffusion-based GCN layers for manifold-valued features achieving state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and ADNI datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel graph convolutional network architecture for handling manifold-valued features on graphs. The proposed framework combines a diffusion layer based on manifold-valued graph diffusion equations with tangent multilayer perceptrons (tMLPs) to create a generic GCN block. This approach enables information aggregation over local neighborhoods while maintaining equivariance under node permutations and feature space isometries. The method demonstrates strong performance on synthetic graph classification tasks and Alzheimer's disease classification from hippocampal meshes, outperforming or matching state-of-the-art methods while being applicable to a broader class of problems.

## Method Summary
The proposed method introduces two key layers for manifold-valued graphs: a diffusion layer and a tangent multilayer perceptron (tMLP). The diffusion layer performs information aggregation over local neighborhoods using a manifold-valued graph diffusion equation, enabling equivariant feature transformations under node permutations and feature space isometries. The tMLP generalizes fully connected layers to manifolds, incorporating nonlinearities between layers while maintaining the same equivariance properties. A generic GCN block combines these layers, achieving strong performance on both synthetic graph classification tasks and Alzheimer's disease classification from hippocampal meshes. The framework is implemented using the Morphomatics library and shows promise for applications with scarce training data.

## Key Results
- Outperforms or matches state-of-the-art methods on synthetic graph classification tasks using hyperbolic and SPD feature spaces
- Achieves 86% accuracy on Alzheimer's disease classification from hippocampal meshes, comparable to specialized methods
- Demonstrates effectiveness in scenarios with scarce training data, showing promise for medical imaging applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The manifold GCN works by combining two key mechanisms: diffusion-based neighborhood aggregation and tangent space MLPs. The diffusion layer propagates information across the graph while respecting the underlying manifold geometry through the graph diffusion equation, allowing for natural information flow that considers both graph structure and manifold constraints. The tangent MLP operates in the tangent space of the manifold, enabling nonlinear transformations while maintaining equivariance properties. This combination allows the network to capture both local geometric structures and global graph patterns, leading to improved performance on manifold-valued graph classification tasks.

## Foundational Learning
- **Graph diffusion equations**: Mathematical framework for modeling information flow on graphs; needed for proper neighborhood aggregation in manifold-valued settings; quick check: verify eigenvalues of graph Laplacian are positive
- **Riemannian manifolds**: Geometric spaces where distances and angles are defined locally; needed to handle non-Euclidean feature spaces; quick check: confirm manifold is complete and has constant curvature where applicable
- **Exponential and logarithm maps**: Functions mapping between manifold and tangent space; needed for tMLP operations; quick check: verify points stay within normal convex neighborhoods
- **Equivariance**: Property of transformations that commute with group actions; needed to ensure consistent behavior under node permutations and isometries; quick check: test layer outputs with permuted inputs

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Graph features -> Diffusion Layer -> tMLP -> Invariant Layer -> MLP -> Classification

**Critical Path**: The critical path involves diffusion-based neighborhood aggregation followed by tangent space transformations and invariant pooling, with each component building on the previous one to handle manifold-valued features effectively.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational complexity for geometric expressiveness, requiring manifold operations (exponential/logarithm maps) that are more expensive than standard Euclidean operations but enable handling of richer feature spaces.

**Failure Signatures**: Training instability from improper manifold operations (features leaving normal convex neighborhoods), poor performance due to unnormalized graph weights or too large diffusion times, and suboptimal results from inappropriate reference point selection in tMLP.

**First Experiments**:
1. Implement and test diffusion layer with synthetic hyperbolic features on simple graph
2. Verify tangent MLP operations with SPD matrices using Morphomatics library
3. Combine both layers and test on small synthetic graph classification task

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed manifold GCN perform in scenarios with limited training data, and can it outperform other methods in such cases?
