# ConLUX: Concept-Based Local Unified Explanations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.12439
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12439
- Reference count: 31
- Improves explanation fidelity from 82.21% for Anchors, 48.59% for LIME, 149.93% for LORE, and 48.27% for Kernel SHAP

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ConLUX, a framework that elevates local model-agnostic explanations from feature-level to concept-level. The key insight is to automatically extract high-level concepts from large pre-trained models and extend existing techniques like LIME, Kernel SHAP, Anchor, and LORE to provide concept-based explanations. By replacing basic feature predicates with concept predicates and extending perturbation models to operate at the concept level, ConLUX significantly improves explanation fidelity while offering multiple forms of explanations (attributions, sufficient conditions, counterfactuals) that better align with both model decision-making processes and user understanding.

## Method Summary
ConLUX works by automatically extracting high-level concepts from large pre-trained models (GPT-3.5 for text, GPT-4o for images) and replacing the basic feature predicates in local model-agnostic explanation techniques with concept predicates. The framework extends the perturbation models to generate samples by changing high-level concepts rather than simply masking feature values, using more sophisticated approaches like Llama3.1 for text and modified versions for images. By augmenting multiple existing techniques (LIME, Kernel SHAP, Anchor, LORE) with concept-based approaches, ConLUX provides unified explanations combining multiple forms while maintaining the benefits of local model-agnostic explanations.

## Key Results
- ConLUX improves fidelity of Anchors by 82.21%, LIME by 48.59%, LORE by 149.93%, and Kernel SHAP by 48.27%
- ConLUX unified explanations achieve 5.75% and 4.9% more accuracy than TBM and EAC on sentiment analysis tasks
- The framework demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art concept-based explanation techniques specifically designed for text and image models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: ConLUX improves explanation fidelity by replacing feature predicates with concept predicates
- Mechanism: The framework extracts high-level concepts from large pre-trained models and replaces basic feature predicates in local model-agnostic techniques with concept predicates, better aligning with model decision processes and user understanding
- Core assumption: High-level concepts extracted from pre-trained models are more representative of the decision process than basic features
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states ConLUX can "automatically extract high-level concepts from large pre-trained models, and uniformly extend existing local model-agnostic techniques to provide unified concept-based explanations"
- Break condition: If extracted concepts don't accurately represent the model's decision process or fail to be intuitive for users

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: ConLUX extends perturbation models to generate samples by changing high-level concepts
- Mechanism: Instead of simply masking feature values, the extended perturbation model (tc_per) changes high-level concepts at the feature level using sophisticated models like Llama3.1 for text and modified versions for images
- Core assumption: Generating samples by changing high-level concepts captures local model behavior more effectively than feature-level perturbations
- Evidence anchors: Section 3.2 explains that "tc_per changes high-level concepts at feature level, which is more complex" compared to simple masking
- Break condition: If the perturbation model cannot effectively translate concept changes to feature-level changes

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: ConLUX provides unified explanations combining multiple forms of explanation
- Mechanism: By augmenting multiple existing techniques with concept-based approaches, ConLUX offers various explanation types (attributions, sufficient conditions, counterfactuals) in a single framework, providing more comprehensive and faithful explanations
- Core assumption: Different users need different forms of explanations, and combining them provides better understanding than any single form
- Evidence anchors: Section 4.2.2 shows ConLUX helps classic techniques achieve 5.75% and 4.9% more accuracy than TBM and EAC
- Break condition: If combining multiple explanation forms creates confusion rather than clarity

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Local model-agnostic explanation techniques
  - Why needed here: Understanding how techniques like LIME, Anchor, LORE, and Kernel SHAP work is fundamental to understanding how ConLUX augments them
  - Quick check question: What are the three main components (predicate sets, perturbation models, learning algorithms) shared by local model-agnostic explanation techniques?

- Concept: Concept predicates and their properties
  - Why needed here: The definition and properties of concept predicates (descriptive, human evaluable) are central to ConLUX's approach
  - Quick check question: What are the two key properties that a concept predicate must satisfy according to ConLUX's definition?

- Concept: Predicate-to-feature mapping
  - Why needed here: Understanding how predicate representations are transformed back to the original input space is crucial for the perturbation model extension
  - Quick check question: How does the predicate-to-feature mapping function (tp2f) transform a binary vector representing predicates back to the original input space?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input → Concept extraction → Predicate replacement → Perturbation model extension → Explanation generation
- Critical path: The framework processes inputs through concept extraction using pre-trained models, replaces feature predicates with concept predicates, extends perturbation models to generate concept-based samples, and produces unified explanations
- Design tradeoffs: ConLUX trades computational complexity (using large models for concept extraction) for improved fidelity and understandability, sacrificing some precision in concept representation for broader applicability across different models and tasks
- Failure signatures: Explanations become less faithful if concept extraction fails to capture relevant concepts, if predicate replacement doesn't align with model decision process, or if perturbation model extension cannot effectively generate concept-based samples
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Apply ConLUX to LIME on a simple text sentiment analysis task, comparing feature-level vs concept-level explanations
  2. Test ConLUX with different pre-trained models for concept extraction (GPT-3.5 vs other models) on the same task
  3. Evaluate the impact of different numbers of concept predicates on explanation fidelity for an image classification task

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does ConLUX handle cases where the concept extraction model (e.g., GPT-4) fails to identify relevant high-level concepts for a given input?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions using large pre-trained models to extract high-level concepts but doesn't discuss failure cases or fallback mechanisms
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on successful concept extraction scenarios but doesn't address potential limitations or error handling when concept extraction fails
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments showing ConLUX's performance when concept extraction models fail, or a discussion of fallback mechanisms for such cases

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the computational overhead of ConLUX compared to vanilla explanation methods, especially considering the additional concept extraction and predicate-feature mapping steps?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] While the paper discusses the methodology, it doesn't provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost or runtime comparison with vanilla methods
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on the effectiveness of ConLUX in terms of explanation fidelity but doesn't address the practical implications of its computational requirements
- What evidence would resolve it: A thorough runtime analysis comparing ConLUX with vanilla methods across different model sizes and input types

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the choice of concept extraction model (e.g., GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4) affect the quality and fidelity of ConLUX explanations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using GPT-3.5 for concept extraction in experiments but doesn't compare results across different model sizes or types
- Why unresolved: The paper uses a specific model for concept extraction without exploring how different models might impact explanation quality
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments using different concept extraction models, showing how model choice affects explanation fidelity and user understanding

## Limitations

- The framework relies heavily on large pre-trained models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Llama3.1) which introduces significant computational overhead and potential variability in concept extraction quality
- The evaluation focuses primarily on fidelity metrics without comprehensive user studies to validate the claimed improvements in explainability and understandability
- The extension to image tasks uses modified rather than fully developed concept-based approaches, suggesting the framework may have limitations in handling different data modalities equally well

## Confidence

- Medium confidence in claims about improved explanation fidelity based on specific models and datasets
- Low confidence in claims about user understandability without user studies
- Medium confidence in the theoretical soundness of replacing feature predicates with concept predicates

## Next Checks

1. Verify the quality and relevance of automatically extracted concepts by manually inspecting a sample of extracted concepts for different input types
2. Test the framework's performance when concept extraction models fail or return irrelevant concepts to understand robustness
3. Conduct runtime analysis comparing ConLUX with vanilla explanation methods across different model sizes and input types to quantify computational overhead
