# Has Multimodal Learning Delivered Universal Intelligence in Healthcare? A Comprehensive Survey

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.12880
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12880
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Current multimodal learning technologies have not achieved universal intelligence in healthcare due to data limitations, model constraints, and ethical concerns.

## Executive Summary
This survey examines whether multimodal learning has delivered universal intelligence in healthcare by analyzing current datasets, task-oriented methods, and foundation models. The authors conclude that despite significant progress, current technologies fall short of universal medical AI due to limitations in data diversity, model capabilities, and ethical considerations. The study proposes ten future research directions to advance toward universal intelligence, including improving data quality, incorporating more modalities, and developing unified models.

## Method Summary
The survey systematically reviews multimodal learning approaches in healthcare through three main components: medical datasets (images, text, and metadata), task-oriented methods (VQA, RG, IC, SS, OD), and foundation models (CFMs and MLLMs). The authors analyze existing approaches using contrastive learning and instruction-tuning, highlighting limitations in data quality, model adaptation, and ethical concerns. The study synthesizes findings from 40 references to identify gaps and propose future directions.

## Key Results
- Current RG datasets lack diversity and representation, with simpleness in question quality for medical VQA tasks
- CFMs and MLLMs show task unification capabilities but struggle with medical-specific reasoning and domain knowledge integration
- Ethical concerns including data privacy, model bias, and lack of interpretability prevent widespread clinical adoption

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multimodal learning in healthcare has NOT delivered universal intelligence because current models are data-limited and fail to capture fine-grained, domain-specific context.
- Mechanism: Healthcare data suffers from low diversity, simplistic construction, and lack of fine-grained annotations, preventing models from learning the nuanced decision-making required in clinical practice.
- Core assumption: The effectiveness of multimodal learning is fundamentally constrained by the quality and diversity of the training data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "current technologies have NOT achieved universal intelligence and there remains a significant journey to undertake"
  - [section] "current RG datasets lack diversity and representation...medical VQA datasets encounter the following limitations: 1) Imbalance of quality and quantity...2) Relative simpleness of the question"
- Break condition: If new datasets with higher diversity, richer contextual information, and fine-grained annotations are introduced, this mechanism would break.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Foundation models (CFMs and MLLMs) contribute to unifying tasks but still fall short of universal intelligence due to limited adaptation to medical domain specifics.
- Mechanism: While CFMs unify multiple tasks across modalities through contrastive learning and MLLMs enable text generation from multimodal inputs, both struggle with medical-specific reasoning, domain knowledge integration, and generalization to unseen clinical scenarios.
- Core assumption: The architecture and pre-training strategies of current FMs are insufficient for capturing the complexity and specificity of medical decision-making.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "current technologies have NOT achieved universal intelligence"
  - [section] "CFMs can do zero-shot image classification...but it would not suffice for practical applications...MLLMs even exhibit inferior performance to those general-domain models"
- Break condition: If FMs are developed with more sophisticated domain knowledge integration, better fine-tuning strategies, and improved reasoning capabilities, this mechanism would break.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Ethical concerns and user trust issues prevent the widespread adoption of multimodal AI in healthcare, hindering the achievement of universal intelligence.
- Mechanism: Issues such as data privacy, model bias, hallucinations, and lack of interpretability create barriers to clinical deployment, as medical professionals and patients are reluctant to rely on AI systems that cannot guarantee safety, fairness, and transparency.
- Core assumption: The success of universal intelligence in healthcare depends not only on technical capabilities but also on ethical considerations and user acceptance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "there remains a significant journey to undertake" (implies ethical and trust issues)
  - [section] "data privacy and model bias need careful attention...FMs might allow data leakage...biases in FMs often stem from uneven demographic distributions"
- Break condition: If robust ethical frameworks, privacy-preserving techniques, bias mitigation strategies, and explainable AI methods are developed and implemented, this mechanism would break.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Data diversity and quality
  - Why needed here: The effectiveness of multimodal learning models is fundamentally constrained by the diversity and quality of the training data. Without sufficient and representative data, models cannot learn the nuanced patterns required for universal intelligence in healthcare.
  - Quick check question: Can you identify the main limitations of current medical datasets in terms of diversity, volume, and construction approaches?

- Concept: Foundation models and their limitations
  - Why needed here: Understanding the capabilities and limitations of CFMs and MLLMs is crucial for assessing their potential to achieve universal intelligence in healthcare. While they offer task unification and multimodal processing, they still struggle with medical-specific reasoning and domain knowledge integration.
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between CFMs and MLLMs, and what are their respective strengths and weaknesses in the medical domain?

- Concept: Ethical considerations and user trust
  - Why needed here: Ethical issues such as data privacy, model bias, and lack of interpretability are significant barriers to the adoption of multimodal AI in healthcare. Addressing these concerns is essential for building trust and ensuring the responsible deployment of AI systems.
  - Quick check question: What are the main ethical challenges associated with using multimodal AI in healthcare, and how can they be addressed?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data layer: Medical datasets (images, text, other modalities)
  - Model layer: Task-oriented methods, CFMs, MLLMs
  - Application layer: Downstream tasks (VQA, RG, IC, SS, OD, etc.)
  - Ethics layer: Data privacy, bias mitigation, explainability

- Critical path:
  1. Data collection and curation (high-quality, diverse datasets)
  2. Model development and pre-training (CFMs and MLLMs)
  3. Fine-tuning and adaptation (domain-specific knowledge integration)
  4. Evaluation and validation (comprehensive benchmarks, user studies)
  5. Deployment and monitoring (ethical considerations, continuous improvement)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model complexity vs. interpretability: More complex models may achieve better performance but are harder to interpret and explain to users.
  - Data quantity vs. quality: Collecting large amounts of data may introduce noise and bias, while focusing on high-quality data may limit the model's generalizability.
  - Task-specific vs. universal models: Specialized models may excel at specific tasks but lack the flexibility to handle diverse clinical scenarios.

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on unseen or rare clinical cases
  - Biased predictions against certain demographic groups
  - Lack of transparency and explainability in model decisions
  - Privacy breaches or data leakage incidents

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the performance of a CFM on a diverse set of medical tasks (IC, SS, OD, VQA, RG) using a comprehensive benchmark dataset.
  2. Assess the impact of incorporating domain knowledge (e.g., medical KGs) on the performance and interpretability of a CFM or MLLM.
  3. Conduct a user study with medical professionals to evaluate the trust, usability, and ethical concerns associated with a deployed multimodal AI system.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses limitations in data diversity and volume, particularly for report generation and VQA datasets. It suggests collecting high-quality, diverse data from multiple modalities, including medical audio, video, and time series data, as a future direction.
- Why unresolved: Current datasets lack diversity and representation, often focusing on specific fields or institutions. They also lack sufficient contextual information and fine-grained details necessary for accurate and comprehensive modeling.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of models trained on large-scale, diverse datasets encompassing multiple modalities, patient histories, and fine-grained annotations. Demonstrating improved performance on a wide range of tasks and real-world clinical scenarios.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can multimodal learning models effectively integrate and utilize domain-specific knowledge to improve performance and reduce hallucinations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the importance of incorporating domain knowledge, such as medical knowledge graphs, to enhance semantic representations and reduce hallucinations. It suggests learning general semantic tokens for discrete knowledge data to seamlessly integrate with language models.
- Why unresolved: Current methods often transform structured knowledge into token sequences, leading to information loss. Integrating this knowledge into image or language models is challenging due to representation disparities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of models that effectively integrate domain knowledge using techniques like general semantic tokens, graph neural networks, or other methods. Demonstrating improved performance, reduced hallucinations, and enhanced interpretability in medical tasks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What evaluation protocols and metrics can comprehensively and objectively assess the performance of multimodal learning models in healthcare?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the challenges of evaluating models that generate open-ended answers with free text. It suggests the need for comprehensive, standardized, and objective evaluation frameworks and metrics, potentially using AI-based evaluation methods.
- Why unresolved: Current evaluation methods rely on automatic statistical metrics like ROUGE-L and BLEU, which may not adequately capture the nuances of medical language and clinical accuracy. Human evaluation can be subjective and introduce biases.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of comprehensive evaluation frameworks that incorporate multiple metrics, including clinical accuracy, semantic similarity, and human expert evaluation. Demonstrating the ability to differentiate between models and provide actionable insights for improvement.

## Limitations

- The specific quantitative thresholds for "sufficient" data diversity across medical modalities remain undefined
- Model capability assessment relies on relative performance comparisons rather than absolute clinical utility metrics
- Ethical framework specificity lacks detailed approaches for balancing competing priorities in real-world deployment

## Confidence

- High confidence: The claim that multimodal learning has not achieved universal intelligence is well-supported by identified limitations in data diversity, model capabilities, and ethical concerns
- Medium confidence: Proposed future research directions are reasonable but lack prioritization based on feasibility or potential impact
- Low confidence: Assessment of foundation models' absolute limitations requires additional clinical validation studies

## Next Checks

1. **Quantitative data diversity audit**: Conduct systematic analysis of current medical multimodal datasets to establish specific metrics (demographic coverage, condition prevalence, institution diversity) and compare against proposed thresholds for "universal" training data.

2. **Clinical utility benchmark**: Develop and validate standardized benchmark that evaluates foundation models on both technical performance and clinical decision-making accuracy across diverse medical scenarios, including rare conditions and cross-institutional variation.

3. **Ethical framework validation**: Design and test framework for evaluating tradeoffs between privacy preservation, bias mitigation, and clinical accuracy in real-world healthcare settings using simulated deployment scenarios with medical professionals.
