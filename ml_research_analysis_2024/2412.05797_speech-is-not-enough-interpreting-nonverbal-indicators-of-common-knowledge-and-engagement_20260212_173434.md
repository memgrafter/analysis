# Speech Is Not Enough: Interpreting Nonverbal Indicators of Common Knowledge and Engagement

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.05797
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05797
- Reference count: 8
- Primary result: An AI partner detects nonverbal behaviors (gaze, gesture, posture) to support group problem-solving and social dynamics in student task-oriented interactions.

## Executive Summary
This work develops an AI partner to support group problem-solving and social dynamics by detecting nonverbal behaviors in student task-oriented interactions. The approach combines multimodal analytics—tracking gestures (e.g., pointing), gaze direction, posture (leaning in/out), and object detection—using Azure Kinect RGBD cameras and neural networks for posture classification. A FasterRCNN ResNet-50-FPN model trained on annotated object bounding boxes provides real-time object detection. Two scenarios were evaluated: a Fibonacci weights task for knowledge support and a simulated classroom project-planning task for social cohesion. The multimodal analysis accurately distinguishes engagement levels and identifies states such as dominated discussions, demonstrating the necessity of nonverbal cues for AI intervention. Future work includes expanding object detection to common devices and porting models to other collaborative settings.

## Method Summary
The system uses Azure Kinect RGBD cameras to capture video and audio data from three participants seated around a table. Body tracking (32 joints) is performed using the Azure Kinect SDK, gesture detection via MediaPipe, and gaze estimation using a vector from the ear midpoint to the nose extended into 3D space. Real-time object detection is implemented with a FasterRCNN ResNet-50-FPN model trained on annotated object bounding boxes for 10 epochs. Posture classification (leaning in/out) is handled by a two-layer feedforward neural network trained per participant position. Multimodal fusion of these signals, along with ASR, enables the AI partner to infer engagement and social states for intervention.

## Key Results
- Multimodal analysis accurately distinguishes engagement levels and identifies states such as dominated discussions.
- Posture tracking (leaning in/out) is a powerful indicator of group engagement level.
- Real-time object detection via FasterRCNN ResNet-50-FPN provides valuable input for knowledge support in collaborative tasks.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multimodal analysis accurately distinguishes engagement levels and identifies states such as dominated discussions.
- Mechanism: Combining verbal (ASR) and nonverbal (gaze, gesture, posture) inputs provides richer contextual cues that ASR alone misses, enabling the AI partner to detect nuanced social dynamics like disengagement in dominated discussions.
- Core assumption: Nonverbal cues are sufficiently reliable and complementary to verbal cues to support real-time AI intervention decisions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "multimodal analytics is crucial for identifying non-verbal interactions... In conjunction with their verbal participation, this creates an holistic understanding of collaboration and engagement"
  - [section] "Automatic speech recognition is a vital part of identifying both positive and negative social situations. However, as the amount of topics, participants, and background noise expands, ASR accuracy decreases... Multi-channel input is crucial for useful input to AI partners."
- Break condition: If nonverbal cues become noisy or ambiguous (e.g., occlusions, cultural differences), the multimodal signal may degrade and misguide the AI partner.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Real-time object detection via FasterRCNN ResNet-50-FPN provides valuable input for knowledge support in collaborative tasks.
- Mechanism: Trained object detectors recognize task-relevant objects (e.g., blocks, scales) in situ, enabling the AI to understand the problem space and offer timely knowledge support based on what participants are interacting with.
- Core assumption: Domain-specific object detection can be rapidly trained on minimal annotated data and ported to new tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Real-time object detection in the video is performed using a FasterRCNN ResNet-50-FPM model... trained over annotations of object bounding boxes for 10 epochs... The expectation is that object detection provides valuable input for AI Partners offering knowledge support."
  - [section] "With minimal amounts of training data we can port to similar new objects specific to new domains."
- Break condition: If object detection accuracy drops in complex or novel environments, the AI partner may misinterpret the task context and provide incorrect support.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Posture tracking (leaning in/out) is a powerful indicator of group engagement level.
- Mechanism: By flattening body orientation vectors and classifying posture, the system infers whether participants are engaged or disengaged, informing intervention timing.
- Core assumption: Lean direction correlates reliably with engagement across participants and contexts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Tracking each individual’s posture over time, in particular leaning in or leaning out, is a powerful indicator of a group’s engagement level."
  - [section] "Each participant’s position and orientation information is then flattened. The vectors are stacked and then input into a two-layer feedforward neural network. We train three such models, one for each participant position."
- Break condition: If participants’ physical positioning is constrained (e.g., seated posture fixed) or cultural norms differ, posture signals may not map accurately to engagement.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multimodal signal fusion
  - Why needed here: To combine verbal and nonverbal cues into a unified representation that the AI partner can reason over for real-time intervention.
  - Quick check question: What are the three primary nonverbal modalities tracked in this system, and how are they extracted?

- Concept: Real-time object detection training pipeline
  - Why needed here: To understand how domain-specific objects are annotated, detected, and used for knowledge support.
  - Quick check question: Which neural network architecture and training regimen are used for object detection in this work?

- Concept: Posture feature engineering
  - Why needed here: To know how body orientation data is preprocessed and modeled to infer engagement.
  - Quick check question: How is the participant’s position determined and what model is trained per position for posture classification?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Azure Kinect RGBD camera -> body tracking (32 joints) + depth data -> gaze & posture features -> gesture detection -> object detection -> multimodal fusion -> engagement/social state -> AI partner logic

- Critical path:
  RGBD frame -> body pose + depth -> gaze & posture features -> gesture detection -> object detection -> multimodal fusion -> engagement/social state -> intervention trigger

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Simpler gesture model (2-stage) vs. more complex but slower alternatives
  - Separate posture models per seat vs. single universal model
  - Minimal training data for object detection vs. higher accuracy with larger datasets
  - Gaze proxy using nose/ear joints vs. full eye-tracking hardware

- Failure signatures:
  - High posture classification error -> engagement detection unreliable
  - Object detector misses or mislabels key task objects -> wrong knowledge support
  - Gesture frustum misaligns -> incorrect joint visual attention inference
  - ASR errors not compensated by multimodal cues -> social state misprediction

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate posture classification accuracy across different participant positions and compare to manual annotations.
  2. Test object detection precision/recall on held-out frames from the Fibonacci weights task.
  3. Run a pilot with simulated classroom task to measure detection accuracy of dominated discussion state with and without nonverbal cues.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the accuracy of object detection vary when applied to new devices (tablets, laptops, phones) compared to the original task-specific objects?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors plan to test object detection portability on common devices such as tablets, laptops, and phones.
- Why unresolved: The paper only demonstrates object detection on specific task-relevant objects (weighted blocks) and does not provide comparative accuracy data for common devices.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative accuracy metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) of the object detection model when trained and tested on both the original objects and common devices like tablets, laptops, and phones.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of speaker cohort (e.g., children) on the reliability of automatic speech recognition in multi-party group environments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that ASR accuracy decreases with more topics, participants, and background noise, and that children provide minimal training data.
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions the issue but does not provide specific data or analysis on how children as a speaker cohort affect ASR performance in group settings.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental data comparing ASR accuracy in groups with adult speakers versus children speakers, controlling for other variables like noise and topic complexity.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How generalizable is the social cohesion model across different educational and non-educational settings (e.g., business, government, healthcare)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest the approach could port to any working group of 3+ given a task-specific engagement model and topic summary.
- Why unresolved: The paper only demonstrates the model in a simulated classroom setting and does not provide validation across other domains.
- What evidence would resolve it: Validation studies applying the social cohesion model to at least three distinct settings (e.g., business meetings, government task forces, healthcare training) with comparative performance metrics.

## Limitations

- No quantitative validation data (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score) provided for core classification tasks.
- Reliance on proxies for gaze (nose/ear joint vectors) and the assumption that leaning reliably indicates engagement are not empirically tested across diverse participants or settings.
- Lack of reported detection accuracy or held-out test set for object detection pipeline.

## Confidence

- Confidence in the system's ability to reliably detect engagement and dominated discussions: Low
- Confidence in the real-time object detection pipeline: Medium
- Confidence in the overall system architecture and integration: High

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate posture classification accuracy: Conduct a user study with at least 10 participants performing the Fibonacci task, manually annotate posture (leaning in/out) per frame, and compare to the system's predictions. Report precision, recall, and confusion matrices for each participant position.

2. Test object detection generalization: Hold out 20% of annotated object bounding boxes from the Fibonacci task and evaluate the FasterRCNN model's precision and recall on this set. Additionally, test detection on a new set of objects (e.g., common classroom devices) with minimal retraining to assess rapid porting claims.

3. Pilot dominated discussion detection: Simulate a classroom project-planning task with scripted dominated discussion scenarios. Compare the system's ability to detect this state using multimodal cues versus ASR-only, and report accuracy, false positive, and false negative rates.
