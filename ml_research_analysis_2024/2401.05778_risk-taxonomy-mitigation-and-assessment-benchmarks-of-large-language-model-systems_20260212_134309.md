# Risk Taxonomy, Mitigation, and Assessment Benchmarks of Large Language Model Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.05778
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05778
- Reference count: 40
- This paper proposes a module-oriented taxonomy to systematically analyze risks across different modules of large language model (LLM) systems, including input, language model, toolchain, and output modules.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical need for systematic risk management in large language model systems by proposing a comprehensive module-oriented taxonomy. The taxonomy categorizes potential risks across four key system modules - input, language model, toolchain, and output - while discussing corresponding mitigation strategies for each category. By surveying prevalent benchmarks for evaluating LLM safety and security, the paper provides a structured framework that enables developers to identify, assess, and address risks in a more organized and effective manner. The work aims to help LLM participants build more responsible and trustworthy systems by offering a systematic perspective that covers a broader range of risks than previous taxonomies.

## Method Summary
The paper conducts a comprehensive literature review on LLM risks, focusing on four system modules: input, language model, toolchain, and output. It develops a module-oriented risk taxonomy that categorizes potential risks and corresponding mitigation strategies for each module. The study also reviews and summarizes existing benchmarks for evaluating LLM safety and security. The methodology involves systematic categorization of risks, review of mitigation methods, and analysis of evaluation benchmarks to provide a structured framework for managing LLM risks.

## Key Results
- Proposes a module-oriented taxonomy covering input, language model, toolchain, and output modules
- Identifies and categorizes risks specific to each module with corresponding mitigation strategies
- Reviews prevalent benchmarks for evaluating LLM safety and security
- Provides a systematic perspective that covers more comprehensive LLM risks than previous taxonomies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The module-oriented taxonomy allows developers to quickly pinpoint system modules associated with a specific risk.
- Mechanism: By categorizing risks into four modules (input, language model, toolchain, output), the taxonomy creates a direct mapping from risk type to affected components.
- Core assumption: Risks can be meaningfully decomposed by module boundaries without losing critical cross-module interactions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "propose a module-oriented taxonomy, which systematically analyzes potential risks associated with each module of an LLM system"
  - [section] "For a specific risk, the module-oriented taxonomy can assist in quickly pinpointing modules necessitating attention"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus papers mention taxonomy but don't detail module-based risk mapping
- Break condition: If risks inherently span multiple modules and cannot be isolated, the mapping becomes ambiguous.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Mitigation strategies can be effectively matched to risk categories through the taxonomy.
- Mechanism: Each risk category maps to specific mitigation techniques (e.g., privacy-preserving methods for privacy leakage, adversarial training for model attacks).
- Core assumption: Mitigation strategies are modular and can be applied independently to address specific risk types.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "discusses the corresponding mitigation strategies"
  - [section] "survey the mitigation strategies employed by different system modules"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus focuses on taxonomy development but doesn't validate mitigation matching
- Break condition: If mitigation strategies have unintended side effects on other modules, the mapping becomes unreliable.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The taxonomy provides a systematic perspective that covers more comprehensive LLM risks than previous taxonomies.
- Mechanism: By including toolchain module risks and novel LLM-specific attacks, the taxonomy expands risk coverage beyond traditional output-focused approaches.
- Core assumption: Toolchain module risks are significant enough to warrant dedicated categorization.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "covers a more comprehensive range of LLM risks than the previous taxonomies"
  - [section] "we consider the security issues closely associated with the toolchain, which is rarely discussed in prior surveys"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus papers don't compare comprehensiveness against prior taxonomies
- Break condition: If toolchain risks prove to be minimal in practice, the expanded coverage may be unnecessary complexity.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Risk decomposition by system modules
  - Why needed here: Enables targeted mitigation and clear responsibility boundaries
  - Quick check question: Can you identify which module(s) would be responsible for addressing a privacy leakage risk?

- Concept: Mitigation strategy categorization
  - Why needed here: Provides a structured approach to selecting appropriate countermeasures
  - Quick check question: What mitigation approach would you choose for detecting adversarial prompts?

- Concept: Risk assessment benchmarking
  - Why needed here: Establishes evaluation criteria for measuring mitigation effectiveness
  - Quick check question: Which benchmark would you use to evaluate LLM robustness against adversarial examples?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input module → Language model module → Toolchain module → Output module
- Critical path: Prompt processing → Model inference → Tool integration → Content generation → Output filtering
- Design tradeoffs: Comprehensive risk coverage vs. implementation complexity
- Failure signatures: Cross-module dependencies causing cascading failures, mitigation conflicts
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement keyword matching for malicious prompt detection in input module
  2. Apply differential privacy training to mitigate privacy leakage in language model module
  3. Deploy control flow integrity checks for software development tool security

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How effective are current defense methods against novel adversarial prompts and jailbreak attacks on LLMs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses various adversarial prompt attacks including goal hijacking, prompt leaking, and jailbreaking, but notes that existing defense methods are limited.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges that attackers can continually devise new prompt injection techniques, and existing rule-based or classifier-based defenses may not keep pace.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing the success rates of novel adversarial prompts against multiple defense methods over time, showing the adaptability and effectiveness of defenses.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the trade-offs between data intervention methods for mitigating toxicity and bias versus their impact on model performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that simple data filtering can degrade model performance and may inadvertently filter out certain demographic groups.
- Why unresolved: The paper highlights the challenge of balancing safety and utility but does not provide quantitative trade-off analyses.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies measuring model performance (e.g., perplexity, task accuracy) before and after different data intervention techniques, alongside toxicity and bias metrics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we develop a general defense framework that addresses both traditional and emerging model attacks on LLMs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper surveys various model attacks (extraction, inference, poisoning, evasion, overhead) and existing defenses, but notes the need for a comprehensive framework.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the gap in universal defenses but does not propose or evaluate such a framework.
- What evidence would resolve it: A unified defense framework tested against a diverse set of model attacks, demonstrating effectiveness across multiple attack types with minimal performance degradation.

## Limitations

- The taxonomy's assumption that risks can be cleanly separated by module boundaries may not hold for cross-cutting security concerns
- Mitigation strategy matching doesn't address potential conflicts or unintended side effects across modules
- Limited empirical validation of the claimed improvement in risk coverage comprehensiveness compared to existing taxonomies

## Confidence

- Module-based risk isolation assumption: Medium
- Mitigation strategy matching reliability: Medium
- Comprehensive risk coverage claim: Low

## Next Checks

1. Conduct empirical analysis of cross-module risk propagation to validate whether the taxonomy's module-based risk isolation assumption holds in practice, measuring the frequency and impact of risks that span multiple modules.

2. Implement and test mitigation strategy interactions in a controlled environment to identify potential conflicts or unintended side effects when applying multiple mitigation approaches across different modules.

3. Perform comparative benchmarking against existing LLM risk taxonomies using a standardized risk corpus to quantify the claimed improvement in coverage comprehensiveness.
