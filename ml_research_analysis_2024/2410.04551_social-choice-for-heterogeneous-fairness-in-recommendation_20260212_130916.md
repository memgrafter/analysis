# Social Choice for Heterogeneous Fairness in Recommendation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.04551
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04551
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces SCRUF-D, a multi-agent social choice framework for fair recommendation that supports heterogeneous fairness definitions across multiple protected groups.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents SCRUF-D (Social Choice for Recommendation with User Fairness Definitions), a novel multi-agent framework that addresses the challenge of heterogeneous fairness definitions in recommendation systems. The framework assigns different fairness agents to users based on their compatibility and fairness needs, then aggregates their preferences with traditional recommendations using choice mechanisms. Experiments demonstrate that SCRUF-D can simultaneously optimize multiple fairness metrics (proportional, utility, and MRR fairness) while maintaining high accuracy, particularly through the Rescore mechanism with Weighted allocation which achieves optimal fairness-accuracy trade-offs.

## Method Summary
SCRUF-D operates by creating multiple fairness agents, each implementing a specific fairness definition (proportional, utility, or MRR-based). Users are assigned to these agents based on compatibility scores that measure how well their preferences align with each fairness agent's goals. The framework then combines the recommendations from these fairness agents with traditional recommendations using choice mechanisms like lottery and weighted allocation. The lottery mechanism selects recommendations randomly from eligible items based on agent utility, while the weighted mechanism scores items by weighting agent utilities by their compatibility with the user. This approach allows the system to handle heterogeneous fairness definitions across different user groups while maintaining recommendation quality.

## Key Results
- SCRUF-D successfully optimizes multiple fairness metrics simultaneously (proportional, utility, and MRR fairness) across different user groups
- The Rescore mechanism with Weighted allocation achieves the best fairness-accuracy trade-off, reaching fairness targets across all agents with minimal accuracy loss
- The Lottery allocation mechanism offers similar fairness outcomes to Weighted allocation but with potential computational efficiency advantages
- The framework maintains high recommendation accuracy while implementing heterogeneous fairness definitions, addressing a key limitation of prior fair recommendation research

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by decomposing the fairness problem into multiple specialized agents, each optimizing for a specific fairness definition. By assigning users to agents based on compatibility scores, the system ensures that each user's recommendations align with their fairness needs while maintaining group-level fairness properties. The choice mechanisms (lottery and weighted) then aggregate these heterogeneous recommendations in a way that balances fairness objectives with recommendation quality. This multi-agent approach allows the system to handle the inherent tension between different fairness definitions that cannot be simultaneously optimized by a single unified metric.

## Foundational Learning
- **Social Choice Theory**: Needed to understand how to aggregate preferences from multiple agents; quick check: can the system handle cyclic preferences or voting paradoxes?
- **Fairness Definitions**: Understanding proportional, utility, and MRR-based fairness metrics; quick check: do these metrics conflict when applied simultaneously?
- **Compatibility Scoring**: Mechanism for measuring alignment between user preferences and fairness agent goals; quick check: how sensitive are results to errors in compatibility estimation?
- **Multi-agent Systems**: Framework architecture for coordinating multiple specialized recommendation agents; quick check: what happens when agents have conflicting recommendations?
- **Fairness-Accuracy Trade-offs**: Understanding the relationship between fairness optimization and recommendation quality; quick check: can the system maintain high accuracy while achieving fairness targets?
- **Choice Mechanisms**: Methods for combining multiple recommendation sources (lottery, weighted); quick check: how do different mechanisms affect final recommendation quality?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
User -> Compatibility Engine -> Fairness Agent Pool -> Choice Mechanism -> Final Recommendations

**Critical Path:**
User query → Compatibility score computation → Agent assignment → Individual agent recommendations → Choice mechanism aggregation → Final recommendations returned

**Design Tradeoffs:**
The framework trades computational complexity for flexibility in handling heterogeneous fairness definitions. While running multiple fairness agents and choice mechanisms increases resource requirements, it enables support for diverse fairness needs across user groups. The choice between lottery and weighted allocation mechanisms represents a tradeoff between computational efficiency (lottery) and precision in fairness optimization (weighted).

**Failure Signatures:**
- Low compatibility scores across all agents may indicate poor agent-user matching
- One agent dominating recommendations suggests imbalanced compatibility distribution
- Failure to achieve fairness targets despite high compatibility scores indicates choice mechanism inadequacy
- Significant accuracy degradation suggests excessive fairness optimization

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test framework with synthetic compatibility scores to validate basic functionality
2. Compare lottery vs weighted allocation mechanisms on a single fairness metric
3. Measure fairness-accuracy trade-offs across different numbers of fairness agents

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies on synthetic protected group assignments in MovieLens rather than naturally occurring demographic data
- Computational overhead of multiple fairness agents and choice mechanisms could become prohibitive at scale
- Framework assumes compatibility scores are available and accurate without addressing how these would be obtained in practice

## Confidence

**High**: The framework's technical soundness and the demonstration that it can optimize multiple fairness metrics simultaneously

**Medium**: The generalizability of results across different recommendation domains given limited dataset diversity

**Medium**: The practical scalability claims, particularly for Weighted allocation mechanism

## Next Checks
1. Validate framework performance on datasets with naturally occurring protected group information (e.g., real demographic data) rather than synthetic assignments
2. Conduct large-scale experiments measuring computational efficiency and memory requirements across different allocation mechanisms
3. Test framework robustness when compatibility scores are noisy or incomplete through sensitivity analysis
