# Guiding Vision-Language Model Selection for Visual Question-Answering Across Tasks, Domains, and Knowledge Types

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09269

- Primary result: No single VLM excels universally; model selection depends on task type, domain, and knowledge requirements

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of selecting appropriate Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for Visual Question-Answering (VQA) tasks across different domains, knowledge types, and practical constraints. The authors introduce VQA360, a novel dataset derived from established VQA benchmarks, annotated with task types, application domains, and knowledge types. They also propose GoEval, a multimodal evaluation metric based on GPT-4o, achieving a 56.71% correlation with human judgments. Through experiments with 10 state-of-the-art VLM variants, the study reveals that no single model excels universally. Proprietary models like Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4o-mini generally outperform others, but open-source models like InternVL-2-8B and CogVLM-2-Llama-3-19B demonstrate competitive strengths in specific scenarios.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a comprehensive framework for VQA model selection through three main components: VQA360 dataset creation, GoEval evaluation metric development, and systematic model benchmarking. VQA360 was constructed by annotating established VQA benchmarks with task types (counting, reasoning, grounding), application domains (biology, business, daily life, general), and knowledge types (common sense, domain-specific, factual, visual). GoEval was developed using GPT-4o to evaluate VQA responses across multiple dimensions. Ten state-of-the-art VLMs were then evaluated across these dimensions to identify performance patterns and selection criteria.

## Key Results
- No single VLM excels across all task types, domains, and knowledge types
- Proprietary models (Gemini-1.5-Pro, GPT-4o-mini) generally outperform others but with domain-specific exceptions
- Open-source models (InternVL-2-8B, CogVLM-2-Llama-3-19B) show competitive performance in specific scenarios
- VQA task complexity significantly impacts model selection requirements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study's effectiveness stems from its systematic approach to decomposing VQA into interpretable dimensions and evaluating models across these dimensions. By creating VQA360 with granular annotations, the researchers could isolate model strengths and weaknesses across specific task characteristics. The GoEval metric provides a consistent evaluation framework that captures multiple aspects of VQA performance beyond simple accuracy, including reasoning quality and contextual understanding.

## Foundational Learning
**VQA Task Types** - Different VQA tasks require different model capabilities (why needed: to understand model selection criteria; quick check: identify task type in sample VQA questions)
**Knowledge Type Classification** - Models must handle common sense, domain-specific, factual, and visual knowledge differently (why needed: to match models to application requirements; quick check: categorize knowledge types in sample questions)
**Domain-Specific Performance** - Model performance varies significantly across application domains (why needed: to ensure appropriate model selection for specialized use cases; quick check: compare model performance across different domain datasets)
**Evaluation Metric Design** - GoEval uses GPT-4o for comprehensive multimodal evaluation (why needed: to provide consistent, interpretable evaluation beyond accuracy; quick check: apply GoEval to sample VQA responses)

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
VQA360 Dataset Creation -> Model Benchmarking Pipeline -> GoEval Evaluation -> Performance Analysis

**Critical Path:**
Dataset annotation → Model evaluation → Correlation analysis → Performance pattern identification

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- Comprehensive evaluation vs. computational cost
- Proprietary model inclusion vs. accessibility for practitioners
- Granular annotation vs. annotation effort and consistency

**Failure Signatures:**
- Low correlation between GoEval and human judgments indicates metric limitations
- Inconsistent performance across domains suggests inadequate domain adaptation
- Task-specific failures reveal model architecture limitations

**First 3 Experiments to Run:**
1. Evaluate a new VQA dataset using GoEval to validate metric consistency
2. Test additional VLMs on VQA360 to expand model coverage
3. Conduct ablation studies on GoEval's evaluation dimensions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- GoEval correlation with human judgments is moderate at 56.71%, suggesting potential evaluation gaps
- Proprietary models' superior performance may be influenced by undisclosed training advantages
- Focus on English-language benchmarks limits multilingual applicability
- Dataset creation through annotation of existing benchmarks may not capture real-world diversity

## Confidence

**Model performance rankings:** High - Based on systematic evaluation across multiple tasks and domains with clear statistical significance

**Domain-specific recommendations:** Medium - While patterns are observed, the limited number of domains tested constrains generalizability

**GoEval metric validity:** Medium - Shows correlation with human judgments but may not capture all evaluation dimensions

**Universality of findings:** Low - Results may not extend beyond tested VLMs, benchmarks, and evaluation conditions

## Next Checks

1. Test model performance on additional domains beyond the four covered (biology, business, daily life, and general) to assess generalizability of domain-specific recommendations

2. Conduct ablation studies on GoEval by comparing its rankings with multiple human annotator panels to better understand its limitations

3. Evaluate the same models on multilingual VQA datasets to determine if performance patterns hold across languages
