# Advancing Retail Data Science: Comprehensive Evaluation of Synthetic Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.13130
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13130
- Reference count: 40
- This paper presents a comprehensive framework for evaluating synthetic retail data, focusing on fidelity, utility, and privacy.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for evaluating synthetic retail data generation models across three critical dimensions: fidelity, utility, and privacy. The framework distinguishes between continuous and discrete data attributes, employing appropriate metrics for each, and assesses utility through real-world retail tasks like demand forecasting and dynamic pricing. Privacy is safeguarded using Differential Privacy and related metrics. Applied to the Complete Journey dataset, the framework evaluated five generative models, with TabAutoDiff and CTGAN emerging as top performers in fidelity, while TabAutoDiff excelled in both utility and privacy.

## Method Summary
The framework uses a train-holdout-eval split approach to evaluate synthetic data generation models. For fidelity assessment, it computes marginal distributions using Wasserstein distance for numerical features and Jensen-Shannon distance for categorical features, while joint distributions are evaluated using Pearson correlation. Utility is assessed through classification tasks (predicting premium customers) and product association analysis using Apriori algorithm. Privacy is evaluated using Distance to Closest Record (DCR) and Closest Cluster Ratio (CCR) metrics. The framework was applied to evaluate five generative models (CTGAN, AutoGAN, TabDDPM, StasyAutoDiff, TabAutoDiff) on the Complete Journey retail dataset.

## Key Results
- TabAutoDiff and CTGAN achieved the highest fidelity scores with lowest Wasserstein distances
- TabAutoDiff demonstrated superior utility performance across both classification and product association tasks
- Privacy metrics showed TabAutoDiff maintained optimal balance between resemblance to training data and generalization
- The framework successfully identified model-specific strengths and weaknesses across fidelity, utility, and privacy dimensions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The framework ensures synthetic data is both statistically faithful and practically useful by combining fidelity metrics (Wasserstein distance, Pearson correlation) to measure statistical similarity with utility metrics based on real-world task performance. This dual approach validates that synthetic data not only mirrors real data distributions but also maintains effectiveness for downstream retail applications.

### Mechanism 2
Privacy preservation is achieved through careful balance between resemblance to training data and generalization, assessed using Distance to Closest Record (DCR) and Closest Cluster Ratio (CCR) metrics. High DCR values indicate effective anonymization while low CCR values suggest the model avoided overfitting, ensuring both privacy and generalizability.

### Mechanism 3
The framework provides scalable evaluation through standardized processes across fidelity, utility, and privacy dimensions using consistent dataset splits. This standardization enables fair comparison of different generative models and provides reliable assessment across various contexts.

## Foundational Learning

- **Statistical distance metrics (Wasserstein distance, Jensen-Shannon distance)**: Quantify how closely synthetic and real data distributions match, crucial for assessing fidelity. Quick check: What does a lower Wasserstein distance between synthetic and real data distributions indicate about the synthetic data's fidelity?

- **Machine learning utility metrics (accuracy, F1 score, ROC, precision, recall)**: Measure how well models trained on synthetic data perform on real-world tasks, crucial for assessing utility. Quick check: If a model trained on synthetic data achieves similar accuracy to a model trained on real data on a held-out test set, what does this imply about the synthetic data's utility?

- **Privacy metrics (Differential Privacy, Distance to Closest Record, Closest Cluster Ratio)**: Quantify privacy-preserving properties of synthetic data, crucial for ensuring compliance with data protection regulations. Quick check: How does a high Distance to Closest Record value contribute to the privacy of synthetic data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data Preparation -> Model Training -> Fidelity Assessment -> Utility Assessment -> Privacy Assessment -> Result Interpretation
- **Critical path**: 1) Prepare dataset and split into train/holdout/eval sets; 2) Generate synthetic data using chosen model; 3) Assess synthetic data's fidelity, utility, and privacy; 4) Interpret results to determine model effectiveness
- **Design tradeoffs**: The framework trades off between comprehensiveness (covering fidelity, utility, and privacy) and complexity (requiring multiple metrics and evaluations). It assumes high fidelity correlates with high utility, which may not always hold.
- **Failure signatures**: Fidelity assessment failure manifests as high Wasserstein distances or low Pearson correlations; utility assessment failure shows as poor downstream task performance; privacy assessment failure reveals high DCR values or low CCR values.
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Run framework on CTGAN to establish baseline performance metrics; 2) Compare CTGAN vs. TabAutoDiff performance across all dimensions; 3) Test framework sensitivity by intentionally generating low-fidelity synthetic data.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How do different retail data generation models perform when dealing with categorical columns that have dramatically imbalanced distributions? The paper notes that imbalanced distributions could lead to worse performance, particularly for GAN-based models susceptible to mode collapse, but does not provide empirical results on this specific scenario.

### Open Question 2
What is the minimum sample size required for reliable detection of data-copying in generative models, as suggested by BadGD's privacy framework? The paper references BadGD but does not specify sample size requirements, which are critical for practical deployment where data volumes vary.

### Open Question 3
Can the evaluation framework be extended to assess higher-order dependencies beyond pairwise relationships, such as complex product bundles or multi-product promotional effects? The framework successfully evaluates pairwise relationships but does not address higher-order interactions crucial for understanding complex retail phenomena.

## Limitations
- Limited empirical validation across different retail contexts and data domains
- Unproven assumption that high fidelity directly translates to improved utility
- Privacy metrics may not capture all privacy risks, particularly against sophisticated attacks

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in methodological soundness and comprehensive coverage of fidelity, utility, and privacy dimensions
- **Medium confidence** in practical effectiveness across different retail contexts
- **Low confidence** in the assumed correlation between fidelity and utility

## Next Checks
1. Apply the framework to at least two additional retail datasets with different characteristics to test generalizability and identify context-dependent limitations.
2. Systematically generate synthetic datasets with controlled fidelity levels and measure their performance on the same downstream tasks to empirically establish whether fidelity metrics predict utility outcomes.
3. Conduct membership inference and reconstruction attacks against synthetic datasets generated using the framework to validate whether DCR and CCR metrics adequately capture privacy risks against real-world adversaries.
