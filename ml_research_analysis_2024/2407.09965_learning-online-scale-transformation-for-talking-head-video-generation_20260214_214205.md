# Learning Online Scale Transformation for Talking Head Video Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.09965
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09965
- Authors: Fa-Ting Hong; Dan Xu
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: OSTNet achieves SSIM of 0.820 for same-scale reenactment and 0.780 for different-scale reenactment on VoxCeleb1 dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of scale inconsistency between source and driving images in talking head video generation, which degrades animation quality. The proposed OSTNet introduces an online scale transformation module that automatically aligns the driving face scale with the source face using keypoint-based scale information. Additionally, a multi-layer scale embedding mechanism preserves scale information throughout the generation process. The method eliminates the need for anchor frames and produces high-quality results that outperform state-of-the-art approaches.

## Method Summary
OSTNet tackles scale inconsistency through a three-part approach: (1) an online scale transformation module that extracts scale information from facial keypoints and warps the driving image to match the source scale, (2) a multi-layer scale embedding mechanism that preserves scale information throughout the generation process, and (3) an expression-preserved augmentation technique for training that removes scale information from driving faces while maintaining expression and pose. The model is trained end-to-end using reconstruction loss, equivariance loss, and keypoints distance loss on datasets including VoxCeleb1 and HDTF.

## Key Results
- OSTNet achieves SSIM of 0.820 for same-scale reenactment and 0.780 for different-scale reenactment on VoxCeleb1
- The method generates more accurate facial expressions in cross-identity reenactment compared to baseline approaches
- Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of both the scale transformation module and scale embedding mechanism

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The scale transformation module aligns driving face scale to source face scale using keypoint-based distance vectors. It computes distance vectors between each keypoint and the centroid, encodes these into a latent scale code, predicts fiducial points, and warps the driving image to match the source scale. The core assumption is that keypoints contain implicit scale information that can be extracted and used for alignment. This works because facial keypoints inherently encode the spatial relationships that define face scale.

### Mechanism 2
The multi-layer scale embedding mechanism preserves scale information throughout the generation process by adding the latent scale code from the scale transformation module to each layer of the generation process. The core assumption is that scale information degrades during generation and needs to be re-injected at multiple layers to prevent scale mismatch in the final output.

### Mechanism 3
The expression-preserved augmentation enables training on driving faces of any scale while maintaining pose and expression. It applies horizontal and vertical augmentation to the driving image, then pads and resizes to original dimensions, preserving expression and pose while changing scale. The core assumption is that augmentation can remove scale information while maintaining other facial characteristics.

## Foundational Learning

- **Keypoint detection and facial landmark localization**: Why needed here - the method relies on detecting facial keypoints to extract scale information and perform spatial transformations. Quick check - how does the method ensure keypoints are detected accurately across different face scales and orientations?

- **Spatial transformer networks and image warping**: Why needed here - the scale transformation module uses grid generators and warping operations to align the driving face to the source face scale. Quick check - what happens if the deformation map generated by the grid generator is not smooth or contains artifacts?

- **Multi-scale feature extraction and aggregation**: Why needed here - the method uses VGG-19 network to calculate reconstruction loss at multiple resolutions, and embeds scale information at each layer of the generation process. Quick check - how does the method ensure scale information is properly aggregated without interfering with other generation aspects?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Keypoint Detector (Fkp) → Scale Transformation Module → Dense Motion Module → Image Encoder (Fen) → Generation Process (F i down, F i up) → Output Layer
- **Critical path**: Keypoint Detection → Scale Transformation → Dense Motion Estimation → Generation Process → Output
- **Design tradeoffs**: Using keypoints for scale information extraction vs. using other features; embedding scale information at each layer vs. only at the beginning or end; using expression-preserved augmentation vs. other data augmentation techniques
- **Failure signatures**: Inaccurate keypoint detection leading to poor scale alignment; scale information degradation during generation leading to scale mismatch; overfitting to specific scale patterns during training
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Test keypoint detection accuracy across different face scales and orientations; 2) Validate scale transformation module output for various input scale differences; 3) Evaluate scale embedding effectiveness by comparing results with and without scale embedding at each layer

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the scale transformation module perform when the source and driving faces have vastly different scales (e.g., one face is much larger than the other)? The paper discusses the module's ability to align scales but doesn't test extreme scale differences. Evidence would come from testing OSTNet on a dataset with driving faces having significantly different scales compared to the source face and evaluating performance metrics.

### Open Question 2
How does OSTNet handle cases where the driving video has significant head rotation or pose variation? The paper focuses on scale alignment without discussing performance under varying head poses. Evidence would come from testing on driving videos with significant head rotation and evaluating generated video quality and identity preservation.

### Open Question 3
How does OSTNet perform in terms of computational efficiency compared to other state-of-the-art methods? The paper mentions using 8 RTX 3090 GPUs but doesn't provide detailed inference time or computational requirements. Evidence would come from benchmarking inference time and computational requirements against other methods.

## Limitations

- The paper lacks specific implementation details for critical components including the exact architecture of the dense motion module and keypoint detector
- The claim about keypoints containing implicit scale information is cited but lacks direct supporting evidence in the corpus
- The paper doesn't provide detailed information about computational efficiency or inference time compared to baseline methods

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The general approach of using keypoints for scale alignment and the effectiveness of the method on VoxCeleb1 dataset (SSIM of 0.820 for same-scale reenactment)
- **Medium confidence**: The multi-layer scale embedding mechanism and expression-preserved augmentation technique, as these are described but lack extensive validation or comparison with alternatives
- **Low confidence**: The claim that scale information degrades during generation and needs to be re-injected at multiple layers, as this is asserted but not empirically demonstrated through ablation studies

## Next Checks

1. Test the keypoint detector's performance across various face scales and orientations to verify it can reliably extract scale information
2. Compare the output of the scale transformation module with ground truth scale alignment using both visual inspection and quantitative metrics like SSIM
3. Conduct ablation studies comparing results with and without scale embedding at each generation layer to validate the claimed benefit of multi-layer scale preservation
