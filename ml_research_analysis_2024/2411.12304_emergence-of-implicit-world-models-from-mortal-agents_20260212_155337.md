# Emergence of Implicit World Models from Mortal Agents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.12304
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12304
- Authors: Kazuya Horibe; Naoto Yoshida
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: The paper proposes that implicit world models and active exploration can emerge as properties of autonomous agents optimizing open-ended behavior through homeostasis.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a novel approach to generating intrinsic motivation and world models in autonomous agents through a "mortal agent" framework. The core hypothesis is that by combining meta-reinforcement learning with homeostatic reinforcement learning, agents can develop implicit world models and exhibit active exploration behaviors. The approach leverages recurrent neural networks to enable meta-learning capabilities, allowing agents to implicitly construct environmental models while maintaining homeostatic balance. The fundamental premise is that the drive to maintain existence (homeostasis) creates an open-ended objective that naturally generates multiple internalized sub-goals and motivations through autopoietic processes.

## Method Summary
The proposed method combines homeostatic reinforcement learning with meta-reinforcement learning by incorporating recurrent neural networks into the agent architecture. The approach maps meta-RL components (external observations, latest action selection, latest reward) to homeostatic RL components (exteroception, proprioception, interoception). The agent maintains homeostasis as its primary objective, with the multi-modal observation space naturally corresponding to the requirements of meta-RL. The authors suggest that this combination can enable emergent world modeling and exploration behaviors without explicit novelty-seeking motivations, driven by the fundamental goal of maintaining existence.

## Key Results
- Theoretical framework proposed for combining meta-RL with homeostatic RL
- Hypothesis that RNNs in homeostatic agents can enable meta-learning and implicit world modeling
- Mapping between homeostatic RL components and meta-RL requirements
- Theoretical argument that mortality-driven homeostasis creates open-ended objectives for exploration

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Combining meta-reinforcement learning with homeostatic reinforcement learning enables emergent world models through recurrent neural networks.
- Mechanism: RNNs in homeostatic RL agents can implicitly learn environmental models while maintaining homeostatic balance, as shown in Wang et al.'s work where model-free architectures exhibited model-based behavior.
- Core assumption: The multi-modal observation space (exteroception, proprioception, interoception) maps naturally to meta-RL requirements (observations, actions, rewards).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "incorporating recurrent neural networks into homeostatic RL agents may enable meta-learning capabilities"
  - [section] "computational experiments have shown that, even though all of the agent architecture and optimization are carried out in model-free, such meta-RL agents behave like model-based"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus support for RNN + homeostasis combination
- Break condition: If the RNN fails to maintain stable homeostatic representations, or if the multi-modal mapping breaks down under complex environmental dynamics.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Mortality (the need to maintain homeostasis) creates an open-ended objective that drives intrinsic motivation and exploration.
- Mechanism: The fundamental drive to avoid death creates a unified extrinsic motivation that generates multiple internalized sub-goals (energy acquisition, predator avoidance) through autopoietic processes.
- Core assumption: Avoiding death is the most fundamental goal of life, preceding and enabling all other goal-setting behaviors.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The most fundamental goal of life is to avoid death. Avoiding death means maintaining a state of being alive, that is, possessing homeostasis"
  - [section] "Autopoiesis is a process by which life, driven by the meta-goal of preserving its own existence (being), autonomously sets multiple internalized motivations"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus support for mortality-driven intrinsic motivation emergence
- Break condition: If the homeostatic objective becomes too stable or too unstable, preventing the emergence of diverse sub-goals and exploration behaviors.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The agent-environment coupling through homeostasis enables open-ended generation of intrinsic motivations and world models.
- Mechanism: Through continuous interaction with the environment while maintaining homeostasis, agents develop implicit world models that guide exploration and behavior adaptation.
- Core assumption: Agent-environment coupling is sufficient to generate complex internal representations without explicit novelty-seeking mechanisms.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This 'mortal agent' approach aims to generate intrinsic motivations and world models through agent-environment coupling, guided by the fundamental goal of maintaining existence"
  - [section] "By conducting meta-RL based on the unified EM (homeostasis), we propose a 'mortal agent' that can open-endedly generate IMs and world models"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus support for agent-environment coupling generating world models
- Break condition: If environmental coupling fails to provide sufficient complexity or if the homeostatic balance prevents exploration.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Autopoiesis and biological autonomy
  - Why needed here: Understanding the theoretical foundation for how life maintains itself and generates autonomous goals is crucial for implementing similar mechanisms in artificial agents
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between autopoiesis and traditional homeostasis, and why is this distinction important for artificial agency?

- Concept: Reinforcement learning fundamentals
  - Why needed here: The paper builds on both meta-RL and homeostatic RL, requiring understanding of how agents learn from rewards and how these frameworks can be combined
  - Quick check question: How does the reward structure in homeostatic RL differ from standard RL, and what implications does this have for agent behavior?

- Concept: Recurrent neural networks and memory
  - Why needed here: RNNs are central to the proposed architecture for enabling meta-learning capabilities in homeostatic agents
  - Quick check question: What specific properties of RNNs make them suitable for capturing temporal dependencies needed for both homeostasis maintenance and environmental modeling?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Multi-modal observation layer -> RNN core -> Homeostasis evaluation -> Action selection -> Environment response -> New observation
- Critical path: Observation → RNN processing → Homeostasis evaluation → Action selection → Environment response → New observation
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Tradeoff between homeostatic stability and exploration drive
  - Balance between model complexity (RNN size) and computational efficiency
  - Tension between explicit novelty-seeking and emergent exploration through homeostasis
- Failure signatures:
  - Agent becomes trapped in local homeostatic minima
  - Oscillating behavior between exploration and exploitation
  - Failure to maintain homeostatic balance in novel environments
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test basic homeostatic RL agent in simple energy-gathering environment to verify core survival mechanisms
  2. Add RNN component and test in environment requiring temporal memory for successful homeostasis
  3. Combine meta-RL and homeostatic RL in complex environment to observe emergence of exploration and world modeling behaviors

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can the proposed "mortal agent" architecture truly generate world models and exploration behavior without explicit novelty-seeking rewards?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests that meta-RL combined with homeostatic RL could lead to emergence of world models and exploration, but acknowledges this is hypothetical
- Why unresolved: The authors propose this architecture but haven't empirically tested it yet. They only provide theoretical arguments and mappings between meta-RL and homeostatic RL components
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical demonstrations showing that RNN-based homeostatic RL agents can acquire implicit world models and exhibit model-based behavior comparable to dedicated world model approaches

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific architectural features are necessary for the emergence of meta-learning capabilities in homeostatic RL agents?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors suggest that including RNNs in homeostatic RL "may naturally lead to meta-learning ability" but don't specify the minimal requirements
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions RNNs as potentially important but doesn't explore what specific architectural properties (memory capacity, recurrence patterns, etc.) are necessary for the proposed emergence
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic ablation studies varying architectural components (RNN types, memory mechanisms, etc.) to identify which features are essential for meta-learning emergence

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed homeostatic framework handle conflicting homeostatic needs that arise simultaneously?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] While the paper discusses homeostasis as maintaining existence, it doesn't address how agents would prioritize between multiple competing physiological needs
- Why unresolved: The authors describe homeostasis as maintaining various internal states but don't explain the decision-making process when different homeostatic objectives conflict
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing how agents balance multiple homeostatic objectives, or theoretical framework for prioritizing between competing needs

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can the proposed approach scale to more complex environments beyond the simple scenarios typically used in homeostatic RL studies?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors reference successful homeostatic RL in simple domains but don't address scalability to complex, realistic environments
- Why unresolved: The paper discusses the theoretical framework but doesn't demonstrate or discuss the practical limitations and scaling challenges
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrations of the approach working in progressively more complex environments, or analysis of the computational and learning challenges at scale

## Limitations

- The proposed mechanisms remain theoretical without empirical validation or experimental results
- No mathematical formulation or proof provided for the emergence of world models from homeostatic agents
- Limited discussion of how the approach would handle conflicting homeostatic needs or scale to complex environments

## Confidence

- High confidence in the theoretical relevance of autopoiesis and homeostatic principles to autonomous agency
- Medium confidence in the proposed architectural framework combining RNNs with homeostatic RL
- Low confidence in the claim that this combination will necessarily produce emergent world models and intrinsic motivation without explicit novelty-seeking mechanisms

## Next Checks

1. Implement the proposed homeostatic RL agent with RNN architecture in a simple environment and measure whether temporal dependencies are effectively captured for maintaining homeostatic balance
2. Test the agent's ability to transfer knowledge across domains while maintaining homeostasis to assess potential meta-learning capabilities
3. Compare exploration patterns and goal-directed behavior between homeostatic agents and traditional novelty-seeking agents in the same environment to quantify the emergence of intrinsic motivation
