# Attacks against Abstractive Text Summarization Models through Lead Bias and Influence Functions

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2410.20019
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20019
- **Reference count:** 25
- **Primary result:** Adversarial attacks can degrade abstractive summarization models by exploiting lead bias and data poisoning

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates adversarial attacks on abstractive text summarization models, demonstrating that both lead bias exploitation and influence function-based data poisoning can significantly compromise model performance. The authors show that minor perturbations at various levels (character, word, sentence, document) can reduce lead sentence inclusion in summaries by up to 90%, while poisoning strategies can introduce toxic content or invert sentiment in generated summaries. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in summarization systems across multiple architectures including BART, T5, Pegasus, and chatbots.

## Method Summary
The paper presents two main attack strategies against abstractive summarization models. First, lead bias exploitation involves crafting adversarial perturbations that target the model's tendency to prioritize information from lead sentences, using techniques that range from character-level modifications to document-level restructuring. Second, the influence function-based poisoning approach identifies influential training samples and replaces their summaries with contrastive or toxic versions, thereby corrupting the model's learned representations. The attacks are evaluated across multiple models and datasets, measuring their impact on summary quality through metrics like lead sentence inclusion rates and sentiment analysis.

## Key Results
- Lead sentence inclusion rates reduced by up to 90% through adversarial perturbations
- Over 90% sentiment inversion achieved in summaries when 30-50% of training data was poisoned
- Models generated extractive rather than abstractive summaries under poisoning attacks
- Toxic content successfully injected into summaries through influence function-based poisoning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The attacks exploit fundamental architectural tendencies in summarization models. Lead bias exploitation works because most models inherently prioritize information from early sentences in documents, making them vulnerable to targeted perturbations that manipulate this preference. The influence function-based poisoning is effective because it leverages the mathematical properties of how training examples contribute to model parameters, allowing attackers to identify and corrupt the most influential samples. These approaches work synergistically because they target both the input processing (through perturbations) and the model's learned representations (through poisoning).

## Foundational Learning
- **Lead Bias:** The tendency of summarization models to prioritize information from early sentences. Why needed: Essential for understanding the primary vulnerability exploited in the first attack. Quick check: Verify whether the target document follows standard lead-first structure.
- **Influence Functions:** Mathematical tools for estimating how individual training samples affect model parameters. Why needed: Core mechanism for identifying which training examples to poison. Quick check: Confirm that influence scores correlate with actual parameter changes.
- **Adversarial Perturbations:** Carefully crafted modifications to input text that cause model misbehavior. Why needed: Primary technique for manipulating lead sentence inclusion. Quick check: Measure perturbation impact on model confidence scores.
- **Data Poisoning:** Technique of corrupting training data to compromise model behavior. Why needed: Foundation for the second attack vector. Quick check: Verify that poisoned summaries are properly integrated into training.
- **Abstractive vs Extractive Summarization:** Abstractive generates novel text while extractive copies from source. Why needed: Attack goal is to shift models from abstractive to extractive behavior. Quick check: Analyze n-gram overlap between source and generated summaries.
- **Sentiment Analysis Metrics:** Tools for measuring emotional tone in text. Why needed: Used to quantify attack success in sentiment inversion. Quick check: Validate sentiment classifier performance on poisoned data.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Input Text -> Lead Bias Detection -> Perturbation Application -> Model Prediction -> Summary Output

**Critical Path:** Training Data -> Influence Function Analysis -> Sample Selection -> Poisoning -> Retraining -> Model Deployment

**Design Tradeoffs:** The paper balances attack effectiveness against computational cost, with influence function analysis being computationally expensive but highly effective. Perturbation-based attacks are faster but may be more easily detected.

**Failure Signatures:** 
- Dramatic reduction in lead sentence inclusion
- Shift from abstractive to extractive summarization patterns
- Introduction of toxic or sentiment-inverted content
- Increased n-gram overlap with source documents

**First Experiments:**
1. Test lead sentence removal effectiveness across different document types
2. Measure influence function computation time for various dataset sizes
3. Validate toxic content injection on small-scale poisoning scenarios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Attack strategies may not generalize to documents with non-standard structures
- Poisoning requires access to significant portions (30-50%) of training data
- Evaluation focuses primarily on lead sentence inclusion and sentiment, potentially missing other quality aspects
- Does not address defensive measures or potential mitigations

## Confidence

**Lead bias exploitation effectiveness:** High - Results are consistent across multiple models and perturbation levels

**Influence function-based poisoning:** Medium - The approach is theoretically sound but relies on strong assumptions about training data access

**Toxic content injection via poisoning:** Medium - Demonstrated but may require extensive data manipulation that's difficult in practice

**Sentiment inversion through poisoning:** High - Clear quantitative evidence across multiple datasets

## Next Checks

1. Test attack transferability across different document domains (scientific, legal, news) to assess robustness of findings
2. Evaluate whether simple preprocessing defenses (sentence reordering, lead sentence emphasis) can mitigate identified vulnerabilities
3. Measure attack effectiveness when only partial training data access is available (e.g., 5-10% instead of 30-50%)
