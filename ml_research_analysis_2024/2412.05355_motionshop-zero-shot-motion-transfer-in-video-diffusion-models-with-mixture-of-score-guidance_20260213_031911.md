# MotionShop: Zero-Shot Motion Transfer in Video Diffusion Models with Mixture of Score Guidance

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.05355
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05355
- Reference count: 40
- State-of-the-art motion fidelity score: 0.913

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Mixture of Score Guidance (MSG), the first motion transfer approach for video diffusion transformers. MSG decomposes conditional scores into motion and content components, formulating motion transfer as a mixture of potential energies in the score space. The method operates directly on pre-trained models without additional training or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate MSG's effectiveness across single/multi-object transformations and complex camera motion transfer scenarios. The authors introduce MotionBench, a comprehensive motion transfer dataset with 200 source videos and 1,000 transferred sequences. MSG achieves state-of-the-art performance in motion fidelity (0.913) and temporal consistency (0.928) while maintaining competitive text similarity (0.314). User studies show significant improvements across all evaluation metrics.

## Method Summary
MotionShop achieves zero-shot motion transfer by reformulating conditional scores in video diffusion models to decompose motion and content components. The method operates in two phases: first extracting conditional score estimates from reference videos in early timesteps, then applying mixture of score guidance during generation. MSG extends standard Langevin dynamics through a mixture of potential energies formulation, naturally preserving scene composition while enabling creative transformations. The approach handles diverse motion transfer scenarios through motion trajectory representation and guidance mechanisms, operating directly on pre-trained video diffusion transformers without requiring additional training or fine-tuning.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art motion fidelity score of 0.913 on MotionBench dataset
- Demonstrates superior temporal consistency with score of 0.928
- Maintains competitive text similarity score of 0.314 while transferring motion

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: MotionShop achieves state-of-the-art motion fidelity by reformulating conditional scores to decompose motion and content components in diffusion models.
- Mechanism: The score decomposition separates the conditional score into motion score (∇z log pt(M(z*)|y)) and content score (∇z log pt(z|M(z*),y)). The motion score captures how latent affects motion characteristics, dominating early timesteps due to motion's hierarchical nature. The content score captures residual information conditioned on motion, becoming more prominent in later timesteps.
- Core assumption: Motion information is predominantly encoded in early diffusion timesteps, allowing effective isolation and transfer through score manipulation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Our key theoretical contribution lies in reformulating conditional score to decompose motion score and content score in diffusion models."
  - [section 4.1.1]: "The score function ∇z log pt(z|y) can be separated into motion and content components through our conditional reformulation ∇z log pt(z, M(z*)|y)"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence for score decomposition effectiveness
- Break condition: If motion information is not predominantly encoded in early timesteps, the decomposition approach would fail to effectively isolate motion patterns.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: MotionShop preserves scene composition while enabling creative transformations through mixture of potential energies formulation.
- Mechanism: The MSG formulation sMSG(zt, z*t) = ∇z log pt(z|y) + wMSG(∇z log pt(z*|y*) − ∇z log pt(z)) creates a mixture of potential energies UMSG(zt) = Ucontent(zt) + wMSG[Umotion(zt, z*t) − Uprior(zt)]. This extends standard Langevin dynamics to explore the correct motion manifold while preserving content.
- Core assumption: The relationship between score mixing and Langevin dynamics provides stable motion transfer without spurious artifacts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "By formulating motion transfer as a mixture of potential energies, MSG naturally preserves scene composition and enables creative scene transformations"
  - [section 4.1.2]: "Consider the standard Langevin equation: dzt = ∇zU(zt)dt + √2β−1dWt where U(zt) is the potential energy function... Our MSG formulation extends this to a mixture of potential energies"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence for stability claims
- Break condition: If the mixture of potential energies formulation does not maintain stable dynamics, spurious artifacts would appear in generated videos.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: MotionShop handles diverse motion transfer scenarios through motion trajectory representation and guidance mechanisms.
- Mechanism: Motion representation operator M(z) = ∇zt log pt(z|y) captures predominant motion patterns at early diffusion timesteps. The method operates in two phases: extracting conditional score estimates from reference video in early timesteps, then applying this guidance during generation at the same timestep range.
- Core assumption: Early timestep conditional scores effectively capture motion characteristics that can be transferred to new content.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5]: "we obtain conditional score estimates from the reference video in early timesteps (t ≪ T), then we apply this guidance during the generation of motion-transferred videos at the same timestep range"
  - [section 4.1.3]: "we establish that the motion representation operator M : Z → Z defined as M(z) = ∇zt log pt(z|y) captures predominant motion patterns at early diffusion timesteps t ≪ T"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence for trajectory representation effectiveness
- Break condition: If early timestep scores do not effectively capture motion patterns, the guidance mechanism would fail to produce realistic motion transfer.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Score-based generative modeling
  - Why needed here: MotionShop relies on understanding how diffusion models use score functions to generate samples and how conditional scores can be manipulated for controlled generation
  - Quick check question: How does the score function ∇ log p(z) guide the denoising process in diffusion models?

- Concept: Langevin dynamics
  - Why needed here: The theoretical foundation of MSG is based on extending Langevin dynamics through mixture of potential energies, requiring understanding of how these stochastic processes enable sampling from complex distributions
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between potential energy functions and the equilibrium distribution in Langevin dynamics?

- Concept: Conditional score decomposition
  - Why needed here: MotionShop's core innovation involves decomposing conditional scores into motion and content components, requiring understanding of how conditional distributions can be factorized
  - Quick check question: How can a conditional score function be separated into components that capture different aspects of the conditioning information?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Pre-trained video diffusion transformer (CogVideoX) -> Motion extraction module -> MSG guidance module -> Generated video
- Critical path: Reference video → Early timestep conditional score extraction → Motion representation M(z) = ∇zt log pt(z|y) → MSG formulation sMSG(zt, z*t) = ∇z log pt(z|y) + wMSG(∇z log pt(z*|y*) − ∇z log pt(z)) → Guided video generation
- Design tradeoffs: Zero-shot operation vs. fine-tuning trade-off (MSG avoids fine-tuning but may be limited by pretrained model's generative priors), early timestep focus vs. full generation coverage (concentrating on early timesteps may miss later-stage details), and guidance strength balancing (wMSG parameter requires careful tuning to avoid over-stylization).
- Failure signatures: MotionShop may produce unrealistic results when target concepts fall outside the pretrained model's distribution, may inherit biases present in the underlying T2V model, and may struggle with motion patterns that are not well-represented in early timesteps.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test motion extraction with varying strength parameters (0.6, 0.7, 0.8) on simple single-object transfers to find optimal balance
  2. Evaluate different guidance timestep ratios (5%, 10%, 25% of total timesteps) to determine effective motion transfer range
  3. Compare CFG, USG, and MSG guidance mechanisms on the same transfer task to validate the decomposition approach's superiority

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but based on the limitations and discussion, several important open questions emerge:

1. How does the performance of Mixture of Score Guidance (MSG) scale with video resolution beyond 720x480 pixels?
2. What is the computational complexity of MSG compared to other motion transfer methods, and how does it affect real-time applicability?
3. How does MSG handle long-term temporal dependencies in videos longer than 7 seconds?

## Limitations

- Weak corpus evidence supporting the theoretical foundations of score decomposition and mixture of potential energies
- Dependence on early diffusion timesteps for motion extraction may not capture all motion types
- Zero-shot approach inherits biases and limitations from pretrained video diffusion models

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims:**
- The mathematical formulation of MSG as a mixture of potential energies is internally consistent and follows established principles of score-based generative modeling
- The decomposition of conditional scores into motion and content components is theoretically sound and follows standard diffusion model frameworks
- The method successfully operates on pretrained models without requiring additional training or fine-tuning

**Medium Confidence Claims:**
- MSG achieves state-of-the-art performance in motion fidelity and temporal consistency (0.913 and 0.928 respectively)
- The method effectively handles diverse motion transfer scenarios including single/multi-object transformations and complex camera motion
- The two-phase approach (extraction and transfer) provides stable and controllable motion transfer

**Low Confidence Claims:**
- MSG's superiority over existing methods in all evaluated metrics
- The effectiveness of motion trajectory representation through early timestep conditional scores for all motion types
- The generalizability of results across different pretrained video diffusion models beyond CogVideoX

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Model Generalization Test**: Evaluate MSG on multiple pretrained video diffusion models (beyond CogVideoX) to verify the method's robustness and generalizability across different model architectures and training distributions.

2. **Timestep Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically test the effectiveness of motion extraction across different timestep ranges (not just early timesteps) to determine whether the assumption about early-timestep dominance holds for all motion patterns.

3. **Ablation on Score Decomposition**: Perform controlled experiments comparing MSG with variants that use full conditional scores without decomposition, or that use different methods for separating motion and content components, to isolate the contribution of the proposed decomposition approach.
