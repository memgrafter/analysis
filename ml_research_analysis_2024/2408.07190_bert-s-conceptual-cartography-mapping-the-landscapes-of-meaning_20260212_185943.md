# BERT's Conceptual Cartography: Mapping the Landscapes of Meaning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.07190
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07190
- Authors: Nina Haket; Ryan Daniels
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: BERT embeddings + GMM clustering reveals significant contextual variation in word usage patterns

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to conceptual engineering by constructing conceptual landscapes using BERT contextual embeddings and Gaussian Mixture Models. The authors analyze 24 target words from the spoken British National Corpus, clustering their contextual embeddings to visualize how meaning varies across contexts. Four metrics (maximum explained variance, self-similarity, intra-group similarity, and inter-group similarity) provide quantitative insights into word usage patterns, revealing that different words exhibit vastly different landscape complexities. The results demonstrate that effective conceptual engineering requires understanding the full range of contextual nuances rather than assuming uniform word usage.

## Method Summary
The methodology combines BERT contextual embeddings with Gaussian Mixture Models to analyze word usage patterns. The authors extract target words from the spoken British National Corpus, generate contextual embeddings using BERT, apply PCA for dimensionality reduction, and cluster the embeddings using GMMs. Four metrics quantify landscape characteristics, while qualitative analysis examines specific cluster interpretations. The approach reveals that words like DUTY, PLANET, and MARRIAGE each have unique contextual patterns, demonstrating the complexity of conceptual engineering and the need for tailored approaches.

## Key Results
- Words exhibit significant variation in contextual clustering patterns, with some words showing uniform usage while others display distinct contextual clusters
- Maximum Explained Variance (MEV) ranges from 0.2 to 0.5 across different words, indicating varying degrees of contextual uniformity
- The approach reveals nuanced contextual distinctions, such as MARRIAGE clustering differently for same-sex marriage versus other uses, possibly reflecting social changes
- Quantitative metrics combined with qualitative analysis provide complementary insights into word usage patterns

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Contextual embeddings capture speaker meaning better than static embeddings
- Mechanism: BERT generates unique embeddings for each token based on its context, approximating speaker meaning, while static embeddings like word2vec learn a global representation that abstracts away contextual nuances
- Core assumption: The contextual variation in word usage is significant enough to require context-specific representations
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "BERT generates contextual embeddings. In contrast, static embeddings...learn a global representation of a word...BERT generates unique embeddings for each token based on its context, giving an approximation of speaker meaning"
  - [section] "Words with similar meanings tend to appear in similar contexts and share similar distributions across various linguistic environments, and therefore share similar contextual embeddings. Contextual embeddings using BERT are therefore a good fit for quantifying speaker meaning"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Gaussian Mixture Models can identify distinct contextual clusters for word usage
- Mechanism: GMMs perform unsupervised soft clustering on reduced-dimensional embeddings to identify distinct contextual patterns, with cluster quality measured by Silhouette scores and ARI
- Core assumption: Word usage contexts form distinct, separable clusters rather than continuous distributions
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We use these embeddings to examine how words are clustered by context using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and compare a range of metrics"
  - [section] "A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is a method of modelling multimodal data using a combination of K unimodal distributions. We use a GMM to perform unsupervised soft clustering on the embedding matrix after dimensionality reduction with principal component analysis (PCA)"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multiple quantitative metrics provide complementary insights into word usage patterns
- Mechanism: MEV measures consistency of usage (uniformity vs variation), self-similarity measures internal diversity, intra-group similarity measures coherence within clusters, and inter-group similarity measures distinction between clusters
- Core assumption: Different aspects of word usage variation require different measurement approaches
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We use four main metrics to describe the landscapes: maximum explained variance (MEV), self-similarity, intra-group similarity, and inter-group similarity"
  - [section] Detailed definitions of each metric and their specific relevance to conceptual engineering

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contextual embeddings vs static embeddings
  - Why needed here: The paper's core methodology relies on understanding how BERT's contextual embeddings differ from traditional static embeddings in capturing word meaning
  - Quick check question: What is the fundamental difference between how BERT and word2vec represent word meaning?

- Concept: Gaussian Mixture Models and clustering
  - Why needed here: The paper uses GMMs to identify distinct contextual clusters for word usage, requiring understanding of clustering algorithms and evaluation metrics
  - Quick check question: How does a GMM differ from k-means clustering, and why might it be more appropriate for this application?

- Concept: Dimensionality reduction and PCA
  - Why needed here: The paper reduces high-dimensional embeddings to 2D for visualization and clustering, requiring understanding of PCA and its limitations
  - Quick check question: What are the trade-offs between using PCA versus nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE for this application?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: British National Corpus -> BERT embeddings -> PCA -> GMM clustering -> Visualization -> Metrics -> Analysis
- Critical path: Corpus → BERT embeddings → PCA → GMM clustering → Visualization → Metrics → Analysis
- Design tradeoffs:
  - BERT model choice: bert-large-uncased vs more recent models (efficiency vs performance)
  - Context window size: Balancing local context capture vs computational efficiency
  - Dimensionality reduction: PCA vs nonlinear methods for preserving cluster structure
  - Clustering algorithm: GMM vs alternatives (soft vs hard clustering, model assumptions)
- Failure signatures:
  - Low Silhouette scores across all words: Context windows too small or BERT embeddings not capturing meaningful variation
  - High MEV scores: Words have uniform usage patterns, reducing need for contextual analysis
  - Poor cluster separation: Contextual boundaries are fuzzy or overlapping
  - High computational cost: Context window size or embedding dimensions too large
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Vary context window size (C=4, 20, 40) and observe Silhouette score changes to find optimal balance
  2. Compare PCA vs t-SNE for dimensionality reduction and observe impact on clustering quality
  3. Test different BERT model sizes (base vs large) and measure impact on MEV and clustering metrics

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do contextual embeddings of the same word differ when comparing spoken versus written language corpora?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors use the Spoken British National Corpus and compare their results to previous work using written corpora, noting that spoken language is underrepresented in CE research.
- Why unresolved: The paper only analyzes spoken language data. Direct comparisons between spoken and written embeddings for the same words would reveal how medium affects conceptual landscapes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Running the same BERT-based GMM analysis on a matched written corpus (e.g., written BNC) and comparing metrics like ARI, self-similarity, and cluster stability between the two.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal context window size for capturing speaker meaning versus semantic meaning in BERT embeddings?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors test context windows of different sizes and find optimal performance around C=40 tokens, but note that single utterances (~10 tokens) may be insufficient.
- Why unresolved: The paper optimizes for clustering quality but doesn't explicitly test whether larger windows capture more speaker meaning versus semantic meaning, or whether there's a trade-off.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic testing of context window sizes with qualitative analysis of whether clusters represent speaker-meaning variations (contextual modulation) versus semantic distinctions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do conceptual landscapes change over time for words undergoing active conceptual engineering?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors note that MARRIAGE contexts show distinct clusters for same-sex marriage versus other uses, possibly reflecting the 2013 UK legalization, but cannot track changes without longitudinal data.
- Why unresolved: The paper uses a single time-bound corpus. Tracking how word landscapes evolve as conceptual engineering efforts succeed or fail would validate the methodology for CE projects.
- What evidence would resolve it: Repeated analysis of the same words across multiple time-sliced corpora (e.g., BNC from different decades) to track landscape evolution and correlate with documented CE efforts.

## Limitations
- Limited to spoken language data from British National Corpus, potentially missing contextual patterns present in written or formal texts
- Computational efficiency claims for larger context windows need empirical validation across different hardware configurations
- PCA component selection methodology is mentioned but not fully specified, affecting reproducibility
- Metric interpretation requires domain expertise and lacks established universal thresholds for "significant" variation

## Confidence

**High confidence** in the claim that contextual embeddings capture more nuanced meaning than static embeddings, as this is well-established in the NLP literature and the mechanism is clearly explained.

**Medium confidence** in the claim that GMMs successfully identify distinct contextual clusters, as the method is appropriate but the evaluation relies on metrics that could be sensitive to parameter choices.

**Medium confidence** in the claim that the four metrics provide meaningful insights into word usage patterns, as the metrics are well-defined but their interpretation requires domain expertise and the paper doesn't establish universal thresholds.

**Low confidence** in the generalizability of specific findings (like DUTY having 5 clusters) to other words or corpora, as this appears to be highly word-specific and corpus-dependent.

## Next Checks

**Validation Check 1**: Replicate the study using the written component of the British National Corpus to assess whether the observed contextual variation patterns hold across different text types. This would test the generalizability of the findings and reveal whether conversational speech exhibits unique patterns.

**Validation Check 2**: Conduct a systematic ablation study varying the context window size (C=4, 10, 20, 40, 60) and BERT model size (base, large, distilled) to quantify their impact on Silhouette scores, MEV values, and clustering quality. This would validate the computational efficiency claims and identify optimal configurations.

**Validation Check 3**: Apply the methodology to a controlled test set where ground truth context clusters are known (e.g., polysemous words with documented senses) to validate whether the metrics correctly identify meaningful contextual distinctions. This would establish whether the approach can reliably distinguish genuine contextual variation from noise.
