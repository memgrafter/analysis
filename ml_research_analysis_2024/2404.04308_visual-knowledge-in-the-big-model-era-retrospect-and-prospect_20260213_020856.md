core_contribution: Visual knowledge is a new form of knowledge representation that
  can encapsulate visual concepts and their relations in a succinct, comprehensive,
  and interpretable manner, with a deep root in cognitive psychology. As the knowledge
  about the visual world has been identified as an indispensable component of human
  cognition and intelligence, visual knowledge is poised to have a pivotal role in
  establishing machine intelligence.

# Visual Knowledge in the Big Model Era: Retrospect and Prospect

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.04308
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04308
- Reference count: 9
- Visual knowledge represents a structured, interpretable form of knowledge about visual concepts that can enhance large AI models' reasoning and transparency

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive review of visual knowledge development in the pre-big model era and explores its opportunities in the context of large AI models. Visual knowledge, rooted in cognitive psychology, provides explicit representations of visual concepts, relations, operations, and reasoning that can address limitations of current large models such as lack of interpretability and reasoning capabilities. The authors systematically categorize visual knowledge research along four dimensions and propose that integrating visual knowledge with large models could create more transparent, reasoning-capable AI systems.

## Method Summary
The paper employs a literature review methodology to systematically categorize visual knowledge research across computer vision, cognitive psychology, and AI domains. The authors analyze research contributions based on four key components: visual concept, visual relation, visual operation, and visual reasoning. The review synthesizes findings to identify gaps and opportunities for visual knowledge development in the big model era, focusing on integration with foundation models and addressing limitations of current approaches. The methodology involves systematic literature search, categorization of research contributions, and synthesis of findings to propose future research directions.

## Key Results
- Visual knowledge provides explicit, structured representations of visual concepts through prototype-and-scope approaches that enhance model interpretability
- Large AI models face limitations including lack of transparency, reasoning capabilities, and catastrophic forgetting that visual knowledge can address
- Integration of visual knowledge with large models offers opportunities for improved reasoning, transparency, and persistent knowledge representation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1: Prototype-and-Scope Interpretability
Visual knowledge enhances interpretability by providing explicit prototype-and-scope representations where prototypes capture typical attributes of visual concepts while scopes define acceptable variation boundaries. This explicit representation allows tracing model decisions back to specific visual prototypes rather than opaque parameter interactions. The core assumption is that prototype-and-scope based representations can be effectively integrated into large model architectures without destroying their pattern recognition capabilities. Evidence shows that Deep Nearest Centroids yields a powerful yet interpretable framework through representing visual concepts as collections of automatically discovered prototypes. Break condition occurs if prototype representations become too sparse or lose semantic meaning when scaled to billions of visual concepts.

### Mechanism 2: Catastrophic Forgetting Resistance
Visual knowledge addresses catastrophic forgetting by providing persistent, structured representations of visual concepts stored outside neural network parameters. When new tasks arrive, models can update knowledge through these external representations rather than overwriting internal weights. The core assumption is that visual knowledge can be maintained and updated independently of neural network parameters without losing the benefits of learned representations. Evidence indicates that visual knowledge offers explicit, structured, persistent, editable, and traceable knowledge representation. Break condition occurs if the overhead of maintaining external visual knowledge representations becomes prohibitive for real-time applications.

### Mechanism 3: Enhanced Reasoning Capabilities
Visual knowledge improves reasoning capabilities by providing explicit operations and causal relations that complement statistical pattern matching. Visual knowledge includes explicit definitions of operations (composition, decomposition, prediction) and causal relations that can be applied systematically to visual concepts, providing a framework for logical inference beyond pattern correlation. The core assumption is that explicit operational and causal knowledge can be effectively combined with implicit pattern knowledge from large models to produce human-like reasoning. Evidence shows that visual knowledge provides an explicit, powerful, and unified framework for comprehensive modeling of visual conceptions, relations, operations, and reasoning. Break condition occurs if complexity of integrating explicit reasoning operations with implicit statistical knowledge creates inconsistencies that degrade overall performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Prototype-and-scope based categorization
  - Why needed here: Forms the foundation of visual concept representation, enabling interpretable and structured knowledge about visual entities
  - Quick check question: How would you represent the concept of "apple" using prototype-and-scope approach, and what would define its scope boundaries?

- Concept: Neuro-symbolic integration
  - Why needed here: Combines the pattern recognition strength of neural networks with the logical reasoning capabilities of symbolic systems
  - Quick check question: What are the key challenges in integrating neural representations with symbolic reasoning operations?

- Concept: Causal reasoning in visual domains
  - Why needed here: Enables understanding of cause-effect relationships rather than just correlations, critical for true visual reasoning
  - Quick check question: How would you distinguish between correlation and causation in a visual scene involving a person cutting an apple?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Visual knowledge layer (prototype storage, relation graph, operation definitions) → Integration module (neuro-symbolic bridge) → Large model backbone → Output interface
- Critical path: Visual concept recognition → Prototype matching → Relation inference → Operation application → Reasoning output
- Design tradeoffs: Explicit knowledge vs. parameter efficiency, interpretability vs. performance, static knowledge vs. dynamic learning
- Failure signatures: Prototype ambiguity causing misclassification, relation graph inconsistencies causing reasoning errors, operation conflicts causing contradictory outputs
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement prototype-based visual concept recognition on CIFAR-10 and compare interpretability metrics with standard CNN
  2. Add simple causal relation inference to a VQA model and measure performance on visual reasoning tasks
  3. Test catastrophic forgetting resistance by training on sequence of visual tasks with and without visual knowledge persistence

## Limitations
- The scalability of prototype-and-scope representations when dealing with the vast visual concept space encountered by large models remains unclear
- Computational overhead and efficiency implications of maintaining explicit visual knowledge alongside learned parameters are not quantified
- Potential conflicts between implicit knowledge captured in model parameters and explicit visual knowledge representations have not been thoroughly explored

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Historical overview of visual knowledge development and cognitive psychology foundations are well-established and thoroughly documented
- **Medium confidence**: Proposed integration mechanisms between visual knowledge and large models are theoretically sound but remain largely untested in practice
- **Low confidence**: Specific implementation details and architectural designs for incorporating visual knowledge into existing large models are not fully specified

## Next Checks
1. Implement a proof-of-concept prototype-and-scope based visual knowledge system integrated with a pre-trained vision transformer and measure performance trade-offs on standard benchmarks
2. Conduct systematic experiments comparing catastrophic forgetting rates between models with and without visual knowledge persistence across sequential visual learning tasks
3. Design controlled studies to evaluate the reasoning performance improvements when combining explicit visual knowledge operations with implicit pattern recognition in visual question answering tasks
