# Toward Structure Fairness in Dynamic Graph Embedding: A Trend-aware Dual Debiasing Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.13201
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13201
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: FairDGE achieves up to 36.46% better performance and 65.32% better fairness scores compared to baselines

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the problem of structure fairness in dynamic graph embedding, where existing methods fail to account for bias introduced by evolving vertex degrees. The authors propose FairDGE, a novel algorithm that learns biased structural evolutions by jointly embedding connection changes and degree trends. FairDGE employs a dual debiasing approach using contrastive learning and fairness loss to improve fairness without sacrificing effectiveness, achieving significant performance and fairness improvements on real-world datasets.

## Method Summary
FairDGE is a dynamic graph embedding algorithm designed to achieve structure fairness by learning trend-aware structural evolutions and applying a dual debiasing approach. The method consists of a trend-aware structural evolution learning module that jointly embeds connection changes and degree trends using a GNN backbone and a trend encoder (GRU + 1D CNN). An intermedia classification task identifies biased structural evolutions (FaT, T2H, SfH). The dual debiasing module then uses contrastive learning to improve FaT vertex performance and a fairness loss to minimize effectiveness disparity between T2H and SfH vertices, encoding fair embeddings without sacrificing effectiveness.

## Key Results
- FairDGE achieves up to 36.46% better performance (HR@20, NDCG@20, PREC@20) compared to baseline methods
- Fairness improvements of up to 65.32% (rHR, rND) over state-of-the-art baselines
- Significant reduction in performance disparity between vertex groups (FaT, T2H, SfH) while maintaining or improving overall effectiveness

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** FairDGE's dual debiasing approach successfully improves fairness without sacrificing effectiveness by combining contrastive learning and fairness loss.
- **Mechanism:** Contrastive learning improves FaT vertex performance by bringing similar structural evolution embeddings closer, narrowing the performance gap with T2H and SfH vertices. The fairness loss then minimizes effectiveness disparity between T2H and SfH vertices, further boosting fairness without significantly impacting their performance.
- **Core assumption:** Contrastive learning improves FaT vertex performance without harming T2H and SfH vertices, and minimizing T2H/SfH disparity boosts fairness without significant performance degradation.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "a novel dual debiasing approach is devised to encode fair embeddings contrastively, customizing debiasing strategies for different biased structural evolutions."
  - [section]: "Thanks to contrastive learning, the embedding performance of FaT vertices will improve, resulting in a smaller performance disparity with T2H and SfH vertices."
- **Break condition:** If contrastive learning does not improve FaT vertex performance or if fairness loss significantly degrades T2H/SfH performance.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Learning trend-aware structural evolutions enables FairDGE to capture dynamic changes in vertex degrees and connections, crucial for achieving fairness.
- **Mechanism:** FairDGE uses a long-short-term degree trend encoder to learn comprehensive vertex degree patterns (long-term trends and short-term fluctuations). It jointly embeds connection changes and degree trends to accurately identify and represent biased structural evolutions (FaT, T2H, SfH).
- **Core assumption:** Evolving vertex degree trends accurately reflect structural evolution, and joint embedding captures these biased structural evolutions.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "FairDGE learns biased structural evolutions by jointly embedding the connection changes among vertices and the long-short-term evolutionary trend of vertex degrees."
  - [section]: "To learn biased structural evolution over time, FairDGE jointly embeds the connection changes among vertices and the long-short-term evolutionary trend of vertex degrees."
- **Break condition:** If degree trends do not accurately reflect structural evolution or joint embedding fails to capture biased structural evolutions.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** FairDGE's fairness loss effectively narrows the performance gap between T2H and SfH vertices, improving fairness without sacrificing their performance.
- **Mechanism:** The fairness loss minimizes effectiveness disparity of T2H and SfH vertex embeddings in downstream tasks, imposing statistical parity. This pushes T2H vertices to get more exposure in recommendations, especially in high rankings, boosting fairness without significantly impacting their high performance.
- **Core assumption:** Minimizing T2H/SfH effectiveness disparity improves fairness without significant performance degradation, and focusing on high-performance vertices is more effective than focusing on FaT vertices.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "We minimize the effectiveness disparity of T2H and SfH vertex groups, which are in the head of the power-law distribution and with high performance, to boost fairness further."
  - [section]: "We minimize the effectiveness disparity of T2H and SfH vertices' embeddings in downstream tasks to boost fairness further and simultaneously avoid dragging their embedding effectiveness down by FaT vertices."
- **Break condition:** If minimizing T2H/SfH disparity significantly degrades their performance or focusing on high-performance vertices does not effectively improve fairness.

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  Trend-aware structural evolution learning module (Long-short-term degree trend encoder, structural evolution embedding (GNN + GRU), bias classification task) -> Dual debiasing module (Contrastive learning, fairness loss) -> Downstream task (Link prediction)

- **Critical path:**
  1. Learn trend-aware structural evolutions by jointly embedding connection changes and degree trends.
  2. Encode fair embeddings using the dual debiasing approach (contrastive learning + fairness loss).
  3. Evaluate the effectiveness of fair embeddings in downstream tasks (link prediction).

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Complexity vs. effectiveness: FairDGE's trend-aware structural evolution learning and dual debiasing approach add complexity but are necessary for achieving fairness without sacrificing effectiveness.
  - Performance vs. fairness: FairDGE aims to improve both performance and fairness, but there might be a trade-off between these objectives. Design choices like loss hyperparameters and number of snapshots can impact this trade-off.

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Poor performance in downstream tasks: If FairDGE fails to capture structural evolutions or if dual debiasing does not effectively improve fairness, learned embeddings might not perform well.
  - Lack of fairness improvement: If contrastive learning or fairness loss does not effectively narrow performance gaps between vertex groups, FairDGE might not achieve desired fairness improvement.

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Ablation study: Remove fairness loss and evaluate performance and fairness to understand its contribution.
  2. Hyperparameter study: Vary number of snapshots, model dimensions, head/tail ratio percentages, and time-sliding windows to identify optimal hyperparameters and understand their impact.
  3. Comparison with degree fairness: Train FairDGE and other methods with degree fairness and compare performance and fairness to demonstrate superiority of trend-aware fairness.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does FairDGE perform on dynamic graphs with more complex structural evolution patterns beyond FaT, T2H, and SfH?
- What is the impact of different time window sizes on the performance and fairness of FairDGE?
- How does FairDGE compare to other fairness-aware dynamic graph embedding methods that do not explicitly model structural evolution?

## Limitations
- The paper focuses on a specific type of bias (evolving vertex degrees) and it is unclear how well the approach generalizes to other types of biases or different graph structures.
- The experimental evaluation is conducted on a limited number of real-world datasets; further validation on a wider range of datasets and graph types would strengthen the claims.

## Confidence
- **High:** The core mechanism of FairDGE, which jointly learns trend-aware structural evolutions and applies dual debiasing using contrastive learning and fairness loss, is well-motivated and supported by experimental results.
- **Medium:** The specific design choices and hyperparameters used in FairDGE are not fully detailed, which may impact the reproducibility and generalizability of the results.
- **Low:** The long-term effectiveness and fairness of FairDGE in real-world dynamic graph applications are not extensively studied.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a thorough ablation study to isolate the contributions of the trend-aware structural evolution learning, contrastive learning, and fairness loss components to the overall performance and fairness improvements.
2. Evaluate FairDGE on a diverse set of real-world dynamic graph datasets, including those with different graph structures, sizes, and types of biases, to assess its generalizability.
3. Perform a longitudinal study to assess the long-term effectiveness and fairness of FairDGE in dynamic graph applications, considering factors such as graph evolution, concept drift, and scalability.
