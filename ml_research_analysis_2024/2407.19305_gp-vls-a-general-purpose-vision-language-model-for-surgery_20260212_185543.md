# GP-VLS: A general-purpose vision language model for surgery

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.19305
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19305
- Reference count: 40
- GP-VLS significantly outperforms existing models on surgical vision-language tasks with 8-21% improvements in accuracy across SurgiQual benchmarks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces GP-VLS, a general-purpose vision language model for surgery that integrates medical knowledge with visual scene understanding. The authors propose SurgiQual, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark that assesses VLMs across medical knowledge, surgical knowledge, and surgical vision-language tasks. GP-VLS demonstrates strong performance on both medical and surgical knowledge tests compared to open-source alternatives, providing an open-source foundation for developing AI assistants to support surgeons across various tasks and scenarios.

## Method Summary
GP-VLS uses Llama2-7B-chat as the LLM backbone with CLIP ViT-L/14 visual encoder. The model is trained through instruction tuning on six new datasets: medical knowledge datasets (MedMCQA, MedQA, Medical Flashcards, MedInstruct-52k), surgical knowledge datasets (SurgTB-QA, MedMCQA-Surgery), and five surgical vision-language datasets covering phase recognition, tool identification, action recognition, and triplet recognition. The architecture employs a linear projection layer to map visual features into the language embedding space, enabling the model to handle both language-only and vision-language tasks.

## Key Results
- GP-VLS achieves 8-21% improvements in accuracy across SurgiQual benchmarks compared to existing models
- The model demonstrates strong performance on medical exam questions, outperforming open-source alternatives
- GP-VLS successfully handles surgical vision-language tasks including phase recognition, tool identification, and action recognition

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The model integrates visual and language modalities through a CLIP visual encoder that extracts image features and a Llama2-7B LLM backbone that processes text. A linear projection layer maps visual features into the language embedding space, allowing the model to handle both language-only and vision-language tasks by concatenating visual tokens with instruction text. This architecture enables effective fusion of surgical scene understanding with language reasoning.

### Mechanism 2
GP-VLS achieves superior performance through comprehensive training across six diverse datasets spanning medical knowledge, surgical textbooks, and surgical vision-language tasks. The model is trained on medical exam questions, surgical textbook QA, and five surgical vision-language datasets covering phase recognition, tool identification, action recognition, and triplet recognition. This diverse training enables the model to handle both knowledge-based questions and visual scene understanding.

### Mechanism 3
Unlike previous surgical VLMs that output classification labels for specific tasks, GP-VLS generates natural language responses to questions about surgical scenes, medical knowledge, and surgical procedures. This text generation capability allows for more nuanced and context-aware interactions with surgeons, enabling more flexible and natural communication compared to task-specific classification outputs.

## Foundational Learning

- **Vision-language model architecture and training**: Understanding how visual and language modalities are integrated is crucial for grasping GP-VLS's design and potential limitations. *Quick check*: How does the linear projection layer connect CLIP visual features to the LLM embedding space?

- **Surgical workflow and terminology**: GP-VLS operates in surgical contexts, so understanding phases, tools, actions, and triplets is essential for interpreting its capabilities. *Quick check*: What is a surgical action triplet and why is it important for describing surgical scenes?

- **Medical knowledge assessment benchmarks**: GP-VLS is evaluated on medical exams like USMLE, so understanding what these benchmarks test helps assess the model's medical competence. *Quick check*: What types of questions are typically included in the USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 exams?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: CLIP ViT-L/14 visual encoder (g(·)) → Linear projection layer → LLM (Llama2-7B-chat) → Text generation
- **Critical path**: 1) Image feature extraction using CLIP, 2) Projection of visual features into language embedding space, 3) Concatenation with text instructions, 4) LLM processing and text generation
- **Design tradeoffs**: Using CLIP vs. training a custom visual encoder (CLIP provides strong general visual features but may lack surgical specificity); 7B parameter LLM vs. larger models (balances performance with computational efficiency); Text generation vs. classification (more flexible but potentially less precise)
- **Failure signatures**: Visual understanding failures (incorrect tool identification or phase recognition), knowledge failures (incorrect medical or surgical facts), generation failures (unnatural or irrelevant text responses)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Test basic visual understanding by providing surgical images and asking "What surgical tools are present?", 2) Test medical knowledge by asking USMLE-style questions, 3) Test multimodal reasoning by providing an image with a complex question about surgical scene understanding

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. **Optimal balance between video and image data**: The paper mentions that future VLMs would benefit from training on surgical videos to capture temporal dynamics, but doesn't provide empirical comparisons between video-based and image-based training approaches.

2. **Adaptation to diverse surgical specialties**: The current model is trained on datasets emphasizing general surgery and cardiothoracic surgery, with no evaluation on other specialties like urology, neurosurgery, or orthopedic surgery.

3. **Practical deployment challenges**: The discussion mentions GPU memory requirements and slower inference time as challenges for clinical integration, but doesn't provide specific metrics on computational requirements or real-time performance benchmarks.

## Limitations

- The evaluation framework is limited to benchmark datasets and doesn't test the model in actual surgical environments or with live surgical teams
- The paper doesn't address potential safety concerns or error handling in critical surgical contexts
- Training datasets may contain biases toward certain surgical specialties or demographic groups that aren't acknowledged

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The architectural design using CLIP + Llama2-7B with projection layer is well-established and technically sound
- **Medium Confidence**: The performance improvements on SurgiQual benchmarks are likely real but may be partly attributed to task-specific fine-tuning rather than general surgical understanding
- **Low Confidence**: The model's ability to generalize to real-world surgical scenarios not represented in the training datasets

## Next Checks

1. Deploy GP-VLS in a simulated surgical environment with actual surgeons to evaluate practical usability and identify failure modes not captured in benchmark testing

2. Test the model on surgical procedures from specialties not represented in the training data (e.g., neurosurgery, orthopedic surgery) to assess true generalization capability

3. Conduct systematic evaluation of the model's failure modes, particularly focusing on scenarios where incorrect responses could have serious consequences in surgical contexts
