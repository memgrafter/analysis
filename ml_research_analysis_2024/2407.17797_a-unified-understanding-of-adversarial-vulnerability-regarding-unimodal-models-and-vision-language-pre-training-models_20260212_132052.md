# A Unified Understanding of Adversarial Vulnerability Regarding Unimodal Models and Vision-Language Pre-training Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.17797
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17797
- Authors: Haonan Zheng; Xinyang Deng; Wen Jiang; Wenrui Li
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: FGA-T achieves superior white-box attack performance and improved black-box transferability across multiple VLP models, datasets, and tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces FGA (Feature Guidance Attack), a novel adversarial attack method for vision-language pre-training (VLP) models that leverages text embeddings as guidance for generating adversarial images. The approach pushes image features away from correct text descriptions and toward incorrect ones, inducing VLP models to misinterpret images. By incorporating text attacks and orthogonal enhancement mechanisms like data augmentation and momentum, FGA-T achieves superior white-box attack performance and improved black-box transferability across multiple VLP models, datasets, and tasks. The method provides a unified baseline for exploring VLP model robustness, bridging the gap between unimodal and multimodal adversarial robustness research.

## Method Summary
FGA is an adversarial attack method that uses text embeddings as guidance to direct perturbations of clean images, causing VLP models to misinterpret them. The method computes gradients of a feature guidance loss that encourages image embeddings to move away from correct text representations toward incorrect ones. FGA-T extends this by introducing cross-modal interaction through adversarial text, enhancing both white-box attack strength and black-box transferability. The approach is orthogonal to many advanced attack strategies in the unimodal domain, allowing direct application of rich unimodal research findings to multimodal scenarios.

## Key Results
- On VE task, FGA-T reduces accuracy from 79.91% to 2.78%, outperforming previous methods
- Achieves superior white-box attack performance across multiple VLP models (CLIP, ALBEF, TCL, BEiT3)
- Demonstrates improved black-box transferability across various datasets and tasks including VQA, VG, VR, ZC, and ITR

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: FGA uses text embeddings as guidance to direct image perturbations toward incorrect text descriptions, causing VLP models to misinterpret images.
- Mechanism: The method computes gradients of a feature guidance loss that encourages the image embedding to move away from correct text representations and toward incorrect ones, leveraging the unified embedding space of VLP models.
- Core assumption: VLP models learn image representations directly from raw text, making text embeddings effective guidance for adversarial perturbations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "uses text representations to direct the perturbation of clean images, resulting in the generation of adversarial images"
  - [section]: "we developed the Feature Guidance Attack (FGA), a novel method that uses text representations to direct the perturbation of clean images"
  - [corpus]: Weak - related papers focus on multimodal attacks but don't explicitly validate this specific text-guided mechanism
- Break condition: If VLP models shift to using separate embedding spaces for modalities or if text embeddings become poor proxies for semantic content.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: FGA-T achieves superior attack effects by introducing cross-modal interaction through adversarial text, enhancing both white-box attack strength and black-box transferability.
- Mechanism: FGA-T first generates adversarial text examples using BertAttack, then uses these texts as guidance for image perturbations, creating a synergistic attack that exploits both modalities simultaneously.
- Core assumption: Attacking both modalities simultaneously is more effective than unimodal attacks alone for VLP models.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "By appropriately introducing text attack into FGA, we construct Feature Guidance with Text Attack (FGA-T). Through the interaction of attacking two modalities, FGA-T achieves superior attack effects"
  - [section]: "attacking both modalities simultaneously is a more effective strategy [54, 33]"
  - [corpus]: Moderate - related works like Co-Attack and SGA mention multimodal attacks but don't validate this specific FGA-T formulation
- Break condition: If VLP models develop robust cross-modal defenses or if adversarial text generation becomes ineffective.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: FGA-T's orthogonality with unimodal attack enhancement mechanisms allows direct application of rich unimodal research findings to multimodal scenarios.
- Mechanism: FGA can be combined with data augmentation, momentum, and other unimodal attack strategies without interference, creating a unified framework for exploring VLP robustness.
- Core assumption: The feature guidance formulation is mathematically independent of specific attack optimization techniques.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "FGA is orthogonal to many advanced attack strategies in the unimodal domain, facilitating the direct application of rich research findings from the unimodal to the multimodal scenario"
  - [section]: "FGA and BertAttack are completely orthogonal strategies"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no explicit validation of orthogonality with specific unimodal mechanisms in related work
- Break condition: If certain unimodal strategies introduce modality-specific constraints that conflict with feature guidance principles.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models and their unified embedding spaces
  - Why needed here: Understanding how VLP models align and fuse image and text embeddings is crucial for grasping why text can guide image perturbations
  - Quick check question: How do aligned models like CLIP differ from fused models like ALBEF in their approach to multimodal representation learning?

- Concept: Adversarial attack formulations (feature deviation vs. feature guidance)
  - Why needed here: Distinguishing between pushing embeddings away from correct representations versus guiding them toward incorrect ones is key to understanding FGA's innovation
  - Quick check question: What is the mathematical difference between the loss functions used in feature deviation attacks versus feature guidance attacks?

- Concept: Transferability in black-box adversarial attacks
  - Why needed here: Understanding why and how adversarial examples transfer between models is essential for appreciating the significance of FGA-T's improved transferability
  - Quick check question: What factors influence the transferability of adversarial examples between different VLP models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Image encoder (𝐸𝑣) -> Text encoder (𝐸𝑡) -> Multimodal encoder (𝐸𝑚) -> Projector (𝑃) -> Classification head (ℎ)
- Critical path: Clean image -> image encoder -> feature guidance loss -> gradient computation -> adversarial perturbation -> adversarial image
- Design tradeoffs: Global vs. patch perturbations (detectability vs. attack strength), ℓ∞ vs. ℓ1 constraints (imperceptibility vs. sparsity), white-box vs. black-box settings (attack power vs. practical applicability)
- Failure signatures: Low attack success rates indicate either poor text guidance quality, ineffective gradient computation, or robust VLP model defenses
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement FGA on a simple aligned model (CLIP) for zero-shot classification to validate basic feature guidance mechanism
  2. Add text attack component to create FGA-T and test on a fused model (ALBEF) for image-text retrieval
  3. Introduce data augmentation and momentum to FGA-T and measure black-box transferability across different VLP models

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The core innovation relies on VLP models maintaining unified embedding spaces, but doesn't address what happens when models use modality-specific encoders
- Orthogonality claims with unimodal attack mechanisms are asserted but not empirically validated against specific strategies
- The relationship between choice of adversarial text examples and attack effectiveness is not thoroughly explored

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The FGA framework's general approach of using text guidance for adversarial image generation is technically sound and demonstrates measurable improvements over baseline attacks in white-box settings
- **Medium confidence**: The improved black-box transferability of FGA-T is demonstrated across multiple datasets and tasks, though the specific contribution of each orthogonal mechanism is not clearly isolated
- **Low confidence**: The claim that attacking both modalities simultaneously is inherently more effective than unimodal approaches lacks comprehensive ablation studies

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation study**: Remove the text attack component from FGA-T and measure the exact contribution of cross-modal interaction to attack success rates across different VLP model architectures
2. **Transferability analysis**: Test FGA-T's performance when transferring between models with different embedding space configurations (aligned vs. fused architectures) to validate the claimed robustness of the approach
3. **Orthogonality verification**: Implement FGA with specific unimodal enhancement mechanisms (MI-FGSM, DI) and measure whether the expected synergistic improvements materialize or if interference occurs
