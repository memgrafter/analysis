# QUITE: Quantifying Uncertainty in Natural Language Text in Bayesian Reasoning Scenarios

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.10449
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10449
- Reference count: 33
- This paper introduces QUITE, a new dataset for probabilistic reasoning that uses real-world Bayesian networks with categorical variables and complex relationships.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces QUITE, a new dataset for probabilistic reasoning that uses real-world Bayesian networks with categorical variables and complex relationships. It provides both numeric and verbalized uncertainty statements, enabling models to estimate probabilities rather than just rank alternatives. Experiments show that neuro-symbolic approaches (fine-tuned LLMs paired with ProbLog) significantly outperform vanilla LLMs on causal, evidential, and explaining-away reasoning tasks. This demonstrates that integrating structured reasoning into NLP systems is a promising direction for improving complex reasoning capabilities.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces QUITE, a dataset for quantifying uncertainty in natural language text in Bayesian reasoning scenarios. It provides real-world Bayesian networks with categorical variables and verbalized premises in both numeric and Words of Estimative Probability (WEP) formats. The evaluation compares vanilla LLMs (zero-shot and chain-of-thought) with neuro-symbolic approaches that fine-tune Mistral-7B using LoRA for semantic parsing to ProbLog, then use ProbLog for exact probabilistic inference. The approach separates problem understanding (LLM) from probabilistic reasoning (ProbLog), achieving superior performance on causal, evidential, and explaining-away reasoning tasks.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned neuro-symbolic models (LLM + ProbLog) significantly outperform vanilla LLMs on all reasoning types in the QUITE dataset
- LLMs fail on evidential and explaining-away reasoning both in zero-shot and chain-of-thought settings
- The neuro-symbolic approach achieves superior performance by offloading mathematical calculations to a deterministic solver

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Fine-tuned neuro-symbolic models (LLM + ProbLog) outperform vanilla LLMs on complex Bayesian reasoning because they offload mathematical calculations to a deterministic solver. The LLM parses natural language premises and evidence into ProbLog syntax, then ProbLog executes exact probabilistic inference without LLM error accumulation. Core assumption: ProbLog accurately models the joint probability distribution defined by the Bayesian network. Evidence anchors: "logic-based models outperform out-of-the-box large language models on all reasoning types" and "Our ProbLog-based approach separates problem understanding and probabilistic reasoning." Break condition: If premise parsing introduces syntax errors or uses undefined predicates, the ProbLog solver fails entirely.

### Mechanism 2
LLMs struggle with evidential and explaining-away reasoning because they lack principled causal structure during pretraining. LLMs learn statistical correlations but cannot reliably invert causal relationships (evidential) or reason about competing causes (explaining-away) without explicit causal modeling. Core assumption: Pretraining data contains mostly causal ("forward") reasoning patterns, not evidential or explaining-away patterns. Evidence anchors: "LLMs fail on questions requiring evidential and explaining-away reasoning both in zero-shot and CoT settings" and "We hypothesize that the LLMs in our study have learned a good concept of causality during pre-training." Break condition: If the LLM receives structured causal information (via ProbLog), it can perform these reasoning types correctly.

### Mechanism 3
Words of estimative probability (WEP) verbalizations are harder for LLMs because they require probabilistic reasoning with ordinal uncertainty rather than numeric computation. LLMs must map linguistic uncertainty expressions to numeric probabilities before performing Bayesian inference, introducing additional parsing complexity. Core assumption: The WEP-to-probability mapping is consistent and known to the LLM during fine-tuning. Evidence anchors: "QUITE also offers a setting that mimicks human conversation, replacing probabilities with words of estimative probability" and "in the case of linguistically specified uncertainty (WEP-based premises), can the model provide close estimates." Break condition: If the LLM fails to map WEPs correctly, subsequent probabilistic reasoning will be fundamentally flawed.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Bayesian networks and conditional probability distributions
  - Why needed here: The entire dataset and evaluation is based on reasoning over these probabilistic structures
  - Quick check question: Given P(A|B) = 0.3 and P(B) = 0.5, what is P(A,B) using the chain rule?

- Concept: Causal vs evidential vs explaining-away reasoning patterns
  - Why needed here: Different reasoning types require different inference approaches, and LLMs show different performance across these types
  - Quick check question: In a V-structure X → Z ← Y, if we observe Z and Y, what type of reasoning explains away X?

- Concept: Natural language parsing to structured logical forms
  - Why needed here: The neuro-symbolic approach requires converting premises to ProbLog syntax
  - Quick check question: How would you represent "If A is true, then B is true with probability 0.7" in first-order logic?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data layer (QUITE dataset) -> Parsing layer (LLM for semantic parsing to ProbLog) -> Reasoning layer (ProbLog solver for probabilistic inference) -> Evaluation layer (accuracy and RMSE metrics)

- Critical path: Premise parsing → Evidence parsing → Query construction → ProbLog execution → Probability calculation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Pure LLM vs neuro-symbolic: Pure LLMs have reasoning errors but no parsing overhead; neuro-symbolic has parsing complexity but deterministic inference
  - Numeric vs WEP premises: Numeric allows direct computation; WEP requires additional uncertainty mapping
  - Fine-tuning scope: Fine-tune on premise parsing vs fine-tune on full reasoning chain

- Failure signatures:
  - High error rate with many background premises → context window overflow or parsing errors
  - Zero correct answers on evidential reasoning → LLM cannot invert causal relationships
  - Invalid ProbLog syntax → parsing errors in semantic conversion

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run baseline LLM on a simple 3-node network with numeric premises to establish minimum performance
  2. Test fine-tuned LLM+ProbLog on the same network to verify mechanism 1
  3. Compare performance on evidential reasoning vs causal reasoning to demonstrate mechanism 2 limitations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How would the performance of neuro-symbolic models compare if trained on a larger and more diverse dataset of real-world Bayesian networks? Basis in paper: The paper mentions that the current QUITE dataset is limited in size and that expanding it to include more diverse and complex networks could further improve the robustness of neuro-symbolic models. Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates the models on the current QUITE dataset and does not explore the potential benefits of training on a larger and more diverse dataset. What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with neuro-symbolic models trained on an expanded QUITE dataset with a wider variety of real-world Bayesian networks and comparing their performance to the current models.

### Open Question 2
Can the neuro-symbolic approach be extended to handle more complex reasoning tasks, such as counterfactual reasoning or reasoning about interventions? Basis in paper: The paper mentions that QUITE currently operates on rung 1 of the ladder of causation and suggests that extending it to cover rungs 2 and 3 could be a future direction. Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the performance of neuro-symbolic models on more complex reasoning tasks beyond the current scope of QUITE. What evidence would resolve it: Developing and evaluating neuro-symbolic models on datasets that include counterfactual reasoning and interventional queries, and comparing their performance to the current models on QUITE.

### Open Question 3
How does the performance of neuro-symbolic models vary across different domains and types of uncertainty (e.g., epistemic vs. aleatoric)? Basis in paper: The paper mentions that QUITE includes Bayesian networks from various domains, but does not analyze the performance of models across these domains or types of uncertainty. Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of how the performance of neuro-symbolic models is affected by the domain or type of uncertainty present in the Bayesian networks. What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with neuro-symbolic models on subsets of QUITE that focus on specific domains or types of uncertainty, and comparing their performance to the overall results.

## Limitations

- The evaluation focuses primarily on accuracy and RMSE metrics without comprehensive error analysis of specific failure modes in the parsing layer
- Performance gap between neuro-symbolic and pure LLM approaches may be partially attributable to explicit task decomposition rather than inherent LLM limitations
- Generalizability of the neuro-symbolic approach beyond QUITE dataset's specific Bayesian network structures remains unclear

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core finding that neuro-symbolic approaches (LLM + ProbLog) outperform vanilla LLMs on Bayesian reasoning tasks within the QUITE dataset.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that LLMs specifically struggle with evidential and explaining-away reasoning due to pretraining data bias.

**Low Confidence**: The assertion that WEP verbalizations are inherently harder for LLMs due to additional uncertainty mapping complexity.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset generalization test**: Apply the fine-tuned semantic parser and ProbLog reasoning pipeline to a different Bayesian reasoning dataset (such as those from educational assessment or medical diagnosis) to evaluate whether the approach generalizes beyond QUITE's specific network structures and linguistic patterns.

2. **Ablation study on parsing complexity**: Systematically vary the complexity of premises (simple vs compound evidence, single vs multiple variables) while keeping the underlying Bayesian network constant to isolate whether performance gains come from better reasoning or from improved handling of complex linguistic structures.

3. **Human evaluation of WEP interpretations**: Conduct a controlled study where human subjects map the same WEP expressions used in QUITE to numeric probabilities, then compare this distribution to the LLM's interpretations to determine whether parsing errors or fundamental uncertainty mapping differences drive performance gaps.
