# An Image Grid Can Be Worth a Video: Zero-shot Video Question Answering Using a VLM

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.18406
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18406
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in 9 out of 10 zero-shot video question answering benchmarks using a single VLM with no video-data training

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces IG-VLM, a novel approach for zero-shot video question answering that transforms videos into a single composite image grid. By sampling six frames from a video and arranging them in a 3x2 grid layout, the method enables direct application of a single Vision Language Model (VLM) without requiring any video-specific training. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across ten benchmark datasets, outperforming existing methods in nine out of ten cases. The key innovation lies in preserving temporal information within the spatial layout of the image grid, eliminating the need for complex video architectures.

## Method Summary
IG-VLM converts videos into image grids by uniformly sampling six frames and arranging them in a 3x2 layout. These composite images are then processed by a pre-trained VLM using carefully designed prompts that include grid guidance (indicating the image represents ordered video frames) and reasoning guidance (directing how to answer open-ended questions). The method requires no video-data training and leverages existing high-performance VLMs directly. Performance is evaluated across five open-ended and five multiple-choice video question answering benchmarks, demonstrating superior results compared to existing approaches.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance in 5 out of 5 open-ended VQA benchmarks
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance in 4 out of 5 multiple-choice VQA benchmarks
- Outperforms existing methods in 9 out of 10 zero-shot video question answering benchmarks tested

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: A single VLM can perform zero-shot video question answering by converting a video into a grid of sampled frames
- Mechanism: By arranging six uniformly sampled frames from a video into a square 3x2 image grid, the temporal sequence of the video is preserved within the spatial layout of a single image. This grid image can then be directly processed by a VLM, which was originally designed to handle images, without requiring any video-specific training or multi-stage architectures
- Core assumption: The spatial ordering of frames in the grid is sufficient for the VLM to infer the temporal relationships and understand the video content
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Initially, we transform a video into a single composite image by arranging multiple frames in a grid layout... effectively retains temporal information within the grid structure"
  - [section 3.1]: "The video sequence is uniformly partitioned into six intervals and the first frame in each interval is chosen to be included in the image grid"
  - [corpus]: Weak—no direct evidence found; based on design assumption
- Break condition: If the temporal ordering in the grid is not interpretable by the VLM, or if the grid shape or frame count significantly disrupts spatial information needed for reasoning

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Grid guidance and reasoning guidance prompts significantly improve VLM performance on video question answering tasks
- Mechanism: Adding explicit instructions in the prompt that (1) the image grid represents an ordered sequence of video frames and (2) how to reason over that sequence, helps the VLM better interpret the spatial-temporal layout and generate accurate answers
- Core assumption: VLMs respond strongly to prompt engineering, especially when the input structure deviates from standard single-image inputs
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.3]: "The reasoning guidance prompt is adopted only for open-ended questions and it provides a guidance to VLM on how the answer should be derived considering image grid and grid guidance prompt"
  - [section 6.2]: "Including reasoning guidance in the prompt yielded a universal boost in performance"
  - [corpus]: Weak—prompt effectiveness is inferred from ablation study, not external benchmarks
- Break condition: If the VLM already has sufficient built-in understanding of ordered visual sequences, or if the prompts introduce noise or ambiguity

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Larger VLMs do not consistently outperform smaller ones for video question answering in IG-VLM
- Mechanism: While LLM size generally correlates with reasoning ability, the video understanding capability in this context is more dependent on the ability to interpret the image grid and the prompt design, rather than raw parameter count
- Core assumption: The bottleneck in video QA is not language modeling capacity but rather the spatial-temporal encoding in the image grid
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 6.1]: "Experiments involving LLaVA v1.6 within IG-VLM have indeed indicated a potential improvement in performance with scaling of LLM sizes; however, this pattern does not uniformly apply across various open-ended and multiple-choice VQA benchmarks"
  - [section 6.1]: "Despite the significant size difference between GPT-4V and LLaVA v1.6 34B, the latter demonstrated superior performance in three out of five open-ended VQA"
  - [corpus]: Weak—no comparative benchmarks from other grid-based VQA methods found
- Break condition: If the VLM's vision encoder is too weak to resolve spatial details in the grid, or if reasoning over longer temporal sequences becomes necessary beyond six frames

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Vision-Language Model (VLM) input modalities
  - Why needed here: Understanding that VLMs accept image tokens (spatial only) and text tokens, but not native video tokens, is essential to grasp why the image grid approach is necessary
  - Quick check question: What types of tokens can a standard VLM process without modification?

- Concept: Frame sampling and temporal encoding
  - Why needed here: The method depends on correctly sampling and ordering frames to preserve video semantics; misunderstanding this would break the temporal reasoning assumption
  - Quick check question: How does uniform frame sampling across video intervals help in representing the video's temporal flow?

- Concept: Prompt engineering and zero-shot learning
  - Why needed here: The success of IG-VLM hinges on carefully crafted prompts that guide the VLM to interpret the grid as a video; without this, the VLM may treat it as an unrelated image collage
  - Quick check question: What is the role of grid guidance and reasoning guidance in zero-shot video QA?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Video input → Frame sampler (6 frames uniformly spaced) → Image grid constructor (3x2 layout) → VLM input pipeline → Prompt assembler (grid + reasoning guidance + question) → VLM inference → Answer output
- Critical path: Frame sampling → Image grid arrangement → Prompt construction → VLM inference
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Frame count vs. spatial resolution: More frames reduce resolution per frame, hurting detail; fewer frames may miss key events
  - Grid shape vs. aspect ratio: Square-like shapes preserve visual integrity; tall or wide layouts distort spatial context
  - Prompt verbosity vs. model overload: More guidance helps reasoning but may confuse the model if redundant
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor VQA accuracy → Check if frames are sampled too sparsely or too densely
  - Inconsistent results across VLMs → Check prompt consistency and grid layout
  - Performance worse than single-frame baseline → Likely loss of critical spatial detail or temporal order misinterpretation
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare IG-VLM performance using 4, 6, and 9 frames in different grid shapes on a small open-ended VQA benchmark
  2. Ablation test: run with and without grid guidance prompt on the same benchmark
  3. Test single-frame vs. image grid performance using the same VLM and prompt setup

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of IG-VLM vary with different numbers of sampled frames in the image grid?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the number of frames included in an image grid is a design element that can influence performance
- Why unresolved: The paper only provides results for N = 6 frames and briefly mentions investigating N = 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, and 20 frames in the analysis section, but does not provide comprehensive results for all these options
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive ablation study showing the performance of IG-VLM for different numbers of frames (N = 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 20) on multiple benchmarks would resolve this question

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of IG-VLM change when using different VLM architectures with varying vision encoder resolutions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the resolution of the vision encoder of the VLM can influence the performance of IG-VLM
- Why unresolved: The paper only evaluates IG-VLM with a limited set of VLMs (CogAgent, LLaVA v1.6 in 3 sizes, and GPT-4V) and does not explore the impact of different vision encoder resolutions
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the performance of IG-VLM using VLMs with different vision encoder resolutions (e.g., different sizes of ViT encoders) on multiple benchmarks would resolve this question

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of IG-VLM compare to other video question answering methods when handling videos with complex temporal dynamics or requiring fine-grained temporal understanding?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that IG-VLM can capture temporal information within the grid structure, but does not provide a detailed analysis of its performance on videos with complex temporal dynamics
- Why unresolved: The paper does not include a specific analysis or benchmark designed to evaluate the temporal understanding capabilities of IG-VLM compared to other methods
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the performance of IG-VLM to other video question answering methods on a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate temporal understanding (e.g., requiring reasoning about complex action sequences or fine-grained temporal relationships) would resolve this question

## Limitations

- The study only evaluates six-frame sampling, leaving uncertainty about optimal frame count for different video lengths and complexities
- Performance variation across different VLMs suggests the method may not be universally applicable
- No comparison against advanced video-specific architectures that use temporal modeling

## Confidence

- Mechanism 1 (Grid-based temporal encoding): Medium
- Mechanism 2 (Prompt engineering effectiveness): Medium
- Mechanism 3 (VLM size independence): Low

## Next Checks

1. Test IG-VLM performance with variable frame counts (4, 6, 9, 12) across different video durations to establish optimal sampling strategy
2. Evaluate the method on videos with rapid scene changes or complex temporal dependencies to test robustness
3. Compare IG-VLM against hybrid approaches that combine grid representation with lightweight temporal modeling
