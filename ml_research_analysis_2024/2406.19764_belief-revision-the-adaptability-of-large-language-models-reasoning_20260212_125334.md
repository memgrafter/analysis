# Belief Revision: The Adaptability of Large Language Models Reasoning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.19764
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19764
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: LLMs exhibit a critical trade-off between belief updating and maintaining accuracy, struggling with belief revision despite strong basic logical inference capabilities.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Belief-R, a novel dataset designed to evaluate belief revision capabilities in large language models. The dataset tests whether models can appropriately update or maintain their prior beliefs when presented with new evidence, a crucial skill for real-world reasoning. Using a delta reasoning framework, the authors assess ~30 LLMs across various prompting strategies and find that models generally struggle with belief revision, exhibiting a critical trade-off between updating and maintaining beliefs. The study highlights the importance of improving LLMs' adaptability to changing information for more reliable AI systems.

## Method Summary
The authors created Belief-R by generating premise sequences from ATOMIC using GPT-4, then manually annotating them with 5 annotators per sample using majority voting. The dataset contains 2,000 entries testing modus ponens and modus tollens inferences with new information that may require belief updates. Models were evaluated using zero-shot classification with encoder-only models (RoBERTa, DeBERTa-v3) and generation-based inference with decoder-only models (GPT, Llama, Phi series), plus API-based generation for larger models using direct prompting, chain-of-thought, and plan-and-solve methods.

## Key Results
- LLMs achieve significantly higher performance on basic logical inference tasks than belief revision tasks
- A critical trade-off exists between belief updating accuracy (BU-Acc) and belief maintaining accuracy (BM-Acc)
- Instruction-tuned models outperform pre-trained models on basic logical inference
- Performance varies significantly across different prompting strategies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Belief-R exposes the inability of LLMs to perform belief revision by forcing a two-step reasoning sequence that requires retracting prior conclusions when new information introduces dependencies.
- Mechanism: The dataset's structure forces models to first commit to an inference at step t, then confront a third premise at t+1 that may introduce a conjunctive dependency requiring retraction of the initial conclusion.
- Core assumption: Models' internal belief representations can be inferred from their responses to multi-step queries with evolving premises.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Using a newly proposed delta reasoning framework, the authors assess ~30 LLMs across various prompting strategies. Results show that LLMs generally struggle with belief revision..."
  - [section 4.2] "We examine the corresponding conclusion, φM +1, to see how the beliefs shifts according to the significance of γ3."
- Break condition: If models can successfully use external knowledge or chain-of-thought to reconstruct dependencies without true belief revision, the framework would misattribute performance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The suppression task structure creates a controlled environment where belief revision failures are measurable and not confused with other reasoning errors.
- Mechanism: By using standardized logical forms with controlled variations in the third premise, the dataset isolates belief revision as a distinct cognitive operation from basic inference.
- Core assumption: The suppression task captures genuine belief revision rather than just pattern matching or surface-level reasoning.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "We start by presenting LMs with two initial premises that satisfy basic logical inference rule to assess its basic inference ability."
  - [section 4] "Each sample in Belief-R is equipped with two initial premises that support basic modus ponens or modus tollens inferences, and a new premise that brings in new information..."
- Break condition: If models can solve the task through shallow pattern matching without engaging in genuine belief revision, the measurement validity breaks down.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The trade-off between belief updating and maintaining reflects a fundamental architectural limitation in how LLMs handle conflicting information streams.
- Mechanism: When models attempt to revise beliefs, they must suppress previously generated content while incorporating new constraints, interfering with maintaining accurate beliefs when updates aren't needed.
- Core assumption: The observed trade-off represents a fundamental limitation rather than optimization artifacts.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Further, models adept at updating often underperformed in scenarios without necessary updates, highlighting a critical trade-off."
  - [section 6] "We discover a trade-off between BU-Acc and BM-Acc: models performing well on one subset typically faltered on the other..."
- Break condition: If prompting strategies or architectural modifications can eliminate the trade-off, it suggests the limitation is not fundamental.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Modus ponens and modus tollens logical inference rules
  - Why needed here: These rules form the basis for the initial belief establishment in the delta reasoning framework
  - Quick check question: Given "If it rains then the ground is wet" and "It rains," what conclusion follows via modus ponens?

- Concept: Suppression task methodology from cognitive science
  - Why needed here: Provides the theoretical foundation for creating controlled belief revision scenarios
  - Quick check question: In a suppression task, what happens to the initial conclusion when a third premise introduces a necessary condition?

- Concept: Inter-rater reliability measurement (Gwet's AC1)
  - Why needed here: Ensures dataset quality through multiple annotator agreement on belief revision judgments
  - Quick check question: What agreement score threshold was used to filter dataset quality?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data generation pipeline → Annotation workflow → Evaluation framework → Results analysis
- Critical path: Generate synthetic premises → Manual annotation → Dataset filtering → LLM evaluation → Trade-off analysis
- Design tradeoffs: Dataset size vs. annotation quality vs. computational efficiency
- Failure signatures: Low inter-annotator agreement → Dataset quality issues; Models achieving near-zero BU-Acc → Genuine belief revision failure; Trade-off between BU-Acc and
