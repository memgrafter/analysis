core_contribution: Wideband Back-Projection Diffusion is a generative framework that
  reconstructs scatterers from wideband data by factoring the inverse scattering map
  into a physics-based latent representation step (inspired by the filtered back-projection
  formula) and a conditional diffusion sampling step. It leverages rotational equivariance
  for the latent encoding and translational equivariance for the score function, enabling
  efficient learning with parameter scaling sub-linear in resolution.

# Back-Projection Diffusion: Solving the Wideband Inverse Scattering Problem with Diffusion Models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2408.02866
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02866
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Wideband Back-Projection Diffusion achieves 1-2% relative error in wideband inverse scattering reconstruction, outperforming deterministic and classical methods

## Executive Summary
Wideband Back-Projection Diffusion introduces a generative framework that solves the challenging wideband inverse scattering problem by combining physics-based latent representation with conditional diffusion models. The method leverages the filtered back-projection formula to create a meaningful latent space encoding, then uses a diffusion model to sample from the posterior distribution of possible scatterers given measured scattering data. By exploiting rotational and translational equivariances in the problem structure, the approach achieves efficient learning with parameter scaling sub-linear in resolution, enabling sharp reconstructions even for sub-Nyquist features and in the presence of strong multiple scattering.

## Method Summary
The method factors the inverse scattering map into two stages: first, a physics-based encoder maps scattering data to a latent representation inspired by the filtered back-projection formula; second, a conditional diffusion model samples from the posterior distribution in this latent space to reconstruct the scatterer. The encoder exploits rotational equivariance by working in polar coordinates centered on the scatterer, while the diffusion model's score function benefits from translational equivariance, allowing efficient learning at high resolutions. The framework produces not just a single reconstruction but samples from the full posterior, enabling uncertainty quantification. The approach is demonstrated on synthetic data with various scatterer geometries, showing superior performance to state-of-the-art deterministic and classical methods while requiring relatively few training samples (as few as 2,000).

## Key Results
- Achieves sharp reconstructions with 1-2% relative error in synthetic experiments
- Outperforms state-of-the-art deterministic and classical methods for wideband inverse scattering
- Demonstrates robust performance with strong multiple scattering and sub-Nyquist features (under specific symmetry constraints)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method succeeds by combining the strengths of physics-based modeling with modern generative approaches. The filtered back-projection formula provides a natural latent representation that captures the essential structure of the inverse problem, while the diffusion model handles the ambiguity inherent in inverse scattering by sampling from the posterior distribution. The exploitation of rotational equivariance in the latent encoding and translational equivariance in the score function dramatically reduces the learning complexity, enabling efficient training even at high resolutions. This hybrid approach bridges the gap between purely data-driven methods and traditional physics-based reconstruction, achieving both accuracy and uncertainty quantification.

## Foundational Learning

**Filtered Back-Projection Formula**: A classical reconstruction technique in tomography that underlies the latent encoding; needed to create a physics-informed latent space that captures essential scattering information; quick check: verify the formula's implementation matches the standard derivation for the specific scattering geometry.

**Conditional Diffusion Models**: Generative models that learn to denoise data conditioned on inputs; needed to sample from the posterior distribution of scatterers given scattering data; quick check: ensure the noise schedule β_t is properly tuned and the model learns to reverse the noising process.

**Rotational Equivariance**: Property where rotating the input leads to a correspondingly rotated output; needed to reduce the effective dimensionality of the latent space by working in polar coordinates; quick check: verify that rotating the scattering data produces the expected rotation in the latent representation.

**Translational Equivariance**: Property where translating the input leads to a correspondingly translated output; needed to enable efficient learning of the score function at high resolutions; quick check: confirm that translating the scattering data produces the expected translation in the reconstructed scatterer.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Scattering Data → Physics-Based Encoder (Filtered Back-Projection) → Latent Representation → Conditional Diffusion Model → Reconstructed Scatterer

**Critical Path**: The forward pass through the physics-based encoder followed by conditional sampling from the diffusion model is the primary reconstruction pipeline. The backward pass during training updates both the encoder and diffusion model parameters to minimize the data misfit.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades computational complexity during training (requiring many diffusion steps) for efficient inference and the ability to sample from the posterior distribution. The physics-based encoder provides structure but may limit the model's ability to capture phenomena not well-represented by the filtered back-projection formula.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor reconstructions may occur when the training and test data have different discretizations, when scatterers lack the rotational symmetries assumed in the training data, or when the latent dimension M is poorly chosen relative to the complexity of the scattering data.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Reconstruct a simple circular scatterer from synthetic scattering data to verify basic functionality.
2. Test the rotational equivariance property by rotating the scattering data and verifying the corresponding rotation in the reconstructed scatterer.
3. Evaluate reconstruction quality with varying numbers of training samples to characterize sample efficiency.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Performance degrades with numerical discretization mismatches between training and test data
- Sub-Nyquist reconstruction capability appears contingent on prior knowledge of scatterer support and rotational symmetries
- Claims about robustness to strong multiple scattering are demonstrated only for specific synthetic scenarios with known support constraints

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The generative framework's ability to produce diverse, physically plausible reconstructions from posterior samples is well-validated through multiple synthetic experiments and the comparison to deterministic methods.
- **Medium confidence**: Claims about sample efficiency (2,000 training samples) and generalization to unseen scatterer geometries are supported by experiments, but real-world validation with measured data is absent.
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that the method can recover features smaller than the Nyquist rate is demonstrated only in controlled settings with rotational symmetry constraints, limiting its general applicability.

## Next Checks
1. Test the method on experimentally measured wideband data from real scatterers to verify performance beyond synthetic scenarios.
2. Systematically evaluate reconstruction quality when training and test data use different numerical discretizations or grid resolutions.
3. Assess the method's ability to reconstruct scatterers without rotational symmetries or known support constraints, particularly for sub-Nyquist features.
