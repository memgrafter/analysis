# Reliability, Resilience and Human Factors Engineering for Trustworthy AI Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.08981
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08981
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Framework integrating reliability, resilience, and human factors engineering for trustworthy AI systems using adapted classical engineering metrics

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive framework that adapts classical engineering reliability metrics to AI systems while incorporating resilience engineering and human factors considerations. The framework addresses both pre-deployment reliability assessment and post-deployment resilience monitoring, focusing on AI-specific failure modes across data, model, computing infrastructure, and human interaction subsystems. A case study using OpenAI status data demonstrates practical application of the framework's reliability metrics including MTBF and failure rate analysis.

## Method Summary
The paper develops a framework that adapts classical engineering metrics like failure rate and MTBF to AI systems, incorporating resilience engineering principles and human reliability analysis. The methodology addresses both pre-deployment reliability assessment and post-deployment resilience monitoring, considering AI-specific failure modes across multiple subsystems. The framework integrates reliability engineering principles with resilience engineering concepts and human factors considerations to create a comprehensive approach for trustworthy AI system development and operation.

## Key Results
- Successfully adapts classical reliability metrics (MTBF, failure rate) to AI systems
- Demonstrates framework application through OpenAI status data case study
- Addresses AI-specific failure modes across data, model, computing infrastructure, and human interaction subsystems
- Integrates reliability, resilience, and human factors engineering into unified framework

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its systematic adaptation of proven engineering reliability concepts to the unique characteristics of AI systems. By incorporating resilience engineering principles, it moves beyond traditional failure prevention to include adaptive recovery capabilities. The integration of human factors engineering ensures that human-AI interaction patterns and human reliability are explicitly considered in system design and operation.

## Foundational Learning
- Reliability Engineering for AI: Adapting classical metrics like MTBF to AI contexts
  - Why needed: AI systems have different failure characteristics than traditional engineered systems
  - Quick check: Compare failure patterns between traditional systems and AI implementations
- Resilience Engineering: Moving from prevention to adaptive recovery
  - Why needed: AI systems must handle novel failure modes and continuous adaptation
  - Quick check: Assess system recovery time after unexpected failures
- Human Reliability Analysis: Incorporating human factors in AI system safety
  - Why needed: Human-AI interaction introduces unique failure modes and safety considerations
  - Quick check: Evaluate human error rates in AI system operation and monitoring

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Reliability Assessment -> Resilience Monitoring -> Human Factors Integration

Critical Path:
Data Quality Assessment -> Model Performance Validation -> Infrastructure Monitoring -> Human Interaction Analysis -> System Trustworthiness Evaluation

Design Tradeoffs:
- Comprehensive monitoring vs. operational overhead
- Predictive accuracy vs. system complexity
- Standardization vs. domain-specific adaptation

Failure Signatures:
- Data-related failures: bias, drift, corruption
- Model failures: hallucination, adversarial attacks, concept drift
- Infrastructure failures: resource exhaustion, cascading failures
- Human interaction failures: misuse, misunderstanding, overreliance

First Experiments:
1. Apply MTBF calculation to OpenAI status data to establish baseline reliability metrics
2. Conduct human reliability analysis on AI system operator error patterns
3. Test resilience response protocols for simulated AI system failures

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Reliance on single vendor (OpenAI) status data may limit generalizability
- Framework's applicability to safety-critical domains remains uncertain
- Human-AI interaction patterns vary significantly across use cases and user populations

## Confidence
- Metric generalizability across AI architectures: Medium
- Safety impact assessment: Low to Medium
- Policy and regulatory guidance utility: Low to Medium

## Next Checks
1. Empirical validation across multiple AI system architectures (not just large language models) to assess metric generalizability
2. Safety impact analysis comparing framework implementation in high-stakes versus general-purpose AI deployments
3. Stakeholder analysis involving regulators, operators, and end-users to validate the practical utility of proposed metrics and monitoring approaches
