# Zero-Shot Learning and Key Points Are All You Need for Automated Fact-Checking

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.08400
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08400
- Reference count: 5
- Primary result: Achieved 10th place in AVeriTeC shared task with score of 0.27

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ZSL-KeP, a zero-shot learning framework for automated fact-checking that combines key point extraction with extensive retrieval. The method generates multiple key points from claims, uses these for BM25 retrieval from a knowledge store, and employs a large language model to generate question-answer pairs as evidence and predict verdicts. The approach avoids fine-tuning and uses only in-context learning, making it straightforward to implement. Evaluated on the AVeriTeC dataset, ZSL-KeP achieved an AVeriTeC score of 0.27, outperforming the baseline by 0.16.

## Method Summary
ZSL-KeP uses a zero-shot prompting approach with Llama-3-70B to generate key points from claims, perform BM25 retrieval using both the original claim and key points as queries, and generate question-answer pairs as evidence for verdict prediction. The framework retrieves documents with top_k=70 for the original claim and top_k=12 for key point queries, concatenating retrieved documents with citation IDs. When context length exceeds LLM limits, the system reduces the number of documents processed. The approach relies entirely on in-context learning without any fine-tuning.

## Key Results
- Achieved 10th place ranking in AVeriTeC shared task
- Scored 0.27 AVeriTeC score, outperforming baseline by 0.16
- Demonstrates viability of zero-shot approach for automated fact-checking
- Shows effectiveness of key point decomposition for improving retrieval

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Using zero-shot learning with key point decomposition enables effective retrieval and fact-checking without fine-tuning.
- Mechanism: The framework constructs key points from claims, performs extensive retrieval using BM25, and uses zero-shot LLM prompting to generate question-answer pairs and verdicts. This approach leverages the LLM's large context window and reasoning capabilities for evidence generation.
- Core assumption: Key point decomposition increases retrieval effectiveness by creating multiple query variations that capture different aspects of the claim.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This work employs Large Language Models (LLMs) with Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL), which offer advantages over simpler, classification-based models due to their long context windows and high reasoning capabilities."
  - [section] "The primary objective of forming key points is that even a simple claim can contain several key points. When searching and retrieving information from the knowledge store, more extensive retrieval typically yields more comprehensive information."
  - [corpus] Found 25 related papers with average neighbor FMR=0.464, indicating reasonable relatedness to automated fact-checking literature.
- Break condition: If the LLM's context window is insufficient to process all retrieved documents, the framework reduces the number of documents processed, potentially missing relevant evidence.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Extensive retrieval using multiple key point queries improves evidence coverage compared to single-query approaches.
- Mechanism: For each claim, the framework generates n key points, appends the original claim, and performs BM25 retrieval with different top_k parameters for each query. Retrieved documents are concatenated with unique identifiers to maintain source traceability.
- Core assumption: Different key points will retrieve complementary evidence, providing a more comprehensive information set for fact-checking.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "If the number of constructed key points is n, we treat these key points as a list of queries. We append the main input claim to this list and use BM25 to retrieve results for each of the n + 1 queries with a different top_k parameter for each query."
  - [abstract] "By utilizing proper prompting strategies, their versatility—due to their understanding of large context sizes and zero-shot learning ability—enables them to simulate human problem-solving intuition."
  - [corpus] Several papers in the corpus focus on retrieval for fact-checking, suggesting this is an established approach.
- Break condition: If the knowledge store lacks relevant documents for any of the key points, the retrieval may miss critical evidence needed for accurate verification.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Dynamic question-answer pair generation based on retrieved evidence produces more relevant and targeted fact-checking evidence than static approaches.
- Mechanism: The framework uses zero-shot LLM prompting to generate 1-4 question-answer pairs based on the claim and retrieved documents, selecting from extractive, abstractive, boolean, or unanswerable answer types. Each QA pair includes a citation ID linking to the source document.
- Core assumption: Questions generated in context with specific retrieved documents will be more targeted and relevant than pre-defined questions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Your task is to accurately determine a correct verdict for a given claim... You need to provide 1 to 4 necessary and helpful question-answer (QA) pairs. Each QA pair should be well-constructed, focusing on different important parts of the claim and utilizing the retrieved knowledge effectively."
  - [abstract] "This work employs Large Language Models (LLMs) with Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL), which offer advantages over simpler, classification-based models due to their long context windows and high reasoning capabilities."
  - [corpus] The corpus contains related work on LLM-based fact-checking, supporting the general approach.
- Break condition: If the LLM generates irrelevant or low-quality questions, the evidence may not adequately support the verdict determination.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Zero-shot learning and in-context learning
  - Why needed here: The framework relies entirely on zero-shot learning to avoid the computational cost of fine-tuning large language models while maintaining flexibility across different claims.
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between zero-shot learning and few-shot learning, and why zero-shot might be preferred for this fact-checking task?

- Concept: BM25 retrieval and document ranking
  - Why needed here: The framework uses BM25 for information retrieval from a knowledge store, requiring understanding of how BM25 scores and ranks documents based on term frequency and document length.
  - Quick check question: How does BM25 handle document length normalization, and why is this important when retrieving evidence for fact-checking?

- Concept: Prompt engineering and template design
  - Why needed here: The framework uses carefully designed prompts to guide the LLM in generating key points, questions, answers, and verdicts, requiring understanding of effective prompt structure and constraints.
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of an effective zero-shot prompt for a language model, and how do temperature and top_p parameters affect the output?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Claim → Key Point Construction → Extensive Retrieval → Evidence Generation → Verdict Prediction
- Critical path: The most time-consuming step is typically the retrieval phase due to multiple queries and document processing.
- Design tradeoffs: The framework trades retrieval comprehensiveness (multiple queries, high top_k values) for computational efficiency and context window constraints. It also balances evidence quantity (1-4 QA pairs) against potential redundancy and scoring penalties.
- Failure signatures: Common failures include context window overflow (requiring document reduction), low-quality or irrelevant key points leading to poor retrieval, and LLM-generated questions that don't align well with the claim or evidence. The framework mitigates these through iterative prompting and document selection.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test key point generation quality by providing various claims and evaluating the diversity and relevance of generated key points against ground truth decompositions.
  2. Evaluate retrieval effectiveness by measuring recall of gold documents when using original claims versus key point-enhanced queries, comparing different top_k values.
  3. Assess evidence generation quality by checking if generated question-answer pairs actually support the correct verdict, measuring precision and relevance of QA pairs across different claim types.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would ZSL-KeP's performance change if a larger context window LLM was used to avoid the need to truncate the retrieval document set?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that "the limited input length of our LLM, constrained by time and budget limitations, prevented us from retrieving a larger document set"
- Why unresolved: The current implementation had to truncate documents due to LLM context window constraints, but the paper doesn't explore how this truncation affects performance
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing performance with full document sets versus truncated sets using larger context window models

### Open Question 2
- Question: Would the framework benefit from a fine-tuned version of the LLM rather than relying solely on zero-shot prompting?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors acknowledge their approach "operates without requiring any fine-tuning" and suggest "a more powerful LLM could enhance accuracy" as a limitation
- Why unresolved: The paper deliberately avoids fine-tuning for simplicity but doesn't investigate whether fine-tuning could improve results
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative results between zero-shot and fine-tuned versions of the same framework

### Open Question 3
- Question: How sensitive is the framework's performance to the specific parameters chosen for BM25 retrieval (top_k values, document selection strategy)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors specify "top_k to 70 for the original claim and to 12 for other queries" but don't explore sensitivity to these choices
- Why unresolved: The paper uses fixed retrieval parameters without exploring how different configurations might affect results
- What evidence would resolve it: Ablation studies varying BM25 parameters and measuring impact on final performance

### Open Question 4
- Question: Could the key point construction step be optimized to generate more effective queries for retrieval?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors describe their key point construction method but note it's designed to "facilitate more divergent retrieval" without testing alternative approaches
- Why unresolved: The paper presents one key point generation strategy without exploring whether other methods might produce better retrieval results
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments testing different key point generation strategies and their impact on retrieval quality

## Limitations

- Limited analysis of whether key point decomposition actually improves retrieval quality compared to baseline methods
- Reliance on a single LLM (Llama-3-70B) without exploring alternative models or fine-tuning approaches
- No systematic exploration of parameter sensitivity for BM25 retrieval or key point generation

## Confidence

**Confidence: Low** on the actual effectiveness of the key point decomposition approach. The paper reports an AVeriTeC score of 0.27, which places it 10th out of 32 teams, but provides limited analysis of whether the key point decomposition actually improves retrieval quality or if the zero-shot approach is optimal.

**Confidence: Medium** on the generalizability of the approach. While the framework avoids fine-tuning, it relies on a single LLM and a specific knowledge store format.

**Confidence: Medium** on the retrieval effectiveness claims. The paper states that "more extensive retrieval typically yields more comprehensive information" but does not provide quantitative evidence comparing retrieval effectiveness with and without key point decomposition.

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study on key point decomposition**: Run the same framework without key point decomposition (using only the original claim for retrieval) and compare AVeriTeC scores, retrieval recall metrics, and evidence quality to determine if key points provide measurable benefit.

2. **Knowledge store coverage analysis**: Evaluate what percentage of claims in the AVeriTeC dataset have relevant supporting documents in the knowledge store. Calculate document recall for claims that received "Not Enough Evidence" verdicts to determine if the issue is retrieval quality or knowledge store completeness.

3. **Context truncation impact assessment**: Systematically vary the number of documents retained when context length exceeds limits, measuring the impact on verdict accuracy. Determine if the framework consistently loses critical evidence due to truncation and identify optimal document selection strategies.
