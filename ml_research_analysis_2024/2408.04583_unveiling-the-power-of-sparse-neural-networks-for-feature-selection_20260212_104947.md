# Unveiling the Power of Sparse Neural Networks for Feature Selection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.04583
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04583
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: SNNs with neuron attribution achieve 54.2% sparsity (SET) and 66.4% (RigL), reducing memory/FLOPs by >50%/55% while outperforming dense networks on 13/18 datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper systematically evaluates sparse neural networks for feature selection using dynamic sparse training algorithms. The authors compare dense and sparse models, two DST algorithms (SET and RigL), and two neuron importance metrics (neuron strength and neuron attribution). Their comprehensive experiments on 18 datasets demonstrate that sparse neural networks can achieve significant computational savings while maintaining or improving feature selection quality. The neuron attribution metric, which uses gradient information to measure feature importance, generally outperforms the simpler neuron strength metric. The study reveals that the optimal choice between SET and RigL depends on dataset characteristics, with SET typically performing better for feature selection tasks.

## Method Summary
The study trains sparse neural networks using two dynamic sparse training algorithms (SET and RigL) and compares them against dense networks on 18 datasets. Models are two-layer MLPs with 1000 and 100 hidden neurons, optimized for sparsity levels [0.25, 0.50, 0.80, 0.90, 0.95, 0.98] and L2 regularization. Feature importance is calculated using either neuron strength (summing incoming weights) or neuron attribution (gradient-based method). The top K=100 features are selected and evaluated using an SVM classifier. The experimental setup includes careful hyperparameter tuning with early stopping and systematic evaluation of memory and computational savings.

## Key Results
- Sparse models achieve >50% memory and >55% FLOPs reduction compared to dense networks
- Neuron attribution outperforms neuron strength in 11 of 18 datasets
- SET algorithm typically outperforms RigL for feature selection
- On 13 of 18 datasets, sparse models with neuron attribution outperform their dense counterparts
- High-dimensional biological datasets and noisy datasets (like Madelon) show better performance with dense models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Neuron attribution outperforms neuron strength for feature selection in sparse neural networks.
- Mechanism: Neuron attribution measures the gradient of the output neuron with respect to each input feature, providing a more nuanced view of feature importance than neuron strength, which sums incoming weights. This allows neuron attribution to capture the relative contribution of features across all output neurons, leading to better feature selection.
- Core assumption: The gradient of the output neuron with respect to an input feature accurately reflects the feature's importance for the final prediction.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We introduce a novel feature importance metric based on neuron attribution, highlighting its advantages over existing feature importance methods in capturing the feature relevance."
  - [section 2.2] "Usually, the gradient information is used to measure the neuron attribution. Neuron attribution for the ith neuron in the output layer w.r.t. the feature xj can be simply defined as: aL−1ij(x) = ∂fL−1i(x)/∂xj"
- Break condition: If the relationship between input features and output neurons is highly non-linear or if the gradients are unstable, neuron attribution may not accurately reflect feature importance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Dynamic sparse training (DST) algorithms like SET and RigL improve feature selection performance compared to dense networks.
- Mechanism: DST algorithms evolve the network's topology during training by dynamically updating the sparse connectivity. This process of adding and removing connections based on weight magnitude or gradient information allows the network to focus on the most relevant features, leading to improved feature selection.
- Core assumption: The DST algorithms effectively identify and retain the most important connections during training, resulting in a sparse network that captures the essential features.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our findings show that feature selection with SNNs trained with DST algorithms can achieve, on average, more than 50% memory and 55% FLOPs reduction compared to the dense networks, while outperforming them in terms of the quality of the selected features."
  - [section 2.3.1] "The goal of DST methods is to optimize the sparse connectivity of the network during training, without resorting to dense network matrices at any point [33, 32, 48]."
- Break condition: If the DST algorithms fail to effectively identify the most important connections or if the sparsity level is too high, feature selection performance may degrade.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Sparsity improves feature selection performance on most datasets.
- Mechanism: Sparsity reduces the complexity of the model, forcing it to focus on the most important features and reducing overfitting. This leads to improved feature selection performance, especially on high-dimensional datasets.
- Core assumption: The reduced model complexity from sparsity allows the model to better capture the underlying structure of the data and avoid overfitting.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our findings show that feature selection with SNNs trained with DST algorithms can achieve, on average, more than 50% memory and 55% FLOPs reduction compared to the dense networks, while outperforming them in terms of the quality of the selected features."
  - [section 4.2] "Comparing dense and sparse models, we consider Dense-Attr and SET-Attr. In Table 3a, we can observe that while on high-dimensional biological datasets and the noisy dataset (Madelon) Dense-Attr performs better, on the rest of the datasets (11 out of 18 datasets) SET-Attr excels the dense model."
- Break condition: If the sparsity level is too high or if the dataset is too noisy, sparsity may not improve feature selection performance.

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input layer -> Hidden layers (1000 neurons) -> Hidden layers (100 neurons) -> Output layer -> Feature importance calculation -> Top K feature selection -> SVM classifier

- Critical path:
  1. Initialize a sparse neural network with desired sparsity level
  2. Train the network using a DST algorithm (SET or RigL)
  3. Calculate feature importance using neuron attribution or neuron strength
  4. Select the top K features based on their importance scores
  5. Evaluate the feature selection performance using an SVM classifier

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Sparsity level: Higher sparsity reduces computational cost but may degrade performance
  - DST algorithm: SET and RigL have different approaches to updating sparse connectivity, leading to different performance characteristics
  - Feature importance metric: Neuron attribution and neuron strength have different advantages and disadvantages

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor feature selection performance: May indicate incorrect choice of sparsity level, DST algorithm, or feature importance metric
  - Unstable training: May indicate issues with the DST algorithm or learning rate
  - High computational cost: May indicate insufficient sparsity or inefficient implementation

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare the feature selection performance of dense and sparse models on a small dataset
  2. Evaluate the effect of different sparsity levels on feature selection performance
  3. Compare the performance of SET and RigL algorithms for training sparse neural networks

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the traditional sense, but several important questions emerge from the discussion:
- How do different neuron attribution methods (beyond gradient-based) compare in feature selection performance for sparse neural networks?
- What is the optimal strategy for updating neuron importance metrics during sparse training, and how does it affect feature selection quality?
- How does the choice of sparse neural network architecture (beyond two-layer MLPs) affect feature selection performance?
- How do sparse neural network-based feature selection methods perform on streaming data where feature distributions change over time?

## Limitations
- The comparison with dense models shows neuron attribution is better on 11/18 datasets, but the performance gap varies significantly across datasets
- The choice between SET and RigL appears dataset-dependent, with no clear theoretical guidance for selection
- The evaluation framework using SVM classifiers on selected features provides a proxy for feature quality but may not fully capture the downstream utility of the selected features
- The paper's findings rely heavily on neuron attribution gradients being stable and meaningful in sparse networks, which is not extensively validated

## Confidence
- High confidence: Claims about memory and FLOPs reduction from sparsity (>50% and >55% respectively) are well-supported by the experimental setup and theoretical calculations
- Medium confidence: Claims about neuron attribution outperforming neuron strength are supported by results but require further investigation into why this advantage varies across datasets
- Low confidence: Claims about DST algorithms universally improving feature selection are not fully supported, as performance depends heavily on dataset characteristics and optimal sparsity levels

## Next Checks
1. Verify gradient stability in sparse networks: Test neuron attribution calculations across different sparsity levels and network depths to ensure gradients remain meaningful for feature importance estimation
2. Conduct ablation on sparsity levels: Systematically evaluate feature selection performance at sparsity levels between the tested points (e.g., 0.30, 0.60, 0.70) to identify optimal operating points for different dataset types
3. Validate downstream utility: Test selected features on alternative downstream tasks beyond SVM classification to ensure the selected features generalize to different use cases
