# A Factor Graph Model of Trust for a Collaborative Multi-Agent System

## Quick Facts

- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07049

- Decentralized trust management system for multi-agent systems using factor graphs

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a decentralized trust management system for multi-agent systems using factor graphs to model agent behaviors and trust relationships. The approach models robot trajectories as Gaussian processes and incorporates trust-related factors (proximity safety, consistency, and transparency) alongside regular path planning factors. Trust is evaluated through Bayesian inference across a network of factor graphs. The method was validated in simulations and real-world experiments with autonomous vehicles navigating an unsignalized intersection.

## Method Summary
The system uses factor graphs to represent both geometric constraints (from robot trajectories) and trust-related factors. Each agent maintains its own factor graph that includes measurements from its sensors and observations of other agents' behaviors. Trust factors are incorporated as additional nodes in the graph, with proximity safety measuring distance between agents, consistency evaluating behavioral predictability, and transparency assessing information sharing quality. The system performs inference across the factor graph network to evaluate trust between agents, which then influences path planning decisions. The approach is decentralized, with each agent making its own trust assessments based on local observations and shared information.

## Key Results
- Safety performance improved significantly when trust factors were considered
- Minimum distance between agents increased from 0.22 m to 0.62 m with trust evaluation
- The factor graph approach successfully balanced safety constraints with efficient navigation in unsignalized intersection scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The factor graph approach works by creating a unified probabilistic framework that can simultaneously model both physical constraints (trajectory planning) and social constraints (trust relationships). By representing trust as factors in the same graph structure as geometric constraints, the system can perform joint inference that naturally balances safety and efficiency. The Gaussian process modeling of trajectories provides smooth, continuous representations that integrate well with the factor graph formulation. Bayesian inference across the graph network allows agents to update their trust assessments in real-time based on observed behaviors and shared information.

## Foundational Learning
- Factor graphs: A bipartite graph representation that factorizes a function into local factors, useful for probabilistic inference
- Gaussian processes: A non-parametric method for modeling distributions over functions, providing smooth trajectory representations
- Bayesian inference: The process of updating probability distributions based on observed evidence, central to trust evaluation
- Decentralized multi-agent systems: Architectures where agents make independent decisions based on local information and communication
- Path planning under uncertainty: Techniques for navigating when both agent intentions and environmental conditions are uncertain

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Factor Graph Network -> Trust Factor Nodes -> Bayesian Inference Engine -> Path Planning Module

### Critical Path
Observation Collection -> Factor Graph Construction -> Trust Factor Evaluation -> Bayesian Inference -> Trust-Aware Path Planning

### Design Tradeoffs
The system trades computational complexity for richer trust modeling by incorporating multiple trust factors. The decentralized approach sacrifices some global optimization potential for scalability and robustness to individual agent failures.

### Failure Signatures
- Trust assessments become overly conservative if proximity safety weights are too high
- Inconsistent trust evaluations across agents if transparency factor is poorly calibrated
- System instability if Gaussian process assumptions about trajectory smoothness are violated

### First Experiments
1. Test factor graph convergence time with increasing numbers of agents
2. Measure sensitivity of trust assessments to different weight combinations of trust factors
3. Validate Gaussian process trajectory modeling accuracy in highly dynamic environments

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited validation to only four autonomous vehicles in a single intersection scenario
- Real-world experiments restricted to two vehicles, raising scalability concerns
- Trust factors are hand-engineered rather than learned from data
- Gaussian process assumptions may not hold in highly dynamic or unpredictable environments

## Confidence

### High Confidence
- Mathematical formulation of factor graphs for trust modeling is sound

### Medium Confidence
- Safety improvements demonstrated in the specific intersection scenario

### Low Confidence
- Generalizability to heterogeneous agent populations and complex environments

## Next Checks

1. Test scalability with 10+ heterogeneous agents in multiple intersection scenarios to evaluate performance degradation
2. Conduct ablation studies removing individual trust factors to quantify their relative contributions
3. Implement adaptive trust factor weights that learn from interaction outcomes rather than using fixed weights
