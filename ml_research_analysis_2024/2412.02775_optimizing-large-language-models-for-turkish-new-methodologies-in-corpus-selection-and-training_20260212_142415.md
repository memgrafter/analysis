# Optimizing Large Language Models for Turkish: New Methodologies in Corpus Selection and Training

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.02775
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02775
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: Achieved state-of-the-art Turkish language model performance with 53.09% accuracy on ARC and 50.45% on HellaSwag using novel corpus selection and training methodologies

## Executive Summary
This study introduces novel corpus selection and training methodologies to enhance Turkish language models by adapting large language model-generated datasets and translated English datasets. Through careful dataset selection (SKWO, Stories, OpenOrca) and training of Llama3-8b, the models achieved state-of-the-art performance on Turkish few-shot tasks. Human evaluations confirmed superior performance across categories including logic, math, and creativity, with merged models reaching ELO scores of 1061. The research demonstrates that synthetic and translation datasets significantly improve performance for under-resourced languages, with enhancements in small-scale models effectively transferring to larger models.

## Method Summary
The methodology involves translating English datasets (Cosmopedia, OpenOrca) to Turkish using Google Translate API, combining SKWO (Stanford+Khan Academy+WikiHow+OpenStax), Stories, and OpenOrca datasets, and fine-tuning Llama3-8B with these datasets using 1 epoch, batch size 1 with gradient accumulation 512, learning rate 1e-6, gradient clipping 0.05, and 8-bit AdamW optimizer. Model merging was performed using linear combination of weights trained on different datasets. The approach was evaluated on Turkish-adapted few-shot datasets (HellaSwag, ARC) and through human evaluation using ELO scoring system.

## Key Results
- Achieved 53.09% accuracy on ARC and 50.45% on HellaSwag few-shot tasks
- Human evaluation ELO scores reached 1061 with win percentages of 56.36% in overall comparisons
- Model merging using linear combination of weights from different datasets improved performance across all evaluation categories
- Enhancements made in small-scale models effectively transferred to larger models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Synthetic datasets and translation datasets significantly improve performance for under-resourced languages like Turkish.
- Mechanism: These datasets expand available training data and provide additional context and examples that help the model better understand Turkish language nuances.
- Core assumption: Translated datasets maintain semantic meaning and context of original English datasets, and synthetic datasets are relevant for Turkish.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "This study introduces novel corpus selection and training methodologies to enhance Turkish language models by adapting large language model-generated datasets and translated English datasets."
- Break condition: If translated datasets introduce significant semantic drift or synthetic datasets are not representative of Turkish language, performance gains may not materialize.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Merging models trained on different datasets can lead to performance improvements.
- Mechanism: Combining strengths of different models allows the merged model to leverage broader knowledge and capabilities.
- Core assumption: Models being merged have complementary strengths without conflicting knowledge.
- Evidence anchors: [section] "Model merging is an important technique that has emerged recently... In this technique, the weights of models trained with different data sets with the same architecture can be combined with different techniques."
- Break condition: If models being merged have significant conflicts in learned representations, merged model may perform worse than individual models.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Enhancements made in small-scale models can effectively transfer to larger models.
- Mechanism: Knowledge and improvements learned by smaller model can be scaled up to larger model, leading to performance gains without extensive retraining.
- Core assumption: Larger model has similar architecture and is trained on similar dataset to smaller model.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "The research demonstrates that synthetic and translation datasets significantly improve performance for under-resourced languages, with enhancements in small-scale models effectively transferring to larger models."
- Break condition: If larger model has significantly different architecture or vastly different dataset, transfer of knowledge may not be effective.

  - Quick check question: What are some common model merging techniques used in machine learning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing -> Model training -> Model merging -> Evaluation
- Critical path: Translate and preprocess datasets -> Train smaller models on selected datasets -> Evaluate smaller models on few-shot tasks -> Train larger models on full datasets -> Merge models using linear merging -> Evaluate merged models on few-shot and zero-shot tasks
- Design tradeoffs: Smaller models are faster to train but may not capture all nuances of language; larger models have more capacity but require more computational resources; model merging can improve performance but may introduce conflicts between models
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on few-shot tasks may indicate issues with dataset selection or model architecture; inconsistent results across different evaluation tasks may suggest overfitting or lack of generalization; unexpected drops in performance after model merging may indicate conflicts between merged models
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train a small model on a single dataset (e.g., SKWO) and evaluate its performance on few-shot tasks.
  2. Train a small model on multiple datasets (e.g., SKWO, Stories, OpenOrca) and compare its performance to the single-dataset model.
  3. Train a larger model on the full dataset and compare its performance to the best small model.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do synthetic datasets compare to real-world Turkish datasets in terms of improving language model performance on specialized domains like medicine or law?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses significant potential of synthetic datasets for languages with limited data sources but does not explore domain-specific applications.
- Why unresolved: Study focuses on general Turkish language tasks without evaluating effectiveness of synthetic datasets in specialized domains where data scarcity is even more pronounced.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies measuring model performance on specialized Turkish datasets before and after incorporating domain-specific synthetic data would clarify their impact.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the long-term scalability of model merging techniques when applied to larger Turkish language models with parameters exceeding 10 billion?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper successfully applies model merging to 8-billion-parameter models but does not address its effectiveness on significantly larger models.
- Why unresolved: Study's findings are limited to relatively small models, and computational and methodological challenges of scaling model merging to larger architectures remain unexplored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical testing of model merging techniques on Turkish models with 10+ billion parameters, measuring performance gains and computational efficiency.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does performance of Turkish language models change when using synthetic datasets generated by different base models (e.g., GPT-4 vs. Llama3)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Study uses datasets generated by specific models but does not compare impact of using synthetic data from different base models.
- Why unresolved: Quality and style of synthetic data can vary significantly depending on base model, potentially affecting downstream model performance in ways not yet quantified.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments training Turkish models with synthetic datasets generated by different base models and comparing their performance across multiple benchmarks.

## Limitations

- Translation quality control and linguistic validation of Google Translate API outputs are not explicitly detailed, introducing uncertainty about semantic preservation.
- Focus on specific datasets (SKWO, Stories, OpenOrca) and Llama3-8B architecture limits generalizability to other datasets or model architectures.
- Human evaluation relies on subjective assessments that may introduce bias, and ELO scoring system reliability for this application is not independently validated.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Core finding that synthetic and translated datasets improve Turkish language model performance is well-supported by quantitative results (53.09% on ARC, 50.45% on HellaSwag) and human evaluation metrics (ELO scores of 1061).

**Medium Confidence**: Claim that enhancements in small-scale models effectively transfer to larger models is supported by results but would benefit from additional experiments across different model scales and architectures.

**Low Confidence**: Assertion that improvements are specifically due to novel corpus selection methodology rather than general fine-tuning effects or dataset quantity increases requires further investigation, as study does not include ablation experiments isolating impact of different dataset components.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct systematic linguistic evaluation of translated datasets to verify semantic preservation and identify potential translation artifacts that could influence model performance.

2. Test the same corpus selection methodology with different model architectures (e.g., Mistral, GPT-Neo) to determine if performance improvements are architecture-dependent or generalizable.

3. Perform ablation studies isolating the contribution of each dataset component (SKWO, Stories, OpenOrca) to quantify their individual and combined effects on model performance, separating impact of dataset quantity from quality.
