# Model Interpretation and Explainability: Towards Creating Transparency in Prediction Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.20794
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20794
- Authors: Donald Kridel; Jacob Dineen; Daniel Dolk; David Castillo

- Primary result: Comparison of four prediction models (logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, neural network) with explainability techniques (SKLearn, LIME, SHAP, GAM) on Lending Club loan data reveals inconsistency between static and dynamic feature importance

## Executive Summary
This study examines model explainability for prediction models using Lending Club loan data, comparing four different prediction models and applying four explainability techniques to assess feature importance. The research reveals significant inconsistency between static feature importance rankings and dynamic prediction scenarios, highlighting the complexity of creating truly transparent models. The authors propose an Explainability Decision Support System for decision-makers and identify the need for further research on feature importance incongruence between prediction and base cases.

## Method Summary
The study employs a comparative analysis approach using Lending Club loan data to evaluate four prediction models: logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, and neural network. Each model is paired with explainability techniques including SKLearn's built-in methods, LIME, SHAP, and GAM. The methodology involves training models on historical loan data, applying explainability techniques to extract feature importance rankings, and comparing these rankings across both static baseline scenarios and dynamic prediction scenarios. The analysis focuses on identifying discrepancies between feature importance rankings and their practical utility for decision-making.

## Key Results
- Significant inconsistency observed between static feature importance and dynamic prediction scenarios across all models and explainability techniques
- SHAP and GAM techniques provide more intuitive feature rankings but face limitations in practical real-world decision-making applications
- The study demonstrates that traditional feature importance metrics may not translate effectively to actual prediction scenarios
- Proposes an Explainability Decision Support System as a framework for improving model transparency for end-users

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The research methodology effectively captures the gap between theoretical model interpretability and practical decision-making utility by systematically comparing multiple model types with various explainability techniques across different scenario types. This comprehensive approach reveals that feature importance metrics, while useful for understanding model behavior, may not provide reliable guidance for real-world decisions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Model Interpretability vs Explainability**: Understanding the distinction between interpreting model internals and explaining predictions to stakeholders (why needed: different audiences require different levels of technical detail; quick check: can a loan officer understand the explanation without ML background?)
- **Feature Importance Consistency**: The reliability of feature rankings across different model states and prediction scenarios (why needed: inconsistent rankings undermine trust in model decisions; quick check: do feature rankings change significantly between training and prediction phases?)
- **Static vs Dynamic Analysis**: The difference between baseline model behavior and prediction-specific explanations (why needed: real-world decisions occur in dynamic contexts; quick check: does feature importance shift when input variables change?)
- **Decision Support Systems**: Frameworks for translating model outputs into actionable insights (why needed: models must serve practical business needs; quick check: does the DSS reduce decision time while maintaining accuracy?)
- **Model Comparison Methodology**: Systematic evaluation of different prediction algorithms and their explainability characteristics (why needed: no single model or technique dominates all scenarios; quick check: does the comparison reveal clear performance tradeoffs?)
- **Real-World Validation**: The necessity of testing explainability techniques in actual operational contexts (why needed: academic metrics may not reflect practical utility; quick check: do explanations improve actual loan approval decisions?)

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Data -> Preprocessing -> Model Training -> Prediction -> Explainability Technique -> Feature Importance Ranking -> DSS Output

Critical Path: The most critical path runs from Model Training through Explainability Technique to Feature Importance Ranking, as this determines the quality and reliability of insights provided to decision-makers.

Design Tradeoffs: The study balances model complexity (neural networks offering highest accuracy but lowest interpretability) against explainability needs, with simpler models like logistic regression providing clearer but potentially less accurate explanations.

Failure Signatures: Inconsistent feature importance rankings between static and dynamic scenarios indicate model behavior that may not align with business logic or stakeholder expectations.

First Experiments:
1. Apply the same methodology to a different lending dataset to test generalizability
2. Conduct user studies with loan officers to evaluate DSS effectiveness
3. Test temporal stability by applying models to subsequent loan cohorts

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Analysis limited to single Lending Club dataset, constraining generalizability to other domains
- Focus on feature importance rankings without deeper validation of practical utility in real-world decision contexts
- No external validation across diverse datasets to confirm findings
- Limited exploration of temporal stability in feature importance rankings

## Confidence
- High confidence in the observation of inconsistency between static and dynamic feature importance due to clear empirical demonstration
- Medium confidence in claims about technique performance differences, as study demonstrates methodological rigor but lacks external validation
- Low confidence in claims about practical utility of SHAP and GAM for decision-makers, as study does not provide concrete evidence of effectiveness in actual lending decisions

## Next Checks
1. Test the explainability techniques across multiple datasets from different domains to assess generalizability
2. Conduct user studies with actual decision-makers to evaluate whether the generated explanations improve loan approval decisions
3. Perform temporal validation by applying the same models to subsequent Lending Club loan cohorts to assess stability of feature importance rankings over time
