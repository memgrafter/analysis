# Enhancing Activity Recognition After Stroke: Generative Adversarial Networks for Kinematic Data Augmentation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.09451
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09451
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: GAN-based augmentation improved stroke activity classification accuracy from 63.1% to 80.2%

## Executive Summary
This study addresses the challenge of limited and heterogeneous data for wearable monitoring in stroke rehabilitation, which constrains the generalizability of machine learning models. To overcome this, the authors employed Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) to generate synthetic kinematic data that mimics the reaching movements of stroke survivors. The cGAN was trained on a publicly available dataset of upper extremity movements, producing realistic synthetic data that captures complex temporal dynamics and common post-stroke movement patterns. The synthetic data were used to augment the training set for a fully convolutional network (FCN) tasked with classifying 10 different upper limb tasks across three impairment levels.

## Method Summary
The authors implemented a conditional GAN with spectral loss and minibatch discrimination to generate synthetic kinematic trajectories for stroke rehabilitation activity recognition. The GAN was trained on a publicly available dataset of upper extremity movements from stroke survivors and healthy controls. The synthetic data were used to augment the training set for a fully convolutional network classifier. Five-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate performance, comparing models trained on real data alone versus models trained on real plus synthetic data. The approach significantly improved classification accuracy from 63.1% to 80.2%.

## Key Results
- GAN-based augmentation improved stroke activity classification accuracy from 63.1% to 80.2%
- Synthetic data captured complex temporal dynamics and common post-stroke movement patterns
- Classification improvements were consistent across 10 tasks and 3 impairment levels

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Synthetic data augmentation with cGANs improves classification accuracy by expanding the representation of movement variability.
- Mechanism: cGANs generate synthetic kinematic trajectories that preserve task- and impairment-specific characteristics, effectively increasing the size and diversity of the training set without requiring additional patient data collection.
- Core assumption: The synthetic data closely mimic the statistical properties and temporal dynamics of real post-stroke movements.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "This approach not only captures the complex temporal dynamics and common movement patterns after stroke, but also significantly enhances the training dataset." [section] "The synthetic data not only replicate the dynamics of post-stroke patient movements accurately but also enrich the training dataset, potentially reducing the reliance on extensive experimental data collection."
- Break condition: If the synthetic data fail to preserve critical spatiotemporal features, the augmented model will overfit to unrealistic patterns and performance will degrade.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The conditional GAN framework allows generation of task- and impairment-specific synthetic samples, improving classifier generalization across heterogeneous patient populations.
- Mechanism: Class labels are provided as inputs to both generator and discriminator, ensuring that synthetic samples are conditioned on specific task and impairment level combinations.
- Core assumption: The cGAN can learn to disentangle task-specific and impairment-specific features from the input data distribution.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "we implemented a Conditional GAN (cGAN). In a cGAN, class labels are provided as additional inputs to both the generator and discriminator [45]." [section] "Given the classification needs of our study, which involve replicating multiple task/impairment categories, we implemented a Conditional GAN (cGAN)."
- Break condition: If the class conditioning is insufficient, the generator may produce samples that do not respect the target task-impairment mapping, leading to noisy or misleading training data.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Spectral loss and minibatch discrimination stabilize GAN training and improve the realism of synthetic trajectories.
- Mechanism: Spectral loss minimizes differences in frequency content between real and synthetic signals; minibatch discrimination encourages diversity in generated samples, reducing mode collapse.
- Core assumption: Post-stroke kinematic data have characteristic spectral properties that can be captured and reproduced by the GAN.
- Evidence anchors: [section] "To address this, the standard cGAN architecture was modified to include a spectral loss function... Additionally, a minibatch discriminator was implemented in training to ensure that the outputs from the generator were diverse, thereby addressing instances of mode collapse." [abstract] No explicit mention of spectral loss or minibatch discrimination.
- Break condition: If the spectral loss over-constrains the generator, it may fail to capture important high-frequency movement features, reducing the utility of synthetic data for classification.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
  - Why needed here: GANs provide a framework to synthesize realistic kinematic data that preserves the statistical and temporal properties of post-stroke movements.
  - Quick check question: What are the roles of the generator and discriminator in a GAN, and how do they interact during training?

- Concept: Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs)
  - Why needed here: cGANs allow generation of class-conditional samples, which is essential for creating synthetic data that matches specific tasks and impairment levels in stroke rehabilitation.
  - Quick check question: How does providing class labels to both the generator and discriminator change the behavior of the GAN compared to an unconditional GAN?

- Concept: Data Augmentation for Imbalanced Datasets
  - Why needed here: Stroke kinematic datasets are often small and imbalanced across impairment levels; augmentation with synthetic data can help the classifier learn robust features across all categories.
  - Quick check question: What are the risks of augmenting a small dataset with synthetic data, and how can they be mitigated?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw kinematic data -> Data preprocessing (normalization, cropping) -> cGAN (generator + discriminator + spectral loss + minibatch discrimination) -> Synthetic data generation -> FCN classifier (1D convolutions + pooling + dense layers + softmax) -> Classification output

- Critical path: 1. Preprocess real kinematic data (normalize, fix length) -> 2. Train cGAN on real data with class conditioning and spectral loss -> 3. Generate synthetic dataset equal in size to real dataset -> 4. Train FCN on (real + synthetic) data -> 5. Evaluate FCN performance on held-out real data

- Design tradeoffs: Using synthetic vs. statistical augmentation: GANs can capture complex temporal dynamics but are harder to train and validate; Spectral loss: Improves frequency matching but may suppress important high-frequency features; Fixed trajectory length: Simplifies model input but may truncate or pad important movement segments

- Failure signatures: Generator collapse (mode collapse): Synthetic samples become repetitive or unrealistic; Spectral mismatch: Synthetic data have unrealistic frequency content, leading to poor classifier generalization; Overfitting to synthetic data: Model performs well on synthetic but poorly on real test data

- First 3 experiments: 1. Train cGAN on real data; generate synthetic samples; visualize t-SNE plots to check clustering by task/impairment -> 2. Train FCN on real data only; record baseline accuracy; compare to model trained on augmented dataset -> 3. Perform ablation: remove spectral loss or minibatch discrimination; assess impact on synthetic realism and classification performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the realism of GAN-generated synthetic data compare to real kinematic data across different stroke impairment levels when assessed with quantitative spatiotemporal parameters?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that while qualitative analysis shows synthetic data follows real movement trends, quantitative parameters like spectral arc length, velocity peaks, and trunk displacement were not directly measured against synthetic data.
- Why unresolved: The study relied on visual and t-SNE-based assessments, which may not capture subtle differences in movement patterns critical for rehabilitation applications.
- What evidence would resolve it: Direct quantitative comparison of real vs. synthetic data using established kinematic parameters for stroke movement assessment.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the GAN approach be adapted to generate realistic IMU signal data that is more commonly used in wearable stroke rehabilitation systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly state that their current focus on kinematic trajectories rather than IMU signals is a limitation and that future work will explore adapting the methods to IMU signals.
- Why unresolved: The current GAN model was trained on kinematic data from a specific motion capture system, and it is unclear if the approach will generalize to different sensor modalities.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful generation of realistic synthetic IMU data that improves classification performance when used to augment training sets.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of GAN-based data augmentation compare to traditional statistical augmentation techniques (e.g., rotation, time-warping) for activity recognition in stroke rehabilitation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that traditional augmentation methods have shown some benefits but often fail to produce realistic training examples, and they suggest a systematic comparison of generative and traditional methods.
- Why unresolved: The study only evaluates the impact of GAN-based augmentation and does not directly compare it to other augmentation approaches.
- What evidence would resolve it: Head-to-head comparison of GAN-based augmentation with traditional methods on the same classification task, measuring improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores.

## Limitations

- Relies on a single publicly available dataset, limiting generalizability to other recording setups or patient populations
- cGAN architecture and training hyperparameters are not fully specified, making exact reproduction challenging
- Improvement from 63.1% to 80.2% accuracy is based on a specific classifier (FCN) and dataset, may not generalize to other models or cohorts

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The conceptual framework of using GANs for data augmentation in activity recognition, and the basic methodology of training cGANs on kinematic data.
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of the specific augmentation strategy (125% synthetic data, spectral loss, minibatch discrimination) in improving classifier performance on the Schwarz et al. dataset.
- **Low confidence**: The generalizability of the results to other datasets, classifier architectures, or real-world clinical deployment scenarios.

## Next Checks

1. Cross-dataset validation: Test the cGAN-based augmentation approach on a different stroke kinematic dataset to assess robustness and generalizability.
2. Ablation study: Systematically remove or modify key GAN components (spectral loss, minibatch discrimination, class conditioning) to quantify their individual contributions to classification improvement.
3. Clinical scenario testing: Evaluate the augmented model on a held-out set of real patient data collected in a realistic clinical setting, focusing on sensitivity to impairment severity and task misclassification rates.
