# Unpaired Modality Translation for Pseudo Labeling of Histology Images

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.02858
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02858
- Reference count: 0
- Achieves Dice scores of 0.736 for axons and 0.652 for myelin on SEM dataset using pseudo labeling approach

## Executive Summary
This work addresses the challenge of segmenting histology images in the absence of annotated data for target imaging modalities. The authors propose a pseudo labeling pipeline that leverages unsupervised image translation to generate high-quality labels for unlabeled histology datasets. Using an adversarial diffusion model (SynDiff), they translate between labeled and unlabeled domains without requiring prior annotations in the target domain. The method is tested across three increasingly challenging target datasets (TEM-MACAQUE, SEM, and bright-field imaging) using TEM as the labeled dataset.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a pseudo labeling pipeline that uses unsupervised image translation to generate high-quality labels for unlabeled histology datasets. The approach employs an adversarial diffusion model (SynDiff) to translate between labeled and unlabeled domains without requiring prior annotations in the target domain. Two pseudo labeling strategies are evaluated: tutoring path (training a segmentation model on synthetic data created by translating the labeled dataset to the target modality) and adaptive path (translating unlabeled images to match the labeled data distribution for segmentation with a pre-trained model). The method is tested across three increasingly challenging target datasets using TEM as the labeled dataset.

## Key Results
- Tutoring path achieves Dice score of 0.736±0.005 for axons on SEM dataset
- Tutoring path achieves Dice score of 0.652±0.005 for myelin on SEM dataset
- Both pseudo labeling strategies outperform training on labeled data alone across all target modalities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by bridging the domain gap between labeled and unlabeled histology datasets through unsupervised image translation. The SynDiff model learns to translate images between domains while preserving anatomical structures, enabling the generation of synthetic training data or adaptation of unlabeled images for segmentation. The tutoring path leverages the translated synthetic data to train a segmentation model that learns the target domain characteristics, while the adaptive path adjusts unlabeled images to match the labeled distribution for segmentation with a pre-trained model.

## Foundational Learning
- **Adversarial Diffusion Models**: Generative models that use adversarial training combined with diffusion processes to create realistic synthetic images. Needed for high-quality cross-domain image translation in histology. Quick check: Verify the model can generate realistic histology images that preserve tissue structures.
- **Domain Adaptation**: Techniques for adapting models trained on one domain to work effectively on another. Essential for handling the modality shift between different histology imaging techniques. Quick check: Test segmentation performance when directly applying a model trained on one modality to another without adaptation.
- **Pseudo Labeling**: Using model predictions on unlabeled data as training labels. Critical for leveraging unlabeled histology datasets to improve segmentation performance. Quick check: Compare segmentation performance using ground truth labels versus pseudo labels.
- **Multi-modal Histology**: Understanding the characteristics and challenges of different histology imaging modalities (TEM, SEM, bright-field). Necessary for evaluating the method's cross-modal generalization. Quick check: Assess performance degradation when moving from TEM to more challenging modalities like bright-field imaging.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
SynDiff translation model -> Segmentation model (nnU-Net) -> Performance evaluation

### Critical Path
1. SynDiff translates labeled TEM images to target modality distribution (tutoring path) or unlabeled target images to TEM distribution (adaptive path)
2. Segmentation model is either trained on translated synthetic data (tutoring) or applied to translated unlabeled images (adaptive)
3. Performance is evaluated using Dice scores on target dataset ground truth

### Design Tradeoffs
- **Translation quality vs. computational cost**: Higher quality translations require more training iterations and computational resources but yield better pseudo labels
- **Tutoring vs. adaptive paths**: Tutoring path requires retraining the segmentation model but may better capture target domain characteristics; adaptive path is faster but relies on pre-trained model generalization
- **Synthetic data generation vs. direct adaptation**: Generating synthetic training data (tutoring) provides more control over the training process but requires additional model training; direct adaptation (adaptive) is simpler but may be limited by pre-trained model performance

### Failure Signatures
- Poor translation quality resulting in anatomically implausible synthetic images
- Segmentation model overfitting to artifacts introduced during translation
- Significant performance drop when moving to more challenging target modalities (e.g., bright-field imaging)
- Inconsistent pseudo labels due to translation instability or mode collapse

### 3 First Experiments
1. Test SynDiff translation quality by visually inspecting synthetic images and comparing structural preservation with ground truth
2. Evaluate baseline segmentation performance on TEM dataset without any pseudo labeling to establish performance ceiling
3. Compare tutoring and adaptive path performance on the SEM dataset to identify which strategy works better for this modality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Under what specific conditions does the tutoring path consistently outperform the adaptive path in pseudo labeling histology images?
- Basis in paper: The authors observe that "it is plausible that the performance is contingent on the efficacy of the translation model in either the adapting U→L or tutoring L→U direction" but do not provide definitive criteria for when each strategy is optimal.
- Why unresolved: The paper only provides qualitative observations about when each strategy might work better but lacks quantitative metrics or systematic analysis to determine the conditions that favor one approach over the other.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying factors like domain similarity, translation quality metrics, and segmentation performance across multiple datasets to establish clear decision boundaries for choosing between tutoring and adaptive paths.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How much manual annotation time is actually saved by using the pseudo labels generated through this method, and what is the optimal human-in-the-loop workflow for refining these labels?
- Basis in paper: The authors claim "a Dice score superior to 0.5 goes a long way, reducing the annotation time by 25%-50%" but acknowledge this should be "further quantified in future works" and provide no empirical data on actual time savings.
- Why unresolved: The paper lacks empirical studies measuring the actual time savings or comparing different refinement workflows for using the pseudo labels as starting points for manual annotation.
- What evidence would resolve it: User studies comparing annotation times and quality when starting from scratch versus using pseudo labels, along with analysis of different refinement strategies (e.g., correcting entire images vs. regions, automated vs. manual correction).

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of this pseudo labeling approach scale with larger, more diverse histology datasets and across different segmentation architectures beyond nnU-Net?
- Basis in paper: The authors note they evaluated their pipeline on "three increasingly challenging target datasets" but all experiments used nnU-Net and relatively small datasets, limiting generalizability.
- Why unresolved: The experiments were limited to specific datasets and a single segmentation architecture, leaving questions about scalability and performance with larger datasets or different segmentation models.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments testing the pipeline with larger histology datasets, multiple segmentation architectures (e.g., transformers, attention-based models), and different evaluation metrics to establish scalability and generalizability across diverse scenarios.

## Limitations
- Performance is highly dependent on the quality of the unsupervised image translation model (SynDiff) to bridge domain gaps
- Method's effectiveness on histology datasets with extreme domain shifts or novel imaging modalities remains unknown
- All experiments used a single segmentation architecture (nnU-Net), limiting generalizability to other architectures

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The tutoring path strategy achieves measurable improvements in segmentation performance when using translated synthetic data for training.
- **Medium confidence**: The overall framework provides a viable solution for pseudo labeling in histology segmentation tasks, but with performance variability across different target modalities.
- **Low confidence**: The method's effectiveness on histology datasets with extreme domain shifts or novel imaging modalities not represented in the current evaluation.

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate the approach on additional histology modalities (e.g., fluorescence, multiphoton microscopy) to assess cross-modal generalization beyond the current three datasets.
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the impact of translation quality on pseudo label accuracy by comparing segmentation performance using ground truth labels versus pseudo labels.
3. Test the method's robustness to label noise by intentionally degrading the quality of pseudo labels and measuring the resulting segmentation performance degradation.
