core_contribution: This work proposes using Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to capture and
  anticipate user intents in data analytics workflows. The KG integrates user information
  (intents, constraints, feedback) with analytical artifacts (datasets, algorithms,
  workflows) and is populated using existing ontologies (DMOP, Person) and workflow
  data from AutoML tools.

# Capturing and Anticipating User Intents in Data Analytics via Knowledge Graphs

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.01023
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01023
- Reference count: 38
- Proposes using Knowledge Graphs to capture and anticipate user intents in data analytics workflows

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach for capturing and anticipating user intents in data analytics using Knowledge Graphs (KGs). The method integrates user information (intents, constraints, feedback) with analytical artifacts (datasets, algorithms, workflows) using existing ontologies (DMOP, Person) and workflow data from AutoML tools. Two recommendation methods are explored: predefined SPARQL queries and knowledge graph embeddings with link prediction for structure-aware recommendations.

The approach demonstrates reasonable performance with TransH embeddings achieving a Hits@3 score of 0.5727 after hyperparameter tuning. A prototype implementation shows the system providing sensible recommendations validated by domain experts. While the technical implementation is sound, the real-world applicability across diverse analytics domains remains to be verified through comprehensive user studies.

## Method Summary
The method employs Knowledge Graphs to capture user intents and analytics artifacts, integrating existing ontologies (DMOP, Person) with AutoML workflow data. Two recommendation approaches are developed: (1) predefined SPARQL queries for knowledge extraction, and (2) knowledge graph embeddings with link prediction for flexible, structure-aware recommendations. The KG is populated with user actions, constraints, feedback, and analytical artifacts. Experiments using PyKEEN demonstrate that TransH embeddings best capture the KG structure. The prototype implementation provides recommendations through an AutoML interface, validated by domain expert assessment.

## Key Results
- TransH embeddings achieve a Hits@3 score of 0.5727 after hyperparameter tuning
- Knowledge graph embeddings outperform SPARQL-based queries for flexible recommendations
- Prototype implementation demonstrates sensible recommendations in AutoML interface

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach leverages the structured nature of knowledge graphs to capture complex relationships between users, their intents, and analytical artifacts. By encoding both user behavior and analytical components into a unified graph structure, the system can identify patterns and relationships that traditional recommendation systems might miss. The use of link prediction through graph embeddings allows the system to generalize from existing knowledge and anticipate user needs based on structural similarities rather than just direct matches.

## Foundational Learning
- Knowledge Graph Embeddings (why needed: to capture complex relationships in data; quick check: measure Hits@k scores on link prediction tasks)
- AutoML Workflows (why needed: to understand analytical patterns; quick check: validate against known workflow sequences)
- Ontology Integration (why needed: to structure domain knowledge; quick check: ensure consistent inference across SPARQL queries)
- Link Prediction (why needed: to anticipate user needs; quick check: compare against baseline collaborative filtering)
- TransH Embeddings (why needed: to handle hierarchical relationships; quick check: verify against TransE and DistMult baselines)
- SPARQL Query Optimization (why needed: for interpretable recommendations; quick check: measure query response times)

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
KG Population -> SPARQL Queries / TransH Embeddings -> Recommendation Engine -> AutoML Interface

**Critical Path:**
User Action Capture → KG Update → Embedding Model Prediction → Recommendation Generation → User Interface Display

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- SPARQL queries provide interpretability but lack flexibility
- Graph embeddings offer flexibility but sacrifice interpretability
- Ontology-based structure ensures consistency but may limit domain coverage
- Link prediction enables anticipation but requires sufficient training data

**Failure Signatures:**
- Low Hits@k scores indicate poor embedding quality
- Slow query response suggests optimization needs
- Inconsistent recommendations point to KG population issues
- High false positives suggest overfitting to training data

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Measure baseline recommendation accuracy using traditional collaborative filtering
2. Compare TransH, TransE, and DistMult embedding performance on the KG
3. Validate SPARQL query coverage against domain expert requirements

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies heavily on expert assessment rather than comprehensive user studies
- Knowledge graph construction depends on existing ontologies that may not generalize to all analytics contexts
- SPARQL-based approach may be too rigid for complex user scenarios
- Real-world applicability across diverse analytics domains remains unverified

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Technical implementation of KG embeddings and TransH model performance metrics
- **Medium confidence**: Feasibility of KG approach for intent capture in AutoML contexts
- **Low confidence**: Real-world effectiveness across diverse user groups and analytics scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Conduct user studies with diverse analytics practitioners to evaluate recommendation quality and intent prediction accuracy in real-world workflows
2. Test the approach across multiple AutoML platforms and data analytics tools to verify generalizability
3. Implement A/B testing comparing KG-based recommendations against traditional rule-based or collaborative filtering approaches
