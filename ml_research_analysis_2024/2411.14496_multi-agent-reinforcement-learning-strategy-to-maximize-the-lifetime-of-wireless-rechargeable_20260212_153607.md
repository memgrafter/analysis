# Multi-agent reinforcement learning strategy to maximize the lifetime of Wireless Rechargeable

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.14496
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14496
- Authors: Bao Nguyen
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Proposes AMAPPO algorithm achieving up to 3.13x network lifetime improvement for 50-target networks

## Executive Summary
This thesis presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for maximizing the lifetime of Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs) using multiple mobile chargers. The approach introduces a novel Decentralized Partially Observable Semi-Markov Decision Process (Dec-POSMDP) formulation with asynchronous decision-making, allowing mobile chargers to operate independently while maintaining effective cooperation. A U-net based actor model generates probability maps of optimal charging locations, which are then optimized to determine precise charging actions. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art approaches, with the proposed AMAPPO algorithm achieving up to 3.13x network lifetime improvement for networks with 50 targets.

## Method Summary
The method formulates the multi-charger coordination problem as a Dec-POSMDP with asynchronous time steps, where each mobile charger maintains its own experience buffer and makes decisions independently. The actor model uses a U-net architecture to generate probability maps representing optimal charging locations across the network area, which are then processed by an optimization algorithm to determine specific charging points and durations. The critic model employs a CNN architecture for value estimation. The framework includes a custom Simpy-based simulator implementing energy consumption models and sensor placement strategies. The approach is trained on a 50-target Hanoi network instance and evaluated on 9 different network scenarios based on Vietnamese geographical data.

## Key Results
- AMAPPO achieves up to 3.13x network lifetime improvement for 50-target networks compared to baseline approaches
- The proposed method outperforms PPO, IPPO, and DTCM baselines across all tested network configurations
- The framework demonstrates generalization capability, performing well on networks with 50-200 targets without requiring extensive retraining

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The asynchronous multi-agent sampling mechanism enables effective cooperation between mobile chargers without requiring synchronized decision-making.
- Mechanism: Each mobile charger maintains its own buffer and can make decisions while others are still executing their macro actions, allowing continuous operation and preventing idle waiting.
- Core assumption: The network dynamics remain stable enough that asynchronous decisions don't lead to conflicting charging strategies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "An Asynchronous Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (AMAPPO) algorithm is proposed to solve this Dec-POSMDP model."
  - [section 4.1]: "Each MC maintains its own buffer, which includes frames, each containing the observation at the start of the previous macro action oi−1, the previous macro action ui−1, the reward ri−1, and the observation at the end of the previous macro action oi."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no direct corpus matches for asynchronous sampling mechanisms.
- Break condition: If the charging demand patterns are highly dynamic, asynchronous decisions could lead to inefficient resource allocation or charging collisions.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The U-net based actor model effectively identifies optimal charging locations through probability map generation and subsequent optimization.
- Mechanism: The U-net outputs a probability map where high values indicate likely optimal charging locations, then an optimization algorithm finds the precise charging point that maximizes energy delivery to critical sensors.
- Core assumption: The probability map accurately reflects the charging needs and spatial distribution of sensors requiring energy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 4.4]: "The thesis proposes an alternative approach utilizing the U-net architecture... to generate a map of visiting probabilities across the area of interest."
  - [section 4.4]: "Subsequently, an optimizing algorithm is employed to identify the charging points surrounding the areas with the highest probability."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus focuses on different applications of U-net and RL but not specifically for WRSN charging location optimization.
- Break condition: If the sensor distribution changes rapidly or if charging patterns are non-stationary, the probability map may become outdated and lead to suboptimal charging decisions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The Dec-POSMDP formulation with four-component observation space enables generalization across different network topologies without retraining.
- Mechanism: The observation space uses four 2D Gaussian kernel functions to encode sensor energy states, mobile charger positions, and coordination information, allowing the same model to adapt to different network sizes and configurations.
- Core assumption: The 2D Gaussian representation captures sufficient information about network state for effective decision-making across diverse topologies.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The proposal allows reinforcement algorithms to be applied to different networks without requiring extensive retraining."
  - [section 3.2]: "The thesis proposes a novel approach to designing the observation for MC so that RL algorithms trained in this designed environment can adapt to the deviation of network scenarios."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus contains general RL applications but not specific evidence for Dec-POSMDP generalization in WRSNs.
- Break condition: If the network topology changes too dramatically (e.g., from sparse to dense sensor distribution), the fixed observation representation may not capture critical state information.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Markov Decision Process (MDP)
  - Why needed here: The charging problem is modeled as an MDP where mobile chargers must make sequential decisions to maximize network lifetime.
  - Quick check question: What are the five components of an MDP tuple (S, A, P, R, γ) and how do they apply to the charging problem?

- Concept: Reinforcement Learning Policy Optimization
  - Why needed here: The AMAPPO algorithm uses policy optimization to learn effective charging strategies without explicit programming.
  - Quick check question: How does the clipped surrogate objective in PPO prevent large policy updates that could destabilize learning?

- Concept: Convolutional Neural Networks for Spatial Data
  - Why needed here: The actor and critic models process 2D observation maps representing the spatial distribution of sensors and chargers.
  - Quick check question: Why are convolutional layers particularly suited for processing the 2D observation maps in this application?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Environment simulator (Simpy-based) -> Dec-POSMDP formulation with asynchronous time steps -> AMAPPO algorithm (modified PPO) -> U-net actor network for probability map generation -> CNN critic network for value estimation -> Optimization module for converting probability maps to charging locations

- Critical path:
  1. Generate observation from network state
  2. Process through U-net actor to get probability map
  3. Optimize probability map to determine charging location and duration
  4. Execute macro action and collect reward
  5. Store experience in buffer and update networks

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Asynchronous vs synchronous decision-making: Asynchronous allows continuous operation but requires careful buffer management
  - Probability map vs direct action prediction: Probability map approach enables better exploration but adds optimization overhead
  - Fixed vs adaptive observation resolution: Fixed resolution simplifies training but may limit scalability

- Failure signatures:
  - Oscillating network lifetime improvement during training indicates poor critic updates
  - Stagnant performance around 1.0 suggests observation space is missing critical information
  - Large drops in performance indicate exploration-exploitation balance issues

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate observation space encoding by checking if critical sensor information is captured in the probability maps
  2. Test the optimization module independently by providing known probability maps and verifying it finds optimal charging locations
  3. Compare synchronous vs asynchronous sampling on a simple network to quantify performance benefits

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How does the proposed AMAPPO algorithm perform in scenarios with dynamic changes in the number of mobile chargers, such as when chargers are added or removed during network operation?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions a lack of investigation into system flexibility when the number of mobile chargers is dynamically changed.
  - Why unresolved: The paper does not provide experimental results or analysis on how the algorithm adapts to changes in the number of agents.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing AMAPPO's performance with varying numbers of mobile chargers, including scenarios where chargers are added or removed during operation.

- Question: What is the impact of environmental uncertainties, such as anomalies affecting target behavior or sensor energy consumption, on the robustness of the proposed algorithm?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that the proposal's robustness against environmental uncertainties remains unexplored.
  - Why unresolved: The paper does not evaluate the algorithm's performance under varying or uncertain conditions.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results demonstrating AMAPPO's performance under different levels of environmental randomness, including scenarios with anomalous target behavior or fluctuating sensor energy consumption.

- Question: Can the proposed Dec-POSMDP formulation be extended to support heterogeneous sensors and mobile chargers with different specifications and capabilities?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on homogeneous sensors and mobile chargers, but real-world scenarios often involve heterogeneous devices.
  - Why unresolved: The paper does not discuss how the formulation can be adapted to handle heterogeneous devices.
  - What evidence would resolve it: A modified version of the Dec-POSMDP formulation that incorporates heterogeneous device specifications and an evaluation of its performance compared to the homogeneous case.

## Limitations

- The framework relies on a custom simulation environment with limited real-world validation
- Asynchronous decision-making may face practical challenges in highly dynamic network conditions requiring charger coordination
- The observation space design assumes specific sensor distribution patterns that may not generalize to all network topologies

## Confidence

- High confidence: The fundamental problem formulation (Dec-POSMDP for multi-charger coordination) and the asynchronous AMAPPO algorithm structure are well-established approaches with clear theoretical foundations.
- Medium confidence: The U-net based actor model for probability map generation shows promise but lacks direct comparison with alternative spatial representation methods.
- Medium confidence: The generalization capability across different network topologies is demonstrated but limited to the specific instances tested (9 Vietnam-based scenarios).

## Next Checks

1. Test the model's robustness to sensor failure scenarios where multiple sensors deplete simultaneously, verifying that the asynchronous mechanism can handle sudden spikes in charging demand without coordination conflicts.

2. Implement a controlled experiment comparing the U-net probability map approach against direct action prediction methods (e.g., predicting coordinates directly) to quantify the benefits of the spatial representation.

3. Evaluate the model's performance degradation when the number of mobile chargers changes (e.g., 2 vs 3 vs 4 chargers) to validate the claimed scalability of the observation space design.
