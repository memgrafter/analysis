# AI Planning: A Primer and Survey (Preliminary Report)

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.05528
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05528
- Reference count: 31
- This paper provides a primer on AI Planning (AP), contrasting it with reinforcement learning (RL) and highlighting how AP leverages structured representations of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) for efficient decision-making.

## Executive Summary
This paper offers a comprehensive introduction to AI Planning (AP), positioning it as a distinct approach from reinforcement learning (RL) for decision-making in artificial intelligence. While RL agents learn through interaction with unknown environments, AP agents operate with complete access to structured models of the world. This fundamental difference enables AP to leverage domain-independent algorithms and heuristics, potentially leading to more efficient planning processes. The paper surveys various AP formalisms, techniques for exploiting structure, and subfields involving learning, providing readers with a thorough understanding of the AP landscape and its connections to other AI subfields.

## Method Summary
The paper synthesizes information from existing literature on AI Planning, presenting a structured overview of the field. It begins by contrasting AP with RL, emphasizing the role of structured representations in AP. The authors then survey AP formalisms such as PDDL and RDDL, followed by a discussion of techniques for exploiting structure, including heuristic search and problem decomposition. The paper also explores subfields involving learning, such as learning planning models, learning for planning, and generalized planning. Throughout, the authors highlight key insights and potential advantages of AP, aiming to provide a comprehensive introduction to the field.

## Key Results
- AI Planning leverages structured representations of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) for efficient decision-making
- AP uses first-order logic and the closed-world assumption for compact representation of planning problems
- The paper identifies potential for generalization across unseen problems of arbitrary size in AP
- Subfields involving learning in AP (learning planning models, learning for planning, generalized planning) are surveyed

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
AI Planning works by leveraging structured representations of the world, typically in the form of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). This structure allows AP agents to use domain-independent algorithms and heuristics, which can exploit the inherent properties of the problem to make more efficient decisions. The use of first-order logic and the closed-world assumption enables compact representation of planning problems, reducing the computational complexity of planning tasks. Additionally, the complete access to world models in AP allows for more sophisticated reasoning and exploitation of attention, automation, and complexity benefits that are not readily available in reinforcement learning approaches.

## Foundational Learning
1. Markov Decision Processes (MDPs): Why needed - fundamental framework for sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Quick check - understand states, actions, transition probabilities, and reward functions.
2. First-order logic: Why needed - provides a compact and expressive way to represent planning problems. Quick check - grasp predicates, quantifiers, and logical connectives.
3. Heuristic search: Why needed - enables efficient exploration of the state space in planning problems. Quick check - understand admissible heuristics and their role in search algorithms.
4. Problem decomposition: Why needed - allows complex planning problems to be broken down into manageable sub-problems. Quick check - recognize techniques like abstraction and macro-operators.
5. PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language): Why needed - standard language for representing planning problems. Quick check - understand the syntax and semantics of PDDL.
6. Reinforcement Learning vs. AI Planning: Why needed - crucial for understanding the fundamental differences and trade-offs between these two approaches. Quick check - compare the assumptions and methodologies of RL and AP.

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: World Model -> Planning Algorithm -> Action Selection -> Execution
Critical path: World Model → Planning Algorithm → Action Selection
Design tradeoffs: Completeness vs. computational efficiency, generality vs. domain-specific optimizations
Failure signatures: Incompleteness of the world model, inability to find a solution within computational constraints
First experiments:
1. Implement a simple STRIPS planner on a grid-world problem
2. Compare heuristic search performance on a logistics planning domain
3. Evaluate the impact of world model accuracy on planning performance in a blocks world domain

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The comparative analysis between AI Planning and Reinforcement Learning is somewhat simplified and lacks thorough exploration of practical implications
- The discussion of subfields involving learning lacks depth in terms of current state-of-the-art achievements and limitations
- Claims about the potential for generalization across unseen problems of arbitrary size need further validation

## Confidence
- High confidence: The explanation of AI Planning formalisms (PDDL, RDDL) and basic techniques (heuristic search, problem decomposition)
- Medium confidence: The claims about the advantages of structured representations and first-order logic in AI Planning
- Low confidence: The potential for generalization across unseen problems of arbitrary size and the practical benefits of AI Planning in real-world applications

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a systematic comparison of AI Planning and RL approaches on benchmark problems to validate claims about efficiency and performance.
2. Investigate the current state of the art in subfields involving learning, particularly in generalized planning, to assess the feasibility of the claims made.
3. Perform a case study on a real-world application where AI Planning is implemented, comparing its performance and scalability with RL methods to verify practical advantages.
