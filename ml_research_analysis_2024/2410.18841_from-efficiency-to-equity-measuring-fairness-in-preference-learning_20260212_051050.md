# From Efficiency to Equity: Measuring Fairness in Preference Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.18841
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18841
- Reference count: 40
- This paper introduces metrics adapted from economics to measure fairness in preference learning models, demonstrating that high-accuracy models can exhibit significant performance disparities across users.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses epistemic fairness in preference learning models, where diverse human preferences must be fairly represented. The authors propose metrics adapted from economics (Gini Coefficient, Atkinson Index, Kuznets Ratio) to quantify fairness in model performance across users. Using two datasets (AI-EDI-Space and Jester Jokes), they demonstrate that even high-accuracy models can exhibit significant performance disparities across users. The research reveals a trade-off between model efficiency and fairness, showing that pre-processing techniques like Mehestan Scaling can improve equality but may reduce overall accuracy. The work provides a framework for evaluating and improving epistemic fairness in preference learning, emphasizing the need for more diverse datasets with individual annotation data to advance research on fair AI systems.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a framework for measuring epistemic fairness in preference learning models by adapting economic inequality metrics. They evaluate models on two datasets: AI-EDI-Space (street-view images with pairwise comparisons from 22 diverse individuals) and Jester Jokes (100 jokes rated by 1,000 users). The method involves computing user-specific error metrics, applying adapted Gini Coefficient, Atkinson Index, and Kuznets Ratio to measure fairness, and testing pre-processing (Min-Max scaling, Normalization, Mehestan Scaling) and in-processing (user embeddings, contrastive loss) techniques to improve fairness. Models are trained using 0-1 loss for AI-EDI-Space and MSE loss for Jester Jokes, with evaluations measuring both overall accuracy and equality across users.

## Key Results
- The proposed equality metrics reveal significant performance disparities across users in models with high overall accuracy
- Mehestan Scaling improves equality metrics but can reduce overall model accuracy
- User embeddings can capture individual voting patterns and improve fairness in some cases
- The research demonstrates a fundamental trade-off between model efficiency and fairness in preference learning

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Economic inequality metrics (Gini, Atkinson, Kuznets) can measure fairness in preference learning by quantifying performance variation across users.
- Mechanism: These metrics treat user-specific model errors as analogous to income distribution, allowing us to measure how unevenly model performance is distributed.
- Core assumption: Model error across users can be meaningfully compared using inequality metrics designed for wealth distribution.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We propose metrics adapted from the Gini Coefficient, Atkinson Index, and Kuznets Ratio to quantify fairness in these models."
  - [section 4] "Drawing inspiration from economic literature on inequality and fair allocation, we introduce two key concepts that will help us evaluate both the overall performance and the fairness of our preference learning models."
- Break condition: If user error distributions don't follow patterns similar to income inequality, these metrics may misrepresent fairness.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Pre-processing techniques like Mehestan Scaling can improve fairness by normalizing individual user score distributions before model training.
- Mechanism: By adjusting raw comparison scores to account for individual voting patterns, these techniques ensure the model learns from a more equitable representation of preferences.
- Core assumption: The source of epistemic injustice lies in raw data distribution rather than model architecture.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 6.1] "Mehestan Scaling [1]: This more sophisticated approach considers the voting patterns of all participants when scaling an individual's scores."
  - [section 6.1] "Mehestan Scaling is particularly effective in achieving sparse unanimity, a property that ensures the preservation of unanimous preferences even when user voting patterns differ significantly."
- Break condition: If user preference patterns are inherently incompatible, normalization may erase meaningful distinctions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: User embeddings in model architecture can capture and adapt to individual voting patterns, improving fairness.
- Mechanism: By incorporating user-specific features into the model, it can learn to adjust its predictions based on who is providing the preference.
- Core assumption: Individual user preferences have learnable patterns that can be captured through embeddings.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 6.2] "User Embeddings: By incorporating user-specific embeddings as additional input to the model, we aim to capture and adapt to individual voting patterns."
  - [section 6.2] "This technique allows the model to learn user-specific features that may influence preference judgments."
- Break condition: If user preferences are too sparse or diverse to learn meaningful embeddings.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
  - Why needed here: The paper builds on RLHF as the foundational framework for preference learning that needs fairness evaluation.
  - Quick check question: What are the three main steps in the RLHF process described in the introduction?

- Concept: Epistemic injustice and epistemic violence
  - Why needed here: The paper's motivation centers on ensuring AI systems don't perpetuate these forms of injustice through biased preference representation.
  - Quick check question: How does the paper define epistemic injustice in the context of generative AI systems?

- Concept: Economic inequality metrics and their application to ML
- Why needed here: The paper adapts these metrics (Gini, Atkinson, Kuznets) to measure fairness in ML models, requiring understanding of both domains.
  - Quick check question: What does the Gini Coefficient measure in economics, and how is it repurposed for model fairness?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Data preprocessing pipeline (scaling techniques) -> Model architecture (feature extractor + classifier head) -> Loss function (0-1 loss, MSE, or BCE depending on task) -> Evaluation framework (efficiency metrics + equality metrics)

- Critical path: Data → Preprocessing → Model Training → Fairness Evaluation → Model Selection
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model complexity vs. fairness metrics improvement
  - Data normalization (may improve fairness but reduce accuracy)
  - Individual user embeddings (adds parameters but captures preferences)

- Failure signatures:
  - High equality metrics but low overall accuracy
  - Inconsistency between different equality metrics
  - Model performs well on aggregate but poorly on specific user subsets

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train baseline model without any fairness interventions, measure all equality metrics
  2. Apply Mehestan Scaling to the AI-EDI-Space dataset, compare equality metrics improvement
  3. Add user embeddings to the Jester Jokes model, evaluate trade-off between accuracy and fairness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we develop scalable methods to create and release datasets with individual-level annotation data that preserve user privacy while enabling fairness analysis?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies a critical gap in available datasets, noting that prominent RLHF datasets lack user identification data, and advocates for the creation and public release of such datasets.
- Why unresolved: Creating datasets with individual annotations raises significant privacy concerns, and existing methods for anonymization may not be sufficient to protect sensitive user information while maintaining analytical utility.
- What evidence would resolve it: A demonstrated framework for collecting, anonymizing, and releasing user-specific annotation data that enables fairness analysis while maintaining privacy guarantees.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the relationship between different preference diversity measures (e.g., clustering in preference space, voting pattern variability) and model fairness metrics across various user groups?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper shows that users with different voting patterns exhibit different levels of model accuracy, but does not fully explore how various measures of preference diversity relate to fairness outcomes.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies correlations between voting patterns and accuracy but doesn't establish systematic relationships between different measures of preference diversity and fairness metrics.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies mapping multiple preference diversity metrics to various fairness measures across different user groups and datasets.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we design model architectures and training procedures that optimize for both overall performance and fairness simultaneously, rather than trading one off against the other?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper demonstrates a clear trade-off between efficiency and equality, showing that techniques like Mehestan Scaling improve fairness but may reduce overall accuracy.
- Why unresolved: Current approaches show conflicting optimization goals between overall performance and fairness, and the paper doesn't provide solutions for achieving both simultaneously.
- What evidence would resolve it: Architectures or training methods that achieve comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art models while maintaining high fairness scores across multiple metrics.

## Limitations

- The effectiveness of economic inequality metrics for measuring ML fairness requires careful interpretation and may not generalize to all scenarios
- The proposed fairness interventions show promise but their effectiveness may be dataset-dependent
- The paper demonstrates trade-offs between accuracy and fairness but doesn't provide solutions for achieving both simultaneously

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The framework for measuring epistemic fairness using adapted economic metrics is well-established and theoretically sound
- **Medium confidence**: The empirical demonstration of accuracy-fairness trade-offs is convincing but may not generalize to all preference learning scenarios
- **Low confidence**: The long-term effectiveness of pre-processing techniques like Mehestan Scaling across diverse real-world applications remains to be validated

## Next Checks

1. Test the adapted fairness metrics on additional preference learning datasets with varying characteristics to validate generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of each pre-processing and in-processing technique on both accuracy and fairness metrics
3. Evaluate whether the observed accuracy-fairness trade-off persists when scaling to larger, more diverse user populations and real-world deployment scenarios
