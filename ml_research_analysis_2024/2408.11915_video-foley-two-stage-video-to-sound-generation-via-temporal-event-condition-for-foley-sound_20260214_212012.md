# Video-Foley: Two-Stage Video-To-Sound Generation via Temporal Event Condition For Foley Sound

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.11915
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11915
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: State-of-the-art video-to-sound generation with improved temporal alignment and controllability

## Executive Summary
Video-Foley presents a novel two-stage framework for generating synchronized Foley sounds from video input. The system addresses key challenges in video-to-sound generation including poor temporal alignment and the need for expensive human annotations. By leveraging Root Mean Square (RMS) as an intuitive temporal event condition, Video-Foley predicts RMS curves from video input and uses them to guide audio generation. The approach incorporates innovative techniques including RMS discretization and RMS-ControlNet, which conditions a pretrained text-to-audio model to achieve precise synchronization with visual content.

## Method Summary
Video-Foley employs a two-stage pipeline where the first stage (Video2RMS) predicts temporal event curves from video input, and the second stage (RMS2Sound) generates synchronized audio using these curves. The system introduces RMS discretization to convert continuous RMS curves into discrete representations that can effectively condition the audio generation process. RMS-ControlNet is developed to modify a pretrained text-to-audio model, enabling it to generate audio that follows the predicted RMS patterns. This architecture allows for fine-grained control over timing, intensity, timbre, and nuance of the generated Foley sounds while maintaining strong audio-visual alignment.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance in audio-visual alignment with E-L1 score of 0.0090
- Human Mean Opinion Score of 4.40 demonstrates superior perceived quality
- Significant improvements in controllability over timing, intensity, timbre, and nuance of generated Foley sounds

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The two-stage architecture effectively separates temporal event prediction from audio generation, allowing each stage to specialize in its respective task. RMS discretization provides a compact yet expressive representation of temporal events that can be efficiently processed by the RMS2Sound stage. The RMS-ControlNet modification enables the pretrained text-to-audio model to generate audio that precisely follows the predicted temporal patterns while preserving the model's generative capabilities. This approach addresses the fundamental challenge of synchronizing generated sounds with visual events without requiring extensive manual annotations.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Root Mean Square (RMS) Analysis**
   - Why needed: Provides a quantitative measure of signal intensity over time, essential for temporal event detection
   - Quick check: Verify RMS calculation correctly captures amplitude variations in audio signals

2. **Temporal Event Detection**
   - Why needed: Enables identification of key moments in video that correspond to sound events
   - Quick check: Confirm temporal alignment between detected events and corresponding visual actions

3. **Discretization Techniques**
   - Why needed: Converts continuous signals into discrete representations suitable for conditioning generative models
   - Quick check: Validate that discretization preserves essential temporal information

4. **ControlNet Architecture**
   - Why needed: Allows conditioning of pretrained models on additional information without extensive retraining
   - Quick check: Ensure control signals properly influence model outputs while maintaining generation quality

5. **Foley Sound Generation**
   - Why needed: Creates realistic sound effects synchronized with visual content for immersive media experiences
   - Quick check: Verify generated sounds match the expected acoustic characteristics of the corresponding visual events

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Video -> Video2RMS -> RMS Discretization -> RMS-ControlNet -> Text-to-Audio Model -> Generated Audio

Critical Path: The temporal alignment accuracy depends critically on the Video2RMS prediction quality, which directly affects the RMS-ControlNet conditioning and ultimately the synchronization of generated audio with visual events.

Design Tradeoffs: The two-stage approach trades off some potential end-to-end optimization benefits for better controllability and interpretability, while the RMS discretization balances expressiveness with computational efficiency.

Failure Signatures: Poor temporal alignment manifests as audio events occurring at incorrect times relative to visual events, while RMS prediction errors can cause amplitude mismatches or missing sound events.

First Experiments:
1. Test Video2RMS module on sample video clips to verify accurate RMS curve prediction
2. Validate RMS discretization preserves temporal information by reconstructing curves from discrete representations
3. Evaluate RMS-ControlNet conditioning effectiveness by comparing generated audio with and without RMS guidance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- RMS prediction quality directly impacts final audio output, but error propagation analysis is limited
- RMS-ControlNet modification may introduce distribution shifts affecting long-term generation stability
- Evaluation primarily focuses on Greatest Hits dataset, potentially limiting generalizability to diverse Foley scenarios

## Confidence
High confidence: Temporal alignment improvements and MOS scores are well-supported by quantitative metrics and ablation studies. The two-stage architecture and RMS discretization approach are clearly described and reproducible.

Medium confidence: Claims about controllability over timbre and nuance are supported by experimental results but could benefit from more diverse audio examples. The RMS-ControlNet modification's impact on the base text-to-audio model requires further investigation.

Low confidence: The generalization capability to diverse Foley scenarios beyond the Greatest Hits dataset is not thoroughly validated. Long-term generation stability and potential cumulative errors in the two-stage pipeline are not addressed.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies isolating the impact of RMS prediction errors on final audio quality across different sound categories
2. Evaluate the system on additional datasets with diverse Foley sound types to assess generalization capability
3. Perform long-duration generation tests (e.g., 30+ seconds) to evaluate temporal consistency and identify potential accumulation of generation artifacts
