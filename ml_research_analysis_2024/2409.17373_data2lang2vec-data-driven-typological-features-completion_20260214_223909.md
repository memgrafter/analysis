# data2lang2vec: Data Driven Typological Features Completion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.17373
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17373
- Reference count: 21
- Primary result: Data-driven approach for completing missing typological features in language databases

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces data2lang2vec, a method for predicting missing typological features in language databases like lang2vec. The approach uses POS tagging, statistical features, and language metadata to predict missing feature values, outperforming prior KNN-based methods. A multi-lingual POS tagger with >70% accuracy across 1,749 languages was developed to support this work. The study introduces a more realistic evaluation setup focusing on likely-to-be-missing features rather than random k-fold splits, demonstrating improved performance particularly for high-missing-ratio features.

## Method Summary
The method employs a multi-stage approach: first identifying likely missing features using a gradient boosting classifier, then training separate classifiers for each of 125 typological features. The system incorporates three types of features: POS tags from a multi-lingual tagger, statistical features (geo coordinates, Wikipedia size, speaker counts), and phylogenetic features (language family, AES status). Each feature has its own classifier with feature selection, avoiding weight sharing issues. The evaluation focuses on high-missing-ratio features identified by the binary classifier, providing a more realistic assessment than traditional k-fold approaches.

## Key Results
- External statistical features proved most informative, contributing to 75% of target features
- POS tag features were the least effective, contributing to only 23% of target features
- The multi-lingual POS tagger achieved >70% accuracy across 1,749 languages
- The approach outperforms previous KNN-based methods in both k-fold and missing-value-focused evaluations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The approach improves typological feature prediction by focusing on likely-to-be-missing features rather than random k-fold splits.
- Mechanism: A binary classifier identifies features most likely missing in lang2vec, then evaluation concentrates on these high-missing-ratio features to avoid overestimating performance on easy cases like English.
- Core assumption: Features identified as likely missing represent genuinely challenging prediction cases that better reflect real-world utility.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We also introduce a more realistic evaluation setup, focusing on likely to be missing typology features, and show that our approach outperforms previous work in both setups."
  - [section 4.1] "We then used top 20% that was most likely to be missing for evaluation purposes"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct neighbor papers discussing missing-value-focused evaluation strategies

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: External statistical features and language metadata are more informative than POS tags for typological feature prediction across diverse language features.
- Mechanism: The model leverages continuous features (geo coordinates, Wikipedia size, speaker counts) and categorical features (language family, AES status) which capture broader linguistic patterns better than POS tags alone.
- Core assumption: Typological features correlate more strongly with macro-level language characteristics than with surface-level POS patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "External statistical features proved most informative, while POS tags were useful only for specific features like word order."
  - [section 4.2] "The most effective feature is 'pylogency,' useful for predicting 75% of target features, while POS tag features from LTI_langID are the least effective, contributing to only 23%."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - neighbor papers discuss typology but not the relative importance of statistical vs. POS features

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Training separate classifiers for each typological feature avoids weight sharing issues and improves prediction accuracy for diverse feature types.
- Mechanism: Each of the 125 features has its own classifier optimized with feature selection, allowing the model to learn feature-specific patterns without interference from unrelated feature predictions.
- Core assumption: Different typological features have distinct predictive patterns that benefit from specialized rather than shared representations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.2] "We developed a distinct classifier for each of these 125 features... By employing distinct classifiers, we prevent weight sharing, which enhances the prediction performance for each specific feature."
  - [section 4.2] Performance improvements specifically noted for individual features in Table 1
  - [corpus] No direct evidence in neighbor papers about multi-feature classifier architecture choices

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Feature importance and selection in machine learning
  - Why needed here: The approach relies on identifying which features (metadata, POS tags, phylogenetic information) are most predictive for different typological features
  - Quick check question: How would you determine which features to include when building a classifier for a new typological prediction task?

- Concept: Binary classification for missing value prediction
  - Why needed here: The feature presence classifier identifies which features are likely missing, forming the basis for the realistic evaluation setup
  - Quick check question: What metrics would you use to evaluate a classifier that predicts whether a language-feature combination is missing in a database?

- Concept: Cross-validation vs. realistic evaluation setups
  - Why needed here: The paper contrasts traditional k-fold evaluation with their proposed missing-value-focused approach
  - Quick check question: When would a traditional k-fold setup give misleading results compared to an evaluation focused on specific subsets of data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Feature presence classifier (Gradient Boosting) → Identifies likely missing features → 125 individual typological feature classifiers → Predict specific feature values → Data preprocessing pipeline → Extracts metadata, POS tags, and phylogenetic features → Evaluation framework → Uses missing-value-focused metrics rather than random splits

- Critical path: Data preprocessing → Feature presence classification → Feature-specific prediction → Evaluation on identified missing features

- Design tradeoffs: Separate classifiers per feature provides better accuracy but increases computational cost and complexity compared to a single multi-output model

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor feature presence classifier performance → Evaluation focuses on wrong features
  - POS tagger accuracy below 70% → Text-based features become unreliable
  - Metadata features missing for many languages → Model loses key predictive information

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train and evaluate the feature presence classifier on a small language sample to verify it identifies truly challenging features
  2. Compare KNN baseline vs. Random Forest on a single typological feature to validate the separate-classifier approach
  3. Test the full pipeline on 10-20 features with known missing values to confirm the evaluation setup works as intended

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal number of principal components for dimensionality reduction when incorporating POS tag features for predicting different typological features?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using PCA for dimensionality reduction with a hyperparameter specifying the number of dimensions to retain, and reports that POS tags were useful only for specific features like word order.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not report the optimal PCA component numbers for POS tag features specifically, nor does it analyze which typological features benefit most from POS tag information.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic analysis showing the relationship between PCA component numbers and prediction accuracy for different typological feature categories, identifying the optimal dimensionality for POS tag features.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How would the inclusion of phonetic/phonological features from external databases impact the prediction accuracy for WALS features related to phonetics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges that none of the curated features relate to phonetics, making it impossible to improve prediction for phonetic-related target features.
- Why unresolved: The paper did not experiment with phonetic features and therefore cannot quantify their potential contribution to prediction accuracy.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing prediction accuracy with and without phonetic features for WALS features related to phonetics, showing the improvement (if any) from their inclusion.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of using different evaluation metrics (beyond F1-score) for assessing typological feature prediction performance, particularly for highly imbalanced feature distributions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses F1-score as the primary evaluation metric but does not discuss alternative metrics or their potential impact on results.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore whether F1-score is the most appropriate metric for this task, especially given the highly imbalanced nature of many typological features (as shown in Figure 1).
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative results using multiple evaluation metrics (precision, recall, ROC-AUC, Matthews correlation coefficient) across different feature categories to determine which metric best captures prediction performance.

## Limitations

- The feature presence classifier relies on lang2vec's existing data to train, creating potential circularity if missingness patterns correlate with feature values themselves
- The POS tagger, while achieving >70% accuracy across 1,749 languages, may still introduce noise that affects downstream typological predictions, particularly for low-resource languages
- The approach assumes that high-missing-ratio features represent genuinely difficult prediction cases, but this may not hold if certain language families or regions systematically lack data collection rather than being inherently harder to predict

## Confidence

- High confidence: The superiority of external statistical features over POS tags is well-supported by the ablation studies showing 75% vs 23% feature coverage
- Medium confidence: The realistic evaluation setup focusing on likely-to-be-missing features provides more meaningful results than random k-fold splits, though the feature presence classifier's accuracy and potential biases need further validation
- Medium confidence: Separate classifiers per feature outperform shared architectures, but computational costs and scalability remain concerns

## Next Checks

1. Validate the feature presence classifier by testing whether its identified "likely missing" features truly represent harder prediction cases across multiple independent language samples
2. Conduct ablation studies removing specific metadata features (geographic, phylogenetic, speaker counts) to quantify their individual contributions to prediction accuracy
3. Test the full pipeline on a held-out language family not used in training to assess generalizability and identify potential family-specific biases
