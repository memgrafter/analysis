# Birbal: An efficient 7B instruct-model fine-tuned with curated datasets

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.02247
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02247
- Authors: Ashvini Kumar Jindal; Pawan Kumar Rajpoot; Ankur Parikh
- Reference count: 14
- Primary result: 35% performance improvement over Qwen-14B based submission

## Executive Summary
This paper presents Birbal, a fine-tuned Mistral-7B model that achieves significant performance improvements through careful dataset curation and efficient fine-tuning on consumer-grade hardware. The authors demonstrate that high-quality instruction datasets, when properly curated, can substantially enhance model capabilities without requiring extensive computational resources. The fine-tuning process was completed on a single RTX 4090 GPU within one day, making it accessible to researchers with limited resources.

The approach addresses the growing need for efficient LLM adaptation methods that can deliver competitive results without massive computational overhead. By focusing on dataset quality over quantity and leveraging modern fine-tuning techniques, Birbal achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks while maintaining computational efficiency. The resulting model outperforms larger models like Qwen-14B by more than 35% on evaluation tasks.

## Method Summary
The authors fine-tuned the Mistral-7B base model using a carefully curated subset of existing datasets, focusing on high-quality instructions across diverse tasks. The fine-tuning was performed on an RTX 4090 GPU (24 GB memory) over the course of one day. The methodology emphasized dataset curation as the primary driver of performance improvements, selecting instructions that cover a wide range of capabilities while maintaining quality standards. The authors employed standard fine-tuning techniques optimized for the limited GPU memory available.

## Key Results
- Birbal achieved 35% better performance than the second-best Qwen-14B based submission
- Fine-tuning completed successfully on RTX 4090 (24GB) within one day
- Demonstrated that high-quality dataset curation can significantly improve model performance
- Made efficient LLM fine-tuning accessible to researchers with limited computational resources

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by leveraging the principle that dataset quality has a more significant impact on model performance than sheer dataset size. By carefully curating high-quality instructions that cover diverse tasks, the model learns more effectively from fewer examples. The efficient fine-tuning on consumer hardware demonstrates that modern optimization techniques and careful resource management can achieve competitive results without massive computational infrastructure. This approach reduces the barrier to entry for researchers and practitioners who want to adapt large language models for specific applications.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Mistral-7B base model -> Curated dataset -> Efficient fine-tuning pipeline -> Birbal model

Critical Path:
The critical path involves dataset curation selection, fine-tuning parameter optimization, and evaluation. Each stage builds upon the previous one, with dataset quality being the primary determinant of final model performance.

Design Tradeoffs:
The approach trades computational resources for dataset quality and careful fine-tuning parameter selection. This makes the method accessible but potentially less scalable for very large datasets or models.

Failure Signatures:
Poor dataset curation may lead to model degradation or overfitting to specific tasks. Insufficient fine-tuning time or suboptimal parameters can result in underfitting or unstable training.

First Experiments:
1. Baseline evaluation of Mistral-7B on standard benchmarks
2. Ablation study with varying levels of dataset curation
3. Fine-tuning time optimization on different hardware configurations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
