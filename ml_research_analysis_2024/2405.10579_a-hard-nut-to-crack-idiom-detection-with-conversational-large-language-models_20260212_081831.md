# A Hard Nut to Crack: Idiom Detection with Conversational Large Language Models

## Quick Facts

- The paper introduces IdioTS, a novel dataset for idiom detection in English, evaluating three conversational LLMs on their ability to distinguish figurative from literal meanings

## Executive Summary
This paper presents IdioTS, a new dataset containing 250 sentences with potentially idiomatic expressions (PIEs) designed to test Large Language Models' ability to detect idioms in conversational contexts. The dataset includes 164 idiomatic sentences and 86 distractor sentences, carefully crafted by language experts to represent challenging cases. Three conversational LLMs (Llama-2-7b-chat, Mistral-7b-Instruct, and Vicuna-7b) were evaluated using a binary classification task to determine whether sentences contain idiomatic expressions. The study found that while automatic metrics showed similar performance across models, manual evaluation revealed significant challenges in correctly identifying idioms, with Mistral achieving the highest True Positive Consistency score of 0.905.

## Method Summary
The researchers created the IdioTS dataset by selecting 100 idioms from the ATOMIC-Plus dataset and generating sentences that included both literal and idiomatic uses of these expressions. They then added 86 distractor sentences containing random elements to test models' ability to focus on relevant expressions. Three conversational LLMs were evaluated using two approaches: automatic evaluation with standard classification metrics, and manual evaluation by language experts who assessed whether model responses correctly identified idiomatic meanings. The True Positive Consistency metric was introduced to measure models' ability to consistently identify idioms across multiple instances.

## Key Results
- Mistral-7b-Instruct achieved the best balanced accuracy and specificity scores among the three evaluated models
- Manual evaluation revealed models often incorrectly assigned idiomatic meanings to literal sentences or random sentence elements
- Mistral achieved a True Positive Consistency score of 0.905, significantly outperforming the other models in consistently identifying idioms
- All models struggled with sentences where idiomatic meanings were context-dependent or where literal meanings were plausible

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of idiom detection relies on LLMs' ability to understand contextual cues and semantic relationships between words. When presented with potentially idiomatic expressions, models must weigh literal interpretations against figurative meanings based on surrounding context. The IdioTS dataset challenges models by including sentences where the distinction between literal and idiomatic meanings is subtle, requiring nuanced understanding of language pragmatics and cultural knowledge.

## Foundational Learning
- Idiom detection in NLP: Understanding how natural language processing systems identify figurative language expressions; needed to establish baseline approaches for comparison; quick check: review existing idiom detection datasets and methodologies
- Conversational LLM architecture: Knowledge of transformer-based models and their instruction-tuned variants; needed to understand model capabilities and limitations; quick check: examine model architecture papers for Llama-2, Mistral, and Vicuna
- Semantic context modeling: How language models capture and utilize contextual information; needed to understand how models distinguish literal vs. figurative meanings; quick check: analyze attention mechanisms in transformer layers

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** IdioTS dataset -> LLM input processing -> Binary classification output -> Automatic evaluation metrics + Manual expert evaluation -> True Positive Consistency calculation
**Critical Path:** Dataset generation -> Model inference -> Classification decision -> Performance measurement
**Design Tradeoffs:** Binary classification simplifies the task but loses nuance; automatic metrics provide quantitative comparison but may miss semantic subtleties; manual evaluation provides qualitative insights but is resource-intensive
**Failure Signatures:** Models incorrectly classifying literal sentences as idiomatic; inconsistent identification of the same idiom across different contexts; over-reliance on surface-level word patterns rather than deep semantic understanding
**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test models on a subset of IdioTS with clearly idiomatic vs. clearly literal sentences to establish baseline performance
2. Evaluate model performance on idioms with similar surface forms but different meanings in different contexts
3. Compare model performance when given additional contextual information versus isolated sentences

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The IdioTS dataset contains only 250 sentences, which may not provide sufficient statistical power for robust conclusions
- Binary classification task design forces models to choose between idiomatic and literal meanings without considering contextual ambiguity
- Manual evaluation methodology lacks detailed documentation, making it difficult to assess inter-rater reliability
- Results may not generalize to broader idiom detection tasks beyond the specific PIEs tested in the dataset

## Confidence
**High confidence in dataset construction methodology and expert curation process**
**Medium confidence in automatic evaluation metrics results due to small sample size**
**Medium confidence in manual evaluation findings due to unclear methodology details**
**Medium confidence in cross-model comparisons given similar performance patterns**
**Low confidence in generalizability to broader idiom detection tasks beyond the specific PIEs tested**

## Next Checks
1. Conduct statistical power analysis to determine minimum dataset size needed for reliable idiom detection evaluation, then expand IdioTS accordingly
2. Implement inter-rater reliability measures (Cohen's kappa) for manual evaluation and document detailed annotation guidelines
3. Test models on additional idiom detection datasets with different PIE types and sentence structures to assess generalizability of findings
