# Modeling Unified Semantic Discourse Structure for High-quality Headline Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.15776
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15776
- Reference count: 32
- Combines document-level RST trees with sentence-level AMR graphs to construct unified S3 graphs for headline generation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to headline generation by modeling Unified Semantic Discourse Structure (S3). The method integrates document-level Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) trees with sentence-level Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs to create a comprehensive semantic representation. This unified S3 graph captures the hierarchical composition of sentences, clauses, and words, providing a rich semantic characterization of the overall document. The authors develop a headline generation framework that encodes S3 graphs as contextual features, enhanced by a hierarchical structure pruning mechanism based on reinforcement learning to eliminate redundant and nonessential nodes.

## Method Summary
The proposed method constructs unified semantic discourse structures by combining document-level RST trees with sentence-level AMR graphs. These S3 graphs are then encoded as contextual features within a headline generation framework. A hierarchical structure pruning mechanism, implemented through reinforcement learning, dynamically screens and removes redundant or nonessential nodes from the graph. This approach aims to capture the essential semantic meaning of documents while maintaining computational efficiency for headline generation tasks.

## Key Results
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on CNNDM-DH and DM-DHC datasets
- Demonstrates the effectiveness of combining RST trees and AMR graphs for headline generation
- Shows that the hierarchical structure pruning mechanism improves headline quality

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by creating a unified semantic representation that captures both the document-level discourse structure (through RST trees) and the sentence-level semantic meaning (through AMR graphs). This dual representation allows the model to understand both the overall flow of information in the document and the specific semantic relationships between concepts. The hierarchical structure pruning mechanism further refines this representation by removing redundant information, focusing the model on the most salient content for headline generation.

## Foundational Learning
- Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST): A theory for analyzing text structure and coherence
  - Why needed: Provides document-level discourse structure representation
  - Quick check: Understand basic concepts of nucleus-satellite relations and discourse trees

- Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR): A semantic representation framework for capturing sentence meaning
  - Why needed: Provides sentence-level semantic graph representation
  - Quick check: Familiarize with AMR concepts like concepts, relations, and reentrancies

- Reinforcement Learning for Structure Pruning: An approach to dynamically optimize graph structures
  - Why needed: To remove redundant nodes and focus on essential semantic content
  - Quick check: Understand the basics of reinforcement learning and its application to graph pruning

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Document -> RST Parser -> AMR Parser -> S3 Graph Construction -> Hierarchical Pruning (RL) -> Headline Generation Model

Critical path: Input document → RST and AMR parsing → S3 graph construction → Reinforcement learning-based pruning → Headline generation

Design tradeoffs:
- Combining RST and AMR provides rich semantic representation but increases computational complexity
- Reinforcement learning-based pruning improves quality but requires careful hyperparameter tuning
- Focus on news articles may limit generalizability to other domains

Failure signatures:
- Poor performance on documents with complex or non-standard discourse structures
- Sensitivity to errors in RST or AMR parsing
- Potential overfitting to news domain characteristics

First experiments to run:
1. Baseline comparison using only RST or AMR representations
2. Ablation study on the hierarchical pruning mechanism
3. Cross-domain evaluation on scientific papers or legal documents

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Computational efficiency and scalability concerns for very long documents
- Potential propagation of errors from preprocessing steps (AMR parsing, RST tree extraction)
- Limited evaluation scope focusing primarily on standard metrics without extensive human evaluation
- Unclear generalizability to languages and domains beyond news articles

## Confidence
- High confidence: The core methodology of combining RST and AMR representations is sound and well-executed
- Medium confidence: The reported performance improvements over baselines are robust but may be partially attributed to dataset-specific characteristics
- Medium confidence: The reinforcement learning pruning mechanism contributes to performance but the exact magnitude of its impact requires further validation

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of RST features, AMR features, and the pruning mechanism to overall performance
2. Perform cross-domain evaluation using datasets from different domains (scientific papers, legal documents, etc.) to assess generalizability
3. Implement human evaluation studies comparing headlines generated by the proposed method against those from strong baselines, focusing on coherence, informativeness, and readability
