# InstaTrans: An Instruction-Aware Translation Framework for Non-English Instruction Datasets

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.01512
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01512
- Reference count: 8
- Primary result: INSTATRANS achieves 85.38 completeness and 78.25 informativeness scores for Korean instruction data, outperforming commercial translators while maintaining high ratio of completeness to informativeness

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of generating high-quality instruction datasets for non-English languages, where tail phenomena and linguistic diversity create significant translation difficulties. INSTATRANS introduces an instruction-aware translation framework that combines function calling with specialized translation prompts to ensure completeness and informativeness when translating English instruction datasets to target languages. The framework fine-tunes existing large language models on translated data to create specialized instruction-aware translators, enabling more effective knowledge transfer across linguistic boundaries.

The proposed approach demonstrates substantial improvements over commercial translation services, achieving higher scores in both completeness and informativeness metrics for Korean instruction data. By maintaining a high completeness-to-informativeness ratio, INSTATRANS ensures that translated datasets retain the essential information needed for effective instruction tuning while preserving the richness of the original content. This advancement enables more efficient extension of large language model capabilities to diverse languages at reduced costs compared to traditional approaches.

## Method Summary
INSTATRANS addresses the challenge of translating instruction datasets to non-English languages by introducing a novel framework that goes beyond standard translation approaches. The method combines function calling capabilities with instruction-aware translation prompts to ensure both completeness and informativeness of the translated content. Rather than relying solely on commercial translators, INSTATRANS fine-tunes existing large language models on translated instruction data to create specialized instruction-aware translators. This approach leverages the strengths of both traditional translation methods and the contextual understanding capabilities of large language models, resulting in translations that better preserve the instructional intent and semantic richness of the original English content. The framework is designed to handle the complexities of instruction datasets, where precision and completeness are critical for downstream applications.

## Key Results
- INSTATRANS achieves 85.38 completeness score and 78.25 informativeness score on Korean instruction data
- Outperforms commercial translators like DeepL (80.50/72.21) while maintaining a high completeness-to-informativeness ratio of 91.65%
- Models fine-tuned with INSTATRANS-translated datasets achieved the highest score of 7.0 on Ko MT-bench

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework's effectiveness stems from its dual approach of combining function calling with instruction-aware translation prompts. Function calling provides structured, task-specific outputs that maintain the integrity of instructional elements, while instruction-aware prompts ensure that the translation process considers the context and intent behind the original content. This combination addresses the limitations of standard translation methods that often struggle with preserving the completeness and informativeness of instruction datasets. By fine-tuning existing LLMs on translated data, INSTATRANS creates specialized translators that are specifically optimized for the nuances of instructional content, leading to more accurate and contextually appropriate translations.

## Foundational Learning

**Function Calling** - why needed: Enables structured, task-specific outputs that maintain the integrity of instructional elements during translation
quick check: Verify that function calls are properly parsed and executed in the target language context

**Instruction-Aware Prompts** - why needed: Ensures translation process considers the context and intent behind original content rather than just literal translation
quick check: Confirm that translated instructions maintain the same task completion requirements as the source

**Fine-Tuning on Translated Data** - why needed: Creates specialized translators optimized for instructional content nuances
quick check: Validate that fine-tuned models show improved performance on instruction-specific evaluation metrics

**Completeness Metrics** - why needed: Measures whether all essential information from source instructions is preserved
quick check: Compare coverage of key concepts between source and translated instructions

**Informativeness Metrics** - why needed: Ensures translated content retains the richness and detail needed for effective instruction
quick check: Evaluate whether translated instructions provide sufficient detail for task completion

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
LLM Base Model -> Function Calling Layer -> Instruction-Aware Prompt Generator -> Translation Output -> Fine-Tuning Pipeline -> Specialized Translator

**Critical Path**
English Instruction Dataset -> INSTATRANS Translation -> Fine-Tuning on Translated Data -> Specialized Instruction-Aware Translator

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Standard translation: Fast but loses instructional nuance
- Full instruction-tuning: High quality but expensive
- INSTATRANS approach: Balances quality and cost through specialized fine-tuning

**Failure Signatures**
- Completeness < 80%: Missing critical instructional elements
- Informativeness < 75%: Insufficient detail for task completion
- High completeness, low informativeness: Complete but overly generic translations
- Low completeness-to-informativeness ratio: Imbalanced preservation of content

**First Experiments**
1. Translate a sample instruction dataset and evaluate completeness/informativeness scores
2. Compare INSTATRANS outputs against commercial translators on identical instruction sets
3. Fine-tune a base model on INSTATRANS-translated data and evaluate on Ko MT-bench

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation only conducted on Korean language, raising questions about generalizability to other language families
- Cost-benefit analysis comparing INSTATRANS fine-tuning expenses to commercial services is not provided
- Performance claims based on single benchmark (Ko MT-bench) without broader validation across multiple evaluation frameworks

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| 85.38 completeness and 78.25 informativeness scores for Korean | High |
| Outperformance of commercial translators like DeepL | High (for Korean) |
| 91.65% completeness-to-informativeness ratio stability | Medium |
| Extension to diverse languages at lower costs | Medium |
| Highest score of 7.0 on Ko MT-bench | High |

## Next Checks
1. Test INSTATRANS on at least three additional non-English languages from different language families (e.g., Spanish, Japanese, and Hindi) to assess cross-linguistic generalizability
2. Conduct a cost-benefit analysis comparing INSTATRANS fine-tuning expenses against the performance gains relative to commercial translation services across multiple languages
3. Perform ablation studies to determine the specific contribution of function calling versus instruction-aware prompts to the overall performance improvements
