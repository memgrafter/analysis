# Transformer Guided Coevolution: Improved Team Selection in Multiagent Adversarial Team Games

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.13769
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13769
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: BERTeam, a transformer-based team selection method, outperforms MCAA in Marine Capture-The-Flag team performance while capturing behavioral agent similarities

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces BERTeam, a transformer-guided coevolution approach for team selection in multiagent adversarial games. The method combines Masked Language Model training with coevolutionary deep reinforcement learning to generate effective teams from a diverse population of agents. BERTeam represents teams as sequences of tokens and learns to predict optimal compositions by masking and reconstructing team members. Tested in Marine Capture-The-Flag (MCTF), BERTeam successfully learns non-trivial, balanced team compositions and outperforms the baseline MCAA algorithm in team performance. The learned agent embeddings also capture behavioral similarities, enabling inference of missing data and adaptation to incomplete training scenarios.

## Method Summary
BERTeam integrates a transformer-based Masked Language Model with coevolutionary deep reinforcement learning to optimize team selection in adversarial multiagent games. The approach begins by evolving a diverse population of agents through coevolution, where each agent learns policies to compete against opponents. Teams are represented as sequences of tokens, with each token corresponding to an agent. The transformer is trained to reconstruct masked tokens in team sequences, effectively learning the relationships between agents and their contributions to team success. During inference, BERTeam generates teams by predicting the most probable sequences, favoring balanced compositions that perform well against unknown opponents. The method is evaluated in MCTF, demonstrating superior team performance compared to MCAA while also capturing meaningful behavioral similarities between agents.

## Key Results
- BERTeam outperforms MCAA in team performance in Marine Capture-The-Flag
- The method learns non-trivial, balanced team compositions that perform well
- BERTeam's learned agent embeddings capture behavioral similarities and enable inference of missing data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
BERTeam leverages the transformer's ability to model sequential relationships and the coevolution framework's capacity to generate diverse, high-performing agents. The Masked Language Model training allows the transformer to learn which agent combinations yield successful teams by reconstructing masked tokens based on context. Coevolution ensures a rich candidate pool of agents with varying strategies, providing the transformer with diverse building blocks for team composition. The integration of these components enables BERTeam to capture both the structural relationships between agents and the emergent team dynamics required for adversarial gameplay.

## Foundational Learning
- **Masked Language Modeling**: A self-supervised technique where parts of input sequences are masked and the model learns to reconstruct them. Needed to train the transformer on team composition patterns without explicit labels. Quick check: Verify reconstruction accuracy on held-out team data.
- **Coevolutionary Deep Reinforcement Learning**: An evolutionary algorithm where multiple populations (agents and opponents) coevolve to improve performance. Needed to generate a diverse, high-performing agent pool for team selection. Quick check: Measure population diversity and performance metrics over generations.
- **Transformer Architectures**: Neural networks using self-attention mechanisms to model sequential data. Needed to capture complex relationships between agents in team compositions. Quick check: Analyze attention weights for interpretable agent-agent interactions.
- **Multiagent Adversarial Games**: Environments where teams of agents compete against each other. Needed as the target application domain for team selection. Quick check: Validate team performance against unseen opponent strategies.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Agent coevolution -> Agent embedding generation -> Team sequence representation -> Transformer MLM training -> Team generation

Critical path: The core workflow begins with coevolving a population of agents, then encoding these agents as embeddings. Teams are represented as sequences of agent tokens, which are fed into the transformer for Masked Language Model training. During inference, the trained transformer generates optimal team sequences by predicting masked tokens, producing the final team composition.

Design tradeoffs: The method trades computational cost (coevolution + transformer training) for improved team performance and generalization. Using a fixed vocabulary of agent tokens simplifies sequence representation but may limit expressiveness for very large agent pools. The masking strategy balances exploration of team space against stability in predictions.

Failure signatures: Poor team performance may indicate insufficient coevolution diversity, inadequate transformer capacity, or suboptimal masking ratios. Failure to capture behavioral similarities could stem from shallow agent embeddings or insufficient training data. Overfitting to specific opponent strategies may reduce generalization to new opponents.

First experiments:
1. Train BERTeam with varying masking ratios (10%, 30%, 50%) and compare team performance to identify optimal exploration-exploitation balance
2. Evaluate team performance with transformer-only (no coevolution) versus coevolution-only (no transformer) baselines to isolate component contributions
3. Test BERTeam's ability to infer missing agents in incomplete team data to validate behavioral embedding quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper does not explicitly call out open questions in the provided content.

## Limitations
- The method's generalizability beyond Marine Capture-The-Flag remains uncertain due to evaluation in a single game environment
- Computational efficiency relative to baseline methods is not thoroughly addressed, which is critical for practical deployment
- The masking strategy may introduce biases depending on the masking ratio and strategy employed

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Team performance improvement | High |
| Behavioral embedding quality | Medium |
| Generalizability to other domains | Low |

## Next Checks

1. Test BERTeam in at least two additional multiagent adversarial game environments to assess generalizability
2. Conduct systematic ablation studies comparing pure coevolution, pure transformer approaches, and the hybrid BERTeam method
3. Perform a comprehensive computational efficiency analysis comparing BERTeam to baseline team selection methods across varying population sizes and training durations
