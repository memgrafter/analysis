# RRLS : Robust Reinforcement Learning Suite

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.08406
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08406
- Reference count: 21
- Provides six Mujoco environments with two uncertainty sets for robust RL evaluation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Robust Reinforcement Learning Suite (RRLS), a benchmark suite for evaluating robust RL algorithms using Mujoco environments. RRLS provides six continuous control tasks with two types of uncertainty sets for training and evaluation, enabling standardized and reproducible experiments. The benchmark includes four compatible baselines: TD3, Domain Randomization, NR-MDP, and RARL, with M2TD3 showing the best worst-case performance across all environments. The suite is designed to be easily expandable and includes wrappers for implementing various deep robust RL baselines. RRLS addresses the critical need for reproducibility and comparability in robust RL research.

## Method Summary
The benchmark suite implements six Mujoco continuous control environments (Ant, HalfCheetah, Hopper, Humanoid Stand Up, Inverted Pendulum, Walker) with two uncertainty sets for training and evaluation. Each environment includes modified parameter ranges (e.g., torso mass in HumanoidStandup: [0.1, 16.0]) that create adversarial conditions. The suite provides wrappers (DomainRandomization, Adversarial, ProbabilisticActionRobust) to implement different robust RL approaches while maintaining consistent evaluation conditions. Four baseline algorithms are included: TD3, Domain Randomization, NR-MDP, and RARL, with M2TD3 showing the best worst-case performance across all environments.

## Key Results
- RRLS provides six Mujoco environments with two uncertainty sets for standardized robust RL evaluation
- M2TD3 achieves the best worst-case performance across all environments in the benchmark
- The suite includes wrappers enabling easy implementation of various robust RL baselines
- RRLS addresses reproducibility issues in robust RL research through standardized evaluation procedures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The benchmark enables standardized worst-case evaluation by providing two uncertainty sets (M2TD3 and RARL) with fixed parameter ranges.
- Mechanism: By defining specific parameter ranges for each environment (e.g., torso mass in HumanoidStandup: [0.1, 16.0]), the benchmark ensures that all algorithms are tested against the same adversarial conditions, enabling fair comparison.
- Core assumption: The uncertainty sets are representative of real-world environmental variations and cover a meaningful range of adversarial conditions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "RRLS provides six continuous control tasks with two types of uncertainty sets for training and evaluation."
  - [section]: "Three uncertainty sets—1D, 2D, and 3D—are provided for each environment, ranging from simple to challenging."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus focuses on other RL benchmarks but doesn't specifically address robust RL standardization.
- Break condition: If the uncertainty sets don't capture the relevant adversarial scenarios or are too narrow/broad, the benchmark loses its standardization value.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The wrapper architecture enables easy implementation of different robust RL algorithms while maintaining consistency.
- Mechanism: Wrappers like DomainRandomization, Adversarial, and ProbabilisticActionRobust modify the environment interface to implement different robust RL approaches without changing the core environment code, ensuring consistent evaluation conditions.
- Core assumption: The wrappers correctly implement the algorithmic modifications without introducing evaluation bias.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "We introduce environment wrappers to facilitate the implementation of various deep robust RL baselines... ensuring researchers can easily apply and compare different methods within a standardized framework."
  - [section]: "The wrappers are described as follows" (followed by detailed wrapper descriptions)
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus mentions other benchmarks but doesn't discuss wrapper architectures for robust RL.
- Break condition: If wrappers introduce implementation errors or inconsistent evaluation procedures, comparisons become invalid.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The evaluation procedure with generate_evaluation_set ensures comprehensive testing across the uncertainty space.
- Mechanism: By creating a uniform mesh over the parameter space and running multiple trajectories per environment, the evaluation captures both worst-case and average-case performance metrics.
- Core assumption: Uniform sampling over the uncertainty set adequately represents the performance distribution across all possible adversarial conditions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "To address this, we propose a systematic approach using a function called generate_evaluation_set. This function takes an uncertainty set as input and returns a list of evaluation environments."
  - [section]: "In the static case, where the transition kernel remains constant across time steps, the evaluation set consists of environments spanned by a uniform mesh over the parameters set."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - corpus doesn't discuss evaluation methodologies for robust RL benchmarks.
- Break condition: If the uniform mesh doesn't adequately sample the uncertainty space or if trajectory counts are insufficient, evaluation results may not be reliable.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Robust MDP formulation with adversarial transition kernels
  - Why needed here: Understanding that robust RL optimizes for worst-case performance across a span of transition kernels is fundamental to why this benchmark exists
  - Quick check question: What's the difference between the static and dynamic models of transition kernel uncertainty?

- Concept: Zero-sum Markov games as the mathematical framework
  - Why needed here: The benchmark implements robust RL as a two-player game where the adversary modifies environment parameters
  - Quick check question: How does the maxπ minp formulation in robust MDPs translate to the maxπ min¯π formulation in two-player games?

- Concept: Mujoco physics engine parameter modification
  - Why needed here: The benchmark modifies physical parameters (mass, friction, forces) through the physics engine to create adversarial conditions
  - Quick check question: What parameters in Mujoco can be modified to create different environmental conditions for robust RL evaluation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: ModifiedParamsEnv interface (set_params, get_params) → Mujoco Physics Engine → Wrappers (DomainRandomization, Adversarial, ProbabilisticActionRobust) → Baseline algorithms (TD3, DR, RARL, M2TD3) → Evaluation system (generate_evaluation_set)
- Critical path: Environment parameter modification → Agent interaction → State update → Performance evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Fixed uncertainty sets provide standardization but may limit real-world applicability; wrappers add flexibility but increase implementation complexity
- Failure signatures: Inconsistent performance across random seeds suggests implementation issues; poor worst-case performance indicates algorithm limitations; high variance suggests insufficient evaluation sampling
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run TD3 on Walker environment with reference parameters only to establish baseline performance
  2. Implement DomainRandomization wrapper and compare average-case performance vs TD3
  3. Use Adversarial wrapper to implement RARL and compare worst-case performance against M2TD3

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the impact of varying the granularity parameter nb_mesh_dim in the evaluation procedure on the reliability and statistical significance of the benchmark results?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using a parameter nb_mesh_dim to control the granularity of evaluation environments in the static case.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide an analysis of how different values of nb_mesh_dim affect the variance and reliability of the benchmark results.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with different values of nb_mesh_dim and analyzing the resulting variance and statistical significance of the performance metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do the performance and robustness of algorithms trained on the uncertainty sets from RARL compare to those trained on the uncertainty sets from M2TD3 across different environments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces two types of uncertainty sets for training and evaluation, one based on RARL and another based on M2TD3.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a direct comparison of the performance and robustness of algorithms trained on these two different uncertainty sets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training and evaluating algorithms using both uncertainty sets across all environments and comparing their performance metrics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the computational costs associated with implementing and running the RRLS benchmark suite, and how do these costs scale with the complexity of the environments and uncertainty sets?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark suite but does not discuss the computational resources required for its implementation and execution.
- Why unresolved: The paper lacks details on the computational requirements and scalability of the benchmark suite.
- What evidence would resolve it: Providing detailed information on the computational resources needed for different environments and uncertainty sets, including time and memory usage.
