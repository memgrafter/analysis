core_contribution: This paper addresses the limitations of spoken term detection (STD)
  by introducing a novel approach that converts speech into discrete, speaker-agnostic
  semantic tokens, enabling efficient text-based retrieval and handling out-of-vocabulary
  terms. The core method employs a bidirectional Mamba encoder within a self-supervised
  learning framework to generate contextual frame-level features, which are then quantized
  into consistent token sequences across varying utterances of the same term.

# BEST-STD: Bidirectional Mamba-Enhanced Speech Tokenization for Spoken Term Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.14100
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14100
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: BEST-STD achieves MAP of 0.86 vs 0.57, MRR of 0.91 vs 0.62, and MTWV of 0.66 vs 0.56 on in-vocabulary terms compared to existing STD baselines

## Executive Summary
BEST-STD introduces a novel approach to spoken term detection by converting speech into discrete, speaker-agnostic semantic tokens using a bidirectional Mamba encoder. This enables efficient text-based retrieval and handles out-of-vocabulary terms while maintaining superior performance compared to existing STD baselines. The system demonstrates significant improvements across multiple metrics including MAP, MRR, and MTWV on both LibriSpeech and TIMIT databases.

## Method Summary
The BEST-STD system employs a bidirectional Mamba encoder within a self-supervised learning framework to generate contextual frame-level features from 96-dimensional Mel-spectrogram inputs. These embeddings are then quantized into discrete tokens using a vector quantizer with an exponential moving average codebook. The system indexes speech segments using bigram tokens and performs retrieval through a two-stage process: coarse search via inverted index followed by fine search using Jaccard similarity. The model is trained on LibriSpeech train-clean-360 and evaluated on both in-vocabulary and out-of-vocabulary query sets.

## Key Results
- BEST-STD achieves MAP of 0.86 vs 0.57, MRR of 0.91 vs 0.62, and MTWV of 0.66 vs 0.56 on in-vocabulary terms compared to existing STD baselines
- The bidirectional Mamba encoder outperforms Transformer models due to better modeling of fine-grained temporal information
- Speech tokens generated by BEST-STD exhibit greater speaker invariance than those from existing tokenizers
- The system handles out-of-vocabulary terms effectively while maintaining efficient retrieval performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The bidirectional Mamba encoder generates more discriminative frame-level embeddings than Transformer models for spoken term detection.
- Mechanism: The bidirectional Mamba processes input in both forward and backward directions, capturing fine-grained local temporal dependencies without positional encodings that may add unwanted temporal detail. The outputs from both directions are combined, enhancing context capture while maintaining focus on local structure critical for STD.
- Core assumption: Fine-grained local temporal information is more important than global temporal structure for distinguishing spoken terms.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our analysis shows that our speech tokens exhibit greater speaker invariance than those from existing tokenizers, making them more suitable for STD tasks."
  - [section] "the bidirectional Mamba outperforms the Transformer. We attribute this difference to the positional encoding employed in Transformers, which may inadequately capture unwanted temporal details. In contrast, the bidirectional Mamba model relies on a simpler temporal model, which is beneficial in the STD context."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus shows related work on bidirectional processing but no direct comparison to Transformers for STD.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Discrete speech tokens generated by BEST-STD are more speaker-invariant than those from existing tokenizers.
- Mechanism: The self-supervised learning framework aligns utterances of the same term using DTW to create anchor-positive frame pairs. The contrastive loss then pushes embeddings of the same term closer while separating embeddings of different terms. The vector quantization step ensures consistent discrete representations across different speakers.
- Core assumption: Speaker variation is the primary source of inconsistency between different utterances of the same term.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our analysis shows that our speech tokens exhibit greater speaker invariance than those from existing tokenizers, making them more suitable for STD tasks."
  - [section] "Our model is trained within a self-supervised learning framework to generate consistent token sequences across different utterances of the same spoken term."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus shows related work on speaker-invariant tokenization but no direct speaker invariance comparisons.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Using an inverted index with bigram tokens enables efficient retrieval compared to DTW-based template matching.
- Mechanism: The system first indexes each speech segment by extracting bigrams from token sequences. During retrieval, it performs coarse search to find candidate frames containing query bigrams, then fine search using Jaccard similarity to rank candidates. This avoids the computational complexity of DTW on continuous features.
- Core assumption: Jaccard similarity on discrete token sequences preserves sufficient information for accurate retrieval while being computationally efficient.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "This facilitates fast retrieval using text-based search algorithms and effectively handles out-of-vocabulary terms."
  - [section] "we use an inverted index to index the tokenized speech archive. We evaluate our method on the LibriSpeech and TIMIT databases, demonstrating its superior performance compared to existing STD baselines while being more efficient."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus shows related work on inverted indexing but no efficiency comparisons.

  - Quick check question: What is the main advantage of converting speech to discrete tokens versus using continuous features for retrieval?

- Concept: Self-supervised learning with contrastive objectives
  - Why needed here: The model learns to generate consistent embeddings for the same term across different utterances without requiring labeled data
  - Quick check question: How does the DTW alignment contribute to creating training pairs in the self-supervised framework?
