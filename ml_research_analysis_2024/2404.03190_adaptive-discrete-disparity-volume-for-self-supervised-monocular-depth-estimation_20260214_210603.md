# Adaptive Discrete Disparity Volume for Self-supervised Monocular Depth Estimation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.03190
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03190
- Authors: Jianwei Ren
- Reference count: 30
- Primary result: ADDV outperforms conventional discretization methods on KITTI dataset with lower depth estimation errors (0.119 AbsRel, 4.892 RMSE with 128 bins)

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of self-supervised monocular depth estimation by proposing a learnable module called Adaptive Discrete Disparity Volume (ADDV). ADDV dynamically generates adaptive bins for depth discretization based on input images, eliminating the need for handcrafted strategies like uniform or spacing-increasing discretization. The module predicts probability volumes over these bins and aggregates them to produce depth maps. To stabilize training without ground truth supervision, the authors introduce two novel strategies: uniformizing, which balances sample distribution across bins, and sharpening, which enhances peak values in probability distributions.

Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that ADDV outperforms conventional discretization methods, achieving lower depth estimation errors and producing higher quality depth maps. The ablation study confirms the effectiveness of uniformizing and sharpening in improving model performance.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces Adaptive Discrete Disparity Volume (ADDV), a learnable module that dynamically generates adaptive bins for depth discretization based on input images. ADDV predicts probability volumes over these bins and aggregates them to produce depth maps. To address the challenge of training without ground truth supervision, the authors propose two strategies: uniformizing, which balances sample distribution across bins, and sharpening, which enhances peak values in probability distributions. These strategies stabilize training and improve depth estimation accuracy.

## Key Results
- ADDV achieves 0.119 AbsRel and 4.892 RMSE on KITTI dataset with 128 bins
- Outperforms conventional discretization methods (uniform and spacing-increasing)
- Ablation study confirms effectiveness of uniformizing and sharpening strategies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
ADDV dynamically adapts bin discretization to the input image, addressing the limitations of handcrafted discretization strategies. By predicting probability volumes over adaptive bins, it captures more nuanced depth information. The uniformizing and sharpening strategies stabilize training by balancing sample distribution and enhancing peak values, respectively, leading to improved depth estimation accuracy.

## Foundational Learning

### Disparity and Depth Relationship
**Why needed:** Depth estimation relies on converting disparity values to depth; understanding this relationship is crucial for accurate 3D reconstruction.
**Quick check:** Verify the inverse relationship between disparity and depth in the model's output.

### Self-supervised Learning
**Why needed:** The model learns depth estimation without ground truth labels, relying on photometric consistency and geometric constraints.
**Quick check:** Ensure the loss function incorporates both photometric and geometric terms for training stability.

### Probability Volume Aggregation
**Why needed:** Aggregating probability volumes over adaptive bins enables the model to produce smooth and accurate depth maps.
**Quick check:** Validate the aggregation process by examining the smoothness and accuracy of the final depth maps.

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component Map
Input Image -> Feature Extraction -> ADDV Module -> Probability Volume Prediction -> Depth Map Aggregation

### Critical Path
The critical path involves feature extraction from the input image, followed by the ADDV module predicting probability volumes over adaptive bins, and finally aggregating these volumes to produce the depth map.

### Design Tradeoffs
- Adaptive discretization vs. fixed discretization: Adaptive discretization allows for more flexible and accurate depth estimation but introduces computational overhead.
- Probability volume prediction vs. direct depth regression: Probability volumes provide a probabilistic interpretation of depth, improving robustness but increasing model complexity.

### Failure Signatures
- Inaccurate depth estimation in regions with complex geometry or textureless areas
- Over-smoothing of depth maps due to aggressive aggregation
- Instability during training due to imbalanced sample distribution across bins

### 3 First Experiments
1. Evaluate depth estimation accuracy on KITTI dataset with varying numbers of adaptive bins (e.g., 64, 128, 256).
2. Compare ADDV's performance with conventional discretization methods (uniform and spacing-increasing) on KITTI dataset.
3. Analyze the impact of uniformizing and sharpening strategies on training stability and depth estimation accuracy.
