# Seed-CTS: Unleashing the Power of Tree Search for Superior Performance in Competitive Coding Tasks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.12544
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12544
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Achieves pass rate of 0.305 on LiveCodeBench-Hard using Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct with token-level MCTS and CoT prompting

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Seed-CTS, a novel token-level Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) approach tailored for competition-level code generation tasks. By integrating MCTS with Chain-of-Thought prompting, the authors demonstrate significant improvements in pass rates on LiveCodeBench-Hard, outperforming established baselines including GPT4o-0513. The method is designed to be model-agnostic and efficient, requiring fewer generations while synthesizing high-quality supervised fine-tuning data. Results highlight the potential of MCTS to elevate the performance of large language models in competitive programming.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a token-level Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) method specifically designed for code generation, combined with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. Leveraging the open-source Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct model, their approach achieves a pass rate of 0.305 on LiveCodeBench-Hard, surpassing the pass@100 performance of GPT4o-0513 (0.245). By incorporating CoT prompting, the method further improves to 0.351, approaching O1-Mini's pass@1 rate. The method is model-agnostic and demonstrates efficiency, with fewer generations required compared to baseline approaches.

## Key Results
- Achieves pass rate of 0.305 on LiveCodeBench-Hard using Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct with token-level MCTS and CoT prompting
- Surpasses pass@100 performance of GPT4o-0513 (0.245) and approaches O1-Mini's pass@1 rate (0.351 with CoT)
- Demonstrates model-agnostic efficiency, requiring fewer generations than baseline approaches

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The integration of token-level MCTS with Chain-of-Thought prompting enables systematic exploration and refinement of code generation paths, leading to higher-quality outputs. MCTS helps navigate the vast search space of possible code solutions by iteratively expanding and evaluating promising branches, while CoT prompting structures the reasoning process, making it more coherent and aligned with human problem-solving strategies. This combination addresses the limitations of standard autoregressive generation in competitive coding tasks, where simple sampling often fails to produce correct or efficient solutions.

## Foundational Learning
- **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**: A search algorithm that balances exploration and exploitation in decision trees, essential for navigating complex code generation spaces. *Quick check*: Verify MCTS can effectively prune irrelevant code branches and focus on promising solutions.
- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**: A prompting strategy that encourages step-by-step reasoning, improving the coherence and correctness of generated code. *Quick check*: Confirm CoT prompts lead to more structured and logical code generation.
- **Competitive Coding Benchmarks**: Standardized datasets like LiveCodeBench-Hard used to evaluate code generation performance. *Quick check*: Ensure benchmarks accurately reflect real-world competitive programming challenges.
- **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**: The process of training models on high-quality labeled data to improve performance. *Quick check*: Validate that synthesized SFT data from MCTS improves downstream model performance.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct -> MCTS Module -> CoT Prompting -> Code Generation -> Evaluation on LiveCodeBench-Hard

**Critical Path:**
Input problem -> CoT Prompting -> MCTS exploration and selection -> Token-level code generation -> Evaluation and pass rate calculation

**Design Tradeoffs:**
- **MCTS granularity**: Token-level search provides fine control but may increase computational cost; coarser search may be faster but less precise.
- **CoT dependency**: CoT prompting boosts performance but may not generalize to all problem types or models.
- **Model agnosticism vs. optimization**: The method is claimed to be model-agnostic, but results are only shown for one model, raising questions about generalizability.

**Failure Signatures:**
- **Poor exploration**: If MCTS fails to explore diverse code paths, it may converge to suboptimal or incorrect solutions.
- **CoT misalignment**: If CoT prompting is not well-matched to the problem domain, it may lead to incoherent or inefficient reasoning.
- **Overfitting to benchmark**: High performance on LiveCodeBench-Hard may not translate to other competitive coding datasets.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Test MCTS with CoT prompting on a held-out set of LiveCodeBench-Hard problems to confirm reproducibility.
2. Run ablation studies: compare performance with and without CoT prompting, and with different MCTS depths.
3. Evaluate computational overhead by measuring inference time and resource usage versus baseline autoregressive generation.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalizability of token-level MCTS approach beyond the specific model and benchmark used remains unclear.
- Computational overhead introduced by MCTS is not fully analyzed, raising practical deployment concerns.
- Mechanism for generating high-quality supervised fine-tuning data is described but not empirically validated.

## Confidence
- **High**: Performance improvements on LiveCodeBench-Hard with Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct + CoT + MCTS.
- **Medium**: Generalizability to other models, benchmarks, or real-world competitive programming scenarios.
- **Low**: Utility and scalability of synthesized SFT data, as validation is lacking.

## Next Checks
1. Test the token-level MCTS approach with a range of open-source and proprietary models (e.g., CodeLlama, GPT-4 variants) on multiple competitive coding benchmarks to assess generalizability.
2. Conduct a detailed ablation study to isolate the contributions of CoT prompting and MCTS, and to quantify computational overhead compared to baseline methods.
3. Generate and evaluate the quality of SFT data produced by the method on held-out problems, measuring its impact on downstream fine-tuning and performance.
