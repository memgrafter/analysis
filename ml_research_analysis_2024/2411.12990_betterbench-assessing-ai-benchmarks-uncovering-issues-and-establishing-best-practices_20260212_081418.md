# BetterBench: Assessing AI Benchmarks, Uncovering Issues, and Establishing Best Practices

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.12990
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12990
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduced BetterBench framework with 46 criteria to assess AI benchmark quality, revealing significant issues in statistical reporting and reproducibility

## Executive Summary
BetterBench introduces a comprehensive framework for evaluating the quality of AI benchmarks, addressing critical gaps in current benchmarking practices. The authors developed 46 assessment criteria based on expert interviews and domain literature, covering the entire benchmark lifecycle from design to maintenance. Applying this framework to 24 benchmarks revealed that commonly used benchmarks suffer from issues like lack of statistical significance reporting and poor reproducibility. The work provides both a practical checklist for researchers and a living repository to promote transparency and higher standards in benchmark development.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted expert interviews and reviewed domain literature to develop 46 assessment criteria organized around the benchmark lifecycle. They applied this framework to 24 AI benchmarks, including 16 foundation model benchmarks and 8 non-foundation model benchmarks. The assessment covered multiple quality dimensions including task relevance, evaluation protocols, statistical rigor, and reproducibility. Results were compiled into a living repository at betterbench.stanford.edu, providing transparency in benchmark quality assessment and serving as a reference for the research community.

## Key Results
- Revealed significant quality differences across AI benchmarks, with commonly used benchmarks failing to adequately report statistical significance
- Identified reproducibility issues as a major concern across both foundation and non-foundation model benchmarks
- Established a checklist for minimum quality assurance and created a living repository of benchmark assessments
- Found that most benchmarks lack proper statistical significance reporting and allow insufficient replication

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by providing systematic, lifecycle-based criteria that capture essential quality dimensions of benchmarks. By combining expert knowledge with literature review, the criteria address both technical and practical aspects of benchmark design and evaluation. The living repository creates accountability and transparency, while the checklist provides actionable guidance for researchers. This structured approach enables consistent evaluation across different types of benchmarks and highlights specific areas for improvement.

## Foundational Learning
- Benchmark lifecycle management: Why needed - Ensures benchmarks remain relevant and useful over time; Quick check - Review maintenance and update procedures
- Statistical significance in AI evaluation: Why needed - Prevents overinterpretation of results; Quick check - Verify p-values and confidence intervals are reported
- Reproducibility standards: Why needed - Enables verification and comparison of results; Quick check - Test if benchmark can be fully replicated with provided materials
- Task relevance assessment: Why needed - Ensures benchmarks measure meaningful capabilities; Quick check - Evaluate alignment with real-world applications
- Evaluation protocol documentation: Why needed - Allows consistent interpretation of results; Quick check - Confirm all evaluation steps are clearly specified
- Bias and fairness considerations: Why needed - Prevents perpetuation of harmful patterns; Quick check - Review for demographic and cultural representation

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Expert interviews -> Literature review -> 46 criteria development -> Benchmark assessment -> Living repository

Critical path: Criteria development → Application to benchmarks → Quality assessment → Repository creation → Community adoption

Design tradeoffs: Comprehensive criteria vs. practical applicability; Expert input vs. standardized evaluation; Living repository maintenance vs. static documentation

Failure signatures: Inconsistent application of criteria; Overemphasis on certain quality dimensions; Incomplete benchmark documentation; Lack of community engagement

First experiments:
1. Apply BetterBench criteria to 5 new benchmarks and compare results with original assessors
2. Test checklist effectiveness by having researchers use it to develop new benchmarks
3. Conduct user study to evaluate repository usability and information accessibility

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Potential subjectivity in applying the 46 assessment criteria across different benchmarks
- Sample size of 24 benchmarks may not capture full spectrum of AI benchmarking practices
- Effectiveness depends on community adoption of the checklist and repository

## Confidence
- High: Identification of common issues in existing benchmarks regarding statistical significance reporting
- High: Findings on reproducibility problems across both foundation and non-foundation model benchmarks
- Medium: Generalizability of findings across all AI benchmarks given the relatively small sample size
- Medium: Long-term impact and adoption of proposed checklist and repository

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a larger-scale validation study applying BetterBench to at least 50 additional benchmarks across diverse AI domains to assess the framework's scalability and consistency.

2. Implement a blind review process where multiple independent assessors apply the BetterBench criteria to the same benchmarks to measure inter-rater reliability and refine ambiguous criteria.

3. Track citation and adoption rates of benchmarks that score highly on BetterBench versus those that score poorly over a 2-year period to empirically validate whether quality assessments predict real-world impact and research community trust.
