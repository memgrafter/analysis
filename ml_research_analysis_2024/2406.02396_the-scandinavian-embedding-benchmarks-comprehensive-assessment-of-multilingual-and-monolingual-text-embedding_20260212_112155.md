## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the Scandinavian Embedding Benchmark (SEB), a comprehensive evaluation framework for text embeddings across Danish, Swedish, Norwegian (Bokmål and Nynorsk), and Bornholmsk. SEB addresses the lack of multilingual embedding benchmarks for Scandinavian languages by providing 24 datasets spanning 10 subtasks across 4 task categories, covering domains such as news, government, fiction, and social media. The authors evaluate over 26 models, including both publicly available and commercial solutions, revealing significant performance disparities between them.

## Method Summary
SEB evaluates text embeddings through 24 datasets across four task categories: Retrieval, Bitext Mining, Classification, and Clustering. The benchmark covers 10 subtasks using metrics like accuracy, F1, NDCG@10, and V-measure. The evaluation includes 26+ models spanning self-supervised (BERT variants, XLM-R, fastText), supervised (LaBSE, MiniLM, MPNet, e5 models, SONAR models), and commercial APIs (OpenAI, Cohere). SEB implements a model registry documenting exact implementations and prompts, expanding upon MTEB's reproducibility. Dataset sizes are capped at 2048 examples to enable evaluation on consumer-grade hardware.

## Key Results
- Commercial APIs from OpenAI and Cohere achieve the highest scores (60+), significantly outperforming public models (50-55)
- The publicly available multilingual E5 model series ranks second after commercial APIs
- Self-supervised models show notable improvements with unsupervised contrastive pre-training but still lag behind supervised counterparts
- Performance varies significantly across task types and domains, with retrieval and classification tasks showing different model preferences

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** The benchmark's multilingual performance evaluation is valid due to strong cross-lingual transfer among Scandinavian languages.
- **Mechanism:** The authors leverage documented high cross-lingual transfer (Nielsen, 2023) to collectively evaluate all mainland Scandinavian languages, effectively expanding coverage despite limited resources for each individual language.
- **Core assumption:** Cross-lingual transfer between Scandinavian languages is sufficient to produce meaningful performance comparisons.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "we choose to utilize the substantial cross-lingual transfer between these languages demonstrated by Nielsen (2023)"; [section 3.1] "we rely on the high degree of cross-lingual transfer (Nielsen, 2023) to estimate model performance more accurately"
- **Break condition:** If cross-lingual transfer is significantly weaker than assumed, or if models exploit spurious correlations that don't transfer, the benchmark's validity would be compromised.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Commercial APIs outperform public models due to superior training data and optimization.
- **Mechanism:** Commercial models (OpenAI, Cohere) achieve 60+ scores while best public models hover around 50-55, suggesting access to proprietary data, compute resources, or optimization techniques unavailable to the public.
- **Core assumption:** Performance differences stem from fundamental advantages in training rather than benchmark-specific artifacts.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 5] "the best-performing model is either of the commercial APIs of OpenAI and Cohere followed by the publicly available multilingual e5 model series"; [section 5] "we see that there is still a notable gap in performance between publicly available text embedding models and their commercial counterparts"
- **Break condition:** If the benchmark is biased toward commercial models' strengths or if commercial models overfit to benchmark-specific patterns.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** Model registry and reproducibility mechanisms ensure reliable benchmark comparisons.
- **Mechanism:** SEB implements a model registry documenting exact implementations and prompts, addressing MTEB's reproducibility issues and enabling fair model comparisons.
- **Core assumption:** Precise documentation of model configurations and evaluation procedures eliminates variability that could skew results.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section 1.1] "SEB implements a model registry that allows for the easy addition of new models as well as documents the exact implementation of existing models evaluated in the benchmark"; [section 1] "SEB expands upon the reproducibility of MTEB by including a model registry for all evaluated models"
- **Break condition:** If model registry documentation is incomplete or if undocumented implementation details still affect results.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Cross-lingual transfer in NLP
  - Why needed here: The benchmark's validity relies on cross-lingual transfer between Scandinavian languages being strong enough to enable meaningful comparisons
  - Quick check question: If Danish and Swedish have 80% lexical overlap but different grammatical structures, would cross-lingual transfer still be reliable for embedding evaluation?

- **Concept:** Embedding evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1, NDCG, V-measure)
  - Why needed here: Different task types require different evaluation metrics, and understanding their meaning is crucial for interpreting results
  - Quick check question: Why does the benchmark use V-measure for clustering instead of simple accuracy?

- **Concept:** Embedding model architectures (BERT, XLM-R, E5 series)
  - Why needed here: Understanding the differences between self-supervised and supervised models, and between monolingual and multilingual approaches, is essential for analyzing performance patterns
  - Quick check question: How would a model trained with contrastive learning differ from one trained with masked language modeling?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Dataset loader (24 datasets across 4 task categories) -> Model registry (26+ models with documented implementations) -> Evaluation pipeline (classification, retrieval, clustering, bitext mining) -> Result aggregation and visualization (dashboard, confidence intervals) -> Cache system (public cache for model outputs)
- **Critical path:** Dataset → Model embedding → Task-specific evaluation → Metric aggregation → Dashboard visualization
- **Design tradeoffs:** Dataset size limit (2048 examples) vs comprehensive evaluation; Cross-lingual evaluation vs language-specific accuracy; Reproducibility documentation vs development speed; Public vs commercial model inclusion
- **Failure signatures:** Dataset loading errors (missing revisions, broken URLs); Model embedding failures (OOM, incompatible formats); Metric calculation errors (mismatched labels, invalid splits); Cache corruption (stale results, missing entries)
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Run benchmark with single dataset (e.g., DaLAJ) and single model (e.g., xlm-roberta-large) to verify basic pipeline; 2) Add a simple new model to registry and verify it appears in dashboard; 3) Test cache functionality by running same evaluation twice and verifying speedup

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal balance between model size and performance for Scandinavian language embedding tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses performance versus throughput trade-offs in Figure 3, showing different model categories' performance relative to their speed
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides empirical comparisons, it doesn't establish definitive guidelines for selecting the optimal model size based on specific use cases or resource constraints
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic evaluation of model performance across varying hardware constraints and specific Scandinavian language application scenarios

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does domain-specific fine-tuning affect performance for Scandinavian language embeddings?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper shows domain-specific performance variations in Table 4 but doesn't explore fine-tuning effects
- Why unresolved: The current benchmark evaluates pre-trained models without examining how domain-specific adaptation might improve results for specialized Scandinavian domains
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments comparing domain-adapted versus general-purpose models across Scandinavian-specific domains like legal, medical, and governmental texts

### Open Question 3
- Question: How transferable are embedding models between Scandinavian languages?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions high cross-lingual transfer between Scandinavian languages but doesn't quantify this relationship
- Why unresolved: While the benchmark covers multiple Scandinavian languages, it doesn't measure performance degradation when models are applied to different languages
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis of model performance when trained on one Scandinavian language and evaluated on others, measuring transfer efficiency

### Open Question 4
- Question: What is the relationship between self-supervised pre-training and downstream performance for Scandinavian languages?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows that SimCSE improves performance over base models but doesn't fully explore optimal pre-training strategies
- Why unresolved: The analysis only compares a few pre-training variants without exploring the full parameter space of contrastive learning techniques
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic ablation studies varying pre-training objectives, dataset sizes, and contrastive learning parameters for Scandinavian language models

### Open Question 5
- Question: What is the optimal embedding size for Scandinavian language tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper shows different embedding sizes but doesn't establish optimal dimensions for Scandinavian languages
- Why unresolved: The analysis presents various model sizes but doesn't systematically explore how embedding dimensionality affects Scandinavian language performance
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments varying embedding dimensions while holding other factors constant, measuring performance across different Scandinavian language tasks

## Limitations
- Benchmark's validity relies on unquantified cross-lingual transfer assumptions between Scandinavian languages
- Limited dataset sizes (capped at 2048 examples) may not capture performance on larger-scale tasks
- Commercial API evaluation depends on availability and potential rate limits affecting reproducibility

## Confidence
- **High confidence:** Performance ranking of models (commercial APIs outperforming public models), reproducibility mechanisms (model registry), and overall benchmark infrastructure
- **Medium confidence:** Cross-lingual transfer assumptions and their impact on multilingual evaluation validity
- **Low confidence:** Exact implementation details for anonymized components (SimCSE pretraining, translate-e5-large baseline)

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-lingual transfer validation:** Measure actual performance variance when evaluating models on language-specific vs cross-lingual splits for each Scandinavian language pair to quantify transfer reliability
2. **Dataset size sensitivity analysis:** Evaluate whether performance rankings remain stable when increasing dataset sizes beyond the 2048 example limit
3. **Reproducibility audit:** Independently implement one commercial API model and one self-supervised model from scratch using only the model registry documentation to verify the reproducibility claims
