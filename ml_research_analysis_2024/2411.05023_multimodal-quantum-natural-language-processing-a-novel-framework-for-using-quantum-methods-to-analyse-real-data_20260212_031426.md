# Multimodal Quantum Natural Language Processing: A Novel Framework for using Quantum Methods to Analyse Real Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.05023
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05023

- Primary result: Syntax-based quantum models outperform bag-of-words and sequential models in multimodal image-text classification

## Executive Summary
This study introduces a novel framework for Multimodal Quantum Natural Language Processing (MQNLP) that integrates quantum methods with image-text classification tasks. Using the Lambeq toolkit, the framework encodes sentence-image pairs into quantum circuits and evaluates four compositional models—syntax-based (DisCoCat, TreeReader), bag-of-words, and sequential (Cups, Stairs). The research demonstrates that syntax-based models achieve significantly higher accuracy, with DisCoCat reaching 63.18% on unstructured verb-focused data and TreeReader achieving 56% on structured syntactic data. The work highlights the potential of quantum approaches for multimodal tasks while identifying current limitations in image representation dimensionality.

## Method Summary
The study develops a quantum framework for multimodal image-text classification by converting sentence-image pairs into quantum circuits using four compositional models: DisCoCat, TreeReader, Cups, Stairs, and Bag-of-Words. Sentence structures are parsed into string diagrams via Lambeq, then mapped to quantum circuits using an ansatz that allocates 1 qubit each for AtomicType.NOUN and AtomicType.SENTENCE, and 5 qubits for image features. Images are processed through ResNet to extract 20-dimensional feature vectors. The text and image quantum circuits are merged and trained using the SPSA optimizer with BCE loss over 200 epochs (unstructured) or 120 epochs (structured). Two datasets were created: one for verb understanding (unstructured, ~350 samples) and one for syntactic structure handling (structured, ~130 samples).

## Key Results
- Syntax-based models (DisCoCat, TreeReader) significantly outperformed bag-of-words and sequential models in both datasets
- DisCoCat achieved 63.18% average accuracy on unstructured verb-focused dataset
- TreeReader achieved 56% accuracy on structured syntactic dataset
- Bag-of-words models struggled with structured data due to lack of syntactic awareness
- Despite low-dimensional image vectors (20D), models achieved >60% accuracy on average

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Syntax-based models outperform bag-of-words and sequential models because they explicitly encode grammatical structure, enabling better semantic understanding.
- Mechanism: DisCoCat and TreeReader models use categorial grammar and CCG derivations to map sentence structure into quantum circuits. This preserves word-type relationships and hierarchical composition, which quantum circuits can then manipulate with entanglement and superposition to capture dependencies.
- Core assumption: Grammatical structure is essential for distinguishing subtle differences in sentence meaning, especially when verbs or word order change.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Results revealed that syntax-based models, specifically DisCoCat and TreeReader, significantly outperformed others by effectively leveraging their understanding of grammatical structure."
  - [section 3.1.2] "DisCoCat model which integrates distributional semantics with categorical compositionality to model the meaning of natural language."
  - [corpus] Weak: corpus lacks explicit QM experiments validating the grammatical advantage claim.
- Break condition: If grammatical structure is not relevant to the classification task (e.g., purely keyword-based retrieval), syntax-based models may not outperform simpler models.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Quantum circuits can encode both linguistic and visual features in a unified parameterized representation, enabling multimodal classification.
- Mechanism: The framework maps sentence diagrams and image feature vectors into quantum states using an ansatz. Parameterized gates evolve these states; measurement yields classification probabilities. The use of entanglement between text and image qubits captures cross-modal dependencies.
- Core assumption: Quantum superposition and entanglement can encode multimodal interactions more efficiently than classical concatenation or attention.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "To convert the merged diagram into a quantum circuit... apply an ansatz to the final diagram containing both image and text representations."
  - [section 4.1] "The ansatz for this approach employs the Sim14Ansatz... distribute 1 qubit each for AtomicType.NOUN, AtomicType.SENTENCE, and... 5 qubits were allocated to image type."
  - [corpus] Weak: corpus neighbors focus on quantum NLP but lack multimodal image-text experiments.
- Break condition: If quantum hardware noise dominates or if classical embeddings suffice, the quantum advantage may not materialize.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Lower-dimensional image vectors (20D) still enable competitive classification because quantum models capture higher-order feature interactions beyond classical linear combinations.
- Mechanism: The ResNet feature extractor compresses images to 20 dimensions; quantum circuits then embed these into Hilbert space where non-linear feature interactions emerge through gate operations. This compensates for the loss of raw detail in classical models.
- Core assumption: Quantum embeddings can recover expressive power lost in classical dimensionality reduction.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 5.2] "Despite this limitation, many models averaged more than 60% accuracy, indicating that the model is learning effectively."
  - [section 4.1] "This distribution resulted in 20 parameters to represent each image, producing a 20-dimensional feature vector during feature extraction."
  - [corpus] Weak: corpus lacks direct comparison of low-D quantum vs high-D classical performance.
- Break condition: If quantum circuits cannot exploit the Hilbert space structure (e.g., due to limited depth), low-dimensional features may be insufficient.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Category Theory & String Diagrams
  - Why needed here: Provides the mathematical foundation for representing linguistic compositionality in quantum circuits; ensures that grammatical structure is preserved during encoding.
  - Quick check question: How does a cup in a string diagram differ from a cap, and what linguistic role does each represent?

- Concept: Quantum Circuit Ansatz Design
  - Why needed here: Determines how many qubits and layers are used for text and image; affects expressivity and trainability of the model.
  - Quick check question: Why allocate 5 qubits to image type versus 1 qubit to sentence type in the Sim14Ansatz?

- Concept: Optimization in Noisy Quantum Simulators
  - Why needed here: Training quantum circuits on simulators requires careful choice of optimizer and hyperparameters to avoid vanishing gradients and noise.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the perturbation factor (c) in SPSA, and why is it set to 0.06 here?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Sentence parser -> String diagram -> Quantum circuit (text) + Image feature extractor (20D) -> Quantum embedding (image) -> Merge circuits -> Unified parameterized circuit -> SPSA training -> Classification output
- Critical path: Parse → Encode → Merge → Train → Evaluate
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Low-dimensional image vectors reduce computational load but may lose detail
  - Simple SPSA optimizer is noise-tolerant but slower to converge than gradient-based methods
  - Small datasets keep training feasible on simulators but limit generalization
- Failure signatures:
  - Uniform training metrics across iterations (bag-of-words on structured data)
  - High variance between best and average results (Cups on structured data)
  - Vanishing gradient with small learning rate
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train DisCoCat on unstructured dataset; observe verb-based accuracy improvement.
  2. Swap image feature dimension from 20D to 50D; measure impact on convergence.
  3. Replace SPSA with Adam (simulated) to compare convergence speed and stability.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would the performance of DisCoCat and TreeReader change with higher-dimensional image feature vectors (e.g., 2048 dimensions instead of 20)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that using 20-dimensional feature vectors from ResNet was a limitation, and higher-dimensional vectors (2048) are commonly used in classical models.
- Why unresolved: The study used 20-dimensional feature vectors due to computational constraints, so the impact of higher dimensions on quantum model performance remains untested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing the same models with 2048-dimensional image vectors and comparing their accuracy and training dynamics against the 20-dimensional results.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How would the models perform if trained on a significantly larger dataset (e.g., 15,000+ samples) as used in classical classifiers?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly states that dataset size was a limitation and that larger datasets (often exceeding 15,000 samples) are common in classical research.
- Why unresolved: The study used a subset of approximately 350 entries for the unstructured dataset and 130 for the structured dataset due to quantum simulator limitations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training the models on datasets of 15,000+ samples and evaluating whether accuracy improves significantly and if training stability increases.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How would deploying these models on actual quantum hardware (rather than simulators) affect their performance and training dynamics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that current noise levels from NISQ devices may not directly impact performance improvements, but it would be interesting to see how models perform as quantum technology advances.
- Why unresolved: The study used quantum simulators with JAX as the backend, so real quantum hardware effects like noise and decoherence were not tested.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing the models on available quantum hardware and measuring accuracy, convergence speed, and sensitivity to noise compared to simulator results.

## Limitations

- Small dataset sizes (350 and 130 samples) limit generalization and robustness of findings
- No empirical comparison with classical baselines using identical low-dimensional features
- Current quantum simulators may not accurately represent noise and constraints of real quantum hardware

## Confidence

- Syntax-based model superiority: **Medium**
- Quantum advantage in multimodal fusion: **Low**
- Low-dimensional image features sufficiency: **Low**

## Next Checks

1. **Benchmark against classical counterparts**: Train identical compositional models (DisCoCat, TreeReader, etc.) using classical ML frameworks with the same 20-dimensional image features to isolate quantum-specific effects.

2. **Dataset generalization test**: Evaluate models on established multimodal datasets like Flickr30k or VQA to assess performance beyond the constructed verb-based and structured sentence pairs.

3. **Quantum circuit depth analysis**: Systematically vary the number of ansatz layers and measure impact on convergence and accuracy to determine whether current circuit depth is optimal or limiting performance.
