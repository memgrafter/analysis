# Talking the Talk Does Not Entail Walking the Walk: On the Limits of Large Language Models in Lexical Entailment Recognition

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2406.14894
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14894
- **Reference count**: 13
- **Key outcome**: Large language models demonstrate moderate performance in recognizing verb entailment relations, with indirect prompting and few-shot examples improving results, though no model perfectly solves the task.

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates eight large language models on their ability to recognize lexical entailment relations among verbs using WordNet and HyperLex datasets. The researchers test various prompting strategies including direct questioning, indirect relational definitions, and reverse negation approaches, both in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Results show that models perform moderately well but struggle with perfect accuracy, with Llama-3 and GPT-3.5 showing the most improvement from few-shot examples. Notably, models exhibit high confidence regardless of their actual accuracy, highlighting a gap between perceived and actual understanding.

## Method Summary
The study employs eight LLMs (GPT-3.5, Llama-3, Llama-2, Mistral, Falcon, Vicuna, NeuralChat, Gemma) to classify verb pairs as entailing or non-entailing using WordNet (116,842 pairs) and HyperLex (453 pairs). Three prompt types are tested: Direct (explicit entailment question), Indirect (relational function definition), and Reverse (negation-based). Both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios are evaluated using two few-shot strategies: HyperLex-FS (using HyperLex scores) and Fellbaum-FS (using Fellbaum taxonomy examples). Models are evaluated on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confidence ratings, with temperature set to near 0 and top_p=50, top_k=1 for constrained generation.

## Key Results
- Models show moderate performance on lexical entailment recognition, with best results under indirect prompting
- Few-shot prompting with Fellbaum-based examples significantly improves model performance
- Llama-3 and GPT-3.5 demonstrate the most improvement with few-shot examples
- All models exhibit high confidence regardless of accuracy, suggesting overconfidence in predictions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Direct prompting with verb definitions improves model performance on entailment recognition
- **Mechanism**: Including synset definitions in prompts provides explicit semantic context that helps LLMs disambiguate verb meanings and resolve entailment relationships more accurately
- **Core assumption**: LLMs can effectively utilize explicit definitional context to improve semantic understanding of verbs
- **Evidence anchors**: Weak - no direct corpus evidence for definition effectiveness, but inference from comparison of WordNet vs HyperLex results
- **Break condition**: If verb definitions are ambiguous, incomplete, or the LLM lacks the capacity to effectively integrate definitional context into its reasoning

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Few-shot prompting with Fellbaum-based examples significantly improves model performance
- **Mechanism**: Providing examples of different entailment types from the Fellbaum taxonomy helps LLMs learn the patterns and distinctions between various entailment relationships
- **Core assumption**: LLMs can generalize from a small set of examples to recognize entailment patterns in new verb pairs
- **Evidence anchors**: Moderate - corpus shows Fellbaum-FS consistently outperforms other few-shot strategies, but doesn't explain why
- **Break condition**: If examples are not representative of the full range of entailment types or if the LLM cannot generalize from the provided examples

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Indirect prompting with relational definitions outperforms direct prompting
- **Mechanism**: Defining entailment through a relational function (F) without using the word "entail" forces LLMs to reason about the relationship structure rather than relying on memorized associations
- **Core assumption**: LLMs can understand and apply abstract relational definitions to determine entailment relationships
- **Evidence anchors**: Moderate - corpus shows indirect prompting often outperforms direct prompting, but doesn't explain the underlying mechanism
- **Break condition**: If the relational definition is too abstract or if the LLM relies too heavily on surface-level pattern matching rather than semantic understanding

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Lexical entailment and verb semantics
  - Why needed here: Understanding the task requires grasping how verb meanings relate to each other through entailment relationships
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between hyponymy and troponymy in verb entailment?

- **Concept**: Prompt engineering and few-shot learning
  - Why needed here: The study heavily relies on different prompting strategies and in-context learning to evaluate model capabilities
  - Quick check question: How does the structure of a prompt affect an LLM's ability to perform a task?

- **Concept**: Evaluation metrics for classification tasks
  - Why needed here: Understanding accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score is crucial for interpreting the experimental results
  - Quick check question: When would you prioritize precision over recall in evaluating a classification model?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data preparation -> Prompt definition -> Model deployment with Guidance framework -> Response evaluation -> Analysis of results
- **Critical path**: Data preparation → Prompt definition → Model deployment with Guidance framework → Response evaluation → Analysis of results
- **Design tradeoffs**: Zero-shot vs few-shot prompting balances simplicity and performance; Direct vs Indirect prompting balances clarity and abstraction; WordNet vs HyperLex balances comprehensiveness and specificity
- **Failure signatures**: Consistent incorrect answers across all models suggest dataset or task definition issues; model-specific failures suggest architectural limitations; confidence without accuracy suggests overconfidence or misalignment
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Run Direct prompt on a small subset of WordNet data with one model to verify basic functionality
  2. Compare Direct vs Indirect prompting on the same subset to observe performance differences
  3. Implement few-shot prompting with HyperLex-FS examples and compare results to zero-shot performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does fine-tuning LLMs on domain-specific verb entailment data significantly improve their performance on recognizing lexical entailment relations compared to zero-shot prompting?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions that some models benefit from few-shot prompting with examples based on HyperLex or Fellbaum, and that TaxoLLaMA (fine-tuned on WordNet) underperformed compared to Llama-3
- Why unresolved: The study focused on general-purpose LLMs and a limited set of few-shot examples. It did not explore extensive fine-tuning on domain-specific data or compare the impact of fine-tuning versus few-shot learning
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments where LLMs are fine-tuned on large, domain-specific datasets of verb entailment relations and comparing their performance to zero-shot and few-shot prompting baselines

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of LLMs in recognizing verb entailment relations vary across different languages and multilingual models?
- Basis in paper: The authors state that their evaluation was conducted exclusively in English and that results may differ in other languages
- Why unresolved: The study did not extend its evaluation to multilingual models or other languages, leaving the generalizability of the findings to other linguistic contexts unexplored
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the same LLMs and prompting strategies on multilingual datasets and comparing their performance across different languages

### Open Question 3
- Question: What specific aspects of verb semantics (e.g., tense, aspect, modality) pose the greatest challenges for LLMs in recognizing lexical entailment relations?
- Basis in paper: The paper discusses the complexity of verb meanings and mentions that handling verb entailment is crucial in various NLP tasks, but does not provide a detailed analysis of which semantic features are most problematic
- Why unresolved: While the study highlights the difficulty of the task, it does not break down the performance by specific semantic features or analyze the types of errors made by the models
- What evidence would resolve it: Analyzing model performance on verb pairs with varying semantic features and conducting error analysis to identify patterns in the types of entailment relations that are most frequently misclassified

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to English verbs only, limiting generalizability to other languages
- Datasets may not fully capture real-world entailment complexity, relying on curated linguistic resources
- Confidence scores are self-assessed on a 1-10 scale, which may not accurately reflect true uncertainty

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The finding that LLMs demonstrate moderate performance in lexical entailment recognition, with variation across models and prompting strategies. This is directly supported by the experimental results showing consistent accuracy scores across multiple runs and datasets.

**Medium Confidence**: The claim that few-shot prompting improves performance, particularly with Fellbaum-based examples. While results show improvement, the mechanism behind why certain few-shot strategies work better than others remains unclear.

**Low Confidence**: The assertion that no model perfectly solves the task. While no model achieved perfect accuracy, the study does not establish a clear threshold for what constitutes "solving" the task, making this claim somewhat arbitrary.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-linguistic validation**: Replicate the study with multilingual datasets and models to assess whether the observed patterns hold across languages, particularly for languages with different verb structures or entailment patterns.
2. **Real-world entailment evaluation**: Test models on naturally occurring text data rather than curated datasets to evaluate performance on authentic entailment relationships encountered in practice.
3. **Calibration analysis**: Conduct a thorough analysis of model confidence calibration by comparing self-reported confidence scores with actual accuracy across different difficulty levels of entailment pairs.
