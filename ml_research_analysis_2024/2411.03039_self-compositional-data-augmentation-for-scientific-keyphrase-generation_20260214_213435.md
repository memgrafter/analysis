core_contribution: The paper addresses the challenge of generating keyphrases for
  documents, particularly absent keyphrases, which require a high level of understanding
  and extrapolation. The authors propose a self-compositional data augmentation method
  that generates synthetic training samples by combining pairs of documents from the
  training set based on shared keyphrases.

# Self-Compositional Data Augmentation for Scientific Keyphrase Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.03039
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03039
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Proposed self-compositional data augmentation improves keyphrase generation performance across computer science, biomedical, and news domains

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of generating keyphrases for documents, particularly absent keyphrases that require high-level understanding and extrapolation. The authors propose a novel self-compositional data augmentation method that generates synthetic training samples by combining pairs of documents from the training set based on shared keyphrases. This approach leverages the relatedness of documents to create coherent and diverse training samples without relying on external data or resources. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in keyphrase generation performance, particularly for absent keyphrases.

## Method Summary
The proposed method involves constructing a heterogeneous graph representation of the dataset where documents and keyphrases are nodes connected by edges. The graph construction identifies pairs of related documents based on shared keyphrases, which are then combined to generate synthetic training samples. The method creates new document-keyphrase pairs by merging content from related documents while preserving keyphrase relevance. This self-compositional approach allows models to learn from expanded training data that captures document relationships and improves generalization, especially for generating absent keyphrases that require extrapolation beyond the source text.

## Key Results
- Statistically significant improvements in both present and absent keyphrase generation on the KP20k dataset
- Consistent performance gains across computer science, biomedical, and news domain datasets
- Enhanced generative capabilities leading to increased proportion of absent keyphrases in generated sequences
- Improved representativity of generated keyphrases as confirmed through qualitative analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by leveraging document relatedness through shared keyphrases to create synthetic training samples. By combining pairs of related documents, the model learns to generate keyphrases that bridge concepts across documents, improving its ability to extrapolate and generate absent keyphrases. The heterogeneous graph construction captures semantic relationships that may not be evident from individual documents alone, allowing the model to learn richer representations of how keyphrases relate to document content.

## Foundational Learning

### Document-keyphrase relationship modeling
- Why needed: Core to understanding how keyphrases are generated from document content
- Quick check: Can the model identify keyphrases that appear in the source text versus those requiring inference

### Heterogeneous graph construction
- Why needed: Enables identification of document relationships based on shared keyphrases
- Quick check: Graph density and connectivity metrics indicate quality of document pairing

### Document composition techniques
- Why needed: Critical for generating coherent synthetic documents that preserve keyphrase relevance
- Quick check: ROUGE scores between synthetic and source documents measure coherence preservation

## Architecture Onboarding

### Component map
Document corpus -> Heterogeneous graph construction -> Document pair extraction -> Synthetic sample generation -> Training data augmentation -> Keyphrase generation model

### Critical path
The most critical path is: Heterogeneous graph construction → Document pair extraction → Synthetic sample generation. This determines the quality and relevance of augmented data, directly impacting model performance.

### Design tradeoffs
- Graph construction parameters (minimum keyphrase overlap threshold) vs. sample diversity
- Document combination strategies (content merging approaches) vs. synthetic sample coherence
- Training time increase vs. performance improvement from augmented data

### Failure signatures
- Poor graph construction leading to irrelevant document pairs and noisy training samples
- Overly conservative combination strategies resulting in minimal augmentation benefits
- Excessive synthetic sample generation causing training instability or overfitting

### First experiments
1. Baseline keyphrase generation performance without augmentation
2. Ablation study with different minimum keyphrase overlap thresholds for graph construction
3. Comparison of different document combination strategies (concatenation vs. summarization-based merging)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but implicit questions include the scalability of graph construction for very large document collections and the method's effectiveness across different languages and non-scientific domains.

## Limitations
- Heterogeneous graph construction relies heavily on keyphrase overlap, potentially missing semantically related documents with different vocabulary
- Performance in extremely low-resource settings (fewer than 1000 training samples) is not clearly established
- Computational overhead of graph construction and synthetic sample generation is not discussed

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| Experimental methodology and statistical significance on KP20k | High |
| Cross-domain generalization | Medium (results show variability) |
| Qualitative improvements in absent keyphrase generation | Medium (partly subjective evaluation) |

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of different graph construction parameters to overall performance
2. Test the method on extremely low-resource settings (fewer than 1000 training samples)
3. Measure and report the computational overhead of the self-compositional augmentation process compared to standard training approaches
