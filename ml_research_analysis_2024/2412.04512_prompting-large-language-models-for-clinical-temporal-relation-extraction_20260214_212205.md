# Prompting Large Language Models for Clinical Temporal Relation Extraction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.04512
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04512
- Reference count: 40
- Four LLMs evaluated for clinical temporal relation extraction with state-of-the-art performance achieved

## Executive Summary
This study evaluates prompt tuning techniques for large language models in clinical temporal relation extraction tasks. The research compares four LLMs (GatorTron-Base/Large, LLaMA3-8B, and MeLLaMA-13B) across various fine-tuning strategies including standard fine-tuning, hard-prompting, soft-prompting, and LoRA adapters. The work examines both few-shot and fully supervised learning settings to understand how these models perform under different data availability conditions.

The results demonstrate that appropriate model selection and fine-tuning strategies significantly impact performance in clinical temporal relation extraction. In fully supervised settings, GatorTron-Base with hard-prompting achieved the highest F1 score of 89.54%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 3.74%. The study also reveals interesting patterns in few-shot learning, where encoder-based models with frozen parameters generally outperform decoder-based models, with performance improvements plateauing after 4-shot scenarios.

## Method Summary
The study employed a comprehensive evaluation of prompt tuning techniques on four large language models for clinical temporal relation extraction. The experimental design included four fine-tuning strategies: standard fine-tuning (updating all model parameters), hard-prompting (fixed template-based prompts), soft-prompting (learnable prompt embeddings), and LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters. These strategies were tested on both encoder-based models (GatorTron variants) and decoder-only models (LLaMA3-8B, MeLLaMA-13B) using the THYME clinical dataset. The evaluation covered both few-shot scenarios (1-shot, 4-shot, 8-shot) with frozen parameters and fully supervised settings with full parameter updates.

## Key Results
- GatorTron-Base with hard-prompting achieved 89.54% F1 score in fully supervised settings, outperforming SOTA by 3.74%
- GatorTron-Large with LoRA and standard fine-tuning of GatorTron-Base outperformed SOTA by 2.36% and 1.88%, respectively
- Encoder-based models with frozen parameters generally outperformed decoder-based models in few-shot scenarios
- Performance improved from 1-shot to 4-shot settings but plateaued beyond that point

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of hard-prompting and full fine-tuning strategies in clinical temporal relation extraction appears to stem from the ability of these approaches to effectively leverage the rich linguistic and domain knowledge embedded in pre-trained models. Hard-prompting provides consistent template structures that guide the model's attention toward temporal relation patterns, while full fine-tuning allows for comprehensive adaptation to clinical domain specifics. The superior performance of encoder-based models with frozen parameters in few-shot settings suggests that these architectures may better preserve pre-trained knowledge while still being able to extract relevant features for temporal relation tasks. The plateauing of few-shot performance beyond 4 examples indicates a fundamental limit to how much information can be effectively extracted from extremely limited examples without parameter updates.

## Foundational Learning
- Clinical temporal relation extraction - Identifying temporal relationships between events in clinical text; needed to understand the specific NLP task being addressed
- Prompt tuning techniques - Methods for adapting pre-trained LLMs to specific tasks; needed to grasp the different fine-tuning strategies compared
- Few-shot learning - Training with limited examples; needed to understand the experimental design and its relevance to clinical applications
- LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) - Parameter-efficient fine-tuning method; needed to understand one of the key technical approaches tested
- Encoder-decoder vs decoder-only architectures - Different LLM architectural approaches; needed to interpret performance differences across model types
- Hard vs soft prompting - Fixed template vs learnable prompt embeddings; needed to understand the prompting strategy comparison

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
GatorTron-Base/Large -> Hard/Soft Prompting/LoRA/Standard Fine-tuning -> F1 Score Evaluation
LLaMA3-8B/MeLLaMA-13B -> Hard/Soft Prompting/LoRA/Standard Fine-tuning -> F1 Score Evaluation

**Critical Path**
Model selection → Fine-tuning strategy application → Evaluation on THYME dataset → Performance comparison → Analysis of few-shot vs fully supervised results

**Design Tradeoffs**
The study balances model capacity (GatorTron vs LLaMA3 vs MeLLaMA) against fine-tuning efficiency (LoRA vs full fine-tuning vs prompting). Hard prompting offers template consistency but may lack flexibility, while soft prompting provides adaptability but requires more training. The few-shot evaluation highlights the tension between model generalization capabilities and the need for task-specific adaptation in resource-constrained clinical settings.

**Failure Signatures**
Performance degradation likely occurs when: 1) Clinical domain mismatch between pre-training and target data, 2) Temporal relation complexity exceeds model's contextual understanding, 3) Few-shot settings lack sufficient examples for proper adaptation, 4) Prompt templates fail to capture temporal relation patterns adequately.

**First Experiments**
1. Test all four fine-tuning strategies on a small validation subset to identify initial performance trends
2. Compare frozen-parameter performance across all models in 1-shot scenario to establish baseline capabilities
3. Evaluate hard-prompting vs soft-prompting on GatorTron-Base to understand prompting strategy effectiveness

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited exploration of alternative prompting strategies beyond hard-prompting and soft-prompting
- Use of a single clinical dataset (THYME) which may not generalize to other clinical domains or languages
- Lack of comparison with traditional rule-based or feature-engineered approaches that may still be competitive in clinical settings
- Narrow scope of model architectures tested, primarily focusing on encoder-decoder and decoder-only models

## Confidence

| Claim Cluster | Confidence Level |
|---------------|------------------|
| Performance improvements over SOTA in fully supervised settings | High |
| Effectiveness of hard-prompting and full fine-tuning strategies | High |
| Few-shot learning results and plateau behavior | Medium |
| Generalizability across clinical domains | Medium |
| Comparative effectiveness of different model architectures | Medium |

## Next Checks
1. Test the proposed fine-tuning strategies on multiple clinical datasets (e.g., i2b2, clinical notes from different specialties) to assess generalizability
2. Compare LLM-based approaches with established clinical NLP pipelines that use rule-based temporal reasoning and feature engineering
3. Evaluate model robustness to clinical text variations including abbreviations, misspellings, and domain-specific terminology not present in the training data
