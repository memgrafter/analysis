# An evaluation framework for synthetic data generation models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.08866
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08866
- Reference count: 30
- Key outcome: A framework combining multivariate statistical tests with rank-based analysis to evaluate synthetic data generation models, resolving conflicting results from individual tests

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel evaluation framework for synthetic data generation models that addresses the challenge of conflicting results from traditional statistical tests. The approach combines multivariate statistical tests (Wasserstein/Cramer's V, Novelty, Domain classifier, and Anomaly detection) with rank-based statistical analysis using the Friedman Aligned-Ranks test and Finner post-hoc test. By aggregating results across multiple evaluation metrics and applying rigorous statistical ranking, the framework provides more reliable and interpretable assessments of synthetic data quality. The method was validated on two real-world datasets (travel review ratings and obesity risk data) and successfully identified top-performing models while demonstrating the difficulty of interpreting individual test results without such a framework.

## Method Summary
The framework works by first applying multiple multivariate statistical tests to compare synthetic and real data distributions. These tests measure distributional similarity, novelty detection, domain classification accuracy, and anomaly detection performance. The results from these tests are then used to rank synthetic data generation models using the Friedman Aligned-Ranks test, which handles multiple comparisons across different evaluation metrics. A Finner post-hoc test is subsequently applied to determine statistically significant differences between model performances. This combined approach addresses the problem of conflicting individual test results by providing an aggregated ranking that reflects overall model quality across multiple evaluation dimensions.

## Key Results
- Successfully identified GMM as the top model for travel review ratings dataset
- CTGAN emerged as the top performer for obesity risk dataset
- Demonstrated the framework's ability to resolve conflicting results from individual statistical tests
- Showed that traditional evaluation approaches can lead to ambiguous conclusions without proper ranking methodology

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by addressing the fundamental challenge that different statistical tests often provide conflicting assessments of synthetic data quality. By aggregating multiple evaluation metrics through rank-based statistical analysis, the framework captures a more holistic view of model performance. The use of established statistical tests (Friedman Aligned-Ranks and Finner post-hoc) provides rigorous significance testing that goes beyond simple averaging of scores. This approach recognizes that synthetic data evaluation requires considering multiple aspects of data quality simultaneously rather than relying on any single metric, and it provides a statistically sound method for combining these diverse assessments into actionable rankings.

## Foundational Learning
**Multivariate Statistical Tests**: Multiple tests (Wasserstein distance, Cramer's V, novelty detection, domain classification, anomaly detection) are needed because synthetic data can fail in different ways - distributional mismatch, overfitting, or mode collapse. Quick check: Apply each test individually to see how they rank models differently before aggregation.

**Friedman Aligned-Ranks Test**: This non-parametric test is appropriate when comparing multiple models across multiple evaluation metrics, as it doesn't assume normal distributions and handles tied ranks. Quick check: Verify that model rankings are consistent across different random seeds of the same synthetic data generation process.

**Finner Post-hoc Test**: Used after Friedman test to identify which specific model pairs have statistically significant performance differences, controlling for family-wise error rate. Quick check: Ensure that the post-hoc test identifies meaningful distinctions between top-performing models rather than just random variations.

**Rank Aggregation**: Converting multiple test scores into ranks before statistical analysis reduces the impact of scale differences between tests and focuses on relative performance. Quick check: Compare results using raw scores versus ranks to confirm that ranking approach doesn't lose critical information.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Synthetic Data Generator -> Statistical Tests (Wasserstein, Cramer's V, Novelty, Domain Classifier, Anomaly Detection) -> Score Matrix -> Friedman Aligned-Ranks Test -> Finner Post-hoc Test -> Model Rankings

**Critical Path**: The critical path involves generating synthetic data, applying all statistical tests to create a comprehensive evaluation matrix, then using rank-based statistics to produce final model rankings. The most computationally intensive step is typically the statistical testing phase, particularly for large datasets or complex models.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The framework trades computational efficiency for statistical rigor and interpretability. While applying multiple tests and rank-based analysis is more computationally expensive than single-metric evaluation, it provides more reliable and nuanced assessments. The choice of specific statistical tests represents a tradeoff between comprehensiveness and computational cost.

**Failure Signatures**: Inconsistent rankings across different test types may indicate fundamental issues with certain models or dataset characteristics that challenge specific evaluation approaches. Failure to achieve statistical significance between top models suggests the evaluation framework may need additional metrics or larger sample sizes.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Apply the framework to a simple synthetic dataset (e.g., Gaussian mixtures) where ground truth differences are known
2. Compare framework results with human expert evaluation on a small dataset to validate statistical rankings
3. Test framework sensitivity by varying the number of synthetic samples generated for each model

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided materials.

## Limitations
- Framework generalizability across different data types and synthetic generation methods remains untested beyond the two specific domains examined
- Computational efficiency of the proposed framework compared to simpler evaluation approaches is not addressed
- Selection of specific statistical tests may influence results, and framework's sensitivity to test selection is not explored
- Performance on imbalanced datasets or data containing significant missing values is not investigated

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The statistical methodology combining multivariate tests with rank aggregation is well-established and appropriately applied.

**Medium confidence**: The framework's ability to resolve conflicting test results and provide clear model rankings is demonstrated but requires validation across more diverse datasets and generation methods.

**Medium confidence**: The identification of top-performing models (GMM for travel ratings, CTGAN for obesity risk) is statistically supported within the tested domains but may not generalize to other data types.

## Next Checks

1. Apply the framework to synthetic data from additional domains (e.g., financial transactions, medical imaging, or time series data) to assess cross-domain robustness and identify any domain-specific limitations.

2. Conduct a sensitivity analysis by replacing the Friedman Aligned-Ranks test with alternative rank aggregation methods (e.g., Borda count, Copeland score) to determine if results are robust to the choice of statistical tests.

3. Evaluate the framework's performance on synthetic data with varying degrees of class imbalance and missing values to understand its limitations in handling real-world data quality issues.
