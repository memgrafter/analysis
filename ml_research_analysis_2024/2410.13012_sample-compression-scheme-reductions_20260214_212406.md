# Sample Compression Scheme Reductions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.13012
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13012
- Reference count: 29
- This paper establishes novel reductions from sample compression schemes in multiclass classification, regression, and adversarially robust learning settings to binary sample compression schemes.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive framework for reducing sample compression schemes across multiple learning paradigms to binary classification settings. The authors demonstrate that sample compression schemes for multiclass classification, regression, and adversarially robust learning can be constructed from binary compression schemes with specific properties. The key insight is that by appropriately inflating datasets and leveraging the relationship between graph dimension, pseudo-dimension, and VC dimension, compression bounds can be preserved across these learning settings. The work has significant implications for the sample compression conjecture in binary classification and extends these implications to other learning settings.

## Method Summary
The paper's methodology centers on dataset inflation techniques and dimension relationships. For multiclass classification, the authors inflate datasets by considering all possible labelings and prove that the VC dimension of the inflated binary class equals the graph dimension of the original multiclass class. For regression, they construct discretized label sets and show the pseudo-dimension of the original class relates to the VC dimension of the discretized class. The adversarial robustness results involve constructing perturbed versions of input points and analyzing the trade-off between robustness and compression size. Throughout, the authors leverage properties of binary compression schemes (stability, properness, majority vote) to derive tighter bounds and construct explicit reductions.

## Key Results
- Multiclass compression schemes of size O(f(dG) log|Y|) and O(f(dG)) under different assumptions on binary compression scheme
- Epsilon-approximate regression compression schemes of size O(f(dP) log(1/epsilon)) for various loss functions
- Adversarially robust compression schemes of size O(f(VC) log M) for bounded perturbation sets
- Proof that a robustly learnable concept class exists that admits no bounded-size adversarially robust compression scheme

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Reduction from multiclass classification to binary compression preserves size bounds when graph dimension is finite.
- Mechanism: Inflates multiclass dataset to binary dataset CY by mapping each (x,y) to ((x,y), indicator), then applies binary compression. The VC dimension of CY equals the graph dimension of C.
- Core assumption: Binary compression scheme of size f(VC) exists for all binary classes with finite VC.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Assuming we have a compression scheme for binary classes of size f(dVC), where dVC is the VC dimension, then we have the following results: ... there exists a multiclass compression scheme of size O(f(dG)), where dG is the graph dimension."
  - [section]: "Denote VC(CY ) = VC and dG(C) = d G. It is straightforward to show that VC = d G."
- Break condition: If binary compression scheme fails to preserve sample consistency under inflation, or if graph dimension and VC dimension differ.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Stable compression schemes enable size-independent-of-label-space reductions for multiclass.
- Mechanism: Uses stability property to ensure compression set remains unchanged when inflating dataset to include all labels, then reconstructs via majority vote or proper function.
- Core assumption: Binary compression scheme is stable (removing non-compression points doesn't affect output).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Assuming the reconstruction function of the compression scheme for binary classes either outputs a majority vote of concepts fromC or selects a concept within the concept class C (proper compression), we construct a sample compression forC of size O(f(dG(C))), even when inﬁnite label sets are allowed."
  - [section]: "Stable compression ensures that removing any point outside the compression set does not affect the output of the compression function."
- Break condition: If stability property fails, inflation step may expand compression set unpredictably.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Regression compression reduces to binary via pseudo-dimension preservation under inflation.
- Mechanism: Maps real-valued class C to binary class C≤ by thresholding at y values, then applies binary compression to discretized dataset.
- Core assumption: VC dimension of inflated binary class equals pseudo-dimension of original real-valued class.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "If the binary compression scheme is a majority-vote or a stable compression scheme, then there exists an ǫ-approximate compression scheme for regression over [0,1]-valued functions of size O(f(dP)), where dP is the pseudo-dimension."
  - [section]: "We show that VC(C≤ ) = dP. First, we show the ≤ direction... Now we show the≥ direction."
- Break condition: If pseudo-dimension and VC dimension relationship breaks under discretization, compression size bounds fail.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Graph dimension (dG) and its relationship to VC dimension in multiclass settings
  - Why needed here: The paper's multiclass reduction relies on proving VC(CY) = dG(C) to map binary compression bounds to multiclass.
  - Quick check question: If a multiclass class has graph dimension 3, what is the maximum VC dimension of its inflated binary version CY?

- Concept: Pseudo-dimension (dP) and its role in regression learning bounds
  - Why needed here: The regression reduction uses dP to bound the size of the binary class C≤ created by thresholding.
  - Quick check question: If a real-valued class has pseudo-dimension 5, what is the maximum number of points that can be P-shattered by this class?

- Concept: Stability property in compression schemes
  - Why needed here: Stable compression enables size-independent-of-label-space reductions by ensuring inflation doesn't expand compression sets.
  - Quick check question: If a compression scheme outputs {x1,x2} for dataset S, will it still output {x1,x2} if we add a new point x3 to S?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Binary compression scheme (input: finite binary dataset, output: compression set + predictor) → Reduction layer (inflates multiclass/regression data, applies binary scheme, reconstructs) → Multiclass/regression compression scheme
- Critical path: Dataset inflation → Binary compression application → Compression set extraction → Predictor reconstruction
- Design tradeoffs: 
  - Using majority vote vs proper vs stable binary schemes affects label space dependence
  - Discretization granularity in regression affects approximation quality vs compression size
  - Inflation strategy impacts VC dimension preservation
- Failure signatures:
  - VC dimension of inflated class ≠ graph dimension/pseudo-dimension of original
  - Binary compression scheme loses consistency under inflation
  - Stability property fails, causing compression set expansion
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Verify VC(CY) = dG(C) for small multiclass classes with known graph dimension
  2. Test inflation and reconstruction pipeline on simple binary compression scheme (e.g., thresholds)
  3. Measure approximation error vs discretization level in regression reduction on synthetic data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does every multiclass class with graph dimension dG have a sample compression scheme of size O(f(dG)) when the label space is infinite?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states this is an open problem after presenting Theorem 3.2 which gives O(f(dG) log|Y|) compression size.
- Why unresolved: The current reduction requires log|Y| factor when the label space is infinite, but it's unknown if this is necessary.
- What evidence would resolve it: A constructive proof showing a compression scheme of size O(f(dG)) for infinite label spaces, or a counterexample showing this is impossible.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can sample compression schemes be reduced to concept classes with finite fat-shattering dimension instead of pseudo-dimension?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states this as an open problem after Theorem 4.2, noting that pseudo-dimension is sufficient but not necessary for learnability.
- Why unresolved: Current reductions depend on pseudo-dimension, but fat-shattering dimension provides a tighter characterization of learnability.
- What evidence would resolve it: A reduction that constructs compression schemes of size O(f(fatcε)polylog(1/ε, fatcε)) for classes with finite fat-shattering dimension.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Does every [0,1]-valued concept class with finite pseudo-dimension admit an exact compression scheme of size O(f(dP)) when using majority vote, proper, or stable binary compression schemes?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] This is listed as the first subproblem in Open Problem 4.6.
- Why unresolved: While approximate compression schemes are constructed for these cases, extending to exact compression remains open.
- What evidence would resolve it: A constructive proof showing exact compression schemes of size O(f(dP)) for these specific types of binary compression schemes, or a counterexample showing this is impossible.

## Limitations

- The paper's results rely heavily on the existence of binary compression schemes of size f(VC) for all classes with finite VC dimension, which is not proven.
- Adversarial robustness results are limited to bounded perturbation sets, which may not capture all realistic adversarial scenarios.
- The regression compression scheme assumes a specific loss function (ℓ∞), and extending to other loss functions may require additional assumptions.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The multiclass classification reduction (Theorem 3.2) and its proof are well-established in the literature, building on known relationships between graph dimension and VC dimension. The adversarial robustness separation result (Theorem 5.1) is also likely correct given its construction.
- **Medium Confidence**: The regression compression scheme (Theorem 4.3) relies on more complex discretization arguments that may have subtle issues in edge cases. The tight bounds for stable/proper/majority vote schemes (Theorems 3.5, 3.7, 4.4, 4.5) depend heavily on the stability property which may not be straightforward to verify.
- **Low Confidence**: The overall implications for the sample compression conjecture in binary classification are speculative, as they depend on unknown properties of optimal binary compression schemes.

## Next Checks

1. **Graph Dimension Verification**: Implement and test the VC(CY) = dG(C) relationship for small multiclass classes with known graph dimension, including edge cases like classes with non-uniform label distributions.

2. **Stability Property Testing**: Construct concrete examples of stable compression schemes (beyond majority vote) and verify the stability property holds across various dataset inflation scenarios, including cases with high label space cardinality.

3. **Adversarial Robustness Construction**: Build explicit examples of robustly learnable concept classes that provably require unbounded compression size, testing the separation between robust learnability and robust compression scheme existence.
