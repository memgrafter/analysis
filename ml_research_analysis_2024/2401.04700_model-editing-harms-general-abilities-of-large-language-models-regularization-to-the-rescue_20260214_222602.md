# Model Editing Harms General Abilities of Large Language Models: Regularization to the Rescue

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2401.04700
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04700
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** Model editing methods improve factuality but significantly impair general abilities of LLMs, with RECT regularization mitigating side effects while maintaining >94% editing performance.

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether model editing methods that update knowledge in large language models (LLMs) to improve factuality inadvertently degrade general abilities like reasoning, question answering, and sentiment analysis. Evaluating four popular editing methods (KN, MEND, ROME, MEMIT) on GPT-2 XL and LLaMA-1 across eight task categories, the research finds that model editing does improve factuality but at the significant cost of impairing general abilities. Performance degradation was observed across all settings (instance/single, sequential, batch editing), with larger batch sizes and more edits leading to worse performance. For instance, using KN to edit LLaMA-1 caused performance to drop to nearly zero with just a single edit. The paper proposes RECT, a regularization method based on relative weight changes, which mitigates these side effects while maintaining over 94% editing performance.

## Method Summary
The paper evaluates four model editing methods (KN, MEND, ROME, MEMIT) on GPT-2 XL and LLaMA-1 using the EasyEdit tool. Experiments are conducted in three settings: instance/single editing, sequential editing, and batch editing. The editing dataset is ZSRE, and eight task categories are evaluated: reasoning, natural language inference, open/closed-domain QA, dialogue, summarization, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis. Performance metrics include solve rate, accuracy, exact match (EM), F1, and ROUGE scores. The proposed RECT method regularizes weight updates by constraining their magnitude relative to original weights to preserve general abilities while maintaining editing performance.

## Key Results
- Model editing improves factuality but significantly impairs general abilities across all evaluated tasks and methods
- Performance degradation scales with batch size and number of edits, with some methods (KN on LLaMA-1) dropping to near-zero performance with single edits
- RECT regularization mitigates side effects while maintaining over 94% editing performance
- Excessive weight updates during editing cause overfitting to edited facts at the expense of general abilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Model editing methods improve factuality by modifying specific neurons or weight matrices, but this localized change causes overfitting to the edited facts and disrupts the model's ability to handle general tasks.
- Mechanism: When editing methods like KN or ROME update parameters, they introduce a bias toward the edited facts. The model's generalization capabilities degrade because the updates are not constrained to preserve the relationships learned during pre-training.
- Core assumption: The original weights encode general abilities that are not redundant or easily recoverable after being altered.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Evaluation results show that RECT can significantly mitigate the side effects of editing while still maintaining over 94% editing performance."
  - [section] "Our analysis reveals that the side effects are caused by model editing altering the original model weights excessively, leading to overfitting to the edited facts."
  - [corpus] Weak, no direct mention of overfitting mechanism.
- Break condition: If regularization is too weak, overfitting persists; if too strong, editing performance drops below acceptable thresholds.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The severity of performance degradation scales with the number of edits and the batch size of edited instances.
- Mechanism: Each editing operation perturbs the model's weight space. Sequential edits compound perturbations, while large batch edits introduce simultaneous, large-scale weight shifts that the model cannot reconcile without retraining.
- Core assumption: LLMs are not robust to large, correlated weight changes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The darker units correspond to more edits" (Figure 2), and "performance degradation to nearly 0 with just a single edit" (KN on LLaMA-1).
  - [section] "Even with only one single editing operation, the performance of edited models exhibits a trend of performance degradation as the batch size increases."
  - [corpus] Weak, no explicit mention of batch size scaling.
- Break condition: When edits are minimal or distributed over many small steps, degradation may be negligible.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: RECT (RElative Change in weighT) regularization mitigates side effects by constraining the magnitude and pattern of weight updates relative to the original weights.
- Mechanism: By penalizing large deviations from original parameters, RECT preserves the original knowledge distribution while allowing targeted fact updates.
- Core assumption: The original weight configuration contains critical general ability components that must be preserved.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "RECT can significantly mitigate the side effects of editing while still maintaining over 94% editing performance."
  - [section] "To mitigate this, a method named RECT is proposed to regularize the edit update weights by imposing constraints on their complexity based on the RElative Change in weighT."
  - [corpus] Weak, no direct evidence of RECT's internal mechanism.
- Break condition: If RECT's regularization hyperparameter is mis-tuned, either side effects persist or editing performance collapses.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Weight perturbation sensitivity in deep neural networks
  - Why needed here: Understanding why small weight changes can drastically alter model behavior is key to diagnosing editing side effects.
  - Quick check question: If a 0.1% change in a single weight can flip a model's prediction, what does that imply about editing safety?

- Concept: Generalization vs. memorization trade-off
  - Why needed here: Editing methods must balance updating specific facts without causing the model to overfit to those facts at the expense of broader knowledge.
  - Quick check question: How can a model be made to update one fact without forgetting how to perform unrelated tasks?

- Concept: Regularization in the context of model editing
  - Why needed here: RECT's effectiveness depends on choosing the right regularization strategy to preserve general abilities while allowing fact updates.
  - Quick check question: What would happen if we regularized too little vs. too much during model editing?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input (editing fact) -> Editing module (KN, MEND, ROME, MEMIT, or RECT-enhanced) -> Regularization layer (RECT constraints) -> Output (edited model with updated fact recall and preserved general abilities)
- Critical path: Fact → Locate neurons/weights → Compute update → Apply regularization (if RECT) → Generate edited model
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Editing performance vs. general ability preservation
  - Speed of editing vs. thoroughness of regularization
  - Batch size vs. stability of general task performance
- Failure signatures:
  - Sharp drop in general task accuracy after editing
  - Overfitting: edited fact recalled perfectly but unrelated facts corrupted
  - Inconsistent behavior across different editing methods
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Apply KN editing to GPT-2 XL on a single fact and measure general task performance before and after.
  2. Apply ROME with RECT regularization to the same model and compare side effect severity.
  3. Increase batch size incrementally and observe degradation trends.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can model editing methods be designed to improve factuality while simultaneously preserving general abilities of LLMs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper demonstrates that current editing methods improve factuality but significantly impair general abilities, suggesting a need for methods that can achieve both objectives.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies this as a critical challenge but does not provide a solution, instead calling for more research efforts to address this trade-off.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and empirical validation of new model editing methods that show improvements in both factuality and general abilities, supported by comprehensive evaluation across multiple task categories.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of batch size on the performance degradation of LLMs during model editing?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows that larger batch sizes lead to worse performance degradation, indicating sensitivity of models to increases in batch size during editing.
- Why unresolved: While the paper observes the trend, it does not explore the underlying mechanisms or provide strategies to mitigate the negative effects of larger batch sizes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed analysis of how different batch sizes affect weight updates and general abilities, along with proposed methods to optimize batch editing without compromising performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can LLMs be strengthened to withstand the influence of weight updates during model editing without compromising general task performance?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper highlights the need for models to be more robust to weight updates, as even slight perturbations can significantly affect performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper calls for strengthening LLMs but does not provide specific approaches or techniques to achieve this robustness.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of new techniques or architectural modifications that enhance LLM robustness to weight updates during editing, maintaining or improving performance across diverse tasks.

## Limitations
- The analysis relies heavily on observed correlations rather than mechanistic explanations of why specific weight changes cause particular task failures
- RECT's effectiveness is demonstrated but lacks ablation studies showing which components are most critical
- Evaluation is limited to GPT-2 XL and LLaMA-1, with generalizability to other architectures untested

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Model editing methods do improve factuality at the cost of general abilities across multiple task categories. This is directly measured and consistently observed across all four editing methods and both model architectures.
- **Medium confidence**: The proposed mechanism of overfitting to edited facts causing general ability loss. While the correlation is strong, the paper doesn't directly test alternative explanations or provide causal evidence.
- **Medium confidence**: RECT's effectiveness in mitigating side effects while preserving editing performance. The 94% editing performance claim is supported, but the regularization's sensitivity to hyperparameter choices and its behavior on larger models is untested.

## Next Checks
1. Conduct controlled experiments that systematically vary the magnitude of weight updates during editing to establish a direct causal link between update size and task performance degradation, rather than relying on correlational evidence from different editing methods.

2. Perform ablation studies on RECT's components to determine which aspects (magnitude constraints vs. pattern constraints) are most critical for preserving general abilities, and test the method's sensitivity to hyperparameter choices across different model scales.

3. Test the generalization of findings to additional LLM architectures beyond GPT-2 XL and LLaMA-1, particularly larger models where the relative impact of editing on general abilities might differ due to increased parameter redundancy or different training dynamics.
