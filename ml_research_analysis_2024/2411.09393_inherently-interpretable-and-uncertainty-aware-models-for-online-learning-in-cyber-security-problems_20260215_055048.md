## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical need for interpretable and uncertainty-aware machine learning models in online learning for cyber-security applications. The authors propose a novel pipeline using Additive Gaussian Processes (AGPs) that combines the interpretability of Generalized Additive Models with the uncertainty quantification properties of Gaussian Processes. By implementing a rolling buffer approach to address AGPs' scalability issues in online settings, they demonstrate that AGPs can perform comparably to standard neural networks while providing crucial transparency for threat detection and decision-making in cybersecurity contexts.

## Method Summary
The method employs Additive Gaussian Processes (AGPs) as the core model, which decomposes predictions into interpretable feature-specific components while maintaining uncertainty quantification through the Gaussian Process framework. The pipeline includes a rolling buffer approach that samples from both recent and historical data to enable online learning without the computational burden of full dataset retraining. Uncertainty-based active learning is implemented using acquisition functions that prioritize samples with high uncertainty. The approach is evaluated on URL phishing classification using a dataset of 11,000+ samples with 30 features each, comparing AGPs against Neural Networks, Gaussian Processes, and Neural Additive Models.

## Key Results
- AGPs achieve F1 scores around 0.92-0.93 using a 20% window proportion in the rolling buffer approach
- Active learning with uncertainty sampling maintains good performance while requiring only 10-20% of new data points to be labeled
- AGPs successfully identify "URL not being HTTPS" and "URL not being an Anchor URL" as key features while providing reliable uncertainty quantification around these contributions
- Unlike Neural Additive Models, AGPs avoid over-confidence issues and provide more reliable uncertainty estimates for feature-specific predictions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Additive Gaussian Processes (AGPs) achieve interpretability by decomposing the model into input-specific Gaussian Process components, where each component's contribution can be directly interpreted as a Shapley value.
- Mechanism: The additive kernel structure K(x, x′) = k0 + Σj kj(xj, x′j) allows for independent GP components per feature. This decomposition makes the model inherently interpretable as each fj(xj) represents the individual contribution of feature j to the final prediction.
- Core assumption: The features are sufficiently independent that modeling them separately does not significantly compromise predictive accuracy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our approach aims to balance predictive performance with transparency while improving the scalability of AGPs"
  - [section 3.2] "This enables us to zero out all the dimensions other than xj in order to find the individual, input-specific, 1-D GP Classifier relating to xj"
- Break condition: If features have strong interactions or dependencies that cannot be captured by the additive structure alone.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: AGPs provide robust uncertainty quantification through the Gaussian Process framework, which naturally captures both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.
- Mechanism: The GP posterior distribution provides confidence intervals around predictions, with uncertainty naturally increasing in regions with sparse data. The additive structure preserves this property for each feature contribution.
- Core assumption: The kernel choice appropriately captures the data structure and the GP posterior variance is meaningful for uncertainty quantification.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our approach aims to balance predictive performance with transparency while improving the scalability of AGPs"
  - [section 2.1] "The posterior distribution of the function values at the test points f∗ given the observed data y is then: f∗|X∗, X, y ~ N(f¯∗, cov(f∗))"
- Break condition: If the kernel is misspecified or the data is too sparse for reliable uncertainty estimates.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The rolling buffer approach addresses AGPs' scalability issues in online learning by balancing computational efficiency with the need to adapt to data drift.
- Mechanism: By maintaining a buffer of recent and randomly sampled historical data, the model can be re-trained on a manageable subset while still capturing both recent trends and global patterns.
- Core assumption: The rolling buffer composition (ratio of recent to historical data) can be tuned to match the problem's specific drift characteristics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.3] "we propose using a rolling buffer that considers re-training on a sub-sample of the whole dataset made of the most recent batches of new data, plus randomly drawn batches of historical data"
  - [section 3.3] "Online learning problems where distributional drifts over time are believed to be smooth do not perhaps need as many recent samples"
- Break condition: If data drift is too rapid or non-stationary for the buffer size to capture.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Gaussian Process regression and classification
  - Why needed here: AGPs build on GP theory, so understanding GP fundamentals is essential for grasping how uncertainty quantification works
  - Quick check question: What does the GP posterior variance represent, and how does it change with data density?

- Concept: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)
  - Why needed here: AGPs are a GP-based extension of GAMs, combining additive structure with uncertainty quantification
  - Quick check question: How does the GAM formulation g(E[Y]) = β0 + Σ fj(xj) enable interpretability?

- Concept: Active learning and uncertainty sampling
  - Why needed here: The paper employs uncertainty-based acquisition functions for selective labelling in the online learning pipeline
  - Quick check question: What's the difference between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, and why does it matter for active learning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input features → Individual GP components (one per feature) → Additive combination → Sigmoid output for classification. The rolling buffer manages training data subsets. Uncertainty quantification flows from GP posterior.
- Critical path: Feature preprocessing → GP component training → Additive combination → Classification output. The rolling buffer update triggers re-training.
- Design tradeoffs: AGPs vs NAMs - AGPs provide better uncertainty quantification but are more computationally expensive. Rolling buffer size vs model accuracy and computational cost.
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on features with strong interactions (AGP limitation). Overconfidence in NAM predictions. Inadequate uncertainty estimates with sparse data.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a basic AGP on a synthetic dataset with known feature contributions to verify interpretability.
  2. Compare AGP and NAM uncertainty quantification on out-of-distribution samples.
  3. Test the rolling buffer approach with different window proportions on a streaming dataset to find the optimal balance.

## Limitations

- The paper does not fully specify kernel hyperparameters and implementation details, creating uncertainty in exact reproduction
- The 20% window proportion for the rolling buffer may not generalize to all online learning scenarios with different drift characteristics
- Results are demonstrated on URL phishing classification and may not directly transfer to other cyber-security applications with different feature structures

## Confidence

- **Medium confidence**: The rolling buffer approach's effectiveness and optimal window proportion
- **Medium confidence**: The generalizability of results to other cyber-security domains

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies on kernel choices and hyperparameters to quantify their impact on AGP performance and uncertainty estimates
2. Test the rolling buffer approach across different drift scenarios (gradual vs. abrupt) to identify optimal window proportions
3. Apply the AGP pipeline to a different cyber-security dataset (e.g., malware detection) to assess cross-domain generalizability and identify potential failure modes
