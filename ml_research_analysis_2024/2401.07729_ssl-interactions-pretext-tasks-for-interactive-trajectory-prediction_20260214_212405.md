# SSL-Interactions: Pretext Tasks for Interactive Trajectory Prediction

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2401.07729
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07729
- **Reference count**: 35
- **Primary result**: SSL-Interactions outperforms state-of-the-art motion forecasting methods with up to 8% improvement, particularly for interaction-heavy scenarios

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of modeling non-linear agent-to-agent interactions in multi-agent trajectory prediction for autonomous vehicles. The authors propose SSL-Interactions, a framework that leverages self-supervised learning pretext tasks to enhance interaction modeling capabilities. The approach introduces four interaction-aware pretext tasks and a novel method for curating interaction-heavy scenarios from datasets, which facilitates the generation of pseudo-labels for training. The method demonstrates both quantitative improvements over state-of-the-art approaches and qualitative advantages in complex interactive scenarios.

## Method Summary
The SSL-Interactions framework enhances trajectory prediction by introducing pretext tasks specifically designed to capture agent interactions. The method involves curating interaction-heavy scenarios from existing datasets, generating pseudo-labels for these scenarios, and training a model on both the pretext tasks and the main trajectory prediction objective. The pretext tasks focus on predicting interaction-specific features such as range gaps, closest distances, movement directions, and interaction types. This dual training approach aims to improve the model's ability to understand and predict complex multi-agent interactions that traditional methods struggle to capture.

## Key Results
- SSL-Interactions achieves up to 8% improvement over state-of-the-art motion forecasting methods
- The framework shows particular effectiveness in interaction-heavy scenarios
- Three new metrics are proposed specifically for evaluating predictions in interactive scenes

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by explicitly training the model to recognize and predict interaction-specific features through self-supervised pretext tasks. By curating scenarios with rich interactions and generating pseudo-labels for interaction-related attributes, the model learns to identify patterns that indicate agent-to-agent influence. This additional supervision on interaction characteristics provides stronger learning signals than traditional trajectory prediction alone, enabling the model to better capture non-linear interaction effects that are critical for accurate multi-agent forecasting.

## Foundational Learning
- **Trajectory prediction fundamentals**: Understanding how to forecast future positions from historical data - needed to grasp the core prediction task
- **Self-supervised learning**: Learning from unlabeled data through pretext tasks - needed to understand the training methodology
- **Agent interaction modeling**: Capturing how agents influence each other's trajectories - needed to appreciate the problem being solved
- **Multi-agent systems**: Dealing with multiple interacting entities simultaneously - needed to understand the complexity addressed
- **Pseudo-label generation**: Creating synthetic labels from available data - needed to understand the data preparation process

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Dataset -> Interaction Curation -> Pseudo-label Generation -> Pretext Task Training -> Main Model Training
- **Critical path**: Interaction-heavy scenario curation → pseudo-label generation → pretext task training → trajectory prediction
- **Design tradeoffs**: Focus on interaction-heavy scenarios may limit generalization to simpler scenarios
- **Failure signatures**: Poor performance in non-curated scenarios, sensitivity to curation threshold selection
- **First experiments**: 1) Ablation study removing each pretext task individually, 2) Performance evaluation on non-curated scenarios, 3) Sensitivity analysis of curation threshold

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Limited ablation study showing how performance changes with different curation thresholds or without curation
- Pseudo-label generation process lacks detailed validation of label quality and potential noise impact
- Four pretext tasks have not been individually evaluated to determine their relative contributions

## Confidence
- High confidence in the overall framework design and implementation methodology
- Medium confidence in the quantitative improvements shown (limited ablation studies)
- Medium confidence in the new metrics' effectiveness (no comparison to alternative metrics)
- Low confidence in the scalability and generalization of the curation approach

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies removing each pretext task individually to quantify their independent contributions to performance gains
2. Evaluate the method's performance on non-curated, randomly sampled scenarios to assess generalization beyond interaction-heavy cases
3. Perform sensitivity analysis on the interaction-heavy scenario curation threshold to determine optimal selection criteria and robustness to parameter choices
