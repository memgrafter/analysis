# LLaVA-Docent: Instruction Tuning with Multimodal Large Language Model to Support Art Appreciation Education

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.06264
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06264
- Reference count: 17
- Key outcome: LLaVA-Docent specialized in personal interpretation phases of art appreciation, generating 115 questions in this category versus GPT-4's 42, but exhibited limited diversity and struggled to progress through all appreciation stages.

## Executive Summary
This study developed LLaVA-Docent, a multimodal large language model-based chatbot designed to enhance art appreciation education. The model was trained using a custom dataset generated by GPT-4 based on a data design framework integrating pedagogical theories of art appreciation. Evaluation comparing LLaVA-Docent to GPT-4 (few-shot) showed LLaVA-Docent specialized in personal interpretation phases of art appreciation, generating 115 questions in this category versus GPT-4's 42. However, LLaVA-Docent exhibited limited diversity in questioning, often repeating similar queries and struggling to progress through all appreciation stages. GPT-4 demonstrated more natural conversational flow and scaffolding abilities but provided less structured progression through appreciation phases.

## Method Summary
LLaVA-Docent uses the LLaVA 1.0 architecture with Vicuna-13B LLM, CLIP-ViT-Large-Patch14 vision encoder, and linear projection layer. The model was trained in two stages: pre-training on CC3M dataset, then fine-tuning on 1000 synthetic dialogue samples generated by GPT-4 using a data design framework based on Anderson's critical stages of art appreciation. The dataset included dialogues between a docent and virtual students discussing 100 artworks from curated sources. Evaluation compared LLaVA-Docent against GPT-4 (zero-shot and few-shot) across five phases of art appreciation through six researchers conducting three 20-turn dialogues each.

## Key Results
- LLaVA-Docent generated 115 questions in the personal interpretation phase (Stage 3) versus GPT-4's 42 questions
- LLaVA-Docent showed limited diversity, often repeating similar queries and struggling to progress through all appreciation stages
- GPT-4 demonstrated more natural conversational flow and scaffolding abilities but provided less structured progression through appreciation phases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** LLaVA-Docent's specialization in the personal interpretation phase of art appreciation (Stage 3) is a direct result of its instruction-tuned dataset design, which emphasizes open-ended questioning aligned with Anderson's critical stages.
- **Mechanism:** The dataset generation process used GPT-4 with a structured prompt template that explicitly incorporated the five stages of Anderson's art appreciation model. This template guided the model to generate questions targeting each stage, with particular emphasis on the personal interpretation phase through tailored prompts and feedback examples.
- **Core assumption:** The quality and structure of the synthetic dataset directly determine the model's conversational specialization and ability to guide users through the art appreciation process.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] The model was trained using a custom dataset generated by GPT-4 based on a data design framework integrating pedagogical theories of art appreciation.
  - [section] The prompt template included specific information about art appreciation education, incorporating five stages from the Data Design Framework Version 2 that represent reaction, perceptual analysis, personal interpretation, contextual examination, and synthesis.
  - [corpus] The corpus contains papers on multimodal prompt tuning and instruction learning, supporting the general approach but not providing specific evidence for LLaVA-Docent's art appreciation specialization.
- **Break condition:** If the synthetic dataset lacks sufficient diversity in question types or fails to properly represent all five stages of art appreciation, the model will exhibit limited progression and repetitive questioning patterns.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** LLaVA-Docent's ability to provide personalized scaffolding in art appreciation education is enabled by its multimodal architecture (LLaVA framework) and instruction tuning process, which allows it to process both visual and textual information relevant to artworks.
- **Mechanism:** The LLaVA architecture combines a vision encoder, projection layer, and LLM (Vicuna) to process image and text inputs simultaneously. Instruction tuning with the art appreciation dataset enables the model to generate contextually appropriate responses and questions based on the visual content of artworks and pedagogical principles.
- **Core assumption:** The multimodal architecture is essential for art appreciation education, as it allows the model to analyze visual elements of artworks and generate relevant questions and feedback, which would not be possible with text-only models.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] The model was designed to serve as a personal tutor for art appreciation, leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs).
  - [section] The LLaVA-Docent used the LLaVA version 1.0 architecture, consisting of a vision encoder, LLM (Vicuna), and projection layer to link visual and textual modalities.
  - [corpus] The corpus includes papers on multimodal instruction tuning and zero-shot learning, supporting the general approach but not providing specific evidence for LLaVA-Docent's art appreciation application.
- **Break condition:** If the vision encoder fails to accurately capture relevant visual features of artworks or the projection layer cannot effectively link visual and textual information, the model's ability to provide meaningful scaffolding will be compromised.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** LLaVA-Docent's potential to democratize art appreciation education and make it more accessible is achieved through its open-source nature, which allows for on-device deployment and reduces reliance on internet connectivity and proprietary models.
- **Mechanism:** By using an open-source MLLM architecture (LLaVA) and training it with a specialized dataset, LLaVA-Docent can be deployed on various devices without requiring constant internet access or sharing user data with large tech companies. This increases accessibility in diverse educational settings and addresses privacy concerns.
- **Core assumption:** Open-source models can maintain robust performance while offering advantages in customization, privacy, and accessibility compared to closed, proprietary models.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] The study explored the potential of open-source MLLMs for art appreciation education, aiming to overcome the limitations of closed, proprietary models.
  - [section] The researchers chose open-source models as they can maintain robust performance while allowing for customization and on-device deployment, improving accessibility in various environments.
  - [corpus] The corpus does not contain specific evidence for the accessibility and privacy benefits of open-source MLLMs in art education, but supports the general concept of open-source AI development.
- **Break condition:** If the open-source model's performance significantly lags behind proprietary models or if on-device deployment introduces substantial computational constraints, the accessibility benefits may be outweighed by reduced functionality.

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:**
  CLIP-ViT-Large-Patch14 -> Linear Projection Layer -> Vicuna-13B LLM

- **Critical path:**
  1. Input artwork image and user query/question
  2. Vision encoder processes image and extracts visual features
  3. Projection layer maps visual features to language embedding space
  4. LLM generates response based on combined visual and textual context
  5. Output response is delivered to the user

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Model size vs. performance: Using Vicuna-13B balances computational requirements with conversational quality
  - Synthetic data vs. real-world data: Synthetic data generation allows for control over pedagogical content but may lack the diversity and authenticity of real conversations
  - Open-source vs. proprietary models: Open-source models offer customization and privacy benefits but may have lower baseline performance compared to state-of-the-art proprietary models

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Repetitive or irrelevant questions: Indicates issues with dataset diversity or model fine-tuning
  - Inability to process complex visual elements: Suggests limitations in the vision encoder or projection layer
  - Hallucinations or incorrect information: Points to problems with the base LLM or insufficient grounding in factual data

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. **Dataset quality assessment:** Manually review a sample of generated dialogues to evaluate the diversity, relevance, and pedagogical soundness of questions and feedback across all five stages of art appreciation
  2. **Vision encoder evaluation:** Test the model's ability to accurately describe and analyze visual elements of various artworks, comparing its outputs to expert analyses
  3. **User interaction simulation:** Conduct a series of simulated conversations with the model, focusing on its ability to guide users through the art appreciation process, maintain engagement, and provide personalized scaffolding
