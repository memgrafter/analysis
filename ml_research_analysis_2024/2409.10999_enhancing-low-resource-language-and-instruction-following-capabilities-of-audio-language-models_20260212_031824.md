# Enhancing Low-Resource Language and Instruction Following Capabilities of Audio Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.10999
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10999
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: Typhoon-Audio achieves Thai ASR WER of 14.17, SpokenQA F1 of 64.60, and SpeechIF Judge scores of 6.11 (Th) and 6.34 (En), outperforming open-source models and matching Gemini-1.5-Pro

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of improving audio language models for low-resource languages, specifically focusing on Thai. The authors propose Typhoon-Audio, a unified model that integrates audio comprehension and speech instruction-following capabilities. By balancing language-specific and multilingual training data, using specialized backbones and a Q-Former adapter, Typhoon-Audio significantly outperforms existing open-source models and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models like Gemini-1.5-Pro in both English and Thai.

## Method Summary
The authors developed Typhoon-Audio by combining Whisper-Th (a Thai ASR model) and Typhoon-1.5 (a multilingual LLM) with a Q-Former adapter for cross-modal alignment. The training strategy involved balancing 65% Thai and 35% English data to enhance low-resource language capabilities while maintaining multilingual performance. The model was trained on specialized datasets including WangchanThaiInstruct for Thai instruction following and Thai-M3Audiolm for audio language modeling, creating a unified system that can handle both audio comprehension and instruction-following tasks across languages.

## Key Results
- Achieved Thai ASR WER of 14.17, significantly outperforming open-source models
- Obtained SpokenQA F1 score of 64.60, demonstrating strong comprehension capabilities
- Achieved SpeechIF Judge scores of 6.11 (Thai) and 6.34 (English), matching Gemini-1.5-Pro performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of Typhoon-Audio stems from its balanced training approach that combines language-specific data (65% Thai) with multilingual data (35% English), preventing catastrophic forgetting while enhancing low-resource language capabilities. The Q-Former adapter effectively bridges the audio encoder (Whisper-Th) and language model (Typhoon-1.5), enabling seamless cross-modal understanding. The specialized datasets like WangchanThaiInstruct provide task-specific instruction-following capabilities that generic multilingual models lack.

## Foundational Learning
- Audio-Language Model Alignment: Critical for connecting speech signals to language understanding, enabling the model to process audio inputs meaningfully
- Cross-Modal Instruction Following: Essential for models to understand and execute spoken instructions, going beyond simple transcription
- Low-Resource Language Adaptation: Necessary for languages with limited training data to achieve competitive performance against high-resource languages

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Whisper-Th (audio encoder) -> Q-Former adapter -> Typhoon-1.5 (LLM)
Critical path: Audio input → Whisper-Th → Q-Former → Typhoon-1.5 → Instruction execution
Design tradeoffs: Prioritized Thai performance (65% data) over perfect language balance, accepting potential bias for stronger low-resource results
Failure signatures: Performance degradation on non-Thai/non-English languages; potential overfitting to instruction types in training datasets
First experiments: 1) Test Thai ASR performance on diverse Thai dialects, 2) Evaluate English instruction following on complex multi-step tasks, 3) Assess cross-lingual transfer from Thai to other Southeast Asian languages

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation scope limited to Thai and English despite multilingual claims
- Potential bias from 65% Thai training data may limit generalization to other low-resource languages
- Instruction-following tested only on limited task types, leaving uncertainty about complex instruction performance

## Confidence
High confidence in model architecture and training methodology, with clear technical details provided
High confidence in comparative performance claims against open-source models with specific metrics
Medium confidence in overall significance due to limited comparison scope with Gemini-1.5-Pro
Medium confidence in generalizability to other low-resource languages beyond Thai

## Next Checks
1. Evaluate Typhoon-Audio on Vietnamese, Indonesian, and Khmer using standardized multilingual benchmarks to assess true multilingual generalization
2. Conduct ablation studies with equal English-Thai representation to determine impact on cross-lingual transfer and identify overfitting
3. Test instruction-following on diverse tasks including real-time dialogue, noisy environment QA, and multi-step audio instructions to validate comprehensive capabilities
