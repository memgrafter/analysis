# Speaker Verification in Agent-Generated Conversations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.10150
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10150
- Authors: Yizhe Yang, Palakorn Achananuparp, Heyan Huang, Jing Jiang, Ee-Peng Lim
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: Fine-tuned speaker verification models, especially when combining features from multiple models, achieve the best performance in verifying utterances from unseen speakers in role-playing agent conversations.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel speaker verification task to evaluate role-playing conversational agents' ability to personalize utterances to specific speakers. The authors compile a large dataset of conversations from movies, TV shows, and books, then develop several speaker verification models including style-based, authorship attribution, and fine-tuned models. Their experiments demonstrate that fine-tuned models significantly outperform baselines, especially when combining features from multiple models. Using these models, the authors evaluate LLM-based role-playing agents and find that current models fail to accurately mimic speakers' linguistic styles and personal characteristics, primarily due to inherent linguistic consistency in these models.

## Method Summary
The paper develops speaker verification models to distinguish utterances from different speakers in conversations. The approach uses hierarchical utterance encoding where each utterance is encoded independently and pooled, then applies contrastive learning with pre-pairing for fine-tuning. Multiple base models (LIWC, LISA, STEL, SBERT, RoBERTa, LUAR) are fine-tuned on paired utterance sets from seen speakers, and their features are combined in a Mixed Features model. The models are evaluated on three test sets (Seen-Seen, Seen-Unseen, Unseen-Unseen) across three difficulty levels (Base, Hard, Harder) using AUC, accuracy, and F1 metrics. The best-performing models are then used to evaluate role-playing agents' personalization abilities through Simulation and Distinction scores.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuned models significantly outperform non-fine-tuned baselines, especially on Hard and Harder difficulty levels
- Mixed Features model combining multiple fine-tuned models achieves the best overall performance
- Current role-playing models fail to accurately mimic speakers' linguistic styles, with verification models able to distinguish real from generated utterances
- Performance degradation on Harder level suggests linguistic accommodation in conversations poses challenges for speaker verification

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Fine-tuned speaker verification models outperform non-fine-tuned baselines on unseen speakers
- Mechanism: Fine-tuning contrastive learning models on paired utterances from same/different speakers allows learning discriminative embeddings that generalize to unseen speakers
- Core assumption: Utterance-level contrastive loss is sufficient to learn speaker-discriminative representations that transfer across domains
- Evidence anchors: Fine-tuned models significantly outperform other models especially on Hard Level and Harder Level; FMR scores for related works range 0.54-0.66 showing limited prior success on unseen speakers
- Break condition: If fine-tuning dataset lacks sufficient speaker diversity or unseen speakers' linguistic styles differ greatly from training speakers

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Hierarchical utterance encoding improves speaker verification compared to concatenating all utterances
- Mechanism: Encoding each utterance independently and pooling embeddings avoids exceeding model length limits while preserving utterance-level discriminative information
- Core assumption: Sentence-level embeddings from pre-trained models retain speaker-specific style signals even when pooled
- Evidence anchors: Hierarchical encoding methodology better suited for speaker verification in conversations; processing utterances independently allows handling conversations with arbitrary number of utterances
- Break condition: If pooling destroys fine-grained style signals or if utterance boundaries are noisy

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Mixed-features (combining multiple fine-tuned models) yields best speaker verification performance
- Mechanism: Different fine-tuned models capture complementary aspects of speaker identity, and combining them yields richer representations
- Core assumption: Each fine-tuned model specializes in different speaker cues; linear or learned combination preserves and amplifies these cues
- Evidence anchors: Mixed Features yield the best results demonstrating robustness by integrating various features; rather than relying on in-batch negatives, pre-pairing strategy adopted
- Break condition: If models are too similar in what they capture, combining them yields little gain; if too dissimilar, combination may dilute signals

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contrastive learning with pre-pairing
  - Why needed here: Enables learning speaker-discriminative embeddings without requiring large in-batch negative sets
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between in-batch negatives and pre-paired training samples in contrastive learning?

- Concept: Hierarchical text encoding
  - Why needed here: Allows processing variable-length conversations without truncation while preserving utterance-level semantics
  - Quick check question: Why might pooling utterance embeddings be preferable to concatenating all text for speaker verification?

- Concept: Speaker verification vs. authorship attribution
  - Why needed here: Speaker verification includes personal characteristics and topic preference, not just linguistic style
  - Quick check question: How does speaker verification differ from authorship attribution in terms of the features considered?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data pipeline → Hierarchical utterance encoder → Pooled embedding → Speaker verification model (STELf t/SBERTf t/RoBERTaf t/LUARf t) → Similarity score → Evaluation (AUC/ACC/F1) → Optional: Feature fusion layer for Mixed Features model

- Critical path:
  1. Load conversation data, split into utterance sets
  2. Encode each utterance independently with base encoder
  3. Mean-pool utterance embeddings to get speaker-level embedding
  4. Apply contrastive loss on paired utterance sets
  5. During inference, compute cosine similarity between speaker embeddings

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Hierarchical encoding vs. full-text encoding: better length handling but potential loss of cross-utterance context
  - Single fine-tuned model vs. Mixed Features: simpler but possibly less robust vs. more robust but heavier
  - Speaker vs. authorship focus: broader feature set but more domain shift risk

- Failure signatures:
  - Low AUC/ACC on Unseen-Unseen test: likely overfitting or domain shift
  - Similar scores for positive/negative pairs: model not learning discriminative features
  - High variance across rounds: unstable training or small dataset

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train a single fine-tuned model (e.g., STELf t) on training set and evaluate on Seen-Seen; expect near-ceiling performance
  2. Evaluate same model on Unseen-Unseen; expect performance drop, revealing generalization gap
  3. Train Mixed Features model and compare AUC/ACC on Unseen-Unseen vs. single fine-tuned baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does linguistic accommodation affect speaker verification accuracy in long-term conversations?
- Basis in paper: A key factor contributing to decreased performance at Harder level may be linguistic accommodation; if speakers accommodate to each other, their speech styles become increasingly similar over time, making it more challenging to distinguish between them
- Why unresolved: The paper hypothesizes that accommodation affects performance but does not empirically measure its impact or quantify how much it contributes to accuracy degradation
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments measuring accuracy degradation over time in conversations where accommodation is known to occur, compared to conversations without accommodation

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can speaker verification models be improved by incorporating interlocutor utterances and modeling conversation dynamics?
- Basis in paper: There is considerable room to improve verification accuracy, such as incorporating utterances of other interlocutors, modeling interaction as well as leveraging insights of linguistic accommodation
- Why unresolved: Current models use only individual speaker utterances without considering conversational context or interaction patterns between speakers
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments showing performance improvements when adding features from interlocutor utterances, conversation flow modeling, or interaction dynamics to verification models

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal way to map single similarity scores to fine-grained personal dimensions in speaker verification?
- Basis in paper: Our evaluation model predicts a single similarity score for a pair of utterance sets, broadly reflecting their degree of similarity; however, this single score value lacks interpretability that allows it to be mapped to similarity (difference) score in different fine-grained personal dimensions
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges this limitation but does not propose or test methods for decomposing the similarity score into interpretable personal dimensions
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of methods to decompose similarity scores into interpretable components (linguistic style, personality traits, personal background) with demonstrated correlation to human judgments

## Limitations

- The evaluation of role-playing agent personalization is constrained by focus on agent-generated conversations as verification targets rather than establishing ground truth speaker identities
- Specific preprocessing steps and speaker filtering criteria are not fully specified, limiting reproducibility
- Interpretation that current role-playing agents cannot effectively personalize conversations is based on indirect evidence through verification scores rather than direct measures of conversational quality or user perception

## Confidence

- High confidence: Technical approach for speaker verification using fine-tuned models with contrastive learning is methodologically sound and experimental results are internally consistent
- Medium confidence: Dataset collection and task formulation are reasonable though specific preprocessing steps are not fully specified
- Low confidence: Interpretation that current role-playing agents cannot effectively personalize conversations based on indirect evidence through verification scores rather than direct measures

## Next Checks

1. **Ground truth validation**: Conduct human evaluation studies where annotators assess whether speaker verification model embeddings accurately capture authentic speaker identity versus superficial differences, comparing model judgments with human perception of speaker similarity

2. **Ablation of accommodation effects**: Systematically analyze the Harder test set to quantify how much linguistic accommodation in conversations contributes to verification difficulty, comparing performance when removing topical/contextual accommodations versus purely stylistic variations

3. **Cross-dataset generalization**: Evaluate the best-performing fine-tuned models on independent speaker verification benchmarks (e.g., VoxCeleb) to assess whether models learn general speaker-discriminative features or merely memorize conversation-specific patterns
