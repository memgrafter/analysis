# Spider2-V: How Far Are Multimodal Agents From Automating Data Science and Engineering Workflows?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.10956
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10956
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: State-of-the-art VLMs achieve only 14.0% success rate on professional data science workflows, dropping to 1.2% for tasks with over 15 steps

## Executive Summary
Spider2-V is a benchmark for evaluating multimodal agents on professional data science and engineering workflows, featuring 494 real-world tasks across 20 enterprise-level applications. The benchmark requires agents to perform both code generation and GUI operations in a real-time executable computer environment, using screenshots and accessibility trees as observations. Despite step-by-step guidance and retrieval-augmented generation, current state-of-the-art VLMs struggle with the complexity of these workflows, achieving only 14.0% overall success rate and demonstrating significant performance degradation as task complexity increases.

## Method Summary
The benchmark uses a real-time executable computer environment with virtual machines running enterprise applications, where agents must complete data science and engineering workflows through both code and GUI operations. The agent-environment interaction is formalized as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), with observations consisting of screenshots, accessibility trees, and task instructions. The benchmark employs a Controller component that grounds predicted actions into the VM, retrieves observations, and manages a document warehouse for retrieval-augmented generation from professional software documentation.

## Key Results
- State-of-the-art VLMs achieve only 14.0% success rate on Spider2-V tasks
- Performance drops to 1.2% for tasks with over 15 steps
- Even with step-by-step guidance, agents underperform in fine-grained GUI actions (16.2% success rate)
- Tasks involving authentic user accounts in cloud-hosted workspaces show only 10.6% success rate

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multimodal agents fail primarily due to action grounding limitations in complex GUI environments.
- Mechanism: VLMs struggle to accurately map natural language instructions to precise GUI element coordinates and sequences, especially when tasks involve multiple applications and fine-grained interactions.
- Core assumption: The benchmark's real-time executable environment with accessibility trees and screenshots reveals fundamental limitations in spatial reasoning and cross-modal alignment.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "even with step-by-step guidance, agents still underperform in tasks that require fine-grained, knowledge-intensive GUI actions (16.2%)"
  - [section] "once agents mispredict the coordinates of the correct button, they will open the wrong window and become trapped in the incorrect area"
  - [corpus] "Breaking the Data Barrier -- Building GUI Agents Through Task Generalization" suggests task generalization remains challenging
- Break condition: When GUI tasks require coordination across multiple applications or when elements are visually similar but functionally distinct.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Performance degrades significantly with task complexity, particularly step count and cloud integration.
- Mechanism: As the number of required actions increases, the probability of errors compounds. Cloud-hosted workspaces introduce additional latency and authentication complexity that current agents cannot handle effectively.
- Core assumption: The benchmark's three-tier difficulty classification (easy ≤5 steps, medium 6-15 steps, hard >15 steps) accurately captures the relationship between task complexity and agent performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "in the most challenging subset, with action steps exceeding 15, the performance drops to 1.2%"
  - [section] "Tasks involving authentic user accounts are much more challenging... data agents struggle to complete tasks involving authentic user accounts (10.6% success rate)"
  - [corpus] "VisualWebArena: Evaluating Multimodal Agents on Realistic Visual Web Tasks" indicates visual web tasks remain challenging
- Break condition: When tasks exceed 15 steps or require real-time interaction with cloud services.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Retrieval-augmented generation provides limited improvement because domain-specific knowledge is insufficient for action grounding.
- Mechanism: While RAG supplies relevant documentation, agents still struggle to translate this information into executable actions, particularly for domain-specific terminology and workflows.
- Core assumption: The document warehouse contains sufficient coverage of professional software documentation to be useful for task completion.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Even with step-by-step guidance, these agents still underperform in tasks that require fine-grained, knowledge-intensive GUI actions (16.2%)"
  - [section] "We also introduce a RAG setting... We select top k chunks... and insert them into the prompt input" with limited performance gains
  - [corpus] "WONDERBREAD: A Benchmark for Evaluating Multimodal Foundation Models on Business Process Management Tasks" suggests domain-specific BPM remains challenging
- Break condition: When tasks require understanding of specialized domain concepts that cannot be easily retrieved or when the retrieved context is too lengthy for effective processing.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: POMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision Process)
  - Why needed here: The agent-environment interaction in Spider2-V is formalized as a POMDP where the agent must make decisions based on partial observations and receive rewards upon task completion.
  - Quick check question: In the POMDP formulation for Spider2-V, what constitutes the observation space and how does it differ from the full state space?

- Concept: Accessibility Tree and AT-SPI
  - Why needed here: The accessibility tree provides a structured, text-based representation of GUI elements that agents can parse to locate interactive components, which is critical for action grounding.
  - Quick check question: How does the accessibility tree's structure enable agents to convert natural language instructions into precise click coordinates?

- Concept: Action Space Design
  - Why needed here: The choice between pyautogui code and JSON dict action spaces affects the agent's ability to express complex sequences and handle different interface types.
  - Quick check question: What are the trade-offs between allowing arbitrary Python code versus restricting to a predefined JSON action schema?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Instruction → Agent → Action → Controller → VM → Observation → Evaluation
- Critical path: Instruction → Agent → Action → Controller → VM → Observation → Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Real-time environment vs. simulation accuracy, rich GUI vs. CLI simplicity, comprehensive documentation vs. retrieval efficiency
- Failure signatures: Incorrect GUI element targeting, authentication failures in cloud services, document retrieval misses for domain-specific terminology
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test agent performance on pure CLI tasks vs. GUI tasks to isolate the impact of visual grounding
  2. Measure the effect of increasing history window size on performance in multi-step tasks
  3. Compare performance with different observation types (screenshot only, a11ytree only, SoM) on the same task set

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does performance scale with increasing number of applications per task, and is there a threshold beyond which performance drops precipitously?
- Basis in paper: Inferred from the observation that most tasks require coordination across multiple professional applications, and the performance variance across different data categories
- Why unresolved: The paper analyzes performance across different task categories and difficulty levels but does not specifically examine how the number of applications per task affects performance
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed analysis showing success rates as a function of the number of applications involved in each task, particularly identifying any performance drop-off points

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific aspects of cloud-hosted workspaces (network latency, authentication, UI complexity) contribute most to the performance gap between local and cloud tasks?
- Basis in paper: Inferred from the observation that tasks with authentic user accounts perform significantly worse (10.6% vs 15.6%) and the discussion of cloud workspaces in the analysis section
- Why unresolved: While the paper identifies that cloud-hosted workspaces are more challenging, it does not decompose which specific factors drive this performance difference
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled experiment varying network conditions, authentication requirements, and UI complexity independently to isolate their individual contributions to performance degradation

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of multimodal agents compare to single-modality agents (text-only or vision-only) on GUI-intensive tasks, and what does this reveal about the value of multimodal integration?
- Basis in paper: Explicit statement that pure GUI tasks are easier than CLI tasks, and the discussion of different observation types in the ablation study
- Why unresolved: The paper compares different combinations of observation types and action spaces but does not directly compare multimodal agents to single-modality baselines on GUI tasks
- What evidence would resolve it: Head-to-head comparison of multimodal agents versus text-only and vision-only agents on the same GUI-intensive task subset, with performance metrics and error analysis

### Open Question 4
- Question: What is the relationship between instruction verbosity and task completion success, and is there an optimal level of detail that maximizes performance?
- Basis in paper: Explicit observation that providing step-by-step guidance improves performance from 11.3% to 16.2%, but also that even with verbose instructions performance remains low
- Why unresolved: The paper only compares abstract versus verbose instructions but does not explore intermediate levels of detail or analyze what types of information in verbose instructions are most helpful
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic variation of instruction detail levels (abstract, moderate, verbose) across tasks with different complexity levels, measuring performance and identifying which types of information (planning vs. grounding details) provide the most benefit

### Open Question 5
- Question: How does the performance of open-source VLMs compare to closed-source models when given equal context lengths and fine-tuning on similar data distributions?
- Basis in paper: Explicit observation that closed-source models significantly outperform open-source ones, with open-source success rates below 2% in some categories
- Why unresolved: The paper attributes the performance gap to differences in training data quality and context length support but does not control for these factors experimentally
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled experiment where open-source models are given comparable context lengths to closed-source models and fine-tuned on similarly high-quality data, with performance comparison on the same task subset

## Limitations
- The benchmark's reliance on specific enterprise software configurations may not generalize to other tool ecosystems
- Performance gaps may stem from both architectural limitations and evaluation methodology choices
- The 1.2% success rate for complex tasks suggests compounding error rates but doesn't isolate whether this is due to sequential reasoning breakdown or diminishing context window effectiveness

## Confidence
- High confidence in the finding that current VLMs struggle with GUI-based data science workflows (supported by consistent underperformance across multiple state-of-the-art models)
- Medium confidence in the claim that action grounding is the primary bottleneck (mechanism 1 is well-supported, but alternative explanations like memory limitations aren't ruled out)
- Medium confidence in the task complexity-performance relationship (the three-tier classification shows clear patterns, but the exact threshold where performance drops sharply may be dataset-specific)

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies removing accessibility trees to determine if performance loss is primarily due to missing structural GUI information versus other factors
2. Test agent performance on tasks with identical complexity but different action space granularities (e.g., high-level vs. low-level actions) to isolate the impact of action space design
3. Implement a controlled experiment comparing single-step vs. multi-step task performance with identical action types to quantify the compounding error effect independent of task complexity
