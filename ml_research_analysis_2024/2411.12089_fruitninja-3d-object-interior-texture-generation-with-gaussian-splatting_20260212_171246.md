# FruitNinja: 3D Object Interior Texture Generation with Gaussian Splatting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.12089
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12089
- Authors: Fangyu Wu; Yuhao Chen
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces first method for generating realistic internal textures in 3D Gaussian Splatting models using only a few cross-sectional views as input

## Executive Summary
FruitNinja introduces the first method to generate realistic internal textures for 3D Gaussian Splatting models, enabling real-time rendering during arbitrary geometric transformations. The core innovation involves using a pre-trained diffusion model to progressively inpaint cross-sectional views and applying voxel-grid smoothing to achieve cohesive textures throughout the object. The approach employs an OpaqueAtom GS strategy that uses densely distributed opaque Gaussians, overcoming limitations of standard 3DGS by avoiding biases toward larger particles and sharp color transitions. Experiments on six common objects demonstrate FruitNinja substantially outperforms existing approaches, achieving CLIP scores of 33.1 versus 24.6 for PhysGaussian.

## Method Summary
FruitNinja generates internal textures for 3D Gaussian Splatting models by using cross-sectional views as references for a diffusion model. The method first initializes internal Gaussians using an opacity field threshold to identify void regions, then applies atomic clipping to limit Gaussian sizes. Reference cross-sections are generated using depth-conditioned Stable Diffusion with Score Distillation Sampling optimization, conditioned on object symmetry. The 3DGS model is jointly trained with surface views and cross-sectional references, followed by progressive texture refinement through iterative optimization. Voxel smoothing is applied every 30-40 iterations to ensure color consistency across untrained internal regions, resulting in real-time rendering capability for arbitrary cuts.

## Key Results
- Achieves CLIP scores of 33.1 versus 24.6 for PhysGaussian on internal texture generation
- Outperforms 2D inpainting baselines by 60% on KID and FID metrics
- Maintains 96% cosine similarity for texture consistency across arbitrary cuts
- Enables real-time editing without the 30-second per-view delay of 2D inpainting baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Progressive inpainting with diffusion models enables realistic internal texture synthesis without full volumetric training data.
- Mechanism: Uses cross-sectional views conditioned on object symmetry to generate internal textures via Stable Diffusion, then refines these references iteratively while training the 3DGS model.
- Core assumption: Objects have symmetric internal structures allowing cross-sections at consistent angles to appear similar.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Building on this observation, we propose FruitNinja, an effective method for generating 3D internal textures by using only a few cross-sectional views as references." [section 3.2] "Fortunately, many common objects possess symmetrical features, allowing their cross-sectional views at consistent angles to appear similar." [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct citations found for symmetry-based cross-section generation in 3DGS literature.
- Break condition: Object lacks sufficient symmetry (e.g., irregular organic structures) or cross-sectional views don't capture representative internal patterns.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: OpaqueAtom GS strategy enables fine-grained texture rendering and stable training by constraining Gaussian size and enforcing uniform opacity.
- Mechanism: Caps Gaussian scales at a fraction of object dimensions and assigns full opacity to all particles, preventing large Gaussians from overlapping multiple regions and ensuring front particles dominate rendering.
- Core assumption: Large overlapping Gaussians create training instability and blur fine texture details.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "Our OpaqueAtom GS strategy overcomes 3DGS limitations by employing densely distributed opaque Gaussians, avoiding biases toward larger particles that destabilize training and sharp color transitions for fine-grained textures." [section 3.4] "This approach enables high-fidelity rendering and precise geometry reconstruction, making it ideal for applications that require detailed textures." [corpus] No direct evidence found for OpaqueAtom GS in related works; appears to be novel to this paper.
- Break condition: Objects requiring transparency or translucent effects, or scenes where blending between layers is essential.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Voxel smoothing resolves inconsistencies between independently generated cross-sectional views and untrained internal regions.
- Mechanism: Constructs a 3D grid over the 3DGS model and applies distance-weighted averaging of nearby trained Gaussians to untrained ones, ensuring color consistency across the object.
- Core assumption: Discrete cross-sectional training leaves some internal Gaussians untrained, creating color inconsistencies when these regions are exposed.
- Evidence anchors: [section 3.3] "Due to the discrete nature of input cross-sectional slices V, some Gaussian primitives are not covered by the generated masks... leaving them untrained and potentially reducing visual fidelity when they are exposed." [section 3.3] "Specifically, untrained Gaussians are assigned colors using a distance-weighted average of nearby trained Gaussians" [corpus] Weak evidence - voxel smoothing for 3DGS is not well-established in related literature.
- Break condition: Objects with highly complex internal structures where distance-weighted averaging cannot capture local detail, or when smoothing over-smooths important texture boundaries.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: 3D Gaussian Splatting fundamentals
  - Why needed here: FruitNinja builds directly on 3DGS representation and rendering pipeline
  - Quick check question: How does 3DGS represent a 3D scene using Gaussian primitives and what rendering equation combines their contributions?

- Concept: Diffusion models and Score Distillation Sampling
  - Why needed here: The method uses Stable Diffusion with SDS to generate cross-sectional views as training references
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between direct optimization with SDS loss and using generated references in a two-stage optimization process?

- Concept: Cross-sectional geometry and slicing operations
  - Why needed here: The method relies on user-defined cutting planes to generate training views for internal textures
  - Quick check question: How does changing the orientation and position of a cutting plane affect the generated cross-sectional view and subsequent training stability?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input 3DGS model + cross-sectional images -> Internal Gaussian initialization -> Diffusion model for cross-section generation -> Iterative refinement -> Voxel smoothing -> Output modified 3DGS model with internal textures

- Critical path:
  1. Initialize internal Gaussians using PhysGaussian approach
  2. Generate reference cross-sections via diffusion model
  3. Jointly train with surface views using OpaqueAtom settings
  4. Iteratively refine cross-sections and apply voxel smoothing
  5. Validate real-time rendering performance

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Fine-grained Gaussian particles vs. rendering performance
  - Cross-section coverage vs. training complexity
  - Smoothing extent vs. texture detail preservation

- Failure signatures:
  - Inconsistent textures across slices → check voxel smoothing parameters
  - Blurry internal details → increase Gaussian density or reduce scale limits
  - Training instability → verify atomic clipping constraints are properly applied

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test internal Gaussian initialization with a simple geometric shape (sphere) to verify filling logic
  2. Validate cross-section generation with a basic object using only horizontal slices
  3. Evaluate voxel smoothing on a synthetically colored 3DGS model to measure color consistency improvement

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the choice of cross-sectional angles affect the quality of generated internal textures, and what is the optimal spacing between slices?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses using 30-40 slices at varying intervals for different objects, but doesn't systematically explore how angle selection impacts results
- Why unresolved: The authors use fixed angle selections without exploring sensitivity to slice spacing or orientation choices
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments varying slice spacing, angles, and number of cross-sections while measuring quality metrics

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the maximum geometric transformation complexity that FruitNinja can handle before internal texture quality degrades significantly?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper shows results for arbitrary cuts but doesn't establish limits on transformation complexity or the relationship between cut angle deviation and quality
- Why unresolved: The authors demonstrate arbitrary cuts work but don't quantify performance degradation as cuts move away from training angles
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic testing of cut angle deviation from training angles with quality metrics across the full range

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the performance of FruitNinja scale with object complexity and internal texture variation?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors test six objects with varying complexity but don't analyze how internal texture complexity affects method performance or training time
- Why unresolved: The paper presents results on six objects but doesn't explore the relationship between object complexity and method performance
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments with objects of increasing internal texture complexity while measuring quality metrics and computational requirements

## Limitations

- Cross-sectional symmetry assumption may not generalize to asymmetric or highly irregular objects
- OpaqueAtom GS strategy appears novel but lacks comparative ablation studies showing necessity over standard 3DGS approaches
- Voxel smoothing method appears heuristic without demonstrated sensitivity analysis for parameter choices

## Confidence

- High confidence: Real-time rendering performance claims and quantitative metrics (CLIP scores, KID/FID, cosine similarity)
- Medium confidence: Progressive inpainting mechanism and cross-section generation approach
- Low confidence: OpaqueAtom GS novelty and effectiveness claims without comparative ablation

## Next Checks

1. Test FruitNinja on asymmetric objects (e.g., pinecones, irregular vegetables) to verify symmetry assumption limits
2. Compare training stability and convergence speed between OpaqueAtom GS and standard 3DGS with identical hyperparameters
3. Conduct ablation study varying voxel smoothing frequency and weight parameters to identify optimal settings for different texture types
