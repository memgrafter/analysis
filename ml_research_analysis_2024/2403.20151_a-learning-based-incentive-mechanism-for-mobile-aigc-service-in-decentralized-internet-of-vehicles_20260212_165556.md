# A Learning-based Incentive Mechanism for Mobile AIGC Service in Decentralized Internet of Vehicles

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.20151
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20151
- Reference count: 13
- Key outcome: MADRL-based double auction mechanism improves social welfare and reduces latency in decentralized AIGC service allocation for IoV networks by up to 10% compared to baseline models.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a decentralized incentive mechanism for allocating AI-Generated Content (AIGC) services in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) networks. The system uses roadside units (RSUs) as local market auctioneers that employ double auction mechanisms to match supply from virtual machines with demand from IoVs. Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning agents learn optimal bidding strategies to maximize global social welfare while minimizing transmission latency. The approach demonstrates effective balancing of service allocation and pricing in resource-constrained, highly mobile IoV environments.

## Method Summary
The proposed method combines double auction mechanisms with multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) in a decentralized IoV network architecture. Each RSU acts as a local auctioneer using McAfee's double auction rules to match virtual machines (sellers) and IoVs (buyers). IoVs are equipped with reinforcement learning agents that use the MAPPO algorithm to determine optimal bids based on market observations including participant counts, transaction prices, and transmission rates. The agents learn policies that maximize a reward function balancing global social welfare, budget costs, and transmission latency. The system is evaluated through simulations with varying numbers of IoVs and compared against baseline auction mechanisms.

## Key Results
- The MADRL-based mechanism achieves up to 10% improvement in market rewards compared to baseline models
- Demonstrates better social welfare and reduced transmission latency across different IoV densities (20-80 vehicles)
- Maintains stable performance with increasing numbers of participants while balancing allocation efficiency and pricing

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The double auction structure enables truthful bidding and efficient service matching between IoVs and virtual machines.
- Mechanism: Each RSU acts as an auctioneer that organizes sellers and buyers into value pools sorted by bids. The auctioneer finds a breakeven index K and calculates a clearing price to match supply and demand, ensuring truthful bidding and individual rationality.
- Core assumption: Sellers and buyers act rationally to maximize their utility within the auction framework, and the auctioneer can accurately calculate clearing prices that satisfy both parties.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The key idea is to model each roadside unit (RSU) as a local market auctioneer that matches supply and demand of AIGC services between virtual machines (service providers) and IoVs (service requesters) through double auction mechanisms."
  - [section II.A] "Hence, this market is double-sided, where bids from multiple buyers and sellers need to be aggregated before the service allocation and pricing."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - The corpus contains related work on auction mechanisms but lacks direct evidence for the specific double auction design used in this paper.
- Break condition: If the auctioneer cannot accurately calculate clearing prices, or if sellers/buyers deviate from truthful bidding strategies, the mechanism fails to achieve optimal allocation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning agents learn optimal bidding strategies that balance global social welfare and transmission latency.
- Mechanism: Each IoV is represented by a reinforcement learning agent that observes market conditions (number of participants, last transaction price, transmission rates) and takes actions (determines buying bid) to maximize rewards (global social welfare minus budget cost and latency).
- Core assumption: The POMDP framework with MAPPO algorithm can effectively learn bidding strategies that adapt to changing market conditions and achieve the desired optimization objectives.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The MADRL agents learn optimal bidding strategies to maximize global social welfare while minimizing transmission latency."
  - [section III.B] "With MAPPO, each agent is trained using the POMDP framework and maintains its policy πv(θv), which is updated using a critic function V(s; φv) that estimates the valuation of the global state S."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - The corpus contains related work on DRL for resource allocation but lacks direct evidence for the specific MAPPO-based bidding strategy learning used in this paper.
- Break condition: If the learning agents fail to converge to optimal strategies, or if the reward function does not adequately capture the desired optimization objectives, the mechanism fails to achieve efficient service allocation.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The decentralized market structure with local RSUs as auctioneers enables efficient resource allocation while maintaining data privacy and reducing latency.
- Mechanism: Each RSU acts as a local market auctioneer that matches supply and demand of AIGC services within its coverage area, reducing the need for centralized coordination and minimizing transmission latency by keeping services local.
- Core assumption: The decentralized structure can effectively balance the benefits of local resource allocation with the need for global coordination, and the limited coverage of RSUs does not significantly impact the availability of AIGC services.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The key idea is to model each roadside unit (RSU) as a local market auctioneer that matches supply and demand of AIGC services between virtual machines (service providers) and IoVs (service requesters) through double auction mechanisms."
  - [section II.A] "In the context of the IoV network, we consider a decentralized global market where each RSU n ∈ N acts as an auctioneer for its local market."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - The corpus contains related work on decentralized resource allocation but lacks direct evidence for the specific decentralized market structure with local RSUs used in this paper.
- Break condition: If the decentralized structure leads to significant fragmentation of the AIGC service market, or if the limited coverage of RSUs results in frequent service disruptions, the mechanism fails to provide efficient resource allocation.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Auction Theory and Mechanism Design
  - Why needed here: The paper relies on double auction mechanisms to match supply and demand of AIGC services, requiring understanding of how to design auctions that ensure truthful bidding and efficient allocation.
  - Quick check question: What properties must an auction mechanism satisfy to ensure truthful bidding and efficient allocation, and how does the double auction design in this paper achieve these properties?

- Concept: Reinforcement Learning and POMDPs
  - Why needed here: The paper uses multi-agent reinforcement learning agents to learn optimal bidding strategies, requiring understanding of how to formulate the bidding problem as a POMDP and how to use RL algorithms like MAPPO to learn optimal policies.
  - Quick check question: How does the POMDP framework model the bidding problem, and how does the MAPPO algorithm enable multiple agents to learn optimal bidding strategies that balance individual and global objectives?

- Concept: Edge Computing and Internet of Vehicles (IoV) Networks
  - Why needed here: The paper considers AIGC service allocation in IoV networks, requiring understanding of the unique characteristics of IoV networks, such as high mobility, limited resources, and latency-sensitive applications.
  - Quick check question: What are the key challenges and opportunities of providing AIGC services in IoV networks, and how does the decentralized market structure with local RSUs address these challenges while leveraging the opportunities?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: RSUs (local auctioneers) -> double auction mechanisms -> virtual machines (sellers) and IoVs (buyers) -> MADRL agents (bidding strategies) -> global coordination mechanism
- Critical path: (1) IoVs observe market conditions and determine bids using RL agents, (2) RSUs receive bids and use double auction mechanisms to match supply and demand, (3) RSUs allocate services and determine prices, (4) IoVs receive services and pay prices, (5) RSUs update service availability and pricing based on outcomes
- Design tradeoffs: Balances local resource allocation benefits (reduced latency, improved data privacy) against global coordination needs (overall efficiency and fairness); uses RL agents for adaptive bidding but requires significant training time and computational resources
- Failure signatures: (1) Double auction mechanism fails to achieve truthful bidding or efficient allocation, (2) RL agents fail to learn optimal strategies or converge to suboptimal solutions, (3) Decentralized structure leads to market fragmentation or service disruptions due to IoV mobility
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the double auction mechanism with a small number of sellers and buyers to verify that it achieves truthful bidding and efficient allocation
  2. Test the reinforcement learning agents with a simple bidding problem to verify that they can learn optimal bidding strategies and balance individual and global objectives
  3. Test the overall system with a small IoV network to verify that it can effectively allocate AIGC services while maintaining low latency and data privacy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed MADRL-based mechanism scale with a significantly larger number of RSUs and IoVs (e.g., 100+ RSUs and 1000+ IoVs) in terms of computational complexity and real-time performance?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates the mechanism with 4 RSUs and up to 80 IoVs, but does not address scalability to larger networks
- Why unresolved: The paper lacks analysis of computational complexity and real-time performance for large-scale deployments, which is crucial for practical IoV applications
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing performance metrics (e.g., training time, inference latency, reward, social welfare, budget cost) for larger network sizes with increasing numbers of RSUs and IoVs

### Open Question 2
- Question: How robust is the proposed mechanism to dynamic changes in network topology, such as sudden appearance or disappearance of RSUs or IoVs, or changes in vehicle speeds and directions?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper assumes a static network topology with fixed RSUs and IoVs moving at constant speeds, but real-world IoV networks are highly dynamic
- Why unresolved: The paper does not address the mechanism's adaptability to rapid changes in network conditions, which is essential for maintaining performance in real-world scenarios
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments simulating dynamic network changes and measuring the mechanism's ability to adapt and maintain performance (e.g., reward, social welfare, latency) under varying conditions

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed mechanism handle heterogeneous AIGC services with varying resource requirements and quality of service (QoS) levels, such as different model sizes, computation times, and accuracy levels?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions heterogeneous AIGC services but does not explicitly address how the mechanism manages different service types with varying resource demands and QoS requirements
- Why unresolved: The paper lacks a detailed analysis of the mechanism's ability to balance resource allocation and QoS for diverse AIGC services, which is crucial for practical implementation
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments evaluating the mechanism's performance (e.g., reward, social welfare, latency) for different combinations of AIGC services with varying resource requirements and QoS levels

## Limitations
- Simplified simulation environment with fixed parameters may not capture real-world IoV dynamics
- Evaluation based on synthetic AIGC service requests using the MeQSum dataset
- Neural network architecture for MAPPO not fully specified, limiting reproducibility
- Assumes rational actors and accurate clearing price calculations that may not hold under network congestion or malicious behavior

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The fundamental auction mechanism design and reinforcement learning framework are sound and well-established in the literature. The mathematical formulation of the POMDP and reward function is rigorous.
- **Medium Confidence**: The simulation results showing improved social welfare and reduced latency are promising but depend on specific parameter choices and the simplified evaluation environment.
- **Low Confidence**: The scalability of the approach to larger, more complex IoV networks and its performance under real-world conditions with variable traffic patterns and diverse AIGC workloads.

## Next Checks
1. **Robustness Testing**: Evaluate the mechanism under varying network conditions including different traffic densities, RSU distributions, and vehicle speeds to assess stability and performance consistency
2. **Real-World Workload Validation**: Test the approach using actual AIGC service traces from production environments to verify that the synthetic workload assumptions hold in practice
3. **Scalability Assessment**: Scale the simulation to larger geographic areas with more RSUs and vehicles to evaluate the approach's performance at realistic IoV network scales and identify potential bottlenecks
