# Attack on Scene Flow using Point Clouds

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.13621
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13621
- Reference count: 0
- One-line primary result: Proposed FGSM-SF and PGD-SF attacks significantly degrade scene flow network performance, with up to 33.7% relative AEPE degradation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces two white-box adversarial attack methods specifically designed for scene flow estimation from point clouds. The FGSM-SF and PGD-SF attacks generate adversarial examples by perturbing point cloud data to maximize the average end-point error between predicted and ground truth scene flow. The attacks demonstrate effectiveness even when targeting individual dimensions or color channels of the point cloud data. Notably, the study finds that scene flow networks are more robust to these attacks compared to their 2D optical flow counterparts, likely due to the additional depth information available in 3D point clouds.

## Method Summary
The authors propose two adversarial attack methods: FGSM-SF (one-step) and PGD-SF (multi-step), which generate adversarial examples by perturbing point cloud data to maximize the average end-point error (AEPE) between predicted and ground truth scene flow. The attacks can target either point cloud dimensions or color channels. The method involves computing gradients of the EPE loss with respect to the input point cloud data and using these gradients to create perturbations that maximize the loss. Experiments are conducted on KITTI and FlyingThings3D datasets using scene flow networks like FlowNet3D, FLOT, and HPLFlowNet.

## Key Results
- FGSM-SF and PGD-SF attacks successfully degrade scene flow network performance
- Up to 33.7% relative degradation in AEPE observed using PGD-SF
- Attacks remain effective when targeting only single dimensions or color channels
- Scene flow networks show greater robustness compared to 2D optical flow networks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The attacks increase AEPE by directly maximizing the end-point error loss between predicted and ground truth scene flow.
- Mechanism: The adversarial perturbations are optimized to increase the EPE loss, which directly measures the average displacement error of the predicted scene flow vectors. By maximizing this loss, the perturbations cause large deviations in the estimated flow vectors from the ground truth.
- Core assumption: The scene flow network's loss function is differentiable with respect to the input point cloud data, allowing gradient-based optimization of the adversarial perturbations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "These attacks generate adversarial examples by perturbing point cloud data to maximize the average end-point error (AEPE) between the predicted and ground truth scene flow."
  - [section 3] "For FGSM-SF, the l∞-bounded adversary A is obtained by the following one-step scheme L = EPE(SF, f (P C1, P C2)), A = P C1 + ϵ · sign(∇P C1L)."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence from corpus papers on gradient-based adversarial attack formulation for scene flow.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Scene flow networks are more robust to adversarial attacks than their 2D optical flow counterparts due to the additional depth information in 3D point clouds.
- Mechanism: The extra depth dimension in point clouds provides more information for the scene flow estimation, making it harder for adversarial perturbations to significantly alter the predicted flow. The 2D optical flow networks, relying only on color information, are more susceptible to attacks targeting color channels.
- Core assumption: The additional depth information in 3D point clouds provides a more robust representation of the scene flow compared to 2D optical flow.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Notably, the study finds that scene flow networks are more robust to these attacks compared to their 2D optical flow counterparts, likely due to the additional depth information available in 3D point clouds."
  - [section 4] "The results also indicate that the 3D variants of the networks exhibit significantly greater robustness compared to their 2D counterparts. The reason for this lies in the additional information they possess regarding the depth of the points."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence from corpus papers on the comparative robustness of 3D scene flow vs 2D optical flow networks to adversarial attacks.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The proposed attacks are effective even when targeting only one dimension or color channel of the point cloud data.
- Mechanism: By perturbing a single dimension or color channel, the attacks can still cause significant changes in the predicted scene flow, as the network relies on all input features for the estimation. This demonstrates the vulnerability of the scene flow networks to subtle, targeted perturbations.
- Core assumption: The scene flow network is sensitive to changes in any individual dimension or color channel of the input point cloud data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The attacks are effective even when targeting only one dimension or color channel of the point cloud data."
  - [section 3] "Attacking the dimensions allows the generation of the point clouds that represent deformed objects. Conversely, attacking the color channels enables the simulation of local shadows and brightness variations."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence from corpus papers on the effectiveness of attacks targeting individual dimensions or color channels for scene flow estimation.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Adversarial attacks on deep neural networks
  - Why needed here: Understanding the principles of adversarial attacks is crucial for designing and evaluating the proposed FGSM-SF and PGD-SF attacks on scene flow networks.
  - Quick check question: What is the main goal of an adversarial attack on a deep neural network?

- Concept: Scene flow estimation from point clouds
  - Why needed here: Familiarity with the scene flow estimation problem and its applications is essential for understanding the motivation behind the proposed attacks and their impact on the network's performance.
  - Quick check question: How does scene flow estimation differ from 2D optical flow estimation?

- Concept: End-point error (EPE) as a loss function for scene flow
  - Why needed here: Understanding the role of EPE in measuring the accuracy of scene flow estimation and its use as the primary loss function for the proposed attacks is important for evaluating their effectiveness.
  - Quick check question: What is the main advantage of using EPE as the loss function for scene flow estimation compared to other loss functions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Point clouds -> Scene flow network -> Estimated scene flow
- Critical path: The adversarial attack generation process involves computing the gradient of the EPE loss with respect to the input point cloud data and using it to create perturbations that maximize the loss.
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Tradeoff between attack strength and perceptibility: Stronger attacks (e.g., PGD-SF) may cause more significant degradation in performance but could also be more noticeable to human observers.
  - Tradeoff between attacking dimensions vs. color channels: Attacking dimensions can simulate deformed objects, while attacking color channels can simulate lighting variations. The choice depends on the specific application and desired attack characteristics.
- Failure signatures:
  - If the scene flow network is not differentiable with respect to the input point cloud data, the gradient-based attacks will fail.
  - If the perturbations are too small or the attack budget (epsilon) is too restrictive, the attacks may not have a meaningful impact on the network's performance.
  - If the scene flow network is already robust to adversarial attacks, the proposed methods may not cause significant degradation in performance.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the proposed FGSM-SF and PGD-SF attacks on a simple scene flow network (e.g., FlowNet3D) using the KITTI dataset, measuring the AEPE and relative degradation in performance.
  2. Compare the robustness of the scene flow network to the attacks with its 2D optical flow counterpart (e.g., RAFT), using the same evaluation metrics and datasets.
  3. Investigate the impact of attacking individual dimensions or color channels on the scene flow network's performance, comparing the results to attacks targeting all dimensions or channels simultaneously.
