# Evaluating Distributed Representations for Multi-Level Lexical Semantics: A Research Proposal

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.00751
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00751
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: Research proposal formalizing three levels of lexical semantics and proposing evaluation methods for distributed representations

## Executive Summary
This research proposal addresses the evaluation of distributed representations from neural networks in capturing multi-level lexical semantics. The work formalizes three levels of lexical semantics—local (word sense), global (word relations), and mixed (cross-lingual concepts)—and proposes methods to evaluate how well language models encode these levels. The core approach involves collecting or constructing multilingual datasets, leveraging various language models, and employing linguistic analysis theories to assess representations at each level.

The proposed evaluation framework aims to bridge computational models and lexical semantics, enhancing the transparency and reliability of language models while providing insights into how these models capture lexical meaning across different linguistic dimensions. While the paper does not present quantitative results, it outlines several methodological challenges including the "extraction dilemma," probe selectivity, and dataset bias.

## Method Summary
The proposed methodology involves three main components: (1) collecting or constructing multilingual datasets for each lexical semantics level (local, global, mixed), (2) extracting representations from various language models (static like Word2Vec/GloVe and contextual like BERT/LLM), and (3) applying evaluation methods including probabilistic inference for sense disambiguation, network construction for word relationships, and semantic map modeling for cross-lingual concepts. The approach leverages graphical models to illustrate relationships among word spaces, multilingual spaces, relation spaces, and concept spaces.

## Key Results
- Three-level formalization (local, global, mixed) enables systematic evaluation of distributed representations across lexical semantics
- Language model representations can be evaluated as semantic probes to reveal encoding patterns
- Cross-lingual semantic map modeling provides a universal framework for evaluating conceptual representations
- Methodological challenges identified include extraction dilemma, probe selectivity, and dataset bias

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The three-level formalization enables systematic evaluation of distributed representations across lexical semantics
- Mechanism: By defining distinct probability formulations for each level (p(e|w,s) for local, p([ei]N|W) for global, p([ci]M|W,R) for mixed), the approach creates measurable evaluation criteria that isolate different semantic phenomena
- Core assumption: Distributed representations can be meaningfully evaluated at each level independently, and performance at one level correlates with overall semantic understanding
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we identify and formalize three levels of lexical semantics: local, global, and mixed levels"
  - [section] "We propose a graphical model to illustrate the relationships among four spaces: W, M, R, and C"
  - [corpus] Weak - the corpus contains related papers but no direct evidence about the effectiveness of this three-level approach
- Break condition: If representations perform well at one level but poorly at another, the independence assumption fails and the evaluation framework loses validity

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Using language model representations as semantic probes reveals encoding patterns that traditional methods cannot capture
- Mechanism: By extracting contextual embeddings from various model architectures (BERT-like, GPT-like) and analyzing their geometric relationships, the approach maps how neural networks represent semantic relationships
- Core assumption: The internal representations of neural networks encode meaningful semantic information that can be extracted and analyzed using appropriate similarity measures and graph algorithms
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "evaluate language models by collecting or constructing multilingual datasets, leveraging various language models"
  - [section] "We propose constructing a word network by leveraging the embeddings learned in large language models (LLMs)"
  - [corpus] Moderate - related papers like "CALE: Concept-Aligned Embeddings" suggest this approach is actively researched
- Break condition: If extracted representations show no meaningful structure or if different extraction methods yield contradictory results, the probing assumption fails

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Cross-lingual semantic map modeling provides a universal framework for evaluating conceptual representations
- Mechanism: By applying typological theories (semantic map modeling) and connectivity hypotheses, the approach evaluates whether representations capture cross-linguistic conceptual relationships through graph-based analysis
- Core assumption: Cross-lingual conceptual spaces have universal structures that can be discovered through distributional representations, and these structures are comparable across languages
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Building on the local level, problems such as concept induction and the similarity of concepts are classical challenges at this level"
  - [section] "We adopt the theory of language typology, specifically semantic map modeling (Haspelmath, 2003)"
  - [corpus] Moderate - papers like "Distilling Monolingual and Crosslingual Word-in-Context Representations" support cross-lingual approaches
- Break condition: If cross-lingual representations fail to align with typological predictions or show language-specific rather than universal patterns, the universal structure assumption fails

## Foundational Learning

- Distributional hypothesis
  - Why needed here: The entire evaluation framework relies on the premise that word meanings can be inferred from their distributional contexts in large corpora
  - Quick check question: If two words appear in identical contexts, will their representations necessarily be identical according to the distributional hypothesis?

- Neural network representation theory
  - Why needed here: Understanding how neural networks compress linguistic information into distributed representations is crucial for interpreting evaluation results
  - Quick check question: What architectural features of transformers (attention mechanisms, layer depth) are most critical for capturing lexical semantics?

- Semantic field theory
  - Why needed here: The three-level formalization is based on understanding how words and meanings are organized into semantic fields at different granularities
  - Quick check question: How does the concept of semantic fields relate to the distinction between local, global, and mixed levels in this framework?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data collection pipeline -> Model interface layer -> Representation processing -> Evaluation framework -> Visualization and analysis tools

- Critical path: Data collection → Model representation extraction → Three-level evaluation → Cross-lingual comparison → Result interpretation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Depth vs. breadth: Deep evaluation of few languages vs. shallow evaluation of many languages
  - Model diversity vs. computational cost: Evaluating many model architectures vs. focusing on established ones
  - Quantitative metrics vs. qualitative analysis: Statistical measures vs. human interpretability

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor cross-validation performance across languages
  - Inconsistent results between different model architectures
  - High variance in similarity calculations indicating unstable representations
  - Failure to construct coherent semantic networks

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Extract static word embeddings (Word2Vec/GloVe) and evaluate basic similarity metrics across the three levels
  2. Implement contextual embedding extraction from BERT and compare performance with static embeddings
  3. Construct a simple word network using cosine similarity and analyze basic graph properties (connected components, clustering coefficients)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: To what extent do large language models (LLMs) encode lexical semantics compared to traditional pre-trained language models (PLMs)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly proposes investigating how LLMs encode lexical semantics in comparison to established research on BERT (BERTology), aiming to identify where lexical semantics are encoded within the model
- Why unresolved: The paper outlines the research proposal but does not present quantitative results or direct comparisons between LLMs and PLMs. It only mentions the need to identify where lexical semantics are encoded within the model
- What evidence would resolve it: Direct quantitative comparisons of lexical semantic tasks across multiple LLMs and PLMs, including evaluation of representations at different model layers, would provide evidence

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we effectively measure the similarity between word representations in high-dimensional spaces, beyond traditional cosine similarity?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that while cosine similarity is commonly used, it may not suffice in higher-dimensional spaces when constructing word networks and evaluating global-level semantics
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the limitation of cosine similarity but does not propose or test alternative similarity measures for high-dimensional spaces
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing various similarity measures (e.g., Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, learned metrics) on semantic tasks in high-dimensional spaces would resolve this question

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we design effective pruning strategies for word networks that allow fair comparison across models of different scales?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper raises the question of how to prune a fully connected graph when comparing different models and what constitutes a fair strategy for pruning across different model types
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the need for fair pruning strategies but does not propose or evaluate specific methods for achieving this
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies of different graph pruning techniques applied to word networks from various models, with evaluation of how pruning affects semantic interpretation and cross-model comparability, would provide evidence

## Limitations
- The research proposal lacks empirical validation results to support its theoretical framework
- The independence assumption between the three semantic levels may not hold in practice
- The "extraction dilemma" remains unresolved: current approaches either ignore context (losing information) or rely on imperfect methods (adding noise)
- Dataset bias and subjective human annotations could affect reliability, though cross-validation is proposed as mitigation

## Confidence
- High confidence: The three-level formalization of lexical semantics provides a useful conceptual framework for evaluating language models
- Medium confidence: The methodology for evaluating representations using probabilistic inference, network construction, and semantic map modeling is feasible
- Low confidence: Claims about cross-lingual conceptual universality and the ability of neural representations to capture typological structures require empirical validation

## Next Checks
1. **Empirical baseline validation**: Implement evaluation on established benchmarks (e.g., WordSim, SimLex, BLESS) to verify that the proposed methods produce expected results for static embeddings before extending to contextual models
2. **Cross-lingual alignment verification**: Test whether semantic maps constructed from multilingual representations align with established typological predictions across language families (e.g., spatial relations in Germanic vs. Romance languages)
3. **Extraction method comparison**: Systematically compare different context extraction strategies (averaging, weighted pooling, first token) on the same datasets to quantify the trade-off between information retention and noise introduction
