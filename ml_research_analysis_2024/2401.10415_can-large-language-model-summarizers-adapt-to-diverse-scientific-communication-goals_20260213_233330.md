# Can Large Language Model Summarizers Adapt to Diverse Scientific Communication Goals?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.10415
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10415
- Reference count: 23
- Non-fine-tuned LLMs outperform humans in the MuP review generation task, both in terms of similarity to reference summaries and human preferences

## Executive Summary
This work investigates the controllability of large language models (LLMs) on scientific summarization tasks. The authors identify key stylistic and content coverage factors that characterize different types of summaries such as paper reviews, abstracts, and lay summaries. They find that non-fine-tuned LLMs outperform humans in the MuP review generation task, both in terms of similarity to reference summaries and human preferences. The authors also show that they can improve the controllability of LLMs with keyword-based classifier-free guidance (CFG) while achieving lexical overlap comparable to strong fine-tuned baselines on arXiv and PubMed. However, their results indicate that LLMs cannot consistently generate long summaries with more than 8 sentences and exhibit limited capacity to produce highly abstractive lay summaries.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates LLMs (LLAMA-2 and GPT-3.5) on scientific summarization tasks using zero-shot approaches with intention prompts for stylistic control and keyword guidance. Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is applied to improve controllability. The authors use ROUGE scores, intention control metrics (kconciseness, knarrative, kkeywords), and human evaluation to assess performance. They compare LLM-generated summaries against supervised baselines (BIGBIRD, FACTOR SUM, BART) and human-written summaries across datasets including MuP, arXiv, PubMed, and eLife.

## Key Results
- Non-fine-tuned LLMs outperform humans in MuP review generation task based on ROUGE scores and human preferences
- CFG with keyword-based guidance achieves lexical overlap comparable to fine-tuned baselines on arXiv and PubMed
- LLMs struggle to generate long summaries (>8 sentences) and produce highly abstractive lay summaries

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Large language models can be controlled via intention prompts to generate summaries with desired stylistic features.
- Mechanism: By specifying prompts that indicate desired characteristics (e.g., number of sentences, narrative perspective), LLMs adjust their generation process to match these intentions.
- Core assumption: LLMs understand and can follow stylistic instructions given in prompts.
- Break condition: If LLMs cannot interpret or follow stylistic instructions, the controllability mechanism fails.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) can improve the controllability of LLMs for summarization tasks.
- Mechanism: CFG modifies the decoding process to weight the influence of intention prompts, making generated summaries more aligned with specified intentions.
- Core assumption: CFG can effectively balance the influence of intention prompts against the model's default summarization behavior.
- Break condition: If CFG does not effectively balance intention prompts and default behavior, controllability improvements may not be achieved.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Keyword-based prompts can guide LLMs to focus on specific content in summaries.
- Mechanism: By providing a list of keywords, LLMs are directed to include these terms in the generated summaries, improving lexical alignment with reference summaries.
- Core assumption: LLMs can effectively incorporate specified keywords into summaries without compromising overall quality.
- Break condition: If LLMs cannot effectively incorporate keywords or if keyword inclusion degrades summary quality, the mechanism fails.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Zero-shot learning
  - Why needed here: Understanding how LLMs can perform tasks without explicit fine-tuning is crucial for evaluating their summarization capabilities.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between zero-shot and few-shot learning in the context of LLMs?

- Concept: Classifier-free guidance
  - Why needed here: CFG is a key technique used to improve the controllability of LLMs for summarization tasks.
  - Quick check question: How does classifier-free guidance modify the decoding process in LLMs?

- Concept: Lexical overlap metrics
  - Why needed here: Metrics like ROUGE are used to evaluate the quality of generated summaries by comparing them to reference summaries.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L metrics?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Article -> LLM with CFG -> Summary -> Evaluation Metrics
- Critical path: 1) Input article and intention prompts 2) Generate summary using LLM with CFG 3) Evaluate summary using ROUGE and intention control metrics
- Design tradeoffs: Model size vs. inference speed, Keyword specificity vs. summary fluency, CFG strength vs. adherence to intentions
- Failure signatures: Low ROUGE scores indicate poor lexical alignment, High intention control metric values indicate good adherence to prompts, Inconsistent results across different prompts suggest model limitations
- First 3 experiments: 1) Evaluate LLM performance on arXiv abstract generation with and without CFG 2) Test keyword-based prompts on PubMed dataset for improved lexical alignment 3) Compare human and LLM-generated summaries on MuP dataset for quality assessment

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper doesn't explicitly call out open questions but implies several through its limitations and results. Key questions include how performance scales with larger models, whether more sophisticated keyword extraction could improve controllability, how LLMs perform across different scientific domains, the impact of additional context on summarization quality, and how LLMs compare to human experts in capturing scientific nuances.

## Limitations
- Cannot consistently generate long summaries (>8 sentences) as required for lay summarization tasks
- Limited capacity to produce highly abstractive lay summaries despite improvements in lexical alignment
- Evaluation focuses primarily on ROUGE scores and limited intention control metrics without exploring other quality dimensions

## Confidence
- LLM superiority on MuP reviews: High confidence
- CFG effectiveness for lexical alignment: Medium confidence
- Keyword guidance effectiveness: Low confidence

## Next Checks
1. Systematically vary the wording and structure of intention prompts to determine which aspects most strongly influence LLM output quality
2. Evaluate generated summaries across additional quality metrics beyond ROUGE and the three intention controls
3. Apply the same controllability techniques to scientific domains not represented in the training data to assess generalizability
