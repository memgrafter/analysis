# Real-time Bangla Sign Language Translator

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.16497
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16497
- Reference count: 38
- Primary result: 94% accuracy and 93% F1 score in real-time Bangla Sign Language translation

## Executive Summary
This study presents a real-time Bangla Sign Language Translator (BSLT) system designed to improve communication for the deaf and mute community in Bangladesh. The system combines MediaPipe Holistic for hand and facial landmark detection with an LSTM-based deep learning model for gesture recognition and translation. A custom dataset was created with 30 frames per word to ensure comprehensive gesture representation. The system achieves high accuracy in real-time sign language translation and integrates computer vision techniques with Bangla font rendering for accurate text display.

## Method Summary
The BSLT system employs MediaPipe Holistic for hand and facial landmark detection, followed by an LSTM-based deep learning model for gesture recognition and translation. The system processes 30 frames per word to capture comprehensive gesture representation. The model architecture integrates computer vision techniques for live detection and translation, with specific optimizations for Bangla font rendering. The approach focuses on individual word recognition with potential for future expansion to continuous sign language translation.

## Key Results
- Achieved 94% accuracy in gesture recognition
- Obtained 93% F1 score in translation performance
- Successfully implemented real-time translation with Bangla font rendering

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system leverages MediaPipe Holistic's robust landmark detection capabilities combined with LSTM's sequential processing strengths for temporal gesture patterns. The custom dataset creation with 30 frames per word ensures comprehensive gesture representation, while the integration of computer vision techniques enables real-time processing. The model's architecture is specifically optimized for Bangla sign language characteristics and font rendering requirements.

## Foundational Learning
- MediaPipe Holistic landmark detection: Essential for capturing hand and facial features needed for sign language recognition
- LSTM sequential modeling: Critical for understanding temporal patterns in sign language gestures
- Custom dataset creation: Necessary for capturing the specific characteristics of Bangla sign language
- Bangla font rendering: Required for accurate text display in the target language context

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map: Video input -> MediaPipe Holistic -> LSTM model -> Bangla font renderer -> Output display

Critical Path: Real-time video processing through MediaPipe -> LSTM gesture recognition -> Bangla text rendering -> Display output

Design Tradeoffs: Individual word recognition vs. continuous translation capability; custom dataset size vs. generalization; real-time performance vs. computational requirements

Failure Signatures: Poor lighting conditions affecting landmark detection; Bangla font rendering issues; limited dataset causing recognition errors

First Experiments:
1. Test landmark detection accuracy across different lighting conditions
2. Validate LSTM model performance on unseen gestures
3. Evaluate Bangla font rendering accuracy and speed

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Validation methodology lacks detail, raising questions about dataset diversity
- System focuses on individual word recognition without continuous translation capabilities
- Performance in real-world conditions and on diverse users not evaluated

## Confidence

High confidence in technical approach using MediaPipe Holistic and LSTM for gesture recognition

Medium confidence in claimed accuracy and F1 score due to limited validation details

Low confidence in system's real-world applicability without user studies or environmental testing

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a user study with diverse participants in various lighting and background conditions to evaluate real-world performance

2. Test the system's accuracy and latency on different hardware configurations to assess computational requirements

3. Implement and evaluate continuous sign language translation capabilities to move beyond individual word recognition
