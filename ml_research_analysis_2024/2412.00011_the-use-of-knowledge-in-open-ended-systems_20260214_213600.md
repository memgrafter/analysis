core_contribution: This paper addresses the epistemological challenges of modeling
  knowledge use and acquisition in open-ended evolutionary systems, where innovative
  and unbounded change generates novel possibilities that traditional closed-system
  approaches cannot handle. The authors develop a framework for epistemic logic that
  localizes knowledge to individual observers embedded within such systems, introducing
  the concept of "frame relativity" to formalize how observers' knowledge is fundamentally
  incomplete and constrained to their perspective.

# The use of knowledge in open-ended systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.00011
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00011
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Knowledge in open-ended evolutionary systems is fundamentally local, non-ergodic, and constrained by frame relativity, making traditional probabilistic approaches to understanding knowledge trajectories invalid

## Executive Summary
This paper develops a formal framework for understanding knowledge use and acquisition in open-ended evolutionary systems (OEE), where innovative and unbounded change generates novel possibilities that traditional closed-system approaches cannot handle. The authors introduce the concept of "frame relativity" to formalize how observers' knowledge is fundamentally incomplete and constrained to their perspective. They demonstrate that in OEE systems, individuals can agree to disagree, common knowledge is generally impossible, and nonlogical search mechanisms (like aesthetic reasoning) can be as knowledge generative as logical ones. The framework also proves that knowledge in these systems is non-ergodic, meaning that traditional probabilistic approaches to understanding knowledge trajectories do not apply.

## Method Summary
The paper develops a formal epistemic logic framework extending Kripke/Aumann models to handle open-ended evolution. It builds on Gödel incompleteness and modal logic foundations to formalize local knowledge, adjacent possible concepts, and frame relativity. The framework uses mathematical proofs to establish key theorems about knowledge incompleteness, non-convergence of theory revision, and undecidability of future discoveries in OEE systems. The method combines formal logic with insights from evolutionary theory and decision theory to create a comprehensive model of knowledge dynamics in systems characterized by continual novelty generation.

## Key Results
- Frame relativity fundamentally limits knowledge completeness in open-ended systems
- Nonlogical search mechanisms can be as knowledge generative as logical ones in OEE systems
- Knowledge in OEE systems is non-ergodic, making traditional probabilistic prediction impossible

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Frame relativity fundamentally limits knowledge completeness in open-ended systems
- **Mechanism**: Embedded observers cannot construct complete theories because their knowledge partitions are always incomplete relative to the full state space. The undecidability of future theoretical discoveries prevents convergence to a theory-of-everything
- **Core assumption**: OEE systems continuously generate novel predicates that cannot be recursively enumerated
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "observers embedded in open-ended evolutionary systems can agree to disagree and that their ability to theorize about their systems is fundamentally local and constrained to their frame of reference"
  - [section]: "individual i's frame of understanding at time t—their possible Πi,t =⟨Mi,t, Ti,t,Pi,t⟩—is an incomplete picture of the actual universe Ω"
  - [corpus]: Weak - related papers focus on evolutionary algorithms but don't address epistemological limitations
- **Break condition**: If system novelty generation halts or becomes fully predictable

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Nonlogical search mechanisms can be as knowledge generative as logical ones in OEE systems
- **Mechanism**: When logical theories become incomplete, aesthetic and heuristic reasoning provide systematic ways to explore adjacent possibilities that logical deduction cannot access. These nonlogical modes encode worldviews that enable coordination despite fragmented knowledge
- **Core assumption**: Individuals benefit from coordinating despite holding different theories of the world
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "nonlogical search mechanisms (like aesthetic reasoning) can be as knowledge generative as logical ones"
  - [section]: "The proliﬁc mathematician Poincaré believed that a mathematician uses their aesthetic sensibilities as 'a delicate sieve' on choice"
  - [corpus]: Weak - related papers don't discuss aesthetic reasoning as knowledge generation
- **Break condition**: If all relevant truths become decidable within logical frameworks

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Knowledge in OEE systems is non-ergodic, making traditional probabilistic prediction impossible
- **Mechanism**: Time averages of knowledge trajectories cannot converge to ensemble expectations because the adjacent possible constantly expands. Each individual's knowledge trajectory samples only a fragment of the total possibility space
- **Core assumption**: OEE systems exhibit continual growth in the number of possibilities
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract]: "knowledge in these systems is non-ergodic, meaning that traditional probabilistic approaches to understanding knowledge trajectories do not apply"
  - [section]: "limT →∞ 1T ´T0 κi,t(ω)dt ̸=´Ω κ(ω)P (ω)dω" proof showing knowledge cannot be ergodic
  - [corpus]: Weak - related papers don't address ergodicity in knowledge systems
- **Break condition**: If possibility space growth becomes bounded or predictable

## Foundational Learning

- **Modal logic and epistemic logic foundations**
  - Why needed here: The framework builds on Kripke/Aumann models but extends them to handle open-ended evolution
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between syntactic and semantic approaches to epistemic logic?

- **Gödel incompleteness and its implications for knowledge theory**
  - Why needed here: Core to understanding why embedded observers cannot construct complete theories of open-ended systems
  - Quick check question: How does Gödel's incompleteness theorem apply to theories of open-ended evolutionary systems?

- **Ergodicity concepts in dynamical systems**
  - Why needed here: Essential for understanding why traditional probabilistic approaches fail in OEE contexts
  - Quick check question: What's the difference between time averages and ensemble averages in non-ergodic systems?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Knowledge framework core -> Decision procedure module -> Theory revision engine -> Coordination mechanism

- **Critical path**: Theory revision → Knowledge update → Coordination attempt → New theory formulation

- **Design tradeoffs**: Local completeness vs. global incompleteness, logical vs. nonlogical reasoning modes, individual vs. system-level perspectives

- **Failure signatures**: Inability to predict system evolution, persistent disagreement between knowledgeable agents, unexpected emergence of novel possibilities

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Implement a simple OEE system with bounded novelty generation and test knowledge partition completeness
  2. Create two agents with different theories and observe coordination attempts under fragmented knowledge
  3. Compare prediction accuracy of ergodic vs. non-ergodic models in OEE systems with varying rates of novelty generation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we formally characterize and measure the degree of knowledge fragmentation between individuals in open-ended evolutionary systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses disjoint knowledge between individuals (Disjointness Conjecture) but does not provide a formal measure of fragmentation.
- Why unresolved: The paper establishes that knowledge is fragmented but doesn't quantify this fragmentation or provide metrics for measuring it.
- What evidence would resolve it: A mathematical framework defining metrics for knowledge overlap/disjointness between individuals, along with empirical validation showing how these metrics correlate with observed behavior in open-ended systems.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Under what specific conditions do nonlogical reasoning modes (aesthetic, heuristic, etc.) outperform logical reasoning in knowledge generation within OEE systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper demonstrates that nonlogical searches can be as knowledge generative as logical ones (OEE4) but doesn't specify when or why.
- Why unresolved: While the paper shows nonlogical reasoning can be effective, it doesn't identify the environmental or systemic conditions that favor one mode over another.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing performance of logical vs. nonlogical reasoning across different types of open-ended systems, identifying systematic patterns in when each approach succeeds.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can institutions be designed to maintain knowledge coordination in systems undergoing rapid theory-altering innovation?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests institutions emerge as epistemic palliatives to coordination problems but doesn't specify design principles.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies the need for institutions but doesn't provide a framework for how they should be structured or evolve.
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies of institutions that successfully maintained coordination through periods of rapid innovation, along with a theoretical framework explaining their key design features.

## Limitations

- The framework's core assumptions about continuous novelty generation in OEE systems remain empirically unverified
- The relationship between aesthetic reasoning and knowledge generation, while theoretically compelling, lacks empirical validation
- The non-ergodicity proofs assume specific forms of possibility space expansion that may not capture all OEE system dynamics

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Frame relativity limiting knowledge completeness, impossibility of common knowledge in OEE systems, basic structure of the knowledge framework
- **Medium confidence**: Non-ergodicity of knowledge trajectories, effectiveness of nonlogical search mechanisms, undecidability of future theoretical discoveries
- **Low confidence**: Practical implications for decision-making under uncertainty, specific mechanisms of theory revision coordination, exact relationship between aesthetic reasoning and knowledge generation

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical validation of novelty generation**: Implement a concrete OEE system (e.g., evolutionary algorithm with open-ended innovation) and measure whether novelty generation truly exhibits the unbounded characteristics required by the framework

2. **Coordination mechanism testing**: Design an experiment where agents with different theories must coordinate on shared goals, testing whether nonlogical reasoning modes actually enable effective coordination under fragmented knowledge

3. **Ergodicity verification**: Compare time-averaged knowledge trajectories against ensemble expectations in simulated OEE systems with varying rates of possibility space expansion, empirically testing the non-ergodicity claim
