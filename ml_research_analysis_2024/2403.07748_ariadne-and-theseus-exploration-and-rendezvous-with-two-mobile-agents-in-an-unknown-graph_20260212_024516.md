# Ariadne and Theseus: Exploration and Rendezvous with Two Mobile Agents in an Unknown Graph

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.07748
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07748
- Reference count: 22
- Primary result: Achieves m time-steps for exploration and 3/2m time-steps for rendezvous with two mobile agents in unknown graphs

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses two fundamental problems in mobile computing: exploration and rendezvous with two mobile agents in unknown graphs. The agents communicate through whiteboards at nodes and move along edges in discrete time-steps. The paper presents novel algorithms that significantly improve upon traditional depth-first search approaches, achieving m time-steps for collective exploration (versus 2m) and 3/2m time-steps for rendezvous (versus 2m). These results hold in both synchronous and asynchronous settings where agent speeds are adversary-controlled.

## Method Summary
The paper develops algorithms for two mobile agents operating in an unknown graph where they can read/write information on whiteboards at nodes and move along one edge per time-step. For exploration, the algorithm achieves collective traversal of all edges in m time-steps rather than the 2m required by depth-first search. For rendezvous, the algorithm guarantees meeting in at most 3/2m time-steps compared to the 2m of wait-for-Mommy approaches. Both algorithms are designed to work in an asynchronous setting where an adversary controls agent speeds, and the results extend to weighted graphs by replacing m with the sum of edge lengths.

## Key Results
- Collective exploration algorithm achieves m time-steps versus 2m for DFS
- Rendezvous algorithm guarantees 3/2m time-steps versus 2m for wait-for-Mommy
- Results extend to asynchronous setting with adversary-controlled speeds
- Guarantees generalize to weighted graphs with sum of edge lengths

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The algorithms leverage efficient communication through whiteboard coordination and strategic movement patterns that avoid redundant traversals. By carefully synchronizing agent movements and information sharing, the algorithms achieve optimal coverage while minimizing unnecessary backtracking.

## Foundational Learning
- **Graph exploration complexity**: Understanding how many edges must be traversed to explore all edges in a graph; needed to establish baseline performance metrics; quick check: compare m vs 2m traversals
- **Mobile agent coordination**: How multiple agents can efficiently coordinate movement and information sharing; needed for both exploration and rendezvous; quick check: verify whiteboard communication model
- **Asynchronous algorithms**: Designing algorithms that work when agent speeds are controlled by an adversary; needed for robustness; quick check: confirm worst-case guarantees hold
- **Lower bound analysis**: Proving that algorithm performance cannot be improved beyond certain limits; needed to validate optimality; quick check: verify matching lower bounds

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component map**: Agents → Whiteboard nodes → Graph edges (Agents communicate via whiteboards at nodes while traversing edges)
- **Critical path**: Movement → Information exchange → Decision making (Agents move, read/write whiteboards, decide next move)
- **Design tradeoffs**: Perfect communication vs. real-world constraints; theoretical guarantees vs. practical complexity
- **Failure signatures**: Communication failures at nodes, agent speed manipulation by adversary, incorrect whiteboard updates
- **First experiments**:
  1. Test exploration algorithm on simple cycle graphs to verify m time-step guarantee
  2. Validate rendezvous algorithm on two-node graphs with different starting positions
  3. Implement asynchronous version and test with adversarial speed control

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Focuses on theoretical worst-case guarantees rather than practical performance
- High computational complexity or memory requirements may limit real-world deployment
- Whiteboard communication model assumes perfect, instantaneous communication
- Results don't extend to multi-agent scenarios beyond two agents

## Confidence
- **Theoretical correctness of m exploration**: High
- **Theoretical correctness of 3/2m rendezvous**: High
- **Practical applicability of algorithms**: Medium
- **Scalability to larger agent populations**: Low

## Next Checks
1. Implement the algorithms and measure actual memory and computational requirements on graphs of varying sizes and structures to assess practical feasibility.
2. Test the algorithms under realistic communication constraints (delays, failures, limited bandwidth) to evaluate robustness beyond the theoretical whiteboard model.
3. Extend the analysis to weighted graphs with heterogeneous edge costs to verify the claimed generalization and identify scenarios where the theoretical guarantees may not hold in practice.
