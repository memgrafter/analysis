core_contribution: This manifesto introduces post-userist recommender systems as a
  framework that moves beyond the traditional user-system relationship to consider
  a broader set of stakeholder relations, particularly between creators and audiences.
  The authors argue that as generative AI enables personalized content synthesis,
  userist recommendation approaches become indistinguishable from media generation,
  threatening the role of creators in digital ecosystems.

# Post-Userist Recommender Systems : A Manifesto

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.11870
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11870
- Reference count: 0
- Primary result: Introduces post-userist recommender systems as framework moving beyond user-system relationship to consider broader stakeholder relations, especially creator-audience connections in era of generative AI

## Executive Summary
This manifesto argues that traditional userist recommender systems face obsolescence in the era of generative AI, as the distinction between recommendation and content generation blurs. The authors propose post-userist recommendation as an alternative framework that maintains the recommendation function's separation from generative media while preserving creator-audience relationships. They identify two paths forward: personalized content synthesis that eliminates creators entirely, or post-userist approaches that embrace broader sociotechnical contexts. The paper outlines a research agenda focusing on creator-audience relations, creator-side interfaces, community governance, and recommendation refusal.

## Method Summary
This conceptual manifesto proposes a theoretical framework rather than a technical method. The authors analyze the limitations of userist recommender systems in the context of generative AI capabilities, arguing that personalized content synthesis threatens creator ecosystems. They outline a research agenda including studying creator-audience relations, designing creator-side interfaces, developing community governance mechanisms, and examining recommendation refusal. The framework distinguishes between recommendation (retrieving existing items) and generative media (creating novel items), positioning post-userist approaches as preserving the recommendation function while maintaining creator connections.

## Key Results
- Userist recommendation becomes indistinguishable from generative media synthesis in era of generative AI
- Commercial platforms have incentives to eliminate creators when digital goods are replaced by generative media
- Post-userist recommendation preserves creator-audience relationships while userist approaches do not
- Two paths forward: creator-exiling personalized synthesis or post-userist approaches embracing broader sociotechnical context

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Userist recommendation becomes indistinguishable from generative media synthesis in the era of generative AI
- Mechanism: As generative AI can create personalized content directly, traditional recommendation function (retrieving existing items) converges with content generation (creating new items), eliminating distinction between recommending and creating
- Core assumption: Generative AI will achieve sufficient quality to replace traditional recommendation slates of digital goods
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we argue that in the era of generative media, userist recommendation becomes indistinguishable from personalized media generation"
  - [section] "Given the trajectory of generative AI, it is reasonable to assume that it will be possible to deliver personalized collections of synthesized content to replace current recommendation slates of digital goods"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus contains related papers on generative recommenders but no direct evidence about indistinguishability claims
- Break condition: If generative AI cannot achieve sufficient quality to replace traditional recommendation slates, or if users strongly prefer authentic creator content over synthesized alternatives

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Commercial platforms have incentives to eliminate creators when digital goods are replaced by generative media
- Mechanism: When platforms can generate content instead of distributing creator content, they eliminate need to share platform revenues with creators, reducing costs to software and server investments only
- Core assumption: Platforms prioritize cost reduction over creator ecosystem health
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "In marketplaces for digital goods where recommender systems are commonly used, costs are (in the limit) driven by the portion of platform revenue shared with item providers/creators" and "When digital goods are replaced by generative media, the creators' share can be eliminated and replaced by capital investment"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus papers focus on technical aspects rather than business model implications
- Break condition: If creator communities provide sufficient value (engagement, authenticity, cultural capital) that outweighs cost savings from elimination

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Post-userist recommendation preserves creator-audience relationships while userist recommendation does not
- Mechanism: By centering broader sociotechnical context including creator-audience relations rather than just user-system relations, post-userist approaches can maintain connections between creators and audiences even when generative media exists
- Core assumption: Creator-audience relationships have intrinsic value beyond immediate consumption
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Post-userist recommendation posits a larger field of relations in which stakeholders are embedded and distinguishes the recommendation function (which can potentially connect creators with audiences) from generative media"
  - [section] "Successful post-userist recommendation designs will aim at the creation and maintenance of the creator/audience relation in addition to the system/user relation"
  - [corpus] No direct evidence - corpus papers do not address creator-audience relationship preservation
- Break condition: If creator-audience relationships prove economically unviable or if users demonstrate no preference for creator connection over pure personalization

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Distinction between retrieval and generation in recommendation systems
  - Why needed here: The paper's core argument depends on understanding that traditional recommendation retrieves existing items while generative approaches create new ones
  - Quick check question: What fundamental difference exists between a system that recommends existing songs and one that generates new songs based on user preferences?

- Concept: Stakeholder analysis in sociotechnical systems
  - Why needed here: Post-userist recommendation requires understanding multiple stakeholder relationships beyond just user-system
  - Quick check question: Who are the stakeholders in a music streaming platform beyond just listeners and the platform itself?

- Concept: Economic incentives in digital platform ecosystems
  - Why needed here: The argument about creator elimination depends on understanding platform revenue sharing models
  - Quick check question: How do platform revenue sharing models create incentives for or against maintaining creator ecosystems?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: User interface → Recommendation engine → Content source (existing items vs generative model) → Creator analytics dashboard → Community governance interface
- Critical path: User request → Recommendation selection/synthesis → Content delivery → Feedback collection → System optimization
- Design tradeoffs: Personalization accuracy vs creator diversity, computational cost of generation vs retrieval, user satisfaction vs creator sustainability
- Failure signatures: User complaints about "inauthentic" content, creator exodus from platform, declining diversity in recommendations, increased computational costs
- First 3 experiments:
  1. A/B test comparing user engagement with traditional recommendations vs synthesized content for identical user profiles
  2. Creator-side dashboard measuring visibility and audience connection metrics under different recommendation approaches
  3. Community governance pilot testing transparency features around content sourcing (generated vs creator-produced)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can recommender systems be designed to strengthen rather than weaken the creator-audience relationship in digital marketplaces?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper explicitly identifies this as a key research direction, stating "Successful post-userist recommendation designs will aim at the creation and maintenance of the creator / audience relation in addition to the system/ user relation."
- Why unresolved: Current recommender systems primarily optimize for user satisfaction and platform engagement metrics, with little consideration for preserving or enhancing connections between creators and their audiences. The paper argues this is problematic in the generative AI era.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing userist vs post-userist recommender system designs that measure not just user satisfaction but also creator-audience engagement metrics, creator revenue impacts, and long-term ecosystem health indicators.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific interfaces and tools do creators need to effectively engage with and benefit from recommender systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The manifesto lists "Designing, implementing and evaluating creator-side interfaces to recommender systems" as a key research direction.
- Why unresolved: While recommender systems have extensive user-facing interfaces, creators typically have limited visibility into how their content is being recommended, what factors influence recommendations, or tools to optimize their content's discoverability while maintaining artistic integrity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and evaluation of prototype creator-side interfaces that provide transparency into recommendation algorithms, content performance analytics, and tools for creator feedback, with measurable impacts on creator satisfaction and content quality.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Under what conditions does userist recommendation break down or face resistance, and what are the sociotechnical factors that drive this breakdown?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies "Studying recommendation refusal and resistance: where does userist recommendation breakdown?" as a key research area.
- Why unresolved: While the paper argues userist recommendation is problematic, it doesn't systematically catalog the specific scenarios, contexts, or user populations where it fails or generates resistance. Understanding these failure modes is crucial for developing viable alternatives.
- What evidence would resolve it: Ethnographic studies, user interviews, and quantitative analysis across different recommendation domains (music, video, social media, etc.) that identify patterns in when and why users reject or resist algorithmic recommendations, including cultural, social, and technical factors.

## Limitations
- Limited empirical evidence supporting claims about generative AI's impact on recommendation systems
- Relies heavily on future-looking predictions about AI capabilities that remain technically uncertain
- Economic arguments assume rational cost-minimizing platform behavior that may not hold in practice
- Practical implementation details and evaluation metrics for post-userist systems remain underdeveloped

## Confidence
- High confidence in the conceptual framing of userist vs post-userist approaches
- Medium confidence in the economic incentive analysis
- Low confidence in technical predictions about generative AI's impact on recommendation systems

## Next Checks
1. Conduct empirical studies measuring user preference for creator-authentic content versus personalized synthesized content across different content domains
2. Analyze existing multistakeholder recommendation systems to identify which aspects already incorporate post-userist principles and where gaps remain
3. Develop preliminary evaluation metrics that can quantify creator-audience relationship quality in recommendation scenarios
