## Executive Summary
This systematic literature review examines the growing application of diffusion models to planning tasks, identifying 41 relevant papers since 2023. The authors categorize the literature into fundamental planning methods, skill-centric approaches, safety mechanisms, and domain-specific applications. Diffusion models are shown to excel in complex planning scenarios through iterative denoising processes that effectively capture data distributions. The review highlights applications in motion planning, reinforcement learning, and autonomous driving while discussing challenges including computational efficiency and scalability.

## Method Summary
The authors conducted a systematic literature review by searching IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Dblp, and ArXiv using keywords "diffusion" and "plan" to identify relevant papers. Starting with an initial set of 47 papers, they applied filtering criteria to exclude papers focused on LLMs/NLP or unrelated to planning applications, narrowing to 41 relevant papers. These were then categorized into five perspectives: datasets and benchmarks, fundamental studies, skill-centric planning, safety mechanisms, and domain-specific applications.

## Key Results

- Applications span motion planning, reinforcement learning, and autonomous driving with significant growth in publications since 2023
- Key challenges include computational efficiency, scalability, and the need for optimization techniques for real-time applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Diffusion models leverage iterative denoising processes to capture complex data distributions effectively.
- Mechanism: Diffusion models introduce noise into training data and learn to reverse this process through iterative denoising, enabling accurate modeling of the underlying data distribution. This process allows exploration of a wide solution space and generation of high-quality, diverse outputs.
- Core assumption: The iterative denoising process can effectively model complex data distributions and capture the underlying structure of the data.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Diffusion models, which leverage stochastic processes to capture complex data distributions effectively, have shown their performance as generative models, achieving notable success in image-related tasks through iterative denoising processes."
  - [section I] "The fundamental principle of diffusion models involves introducing noise to training data and learning to reverse this process through iterative denoising, effectively capturing complex data distributions."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence: Corpus neighbors focus on systematic literature reviews in other fields, not specifically on diffusion model mechanisms.
- Break Condition: If the iterative denoising process fails to converge or produces poor-quality outputs, the model's ability to capture complex data distributions would be compromised.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Diffusion models excel in complex planning scenarios by providing flexibility and adaptability.
- Mechanism: Diffusion models can be conditioned on various inputs, such as task requirements and environmental constraints, to generate task-specific trajectories and policies. This allows for adaptive planning in dynamic environments and enhances the model's ability to handle unforeseen situations.
- Core assumption: Conditioning diffusion models on relevant inputs can effectively guide the generation of appropriate plans and policies for specific tasks and environments.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Recently, diffusion models have been further applied and show their strong abilities in planning tasks, leading to a significant growth in related publications since 2023."
  - [section IV.B] "Targeting motion and path planning, this section introduces diverse approaches leveraging diffusion models, comparing their contributions, proposed methodologies."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence: Corpus neighbors focus on systematic literature reviews in other fields, not specifically on diffusion model applications in planning.
- Break Condition: If the conditioning mechanism fails to provide sufficient guidance or the generated plans are not feasible or optimal, the model's adaptability and performance in complex planning scenarios would be limited.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Diffusion models can be combined with other generative models to enhance performance, robustness, and efficiency.
- Mechanism: Integrating diffusion models with models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can address challenges such as overfitting, improve training stability, and accelerate inference processes. This combination leverages the strengths of each model to create a more robust and efficient planning system.
- Core assumption: The integration of diffusion models with other generative models can effectively combine their strengths and mitigate their weaknesses, leading to improved overall performance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section VIII.A] "Combining diffusion models with other generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) [67] and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [68], offers the potential for enhancing the performance, robustness, and efficiency of diffusion models used in planning."
  - [section VIII.A] "Integrating diffusion models with VAEs can mitigate overfitting by leveraging the continuous data approximations that VAEs provide."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence: Corpus neighbors focus on systematic literature reviews in other fields, not specifically on combining diffusion models with other generative models.
- Break Condition: If the integration of models leads to increased complexity, instability, or reduced performance, the benefits of combining diffusion models with other generative models would be negated.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Stochastic processes
  - Why needed here: Diffusion models are based on stochastic processes, which introduce randomness into the data generation process. Understanding stochastic processes is crucial for grasping the underlying principles of diffusion models.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of stochastic processes in diffusion models, and how do they contribute to the model's ability to capture complex data distributions?

- Concept: Iterative denoising
  - Why needed here: Iterative denoising is a core component of diffusion models, where noise is gradually removed from the data to reveal the underlying structure. Understanding this process is essential for comprehending how diffusion models generate high-quality outputs.
  - Quick check question: How does the iterative denoising process work in diffusion models, and what are its key advantages compared to other generative approaches?

- Concept: Conditioning
  - Why needed here: Conditioning allows diffusion models to generate outputs based on specific inputs, such as task requirements or environmental constraints. This is crucial for adapting the model to different planning scenarios and ensuring the generated plans are relevant and feasible.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of conditioning in diffusion models, and how does it enable the generation of task-specific trajectories and policies?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Noise injection module -> Denoising network -> Conditioning module -> Output module

- Critical path:
  1. Inject noise into the training data
  2. Train the denoising network to reverse the noise injection process
  3. Condition the model on relevant inputs
  4. Generate the final plan or trajectory through iterative denoising

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Model complexity vs. performance: More complex models may achieve better performance but require more computational resources
  - Training time vs. sample quality: Longer training times may lead to higher-quality samples but increase the overall development time
  - Conditioning granularity vs. adaptability: Finer-grained conditioning may improve adaptability but increase the complexity of the conditioning module

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor-quality outputs: Indicates issues with the denoising network or noise injection process
  - Lack of adaptability: Suggests problems with the conditioning module or insufficient training data
  - Slow inference times: May indicate inefficiencies in the model architecture or computational resources

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train a basic diffusion model on a simple planning task (e.g., maze navigation) and evaluate its performance
  2. Introduce conditioning inputs and assess the model's ability to generate task-specific plans
  3. Combine the diffusion model with a VAE or GAN and compare its performance to the standalone diffusion model
