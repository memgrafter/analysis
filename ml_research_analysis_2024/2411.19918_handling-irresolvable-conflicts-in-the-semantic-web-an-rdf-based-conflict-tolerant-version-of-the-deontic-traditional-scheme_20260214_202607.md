core_contribution: This paper presents a novel computational ontology for modeling
  and reasoning with deontic modalities in RDF, specifically designed to handle irresolvable
  conflicts in normative reasoning. The key contribution is the distinction between
  contradictions and conflicts, where conflicts are defined as situations where complying
  with one deontic statement entails violating another, rather than treating them
  as contradictions as traditional deontic logics do.

- Primary result: Novel RDF-based computational ontology for deontic reasoning that distinguishes conflicts from contradictions and implements all six deontic modalities with explicit conflict representation

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a computational ontology for modeling and reasoning with deontic modalities in RDF that specifically addresses irresolvable conflicts in normative reasoning. The key innovation is distinguishing between contradictions and conflicts, where conflicts are situations where complying with one deontic statement entails violating another, rather than treating them as contradictions as traditional deontic logics do. The framework implements the Deontic Traditional Scheme in RDFs and SPARQL, formalizing all six deontic modalities (obligatory, permitted, prohibited, omissible, optional, non-optional) and their logical relationships. A key technical innovation is the two-level architecture distinguishing "eventualities" (where deontic modalities apply) from "statements" (implementing classical logic operators), implemented through reification. The ontology includes explicit representation of conflicts and other abnormalities, enabling reasoning about them rather than simply blocking undesired inferences.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a novel RDF-based framework for deontic reasoning that implements the Deontic Traditional Scheme through a two-level architecture using reification. The approach distinguishes between "eventualities" (where deontic modalities apply) and "statements" (implementing classical logic operators), enabling the representation of all six deontic modalities and their logical relationships. The framework formalizes conflicts as situations where complying with one deontic statement entails violating another, rather than treating them as contradictions. All examples and Java code are available in a public GitHub repository, providing a W3C-standard compatible framework for processing Big Data in RDF format and identifying conflicts between norms from legislation.

## Key Results
- Novel RDF-based computational ontology for deontic reasoning that distinguishes conflicts from contradictions
- Implementation of all six deontic modalities (obligatory, permitted, prohibited, omissible, optional, non-optional) and their logical relationships in RDFs and SPARQL
- Two-level architecture using reification to distinguish "eventualities" from "statements" for handling deontic modalities
- Explicit representation of conflicts and abnormalities enabling reasoning about them rather than blocking inferences

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by implementing a two-level architecture that separates the representation of deontic modalities (applied to "eventualities") from classical logic operators (implemented as "statements"). This separation, achieved through reification, allows for the proper handling of conflicts as irresolvable situations rather than contradictions. By explicitly representing conflicts and abnormalities in the ontology, the system can reason about them and make informed decisions about normative compliance, rather than simply blocking inference when conflicts arise. The distinction between conflicts and contradictions aligns with established deontic logic principles and enables more nuanced reasoning about legal norms.

## Foundational Learning
- Deontic Traditional Scheme: A logical framework for representing obligations, permissions, and prohibitions; needed to provide a formal basis for normative reasoning in legal applications
- Reification in RDF: The process of turning RDF statements into resources that can be referenced; needed to implement the two-level architecture distinguishing eventualities from statements
- Conflict vs. Contradiction distinction: Conflicts are irresolvable situations where complying with one norm violates another, while contradictions are logical inconsistencies; needed to enable proper reasoning about normative conflicts rather than blocking inference
- Six deontic modalities: Obligatory, permitted, prohibited, omissible, optional, and non-optional; needed to capture the full range of normative statements in legal reasoning
- SPARQL for deontic reasoning: Using SPARQL queries to implement logical relationships between deontic modalities; needed to provide a practical implementation that can be deployed on existing Semantic Web infrastructure

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Eventualities (RDF resources with deontic modalities) -> Statements (reified RDF triples with logical operators) -> Conflicts/Abnormalities (explicitly represented normative conflicts)

**Critical path:** Eventualities with deontic modalities are identified and linked to reified statements that implement classical logic operators, with conflicts detected through SPARQL queries that identify situations where compliance with one norm violates another

**Design tradeoffs:** The two-level architecture using reification provides conceptual clarity and enables proper conflict handling, but may introduce query complexity and performance overhead in SPARQL implementations

**Failure signatures:** Undetected conflicts when SPARQL queries fail to identify compliance-violation relationships; incorrect conflict classification when the distinction between conflicts and contradictions is not properly maintained; performance degradation with large legal ontologies due to reification overhead

**3 first experiments:** 1) Test conflict detection accuracy on a small legal ontology with known conflicts; 2) Benchmark query performance on ontologies of increasing size to assess scalability; 3) Integrate with a sample legal reasoning system to evaluate compatibility and practical utility

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Lack of empirical validation on real-world legal datasets or complex conflict scenarios
- No performance benchmarks or scalability tests to verify "Big Data" processing claims
- Potential practical challenges with SPARQL query complexity and execution efficiency in the two-level reification architecture

## Confidence
- Theoretical contributions: High (clear mathematical formalization and logical relationships)
- Practical applicability: Medium (lacks empirical validation but theoretically sound)
- Scalability claims: Low (no performance data provided)

## Next Checks
1. Implement testing with real legal ontologies containing known conflicts to verify conflict detection accuracy
2. Conduct performance benchmarking on datasets of increasing size to assess scalability claims
3. Perform integration testing with existing legal reasoning systems to evaluate compatibility and practical utility
