core_contribution: We present the first data-driven approach to creating human-like
  movement controllers for CS:GO, trained on 123 hours of professional game play.
  Our transformer-based model, MLMOVE, generates coordinated team movement for all
  players in a Retakes round, with an amortized cost of less than 0.5 ms per game
  step on a single CPU core.

# Learning to Move Like Professional Counter-Strike Players
## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.13934
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13934
- Reference count: 17
- Data-driven approach creating human-like movement controllers for CS:GO

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces MLMOVE, a transformer-based model trained on 123 hours of professional CS:GO gameplay that generates coordinated team movement in Retakes scenarios. The system produces human-like movement patterns at high efficiency (under 0.5ms per game step) and outperforms both commercial bots and expert-crafted controllers in human evaluations, achieving 16-59% higher TrueSkill ratings. The model demonstrates coordinated team behavior, fewer common movement mistakes, and produces movement distributions and player outcomes similar to professional play.

## Method Summary
The authors developed a transformer-based model that learns to generate coordinated team movement by training on professional CS:GO gameplay data. The model processes observations from all players in a Retakes round and outputs movement decisions for each player simultaneously. The training leverages a large dataset of 123 hours of professional gameplay, focusing on the Retakes game mode. The architecture is designed for efficiency, achieving sub-0.5ms inference time on a single CPU core, making it practical for real-time game applications.

## Key Results
- MLMOVE generates coordinated team movement for all players in Retakes rounds with <0.5ms computation per step
- Human evaluators rated MLMOVE as more human-like than commercial bots and rule-based controllers (16-59% higher TrueSkill rating)
- Self-play experiments show MLMOVE exhibits teamwork, fewer movement mistakes, and produces professional-like movement distributions and kill locations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The model leverages transformer architecture's ability to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns in professional gameplay data. By training on 123 hours of expert demonstrations, MLMOVE learns the implicit coordination strategies and movement patterns that characterize professional CS:GO play. The attention mechanism allows the model to reason about relationships between players' positions and actions, enabling coordinated team behavior that emerges naturally from the learned representations rather than through explicit rule programming.

## Foundational Learning
- **Transformer architecture**: Why needed - processes sequential game state data and captures long-range dependencies between player movements; Quick check - verify attention patterns align with intuitive player coordination
- **Retakes game mode**: Why needed - provides controlled scenario with clear objectives and predictable enemy positions; Quick check - ensure dataset covers diverse tactical situations within this mode
- **Professional gameplay data**: Why needed - captures expert-level movement patterns and decision-making; Quick check - validate data quality and diversity of play styles
- **Human evaluation metrics**: Why needed - assesses subjective quality of "human-like" behavior; Quick check - establish inter-rater reliability and clear evaluation criteria

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map**: Input observations -> Transformer encoder -> Player coordination attention -> Movement action decoder -> Output actions
**Critical Path**: Game state observations → Multi-head attention processing → Cross-player coordination reasoning → Individual movement predictions
**Design Tradeoffs**: Chose transformer over recurrent models for better parallel processing and attention-based coordination, sacrificing some temporal modeling efficiency for improved team coordination capabilities
**Failure Signatures**: May produce unrealistic movements in unseen scenarios, struggle with novel tactical situations not present in training data, or exhibit coordination breakdowns when player counts deviate from training distribution
**First Experiments**: 1) Unit test individual movement predictions against ground truth trajectories, 2) Evaluate cross-player coordination in controlled 2v2 scenarios, 3) Stress test with adversarial movement patterns designed to break coordination

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Narrow scope focusing exclusively on Retakes scenarios, limiting generalizability to other game modes
- Human evaluation methodology relies on subjective crowdsourcing assessments rather than objective performance metrics
- Claims of "human-like" behavior primarily address movement patterns without addressing tactical decision-making or weapon selection

## Confidence
**High Confidence**: Technical implementation details and performance metrics (computation time, coordination capabilities) are well-documented and reproducible
**Medium Confidence**: Human evaluation results showing MLMOVE's superiority over baselines depend on subjective assessments and show variability (16-59% improvement range)
**Low Confidence**: Claims about tactical awareness and strategic decision-making lack empirical support; model behavior in unseen scenarios remains untested

## Next Checks
1. Cross-scenario validation: Test MLMOVE's performance in non-Retakes scenarios (competitive matches, other map types) to assess generalizability
2. Controlled human evaluation: Conduct blind tests with professional CS:GO players comparing MLMOVE against human opponents and commercial bots across multiple performance dimensions
3. Adversarial testing: Evaluate MLMOVE's robustness against deliberately designed anti-movement strategies and in edge cases (smoke grenades, flashbangs, complex terrain) to identify potential failure modes
