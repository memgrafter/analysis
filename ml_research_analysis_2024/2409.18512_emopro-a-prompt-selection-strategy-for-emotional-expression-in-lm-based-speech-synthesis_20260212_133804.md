# EmoPro: A Prompt Selection Strategy for Emotional Expression in LM-based Speech Synthesis

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2409.18512
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18512
- **Reference count:** 34
- **Key outcome:** EmoPro achieves emotion MOS of 4.45 versus 4.13-4.33 for baselines and strength perception score of 0.811 versus 0.668-0.767

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces EmoPro, a two-stage prompt selection strategy designed to enhance emotional expressiveness in language model-based speech synthesis. The method addresses the challenge of selecting appropriate prompts that effectively convey target emotions in synthesized speech. EmoPro operates through a static selection stage that filters prompts based on multiple evaluation criteria, followed by a dynamic selection stage that chooses the most semantically relevant prompt for the given text. The approach is evaluated using the CosyV oice model across five emotions, demonstrating significant improvements in both perceived emotion quality and strength compared to baseline selection methods.

## Method Summary
EmoPro implements a two-stage prompt selection framework. The static selection stage evaluates available prompts using four metrics: pitch characteristics analysis, perceptual quality assessment via DNSMOS, text-emotion consistency scoring, and model performance metrics including character error rate (CER), speaker similarity, and emotion similarity. Prompts that meet threshold criteria across these metrics are retained for the next stage. The dynamic selection stage then matches the synthesized text with the most semantically relevant prompt from the filtered candidates using text-based similarity measures. This hierarchical approach aims to balance both technical quality and emotional appropriateness in prompt selection.

## Key Results
- EmoPro achieves emotion MOS of 4.45 compared to 4.13-4.33 for baseline methods
- Strength perception scores reach 0.811 versus 0.668-0.767 for baselines
- Superior performance in speaker similarity, emotion similarity, and CER metrics compared to baseline approaches
- Consistent improvements across all five evaluated emotions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
EmoPro's effectiveness stems from its hierarchical evaluation framework that combines both objective technical metrics and subjective quality assessments. The static selection stage ensures that only prompts meeting baseline quality standards in terms of pitch, perceptual quality, and model performance are considered, preventing degradation from poorly performing prompts. The subsequent semantic matching stage then optimizes for emotional relevance to the specific input text. This dual-filter approach addresses both the technical constraints of speech synthesis and the nuanced requirements of emotional expression, creating a more robust selection process than single-criterion methods.

## Foundational Learning
- **Pitch characteristics analysis**: Essential for evaluating prosodic features that convey emotion in speech; quick check involves analyzing fundamental frequency patterns and pitch contour variations
- **DNSMOS perceptual quality metric**: Provides standardized human perception scores for audio quality; quick check requires comparing DNSMOS scores across different prompt selections
- **Text-emotion consistency scoring**: Measures alignment between textual content and intended emotional expression; quick check involves automated emotion classification of text paired with prompt evaluation
- **Character error rate (CER)**: Quantifies transcription accuracy in synthesized speech; quick check compares CER values across different prompt selections
- **Speaker similarity metrics**: Ensures emotional expression doesn't compromise speaker identity; quick check involves speaker verification models comparing synthetic and reference speech
- **Emotion similarity measures**: Quantifies how well synthesized speech matches target emotional characteristics; quick check uses emotion recognition models to score similarity

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Static Selection Module -> Dynamic Selection Module -> CosyV oice Synthesis Model

**Critical Path:** Prompt Database → Static Evaluation (Pitch, DNSMOS, Text-Emotion, Model Metrics) → Filtered Prompt Set → Dynamic Semantic Matching → Selected Prompt → Speech Synthesis

**Design Tradeoffs:** The two-stage approach trades computational overhead for improved selection quality. Static filtering reduces the candidate pool early, improving dynamic matching efficiency, but may exclude potentially useful prompts that fail one metric but excel in others. The method prioritizes reliability over exploration of novel prompt-emotion combinations.

**Failure Signatures:** Poor pitch analysis may retain prompts with unnatural prosody; inadequate DNSMOS thresholds may allow perceptually degraded speech; overly strict text-emotion consistency may exclude contextually appropriate prompts; suboptimal dynamic matching may select semantically relevant but emotionally weak prompts.

**First Experiments:** 1) Run static selection alone to evaluate baseline filtering effectiveness, 2) Test dynamic selection with all available prompts to establish upper bound performance, 3) Compare individual metric contributions by running ablation studies on static selection criteria

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the source material.

## Limitations
- Results rely on a single dataset (LJSpeech) with emotion labels generated via pre-trained model rather than natural annotations
- Evaluation framework depends heavily on subjective MOS scores and automated metrics that may not fully capture nuanced emotional expressiveness
- CosyV oice model-specific implementation suggests potential transfer challenges to other language models
- Limited investigation of how prompt selection strategies perform across different emotional speech synthesis architectures

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in quantitative improvements over baselines (emotion MOS, strength perception scores)
- **Medium confidence** in practical applicability across different emotional speech synthesis systems
- **Low confidence** in claims about robustness across diverse datasets and annotation methodologies

## Next Checks
1. Test EmoPro's performance on naturally annotated emotional speech datasets rather than synthetically labeled ones to validate robustness across different data quality levels
2. Evaluate the transferability of the static selection criteria (pitch characteristics, DNSMOS, text-emotion consistency) across different language models and speech synthesis architectures to assess generalizability
3. Conduct ablation studies to determine the relative contribution of each evaluation metric in the static selection stage and whether the two-stage approach provides significant advantages over simpler single-stage selection methods
