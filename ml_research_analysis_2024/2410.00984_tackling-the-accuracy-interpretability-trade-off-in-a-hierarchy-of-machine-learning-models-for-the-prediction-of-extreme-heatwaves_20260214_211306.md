# Tackling the Accuracy-Interpretability Trade-off in a Hierarchy of Machine Learning Models for the Prediction of Extreme Heatwaves

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.00984
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00984
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: ScatNet achieves similar performance to CNNs while providing greater transparency and identifying key scales and patterns in the data.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the accuracy-interpretability trade-off in machine learning models for predicting extreme heatwaves. The authors use a hierarchy of increasingly complex models, ranging from a global Gaussian Approximation (GA) to deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to forecast heatwaves over France. They find that CNNs provide higher accuracy but are less interpretable, while a Scattering Network (ScatNet) achieves similar performance to CNNs while providing greater transparency and identifying key scales and patterns in the data. The study highlights the importance of interpretability in climate science and demonstrates that simpler models can rival the performance of their more complex counterparts.

## Method Summary
The study uses a hierarchy of four machine learning models to predict extreme heatwaves over France: Gaussian Approximation (GA), Invariant Integrated Neural Network (IINN), Scattering Network (ScatNet), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The models are trained and validated on 800 years of CESM climate model data (1000 years total, with 200 years held out for testing), using daily geopotential height anomaly (500 hPa) over the Northern Hemisphere and soil moisture anomalies over France during June-July-August. Performance is evaluated using Negative Log Likelihood (NLL), Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS), and Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) for top 5% events, with skill scores relative to climatology.

## Key Results
- ScatNet achieves similar performance to CNNs while providing greater transparency and identifying key scales and patterns in the data
- When data is scarce, the best performance was achieved by the simple linear regression of the Gaussian approximation
- The gain in performance from GA comes from oscillations in the geopotential height field, mainly over the North Atlantic and with a wavelength around 400 km

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Simpler interpretable models can rival or exceed the performance of complex black-box models when data is limited.
- Mechanism: With scarce data, complex models overfit while simpler models generalize better; interpretability remains high due to linear or constrained architectures.
- Core assumption: Model performance depends on data availability and the complexity of the learning task.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "simpler models can rival the performance of their more complex counterparts"
  - [section]: "when data is scarce, the best performance was achieved by the simple linear regression of the Gaussian approximation"
  - [corpus]: weak evidence, no direct matches in neighbors
- Break Condition: If the dataset becomes large enough that complex models can learn without overfitting, their performance advantage may outweigh interpretability loss.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Post-hoc explainability methods provide limited insight compared to built-in interpretability.
- Mechanism: Post-hoc explanations approximate model behavior and may not reflect the true reasoning; built-in interpretability exposes the actual decision process.
- Core assumption: Local explanations cannot capture global model behavior and may mislead.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "post-hoc explainability of the more complex networks" contrasted with "built-in interpretability"
  - [section]: "post-hoc explainable AI techniques... fundamentally flawed as the explanations provided only approximate the true prediction"
  - [corpus]: weak evidence, neighbors focus on interpretability-accuracy trade-offs but not on method limitations
- Break Condition: If explainability methods are specifically designed for the model architecture and validated, their insights may become more reliable.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Scattering networks capture key predictive features while maintaining interpretability.
- Mechanism: The scattering transform extracts stable, translation-invariant features at multiple scales, allowing linear models on top to remain interpretable.
- Core assumption: Important predictive information is encoded in the scale and orientation of features rather than complex nonlinear combinations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "ScatNet achieves similar performance to CNNs while providing greater transparency, identifying key scales and patterns"
  - [section]: "the gain in performance from GA comes from oscillations in the geopotential height field, mainly over the North Atlantic and with a wavelength around 400 km"
  - [corpus]: weak evidence, neighbors do not discuss scattering networks
- Break Condition: If the underlying data structure does not exhibit scale-dependent patterns, the scattering transform may not provide additional predictive power.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Linear regression and Gaussian approximations
  - Why needed here: Forms the baseline interpretable model and understanding of how projection patterns relate to physical phenomena
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how the Gaussian approximation projects high-dimensional data onto a scalar index and why this is interpretable?

- Concept: Convolutional neural networks and their black-box nature
  - Why needed here: Understanding the trade-off between model complexity and interpretability
  - Quick check question: What are the key architectural differences between CNNs and linear models that make CNNs harder to interpret?

- Concept: Scattering transforms and multiscale feature extraction
  - Why needed here: Core mechanism for achieving both high performance and interpretability
  - Quick check question: How does the scattering transform decompose input data into features at different scales and orientations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input preprocessing -> Model hierarchy (GA -> IINN -> ScatNet -> CNN) -> Performance evaluation -> Interpretability analysis
- Critical path: Data preparation -> Model training -> Hyperparameter optimization -> Performance testing -> Interpretability validation
- Design tradeoffs: Simplicity vs. performance, interpretability vs. flexibility, data efficiency vs. model capacity
- Failure signatures: Overfitting in complex models, poor generalization in simple models, uninterpretable post-hoc explanations
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement and train the Gaussian approximation on the dataset, validate performance and projection patterns
  2. Add the IINN model, compare performance and projection patterns to GA
  3. Implement ScatNet, verify it achieves similar performance to CNN while maintaining interpretability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would the performance of these models change when applied to observational datasets with shorter records and potential biases compared to the CESM control run?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors explicitly note that their experiments used a 1000-year CESM control run, which is much longer than typical observational datasets, and they mention this as a limitation for real-world applications.
- Why unresolved: The paper primarily uses synthetic data from a climate model, which may not capture all the complexities and biases present in observational records. The authors acknowledge this gap but do not provide empirical evidence from observational data.
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the same hierarchy of models to real-world observational datasets (e.g., ERA5 reanalysis) and comparing performance metrics (CRPS, NLL, BCES) would provide concrete evidence of how well these methods generalize to observational data.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific physical mechanisms drive the sub-synoptic oscillations in geopotential height that the ScatNet identifies as important for heatwave prediction?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state that the ScatNet identifies additional predictive information in sub-synoptic oscillations in the geopotential height field, particularly over the North Atlantic with wavelengths around 400 km, but they do not provide a mechanistic explanation for these patterns.
- Why unresolved: While the ScatNet can identify these patterns and their scales, the paper does not investigate the underlying physical processes that generate these sub-synoptic oscillations or their connection to heatwave formation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed dynamical analysis of the identified oscillation patterns, including their relationship to known atmospheric phenomena (e.g., gravity waves, mesoscale convective systems, or boundary layer processes) and their role in heatwave development, would provide physical insight into these mechanisms.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How would incorporating ocean variables (sea surface temperature, sea ice) affect the performance and interpretability of these models for subseasonal to seasonal heatwave prediction?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly state that they neglected ocean variables "although in the real world they can be important sources of predictability for heatwaves at the subseasonal to seasonal timescale" and focus only on land and atmospheric components.
- Why unresolved: The study deliberately excludes ocean variables to simplify the problem and focus on methodological aspects, but this limits the applicability of the models to real-world prediction scenarios where ocean-atmosphere interactions are crucial.
- What evidence would resolve it: Re-running the experiments with ocean variables included as predictors and comparing performance metrics across different lead times would demonstrate the impact of ocean-atmosphere coupling on model skill and interpretability.

## Limitations
- The study uses only one climate model (CESM) for validation, which may limit generalizability
- The hyperparameter optimization and model training procedures are computationally intensive
- The paper focuses on a specific region (France) and time period (JJA), which may not generalize to other locations or seasons

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The existence of an accuracy-interpretability trade-off in ML models for climate prediction is well-established in the literature.
- **Medium confidence**: The specific claim that ScatNet achieves similar performance to CNNs while maintaining interpretability needs independent validation.
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that simpler models outperform complex ones when data is scarce requires testing on datasets with varying sizes.

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset generalization test**: Validate the model hierarchy on a different climate model or observational dataset to assess robustness of the accuracy-interpretability findings.

2. **Cross-validation robustness**: Perform additional cross-validation with different splits to ensure the performance rankings of models are stable.

3. **Interpretability audit**: Conduct a systematic comparison of post-hoc explanation methods versus built-in interpretability for the CNN and ScatNet models.
