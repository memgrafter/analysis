# Robustness and Exploration of Variational and Machine Learning Approaches to Inverse Problems: An Overview

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.12072
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12072
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Reviews robustness and exploration of variational and ML methods for inverse problems, focusing on point estimators and data-consistent solution subspaces.

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in solving inverse problems in imaging using variational methods and machine learning, with particular emphasis on robustness and explorability. The authors examine point estimators and their stability against adversarial perturbations through both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments on a one-dimensional toy problem. The review covers various deep learning approaches for point estimates and Bayesian methods for stochastic sampling, while addressing stability and robustness issues including adversarial robustness, distribution shifts, and changes in the forward measurement operator. The paper also explores methods for generating multiple solutions and incorporating additional guidance criteria to satisfy specific semantic or textural properties.

## Method Summary
The paper analyzes inverse problem solutions through both variational and learned approaches. Variational methods employ Tikhonov and total variation regularization, while learned approaches include U-Net post-processing, Tiramisu architectures, and ItNet with proximal steps. The theoretical framework establishes robustness bounds using Bregman distances for convex regularizers, showing that reconstruction differences are bounded by measurement consistency plus Bregman distance terms. Numerical experiments on a 1D toy problem demonstrate these theoretical properties, comparing reconstruction quality (ℓ2 error), measurement consistency, and adversarial robustness across different methods. The paper also discusses exploration methods for generating multiple solutions through conditional generative models and diffusion models with consistency projection.

## Key Results
- Variational methods exhibit provable stability through Bregman distance bounds, with reconstruction error bounded by measurement consistency plus a Bregman distance term.
- Learned convex regularizers can inherit stability properties when properly constrained (e.g., Lipschitz continuity), though empirical validation is limited to 1D problems.
- Deep equilibrium models (DEQs) show robustness to measurement operator changes by implicitly sharing parameters across iterations, unlike unrolled networks that suffer from step-dependent degradation.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: Robustness can be quantified in terms of the sum of measurement consistency and Bregman distance with respect to the regularizer, rather than only 𝓁2 stability in image space.
- **Mechanism**: For variational approaches, stability follows from the optimality condition of the energy minimization. The difference of two optimality conditions yields a bound where the change in reconstruction is bounded by the change in measurements plus a Bregman distance term, which depends on the subgradient of the regularizer.
- **Core assumption**: The regularizer is convex (or at least has well-defined subgradients) and the forward operator is linear.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] mentions "stability and robustness issues, including adversarial robustness, robustness to distribution shifts, and changes in the forward measurement operator."
  - [section] provides the explicit derivation showing 1/2‖𝑓1−𝑓2‖2 ≥ 1/2‖𝐴𝑢1−𝐴𝑢2‖2 + 𝐷𝑅(𝑢1,𝑢2) for convex regularizers.
  - [corpus] lacks direct evidence; no cited papers discuss Bregman distances explicitly.
- **Break condition**: If the regularizer is non-convex or has discontinuous subgradients, the Bregman distance may not be well-defined, invalidating the bound.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Learned convex regularizers can inherit provable stability properties similar to classical variational methods, provided they are designed with appropriate constraints.
- **Mechanism**: By constraining the learned regularizer (e.g., via Lipschitz continuity, convexity, or enforcing descent directions), one can ensure that the resulting reconstruction operator satisfies a stability estimate analogous to the classical Bregman bound.
- **Core assumption**: The learned regularizer satisfies the same structural properties (convexity, Lipschitz continuity) as classical regularizers.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] references "learned regularizers which are trained adversarially to distinguish between samples from the training data distribution and degraded samples" and notes that "imposing Lipschitz-continuity on the regularizer via a soft-penalty" can enforce stability.
  - [section] discusses how learned regularizers can be constrained to ensure convergence and stability, citing [108, 124, 123].
  - [corpus] shows no direct citations to papers proving stability for learned convex regularizers; evidence is inferred from the text.
- **Break condition**: If the learned regularizer violates the imposed constraints during training (e.g., becomes non-convex or non-Lipschitz), the stability guarantees no longer hold.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: Deep equilibrium models (DEQs) provide robustness to changes in the measurement operator because they implicitly share parameters across iterations and do not unroll a fixed number of steps.
- **Mechanism**: DEQs solve a fixed-point equation that depends on the forward operator; since the same set of parameters is used regardless of the number of iterations, the model can adapt to variations in 𝐴 without retraining, as long as the fixed-point equation remains solvable.
- **Core assumption**: The forward operator variations do not render the fixed-point equation unsolvable or ill-conditioned.
- **Evidence anchors**:
  - [abstract] states that "testing unrolled networks using more inference steps than used in training typically results in severe artifacts" and references DEQs as addressing this shortcoming.
  - [section] explicitly notes that "unrolled networks based on deep equilibrium models [56] are robust to changes in the measurement model."
  - [corpus] has no citations discussing DEQ robustness to measurement operator changes; this is taken directly from the paper text.
- **Break condition**: If the measurement operator changes so drastically that the fixed-point equation has no solution or multiple unstable solutions, the DEQ approach fails.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Convex analysis and Bregman distances
  - Why needed here: To understand the theoretical basis for stability in variational methods and why the Bregman distance term appears in the robustness bound.
  - Quick check question: Can you state the definition of a Bregman distance and explain why it is always non-negative for convex functions?

- **Concept**: Subgradients and optimality conditions for convex optimization
  - Why needed here: The derivation of the stability bound relies on the first-order optimality conditions and the properties of subgradients.
  - Quick check question: Given a convex function 𝑅, what is the subgradient inequality, and how does it lead to the Bregman distance formula?

- **Concept**: Deep equilibrium models and implicit layers
  - Why needed here: To grasp why DEQs are more robust to measurement operator changes compared to unrolled networks.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between an unrolled network and a DEQ in terms of parameter sharing and inference steps?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**:
  Variational reconstruction engine (Tikhonov, TV, learned regularizers) -> Learning-based modules (U-Net post-processor, Tiramisu, ItNet with proximal steps) -> Adversarial attack simulator (projected gradient ascent) -> Robustness evaluator (𝓁2 error, measurement consistency, Bregman distance) -> Exploration controller (conditional generative models, diffusion models with consistency projection)

- **Critical path**:
  1. Input: noisy measurement 𝑓
  2. Apply reconstruction algorithm (variational or learned)
  3. Generate adversarial perturbation 𝛿adv
  4. Reconstruct from 𝑓 + 𝛿adv
  5. Evaluate robustness metrics
  6. (Optional) Use exploration method to generate multiple consistent solutions

- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Convex vs non-convex regularizers: provable stability vs better expressivity for natural images
  - End-to-end learning vs model incorporation: reconstruction quality vs robustness to measurement operator changes
  - Point estimates vs stochastic sampling: single best guess vs uncertainty quantification and multiple solutions

- **Failure signatures**:
  - Large 𝓁2 error in reconstruction but small measurement consistency: adversarial attack exploiting null space
  - Large Bregman distance violation: non-convex regularizer or incorrect subgradient computation
  - DEQ divergence: measurement operator change too large for fixed-point equation to remain solvable

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Replicate the 1D toy problem: implement Tikhonov, TV, U-Net post-processing, Tiramisu, and ItNet; apply adversarial attack; compare 𝓁2 error and measurement consistency.
  2. Test robustness to measurement operator change: train a model on a given 𝐴, then evaluate on a slightly modified 𝐴; measure performance drop.
  3. Explore multiple solutions: implement a conditional generative model or diffusion model with projection; generate several reconstructions from the same measurement; evaluate diversity and consistency.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can different neural network architectures and training schemes lead to different notions of stability in image reconstruction?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the need for further research on how neural network architectures and training schemes could lead to different notions of stability, beyond the well-established Bregman distance for convex variational methods.
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides a comprehensive overview of stability and robustness issues in deep learning-based image reconstruction, it does not provide a definitive answer on how different neural network architectures and training schemes affect stability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing the stability of various neural network architectures and training schemes in image reconstruction tasks, along with theoretical analysis of the resulting stability properties.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the explorability of inverse problems be improved to generate multiple solutions that satisfy specific semantic or textural properties?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the importance of explorability in inverse problems, particularly for under-determined problems where multiple solutions exist. It discusses methods for generating multiple solutions and incorporating additional guidance criteria.
- Why unresolved: While the paper provides an overview of current approaches for exploring the solution space of inverse problems, it does not provide a comprehensive solution for improving explorability and generating diverse solutions with specific properties.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of new methods or improvements to existing techniques that can effectively explore the solution space of inverse problems and generate multiple solutions satisfying specific semantic or textural properties, along with empirical validation of their performance.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the trade-off between reconstruction quality and robustness be optimized in deep learning-based image reconstruction?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the trade-off between reconstruction quality and robustness in deep learning-based image reconstruction, noting that improved robustness often comes at the cost of reduced reconstruction quality.
- Why unresolved: While the paper acknowledges the existence of this trade-off, it does not provide a definitive solution for optimizing the balance between reconstruction quality and robustness.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of new methods or improvements to existing techniques that can effectively balance reconstruction quality and robustness in deep learning-based image reconstruction, along with empirical validation of their performance.

## Limitations
- Theoretical framework relies on convex analysis and Bregman distances, which may not extend to highly non-convex learned regularizers.
- Empirical validation is confined to a one-dimensional toy problem, limiting generalization to complex imaging tasks.
- Discussion of DEQ robustness to measurement operator changes lacks extensive experimental evidence or citations.

## Confidence
- High: Classical variational methods' stability bounds via Bregman distances (supported by established convex analysis).
- Medium: Learned regularizers' stability when constrained (plausible but lacks direct empirical or theoretical citations in the paper).
- Low: DEQ robustness to measurement operator changes (stated but not experimentally verified or cited).

## Next Checks
1. Extend the 1D toy problem to a 2D imaging task (e.g., sparse-view CT) to test if Bregman-based stability bounds hold for real-world data.
2. Implement a learned regularizer with enforced Lipschitz continuity and empirically verify its robustness against adversarial attacks and measurement operator perturbations.
3. Design a systematic ablation study varying the measurement operator in DEQs and unrolled networks to quantify the robustness gap claimed in the text.
