# Point Cloud Compression with Bits-back Coding

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.18115
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18115
- Reference count: 15
- Primary result: Achieves 1.56 bit-per-point compression ratio on average, outperforming Draco's 1.83 bit-per-point

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel lossless compression method for point cloud geometric attributes using bits-back coding with a convolutional variational autoencoder (CVAE). The approach leverages a latent variable model to capture correlations between data points, avoiding the high overhead of storing explicit marginal probability distributions. Experiments on ShapeNet and SUN RGB-D datasets demonstrate superior compression performance compared to Google's Draco library while significantly reducing codec overhead.

## Method Summary
The method combines voxelization of point clouds with a CVAE-based entropy estimation model, followed by bits-back coding using an ANS codec. Point clouds are first voxelized into 3D grids with varying bit-depths (d=5,6,7), then compressed using the CVAE to learn spatial correlations. The bits-back coding algorithm encodes data without requiring explicit storage of marginal probabilities, instead using a Gaussian prior and latent variable model. The approach achieves compression ratios of 1.56 bit-per-point on average, with the decoder size remaining under 10 MB compared to over 104 MB for sequential coding approaches.

## Key Results
- Achieves average compression ratio of 1.56 bit-per-point on ShapeNet and SUN RGB-D datasets
- Outperforms Google's Draco library (1.83 bit-per-point) while reducing decoder overhead from 104+ MB to under 10 MB
- Compression efficiency improves with larger datasets, making it practical for real-world applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Bits-back coding reduces overhead by replacing explicit marginal probability storage with a latent variable model and prior distribution.
- Mechanism: Instead of storing or communicating the marginal probability Pθ(x) for each point cloud, bits-back coding uses a Gaussian prior P(z) and latent variable model to encode and decode data. This allows compression of large batches by exploiting correlations between data samples without the need for B × M conditional probabilities.
- Core assumption: The encoder and decoder can share the same prior distribution and learned model parameters {θ, ϕ} without significant overhead.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "By using bits-back coding, we can capture the potential correlation between the data points, such as similar spatial features like shapes and scattering regions, into the lower-dimensional latent space to further reduce the compression ratio."
  - [section]: "In return, bits-back coding pays an overhead cost of inserting latent variables into the compression process. However, we provide empirical evaluations to show that this overhead cost is trivial compared to the compression gain of the bits-back coding method..."
  - [corpus]: Weak. No direct corpus evidence on bits-back coding overhead reduction in point cloud compression.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The CVAE-based entropy estimation model effectively learns spatial correlations in voxelized point cloud data, enabling efficient compression.
- Mechanism: The CVAE uses 3D convolutional layers to reduce the dimensionality of voxelized point cloud data before feeding it into fully connected layers. This architecture allows the model to learn spatial features and correlations in the data, which are then exploited during bits-back coding to achieve lower compression ratios.
- Core assumption: The CVAE can effectively learn and model the spatial correlations in voxelized point cloud data, and these correlations are sufficient to reduce the compression ratio.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "The main idea of utilizing the 3D convolutional layers is to subsequently reduce the size of the input vectors before feeding into the fully connected layers. At the same time, the use of these convolutional layers is critical to capture and learn the spatial information of the voxel data."
  - [section]: "By using bits-back coding, we can capture the potential correlation between the data points, such as similar spatial features like shapes and scattering regions, into the lower-dimensional latent space to further reduce the compression ratio."
  - [corpus]: Weak. No direct corpus evidence on the effectiveness of CVAE-based entropy estimation for point cloud compression.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Bits-back coding with ANS codec provides a practical and efficient alternative to sequential coding and Draco for point cloud compression.
- Mechanism: Bits-back coding with ANS codec achieves lower compression ratios than Draco and comparable ratios to sequential coding while significantly reducing decoder size and overhead. This is because bits-back coding does not require access to the learned entropy model Pθ(x) during decoding, unlike sequential coding.
- Core assumption: The decoder size and overhead reduction from bits-back coding outweighs any potential loss in compression efficiency compared to sequential coding.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "Experiment results show that our proposed approach can achieve a compression ratio of 1.56 bit-per-point on average, which is significantly lower than the baseline approach such as Google’s Draco with a compression ratio of 1.83 bit-per-point."
  - [section]: "With the high bit-depth value d = 7, the overhead of the decoder size of the sequential coding approach is over 104 MB, while the overhead values of the bits-back coding and Draco approaches are less than 10 MB."
  - [corpus]: Weak. No direct corpus evidence comparing bits-back coding with ANS codec to other point cloud compression methods.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
  - Why needed here: VAEs are used to estimate the Shannon entropy of point cloud data by learning a probabilistic model of the data distribution. This estimated entropy is then used for compression.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the latent space in a VAE, and how does it contribute to entropy estimation?

- Concept: Bits-back Coding
  - Why needed here: Bits-back coding is a lossless compression technique that leverages a latent variable model to encode and decode data without requiring explicit storage of marginal probabilities. This reduces overhead and improves compression efficiency.
  - Quick check question: How does bits-back coding differ from traditional arithmetic coding in terms of the information required for encoding and decoding?

- Concept: Asymmetric Numeral Systems (ANS)
  - Why needed here: ANS is used as the underlying codec for bits-back coding due to its efficiency and compatibility with the bits-back algorithm. It allows for efficient encoding and decoding of the compressed data.
  - Quick check question: What are the advantages of using ANS over arithmetic coding in the context of bits-back coding for point cloud compression?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Voxelized point cloud data -> CVAE Model (3D Conv3D -> FC -> Latent space -> FC -> ConvTran3D) -> Bits-back Coding (ANS codec) -> Compressed binary sequence

- Critical path:
  1. Voxelize point cloud data
  2. Train CVAE model on voxelized data
  3. Use trained CVAE model for bits-back coding
  4. Compress data using bits-back coding with ANS codec

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using 3D convolutional layers in CVAE vs. fully connected layers: Convolutional layers are better at capturing spatial features but may require more computational resources.
  - Bits-back coding vs. sequential coding: Bits-back coding reduces overhead but may introduce additional computational complexity.
  - Voxelization vs. other spatial processing methods: Voxelization is simple but may lose some information compared to more complex methods like Octree or KD-tree.

- Failure signatures:
  - High compression ratio: Indicates that the CVAE is not effectively learning spatial correlations or that the bits-back coding algorithm is not efficiently exploiting these correlations.
  - Large decoder size: Suggests that the CVAE model is too complex or that the bits-back coding algorithm is not effectively reducing overhead.
  - Poor reconstruction quality: May indicate that the voxelization process is losing too much information or that the CVAE model is not accurately modeling the data distribution.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare compression ratios of bits-back coding with different CVAE architectures (e.g., varying number of convolutional layers or latent space dimensions).
  2. Evaluate the impact of voxelization resolution (bit-depth) on compression efficiency and decoder size.
  3. Benchmark bits-back coding against other point cloud compression methods (e.g., Draco, sequential coding) on various datasets with different geometric patterns.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed bits-back coding approach perform when combined with advanced spatial processing techniques like Octree or KD-tree structures?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper suggests that bits-back coding could potentially be combined with tree-based spatial processing like Octree or KD-tree to achieve better compression ratios at high bit-depth values, but notes this would require complex entropy estimation models and is beyond the scope of the current work.
- Why unresolved: The paper explicitly states that implementing such a combination is not part of their main contribution and is left as a future direction, with no empirical results provided.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing compression ratios, codec overhead, and computational complexity when integrating bits-back coding with tree-based spatial processing methods like Octree or KD-tree.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of using deeper neural networks or more complex architectures in the CVAE model on the compression ratio and decoder overhead?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that while more complex entropy estimation models could potentially improve 3D spatial detail recovery, building such models is not their focus and is suggested as a future research direction.
- Why unresolved: The authors intentionally limited the CVAE complexity to focus on demonstrating bits-back coding capabilities and did not explore the trade-offs of deeper models on compression performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying CVAE depth and complexity while measuring changes in compression ratio, decoder overhead, and computational requirements.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does bits-back coding performance scale with extremely large point cloud datasets beyond 1,000 point clouds?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper evaluates performance up to 1,000 point clouds and observes decreasing compression ratios as dataset size increases, but does not explore performance beyond this scale.
- Why unresolved: The experimental evaluation was limited to 1,000 point clouds, and the paper does not provide theoretical analysis or empirical data for larger-scale scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results compressing datasets with tens of thousands to millions of point clouds, measuring compression ratio trends, decoder overhead scaling, and practical limitations.

## Limitations

- No ablation study isolating the contribution of 3D convolutional layers versus bits-back coding mechanism to compression improvement
- Voxelization process may introduce information loss that artificially inflates compression ratios
- ANS codec implementation details are omitted, making it difficult to assess whether reported results are implementation-specific

## Confidence

- Bits-back coding framework: Medium
- CVAE spatial correlation learning: Medium
- Comparative performance claims vs. Draco: Medium

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study**: Compare bits-back coding performance with and without the 3D convolutional layers in the CVAE to isolate the contribution of spatial feature learning versus the bits-back coding algorithm itself.

2. **Information preservation analysis**: Quantify the information loss introduced by voxelization at different bit-depths (d=5,6,7) and correlate this with compression ratios to determine if gains come from efficient coding or data simplification.

3. **Scalability testing**: Evaluate compression ratios and decoder size overhead across datasets of varying sizes (10K to 1M points) to verify the claim that bits-back coding becomes increasingly advantageous with larger datasets.
