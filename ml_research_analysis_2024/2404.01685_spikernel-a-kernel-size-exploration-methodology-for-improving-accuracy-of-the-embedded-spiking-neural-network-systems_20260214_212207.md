# SpiKernel: A Kernel Size Exploration Methodology for Improving Accuracy of the Embedded Spiking Neural Network Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.01685
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01685
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: Achieves 93.24% accuracy on CIFAR10, 70.84% on CIFAR100, and 62% on TinyImageNet with <10M parameters and 4.8x faster search time

## Executive Summary
SpiKernel addresses the challenge of achieving high accuracy in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) while maintaining a limited memory footprint suitable for embedded applications. The methodology explores kernel size scaling as a means to improve accuracy, systematically investigating how different kernel sizes affect performance across various datasets. By combining neural architecture search with representation capability scoring and accuracy-memory tradeoff analysis, SpiKernel achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly reduced search time and parameter count.

## Method Summary
SpiKernel proposes a four-step methodology: (1) investigate the impact of different kernel sizes on SNN accuracy, (2) devise new kernel size sets including larger kernels (5x5, 7x7) alongside traditional sizes (1x1, 3x3), (3) generate SNN architectures using neural architecture search based on the selected kernel sizes with reduced search iterations (1000x vs 5000x), and (4) analyze accuracy-memory trade-offs to select appropriate models under memory constraints. The approach uses a representation capability score based on Hamming distance to quickly evaluate network candidates without full training.

## Key Results
- Achieves 93.24% accuracy on CIFAR10 with <10M parameters
- Achieves 70.84% accuracy on CIFAR100 (vs 66.78% state-of-the-art) with <10M parameters
- Achieves 62% accuracy on TinyImageNet with <10M parameters
- Reduces search time by up to 4.8x compared to state-of-the-art methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Larger kernel sizes improve SNN accuracy by capturing more spatial information. Larger kernels (5x5, 7x7) extract more unique input features compared to smaller kernels (1x1, 3x3), particularly beneficial for datasets with many classes like CIFAR100. This additional spatial context translates into more informative features for classification.

### Mechanism 2
Reducing search iterations from 5000x to 1000x speeds up neural architecture search without sacrificing accuracy. Fewer iterations reduce computational overhead while still exploring sufficient architecture space to find high-performing models, enabled by the constrained search space from predefined kernel size sets.

### Mechanism 3
Using representation capability score (R) based on Hamming distance allows quick evaluation of network candidates without full training. The R score estimates the network's ability to distinguish samples early in the search process, avoiding expensive full training for each candidate by leveraging early-stage activity patterns.

## Foundational Learning

- **Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for SNNs**: Why needed: SpiKernel builds on existing NAS approaches but modifies them for kernel size exploration; understanding NAS is essential to grasp the methodology. Quick check: What distinguishes SNN NAS from ANN NAS in terms of evaluation metrics and constraints?

- **Kernel size impact on feature extraction**: Why needed: The core innovation involves systematically exploring different kernel sizes; understanding how kernel size affects receptive field and feature abstraction is crucial. Quick check: How does a 5x5 kernel's receptive field compare to a 3x3 kernel's, and what types of features might each capture better?

- **Accuracy-memory tradeoff analysis**: Why needed: SpiKernel's final step involves selecting models based on accuracy-memory constraints; understanding this tradeoff is essential for practical deployment. Quick check: If an application requires <10M parameters, how would you identify the optimal kernel configuration from the accuracy-memory correlation graph?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data encoding layer (feed-forward topology) -> Multiple neural cells (2 cells, each with 4 nodes and edges) -> Pre-defined operations (Zeroize, SkipCon, 1x1Conv, 3x3Conv, 5x5Conv, 7x7Conv, 3x3AvgPool) -> Classifier layer -> Representation capability score calculator (for NAS)

- **Critical path**: NAS search → R score evaluation → candidate selection → accuracy evaluation → memory footprint calculation → model selection

- **Design tradeoffs**: Larger kernels provide better accuracy but higher memory usage; more search iterations yield better exploration but slower search; wider kernel combinations enable broader exploration but exponentially larger search space; fewer training epochs speed up results but may reduce accuracy.

- **Failure signatures**: Accuracy plateaus despite larger kernels (potential overfitting); search time doesn't improve with reduced iterations (inefficient exploration); memory usage exceeds budget for all configurations (need constraint relaxation); R score poorly correlates with actual accuracy (evaluation metric failure).

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Reproduce baseline: Implement NAS with 1x1 and 3x3 kernels, 5000x iterations, compare to state-of-the-art accuracy
  2. Test kernel scaling: Implement NAS with 1x1 and 5x5 kernels, 1000x iterations, measure accuracy improvement and search time reduction
  3. Validate R score: Compare R score rankings with actual trained accuracies across multiple architectures to assess correlation quality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the choice of kernel size scaling affect the accuracy of SNNs in tasks with more than 1000 classes, such as large-scale image classification or natural language processing? The paper demonstrates effectiveness on CIFAR100 (100 classes) but does not explore tasks with more than 1000 classes.

### Open Question 2
How does the proposed methodology perform when applied to SNNs with different network architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs)? The methodology is evaluated on a specific SNN architecture, with effectiveness on other architectures uninvestigated.

### Open Question 3
How does the proposed methodology perform when applied to SNNs with different data encoding schemes, such as rate coding or temporal coding? The methodology is evaluated using a specific data encoding scheme, with performance across other encoding schemes unexplored.

## Limitations
- Critical implementation details for the NAS process, kernel size selection strategy, and memory constraint application are underspecified, creating reproducibility barriers
- The representation capability score's correlation with actual trained accuracy lacks empirical validation
- State-of-the-art comparisons focus on final accuracy without reporting training stability, variance, or hyperparameter sensitivity

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: Claims about the general problem space (accuracy-memory tradeoff in SNNs for embedded systems) and experimental results showing accuracy improvements with larger kernels
- **Medium confidence**: The proposed methodology steps are logically coherent, but specific implementation details needed for reproduction are incomplete
- **Low confidence**: Efficiency claims (4.8x speed-up, <10M parameters across all models) lack sufficient methodological detail for independent verification

## Next Checks
1. **R score correlation study**: Run NAS process with both R score evaluation and full training for the same candidate set, measuring correlation between R scores and actual trained accuracies across multiple random seeds
2. **Memory constraint analysis**: Implement accuracy-memory tradeoff analysis with varying parameter budgets (5M, 10M, 15M) to verify SpiKernel consistently finds optimal configurations within constraints
3. **Search iteration ablation**: Compare NAS results using 1000x, 2500x, and 5000x iterations to empirically measure the accuracy-efficiency tradeoff and validate the claimed 4.8x speed-up
