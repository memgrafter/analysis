# Tropical Decision Boundaries for Neural Networks Are Robust Against Adversarial Attacks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.00576
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00576
- Authors: Kurt Pasque; Christopher Teska; Ruriko Yoshida; Keiji Miura; Jefferson Huang
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Novel tropical CNN architecture achieves robustness against adversarial attacks while maintaining accuracy and efficiency

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel convolutional neural network architecture that leverages tropical geometry to achieve robustness against adversarial attacks. The key innovation is a tropical embedding layer that maps data into the tropical projective torus, resulting in well-defined decision boundaries that are inherently more resistant to gradient-based attacks. The architecture maintains computational efficiency while outperforming standard ReLU and Maxout models on benchmark datasets against various attack methods, including the powerful Carlini & Wagner attack.

## Method Summary
The authors propose a tropical convolutional neural network that replaces the final fully-connected layer with a tropical embedding layer. This layer computes tropical distances between input features and trained weight vectors, which represent Fermat-Weber points in the tropical projective torus. The resulting decision boundaries are unions of tropical hyperplanes that can be visualized as Voronoi cells. The softmin function converts these distances to class probabilities. The tropical metric's piecewise-linear structure creates decision boundaries that are more structured than standard neural network boundaries, limiting the effectiveness of gradient-based attacks.

## Key Results
- Tropical CNN outperforms standard ReLU and Maxout models against PGD, CW, and SPSA attacks on MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10 datasets
- Maintains comparable accuracy and computational efficiency to standard models while providing enhanced robustness
- Theoretical analysis shows decision boundaries are defined by tropical bisectors and can be visualized as Voronoi cells in the tropical projective torus
- Carlini & Wagner attacks are particularly ineffective against tropical CNNs due to the discrete nature of tropical distance functions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The tropical embedding layer creates decision boundaries that are inherently more resistant to gradient-based attacks due to their piecewise-linear structure. The tropical distance metric produces decision boundaries that are unions of tropical hyperplanes, which are more structured than standard ReLU decision boundaries. This structure limits the effectiveness of gradient-based attacks that rely on smooth decision surfaces.

### Mechanism 2
The CW attack is less effective against tropical CNNs because the attack formulation conflicts with the discrete nature of tropical distance functions. The Carlini & Wagner attack requires continuous differentiability, but tropical distance functions have non-differentiable points at sector boundaries. This forces the attack to get stuck in suboptimal solutions or fail to converge.

### Mechanism 3
The tropical CNN achieves robustness without sacrificing accuracy by maintaining the same computational efficiency as standard models. By placing the tropical embedding layer as the final layer, the model leverages standard convolutional feature extraction while only modifying the classification decision boundary. This allows the model to learn good feature representations while benefiting from tropical geometry properties.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Tropical geometry and max-plus algebra
  - Why needed here: The entire paper relies on understanding how tropical operations define decision boundaries and how they differ from standard neural network operations
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how the tropical metric differs from Euclidean distance and why this matters for decision boundaries?

- Concept: Fermat-Weber points and their optimization
  - Why needed here: The weights in the tropical layer are trained to represent Fermat-Weber points, which are crucial for the robustness properties
  - Quick check question: What is the optimization problem being solved when finding Fermat-Weber points, and how does this relate to the tropical distance metric?

- Concept: Adversarial attack formulations (PGD, CW, SPSA)
  - Why needed here: Understanding how different attacks work helps explain why tropical CNNs are robust to certain attacks but not others
  - Quick check question: How does the Carlini & Wagner attack formulation differ from PGD, and why might this make it less effective against tropical decision boundaries?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Base CNN layers -> Tropical embedding layer -> Softmin function
- Critical path: 1. Standard CNN processes input to produce feature vector 2. Tropical embedding layer computes distances to trained weights 3. Softmin function produces final classification probabilities
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Placement of tropical layer: Last layer preserves computational efficiency but may limit interaction with feature learning
  - Number of tropical neurons: More neurons provide finer decision boundaries but increase computation
  - Training approach: Standard vs adversarial training affects how decision boundaries are shaped
- Failure signatures:
  - High test error on clean data: Tropical layer not properly trained or too few neurons
  - Poor robustness to attacks: Tropical weights not representing Fermat-Weber points correctly
  - Slow training: Tropical layer placed too early or too many neurons
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replace final fully-connected layer with tropical embedding layer (1 neuron per class) on MNIST
  2. Visualize decision boundaries in tropical projective torus for a 3-neuron tropical layer
  3. Compare CW attack success rate on tropical vs standard models with identical base architectures

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Claims about tropical geometry creating inherently more robust decision boundaries remain largely theoretical
- Limited empirical validation beyond standard benchmark datasets
- Computational efficiency claims based on theoretical analysis rather than comprehensive benchmarking

## Confidence

**Major Uncertainties:**
The paper's claims about tropical CNNs being inherently more robust due to their geometric properties remain largely theoretical, with limited empirical validation beyond standard benchmark datasets. The mechanism by which tropical geometry creates more robust decision boundaries is described but not thoroughly proven through ablation studies or analysis of attack failure modes. The claim that CW attacks are fundamentally incompatible with tropical distance functions is speculative and lacks rigorous mathematical proof. Additionally, the computational efficiency claims are based on theoretical analysis rather than comprehensive benchmarking across different hardware platforms and network architectures.

**Confidence Labels:**
- High confidence: The basic implementation of tropical CNNs and their ability to achieve reasonable accuracy on standard datasets
- Medium confidence: Claims about improved robustness against specific attacks like PGD and CW, based on experimental results
- Low confidence: Theoretical claims about why tropical geometry inherently creates more robust decision boundaries and why CW attacks fail against them

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies removing the tropical layer at different positions in the network to quantify how placement affects both robustness and accuracy
2. Analyze gradient properties of tropical distance functions to mathematically prove or disprove claims about CW attack incompatibility
3. Benchmark computational efficiency across multiple hardware platforms and compare with other provably robust architectures like randomized smoothing
