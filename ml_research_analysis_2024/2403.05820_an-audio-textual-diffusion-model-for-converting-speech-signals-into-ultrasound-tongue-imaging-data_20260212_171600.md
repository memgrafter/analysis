# An Audio-textual Diffusion Model For Converting Speech Signals Into Ultrasound Tongue Imaging Data

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.05820
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05820
- Reference count: 0
- An audio-textual diffusion model generates high-quality ultrasound tongue imaging (UTI) data with clear tongue contours from speech signals.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of acoustic-to-articulatory inversion (AAI) by proposing an audio-textual diffusion model that converts speech signals into ultrasound tongue imaging (UTI) data. The key innovation is leveraging both personalized acoustic information from Wav2Vec 2.0 and universal tongue motion patterns from BERT-encoded text to generate UTI data with clear tongue contours. Experimental results on a Mandarin speech-ultrasound dataset demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art DNN-based AAI systems, achieving a 67.95% relative improvement in LPIPS and a 91.43% relative reduction in FID.

## Method Summary
The proposed method employs a diffusion-based generative model that takes speech audio and ASR transcriptions as inputs. Wav2Vec 2.0 encodes personalized acoustic characteristics, while BERT encodes universal tongue motion patterns from text. A diffusion module with cyclic denoising sampling strategy then generates the UTI data. The model is trained on a Mandarin speech-ultrasound dataset with 6.85 hours of data from 40 speakers, using 4 NVIDIA A6000 GPUs for 5M iterations. Evaluation metrics include LPIPS, FID, RMSE, and PSNR.

## Key Results
- 67.95% relative improvement in LPIPS compared to state-of-the-art DNN-based AAI systems
- 91.43% relative reduction in FID compared to state-of-the-art DNN-based AAI systems
- Generated UTI data exhibits clear tongue contours suitable for clinical assessment

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Diffusion-based generative models can produce high-quality UTI data with clearer tongue contours compared to deterministic DNN baselines.
- Mechanism: The diffusion model reverses a forward noising process by learning a score function that guides denoising toward higher density regions (tongue contours), and the use of cascade denoising allows for progressive refinement from coarse to fine details.
- Core assumption: Tongue contours in UTI data form higher density regions in the data distribution that the diffusion model can learn to reconstruct.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Experimental results showed that the proposed diffusion model could generate high-quality UTI data with clear tongue contour that is crucial for the linguistic analysis and clinical assessment."
  - [section] "According to the equation (2) used in the denoising process, the network optimization will pay more attention to the field related to the tongue contour in UTI data, and thus the UTI data with clearer tongue contour can be acquired."
  - [corpus] Weak: corpus neighbors discuss ultrasound segmentation and inversion but do not directly address diffusion-based generation of UTI tongue contours.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Adding text (ASR transcriptions) as an auxiliary modality improves the quality of generated UTI data compared to using audio alone.
- Mechanism: BERT-encoded word embeddings capture universal tongue motion patterns common across speakers, and cross-attention fusion with Wav2Vec2 acoustic embeddings allows the model to condition generation on both personalized acoustic details and universal motion patterns, reducing the need for large parallel training data.
- Core assumption: Tongue motions for the same consecutive pronunciations share universal patterns that can be encoded from text, while speech encodes personalized details.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the ASR transcriptions related to the universality of tongue motions are encoded by using BERT"
  - [section] "In this study, the inherent acoustic characteristics of individuals related to the tongue motion details are encoded by using wav2vec2.0, while the ASR transcriptions related to the universality of tongue motions are encoded by using BERT."
  - [corpus] Missing: corpus does not provide direct evidence for multimodal audio-textual fusion improving UTI generation quality.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The cyclic denoising sampling strategy in the diffusion module captures long-term dependencies between consecutive pronunciations and UTI data, producing coherent sequences.
- Mechanism: Instead of fixed step denoising, the cyclic strategy adjusts noise levels dynamically and iterates sampling in a cascade model where each stage refines the output of the previous one, enabling coherent temporal structure in the generated UTI sequence.
- Core assumption: Long-term temporal dependencies in speech-UTI pairs can be captured by adaptive denoising sampling rather than fixed step denoising.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "In this module, the long-term dependencies between consecutive pronunciations and UTI data are captured by using cyclic denoising sampling strategy."
  - [section] "The sampling begins with a noise sample x0, and the noise level is given by σ (ti) = ti... we calculate the variable factorγi... and calculate the slightly increased noise level ˆti... Then, this sample is applied in the denoising model..."
  - [corpus] Weak: corpus neighbors do not discuss diffusion sampling strategies or temporal coherence in UTI generation.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Diffusion probabilistic models (forward noising + reverse denoising via score function estimation).
  - Why needed here: Core mechanism by which the model generates realistic UTI data from noise.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the score function ∇x log p(x; σ) in the denoising process?

- Concept: Multimodal representation fusion via cross-attention.
  - Why needed here: Enables integration of acoustic embeddings (personalized) with textual embeddings (universal) to condition UTI generation.
  - Quick check question: How does cross-attention differ from simple concatenation when fusing modalities?

- Concept: Ultrasound tongue imaging (UTI) data characteristics and tongue contour extraction.
  - Why needed here: Understanding what constitutes high-quality UTI data and why clear tongue contours matter for clinical and linguistic analysis.
  - Quick check question: Why are tongue contours in UTI data considered the most important part for displaying tongue motor function?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Wav2Vec2.0 (acoustic encoder) → BERT (textual encoder) → Cross-attention fusion → Diffusion denoising module (Unet-based with temporal attention) → UTI data output
- Critical path: Audio/text → Acoustic/Text embeddings → Fusion → Diffusion denoising → Final UTI
- Design tradeoffs: Using large pretrained encoders (Wav2Vec2.0, BERT) improves representation quality but increases computational cost; diffusion models are slower than deterministic DNNs but produce higher quality, more coherent outputs
- Failure signatures: Blurry or distorted tongue contours suggest diffusion denoising issues; lack of temporal coherence suggests cyclic sampling not effective; poor performance with text modality suggests fusion or text encoding issues
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train audio-only diffusion AAI baseline and compare LPIPS/FID to DNN baseline
  2. Add textual inputs and compare quality metrics; ablate BERT vs. no text to confirm benefit
  3. Vary UTI output resolution (64x64, 96x96, 112x112) and assess trade-off between quality and resolution

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the quality of UTI data generated by the proposed audio-textual diffusion model compare to real UTI data in terms of linguistic analysis and clinical assessment tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that the generated UTI data exhibits clear tongue contours, making it suitable for clinical assessment tasks, but does not provide specific evidence or comparisons to real UTI data in these contexts.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates the model's ability to generate high-quality UTI data with clear tongue contours, but it does not directly compare the generated data to real UTI data in practical applications like linguistic analysis or clinical assessment.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments where the generated UTI data is used in actual linguistic analysis and clinical assessment tasks, comparing the results to those obtained using real UTI data, would provide evidence of the model's practical utility and effectiveness.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of the proposed audio-textual diffusion model on the interpretability of the generated UTI data for linguistic analysis?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the generated UTI data with clear tongue contours is crucial for linguistic analysis and clinical assessment, implying that the model's output is interpretable and useful for these purposes. However, it does not explicitly address the interpretability aspect.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates the model's ability to generate high-quality UTI data, it does not explore how well the generated data can be interpreted and utilized for linguistic analysis, which is an important aspect of its practical application.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting studies where linguists analyze the generated UTI data to extract linguistic features and compare their findings to those obtained using real UTI data would provide insights into the model's interpretability and its impact on linguistic analysis.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed audio-textual diffusion model perform on speech-ultrasound datasets from different languages or with different characteristics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper evaluates the model on a Mandarin speech-ultrasound dataset, but it does not explore its performance on datasets from other languages or with different characteristics.
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates the model's effectiveness on a specific dataset, but its generalizability to other languages or datasets with different characteristics remains unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments on speech-ultrasound datasets from different languages or with varying characteristics, such as different phonetic inventories or recording conditions, would provide insights into the model's generalizability and robustness.

## Limitations
- The dataset is limited to Mandarin speech with 40 speakers, potentially limiting generalization to other languages or speaker populations
- The computational cost is substantial, requiring 4 NVIDIA A6000 GPUs for training, which may limit practical deployment
- No direct evaluation of whether generated tongue contours are anatomically accurate or useful for clinical diagnosis beyond qualitative assessment

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The diffusion model architecture and training procedure are clearly described, and the quality metrics show significant improvements over baselines
- **Medium Confidence**: The claims about improved tongue contour clarity are supported by visual examples and quality metrics, but lack direct clinical validation
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability of results to languages other than Mandarin and the clinical utility of generated UTI data remain unverified

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a study with speech-language pathologists to evaluate whether the generated UTI data with clearer tongue contours improves diagnostic accuracy compared to traditional AAI methods or ground truth UTI
2. Train and evaluate the model on a non-Mandarin dataset (e.g., English or French) to verify if the audio-textual diffusion approach generalizes across languages
3. Compare the generated tongue contours against ground truth ultrasound data using anatomical landmarks or tongue contour extraction algorithms to quantify how closely the generated contours match real tongue movements
