# Machine learning in business process management: A systematic literature review

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2405.16396
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16396
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: First comprehensive systematic literature review of ML applications in BPM (200 papers, 1998-2022) identifying patterns, gaps, and future directions

## Executive Summary
This paper presents the first comprehensive systematic literature review examining machine learning applications across all six phases of the business process management lifecycle. The review analyzes 200 papers published between 1998 and 2022, revealing that ML applications predominantly focus on event-data-intensive phases (process discovery, analysis, and monitoring) while using deep learning as the dominant ML concept. The study provides a structured knowledge base through an interactive concept matrix that classifies applications by BPM phase, ML paradigm, concept, and algorithm group.

The review identifies ten key findings and proposes ten future research directions, addressing critical gaps in current ML-BPM integration. These include exploring new data sources beyond event logs, integrating domain knowledge into ML models, and developing human-centric assessment metrics. The authors provide an interactive coding table that enables researchers and practitioners to filter and explore specific combinations of BPM phases and ML applications, supporting evidence-based development of ML applications for BPM tasks.

## Method Summary
The systematic literature review employed a structured search across three major databases (Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and Web of Science) using combined BPM and ML keywords. From an initial pool of 7,406 papers, the authors conducted title and abstract screening, followed by quality screening using specific criteria including citation count thresholds and relevance assessment. Three independent coders reviewed the remaining papers, coding them according to a BPM lifecycle framework and ML model development framework. The review covered papers published between 1998 and 2022, with inter-coder reliability analysis using Krippendorff's α and Fleiss' κ to ensure coding consistency.

## Key Results
- ML applications predominantly address event-data-intensive BPM phases: process discovery, analysis, and monitoring
- Deep learning emerges as the dominant ML concept across all BPM lifecycle phases
- Event logs remain the primary data source, with limited integration of unstructured data (text, video, image) and domain knowledge
- Interactive concept matrix provides filterable access to 200+ ML-BPM applications across lifecycle phases

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The systematic review methodology ensures comprehensive coverage by using structured search across multiple databases, quality screening criteria, and three-coder review with reconciliation. This approach minimizes selection bias and provides reliable classification of ML applications across BPM lifecycle phases. The interactive concept matrix enables pattern identification and gap analysis by allowing users to filter results by specific BPM phases, ML paradigms, and application types.

## Foundational Learning
- **BPM Lifecycle Framework**: Six-phase model (design, implementation, execution, monitoring, analysis, optimization) - needed to systematically classify ML applications; quick check: can you map any ML-BPM paper to its relevant lifecycle phase(s)
- **ML Model Development Framework**: Data source identification, ML paradigm selection, concept classification - needed to understand how ML integrates with BPM tasks; quick check: identify the three main data sources used in ML-BPM applications
- **Systematic Review Methodology**: Structured search, quality screening, inter-coder reliability - needed to ensure comprehensive and unbiased literature coverage; quick check: can you explain the three databases used in the search
- **Concept Matrix Construction**: Filterable classification system for ML-BPM applications - needed to enable targeted exploration of research gaps; quick check: can you describe how to filter for deep learning applications in process monitoring
- **Quality Screening Criteria**: Citation thresholds, relevance assessment - needed to ensure only high-quality papers are included; quick check: what's the minimum citation count criterion mentioned
- **Inter-coder Reliability Analysis**: Krippendorff's α and Fleiss' κ metrics - needed to validate coding consistency across reviewers; quick check: can you name the two reliability metrics used

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Literature Search (Scopus/IEEE/WoS) -> Title/Abstract Screening -> Quality Screening (Q1-Q4) -> Full-Text Review (3 coders) -> Coding (BPM phase, ML paradigm, concept) -> Reconciliation -> Interactive Concept Matrix

**Critical Path**: Search -> Quality Screening -> Coding -> Reconciliation -> Matrix Construction

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Comprehensive coverage vs. manageability (200 papers from 7,406 initial results)
- Standardized coding vs. nuanced interpretation (3-coder approach with reconciliation)
- Interactive accessibility vs. complexity (filterable matrix with multiple dimensions)

**Failure Signatures**:
- Missing relevant papers due to keyword selection or database coverage
- Inconsistent coding across reviewers despite reconciliation process
- Quality screening criteria that may exclude relevant but less-cited work

**First Experiments**:
1. Search for "machine learning" AND "business process" papers in one database to validate keyword effectiveness
2. Apply quality screening criteria to a sample of 10 excluded papers to assess threshold appropriateness
3. Test interactive concept matrix filtering by selecting "deep learning" AND "process discovery" to verify functionality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided material

## Limitations
- Focus on English-language papers may omit relevant non-English research
- Exclusion of grey literature potentially misses practical implementations and industry applications
- Quality screening criteria (Q4) remains partially unspecified, creating uncertainty about inclusion thresholds

## Confidence
**High confidence**: Comprehensive coverage through systematic search across three major databases and three-coder review methodology
**Medium confidence**: Dominance of deep learning and event-log-based approaches, influenced by publication bias toward computationally intensive methods
**Medium confidence**: Identified research gaps and future directions reflect authors' perspectives based on selected corpus rather than objective field gaps

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the search with expanded keyword variations to verify coverage completeness
2. Apply the exact quality screening criteria to a sample of excluded papers to assess potential bias
3. Conduct temporal analysis to validate whether identified trends reflect genuine field evolution or publication patterns
