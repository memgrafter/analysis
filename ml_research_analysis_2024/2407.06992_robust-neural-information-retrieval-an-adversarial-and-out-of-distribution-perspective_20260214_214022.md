# Robust Neural Information Retrieval: An Adversarial and Out-of-distribution Perspective

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.06992
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06992
- Reference count: 40
- This paper presents the first comprehensive survey on the robustness of neural information retrieval (IR) models, focusing on adversarial and out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness.

## Executive Summary
This survey provides the first comprehensive overview of robustness in neural information retrieval (IR) systems, focusing on adversarial and out-of-distribution challenges. The authors categorize robustness into three types: performance variance under IID data, adversarial robustness against attacks, and OOD robustness for unseen queries and documents. The survey covers two key components of neural IR pipelines: dense retrieval models (DRMs) and neural ranking models (NRMs). It provides an in-depth discussion of existing methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics, and introduces a new benchmark called BestIR for robust neural IR. The paper also highlights challenges and future directions, particularly in the era of large language models (LLMs).

## Method Summary
The survey systematically categorizes and analyzes robustness in neural IR systems by examining two primary pipeline components: dense retrieval models and neural ranking models. The authors define robustness in IR as the consistent performance and resilience of top-K results when faced with unexpected scenarios. They survey existing methods for improving robustness, evaluate available datasets and metrics, and introduce a new benchmark called BestIR. The survey also discusses challenges and future directions for robust neural IR in the context of emerging large language models.

## Key Results
- The paper presents the first comprehensive survey on neural IR robustness, categorizing it into three types: performance variance, adversarial robustness, and OOD robustness
- Introduces a new benchmark called BestIR for evaluating robust neural IR systems
- Highlights challenges and future directions, particularly regarding large language models in neural IR

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The survey's framework for understanding neural IR robustness is built on three fundamental principles: (1) the separation of robustness concerns into distinct categories allows for targeted interventions, (2) the focus on both dense retrieval and ranking components addresses the full pipeline, and (3) the introduction of systematic evaluation through the BestIR benchmark enables reproducible assessment of robustness improvements.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Dense Retrieval Models (DRMs)**: Neural models that encode queries and documents into dense vector representations for efficient similarity matching. Why needed: Form the first stage of modern neural IR pipelines for candidate generation. Quick check: Verify the model can retrieve relevant documents for standard queries.

2. **Neural Ranking Models (NRMs)**: Models that score the relevance between query-document pairs. Why needed: Refine the results from DRMs and provide final ranking scores. Quick check: Ensure the model can distinguish between relevant and non-relevant document pairs.

3. **Adversarial Attacks in IR**: Manipulations of queries or documents to deceive neural IR models. Why needed: Understanding attack vectors is crucial for developing robust defenses. Quick check: Test model performance degradation under known attack patterns.

4. **Out-of-distribution (OOD) Data**: Data that differs significantly from the training distribution. Why needed: Real-world IR systems must handle diverse and evolving query patterns. Quick check: Evaluate model performance on queries from different domains or time periods.

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: Input Queries -> Dense Retrieval Models -> Neural Ranking Models -> Output Rankings

Critical path: The most critical path is Input Queries → Dense Retrieval Models → Neural Ranking Models → Output Rankings, as errors in early stages cascade through the pipeline.

Design tradeoffs: The main tradeoffs involve balancing retrieval accuracy with robustness, computational efficiency with model complexity, and generalization ability with domain specificity.

Failure signatures: Common failure patterns include: (1) performance degradation on OOD queries, (2) vulnerability to adversarial document manipulations, and (3) inconsistent top-K results under minor input variations.

First experiments: 1) Evaluate baseline model performance on standard IR benchmarks, 2) Test model robustness against simple adversarial attacks, 3) Assess performance on out-of-distribution query sets.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can large language models be effectively integrated into robust neural IR systems?
- What are the most effective ways to benchmark and evaluate OOD robustness in neural IR?
- How can we develop universal defenses that work across different types of attacks and OOD scenarios?

## Limitations
- The survey's scope is limited to dense retrieval models and neural ranking models, potentially missing robustness considerations in other IR components
- The survey appears to focus on academic research without addressing practical deployment challenges
- The relationship between robustness in neural IR and broader IR robustness literature is not extensively explored

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Categorization of robustness types (performance variance, adversarial robustness, and OOD robustness) | High |
| "First comprehensive survey" on neural IR robustness | Medium |
| Effectiveness of the new BestIR benchmark | Low |

## Next Checks
1. Verify the uniqueness claim by conducting a comprehensive literature search for other surveys on neural IR robustness
2. Evaluate the BestIR benchmark on multiple neural IR models to assess its effectiveness in measuring robustness
3. Extend the survey to include robustness considerations in non-neural IR components and compare findings with the neural IR-specific results presented
