# Adversarial Attacks for Drift Detection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.16591
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16591
- Authors: Fabian Hinder; Valerie Vaquet; Barbara Hammer
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: This work investigates how commonly used drift detection methods can be fooled by adversarial attacks, where concept drift is hidden from detection.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a theoretical framework for understanding adversarial attacks on drift detection systems. The authors analyze two attack scenarios: metric adversarials, which exploit weaknesses in the statistical metrics used for detection, and window adversarials, which manipulate the data selection process. They provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of window adversarials and present algorithms to construct such attacks. The theoretical findings are validated through experiments on synthetic data and real-world water distribution networks, showing that many standard drift detectors are vulnerable to these attacks.

## Method Summary
The paper investigates adversarial attacks on drift detection by modeling concept drift using distribution processes. The authors construct adversarial streams that exhibit drift but remain undetected by exploiting weaknesses in statistical metrics and windowing schemes. They provide algorithms for constructing these adversarials and test them using permutation MMD tests with 2,500 permutations. Experiments are conducted on synthetic two-squares datasets and real-world water distribution network pressure measurements.

## Key Results
- Provides necessary and sufficient conditions for window adversarials existence
- Demonstrates vulnerability of standard drift detectors to both metric and window adversarials
- Shows near-perfect alignment between theoretical predictions and empirical results across 500 independent runs
- Validates approach on both synthetic data and real-world water distribution networks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Drift adversarials exploit weaknesses in the statistical metrics used for detection by constructing distributions that appear identical under the metric despite having different underlying distributions.
- Mechanism: The construction exploits the fact that most drift detectors compare data from two windows using some statistical tool (commonly a metric). By creating distributions that are indistinguishable by the metric but actually different, drift can occur without triggering detection.
- Core assumption: The metric used for comparison is not a true metric or has weaknesses that can be exploited.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We show how to construct data streams that are drifting without being detected. We refer to those as drift adversarials."
  - [section 3.1]: "The most commonly used drift detectors are based on learning models referring to the optimal model or model accuracy to detect drift... this approach is flawed and can be exploited in many cases."
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus neighbors discuss concept drift detection but don't specifically address metric-based vulnerabilities.
- Break condition: When the metric used is a true metric (satisfying all metric properties), it becomes impossible to construct such adversarials.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Window adversarials manipulate the data selection process by exploiting the specific windowing schemes used in drift detection.
- Mechanism: The construction leverages the fact that drift detectors typically process data on sliding windows. By manipulating which data points fall into which windows through controlled distribution processes, drift can be hidden from detection.
- Core assumption: The windowing scheme has inherent vulnerabilities that can be mathematically characterized and exploited.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of window adversarials and present algorithms to construct such attacks."
  - [section 3.2]: "As most drift detectors work by comparing data from two windows... we will focus on this setup."
  - [section 3.2]: Provides detailed mathematical characterization of window adversarials for different windowing schemes.
- Break condition: When the drift detector combines multiple windowing schemes or uses provably correct detection methods that eliminate all possible adversarials.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The theoretical framework provides necessary and sufficient conditions for when drift detectors can be fooled, allowing for verification of detector robustness.
- Mechanism: By characterizing the improper adversarial functions (Adv0(A)) that describe all distribution processes with undetected drift, one can determine whether a specific drift detector is provably correct or vulnerable.
- Core assumption: The characterization of improper adversarial functions is mathematically sound and complete.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We give necessary and sufficient conditions for their existence, provide methods for their construction, and demonstrate this behavior in experiments."
  - [section 3.2]: "Define the improper adversarial functions for A... Then, Adv(A) describes all distribution processes with drift that is not detected by A."
  - [section 4]: "We performed 500 independent runs for each setup. The results are reported in Table 2. As can be seen, there is a (nearly) perfect alignment of our theoretical predictions and the empirical results."
- Break condition: When the theoretical model doesn't capture real-world complexities like sampling errors, noise, or computational limitations.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Distribution processes and concept drift
  - Why needed here: The paper models concept drift using distribution processes to provide a theoretical foundation for analyzing drift detection vulnerabilities.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between sample-wise drift definition and the distribution process definition used in this paper?

- Concept: Kernel methods and probability metrics
  - Why needed here: The paper uses kernel-based probability metrics (like MMD) commonly used in drift detection, and the adversarial construction relies on understanding these metrics.
  - Quick check question: How does the biased MMD statistic relate to the kernel matrix K in the finite case analysis?

- Concept: Sliding window mechanisms and their mathematical properties
  - Why needed here: The core vulnerability exploited by window adversarials depends on the specific mathematical properties of different sliding window schemes.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference in adversarial function requirements between fixed reference windows versus sliding windows?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Data stream -> Window selection logic -> Statistical test module -> Threshold decision logic

- Critical path:
  1. Data stream arrives and is partitioned into windows
  2. Window pairs are selected according to the detection scheme
  3. Statistical test computes similarity metric between windows
  4. Decision threshold determines if drift is detected

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Sensitivity vs. robustness: More sensitive detectors may be more vulnerable to adversarials
  - Window size vs. detection speed: Smaller windows may be more vulnerable but detect faster
  - Single vs. multiple metrics: Using multiple metrics may eliminate adversarials but increase computational cost

- Failure signatures:
  - Unexpected false negatives in drift detection
  - Patterns in detected drift that follow window boundaries
  - Consistent failure to detect drift in periodic data streams

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement the synthetic two-squares dataset experiment to verify theoretical predictions
  2. Test the water distribution network scenario to validate practical applications
  3. Construct adversarials for a specific drift detector to demonstrate vulnerability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can adversarial attacks be constructed for drift detection methods that use more complex metrics beyond simple distance measures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that metric adversarials can be constructed for methods like the windowing Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and methods using deep embeddings.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses primarily on window adversarials and provides a general framework, but doesn't exhaustively explore all possible metric-based attacks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies demonstrating successful adversarial attacks on a wide range of drift detection methods using various metrics, including deep learning-based approaches.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do boundary effects impact the robustness of drift detectors in real-world scenarios with finite data streams?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses boundary effects in the context of finite samples and provides examples in Table 1, but doesn't thoroughly investigate their practical implications.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides theoretical insights into boundary effects but lacks empirical validation of their impact on detection performance in real-world settings.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extensive experiments on real-world data streams showing how boundary effects influence the detection accuracy of different drift detectors under various conditions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can drift detectors be designed to be provably robust against all possible adversarial attacks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests that combining multiple drift detectors can potentially make them more robust, as Adv((A, B)) ⊆ Adv(A) ∩ Adv(B).
- Why unresolved: The paper proposes a theoretical approach but doesn't provide a concrete algorithm or empirical evidence for constructing such robust detectors.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of a drift detection method that combines multiple detectors and demonstrates resistance to a wide range of adversarial attacks in practical scenarios.

## Limitations
- The experimental validation, while thorough for synthetic data, is less comprehensive for real-world scenarios
- The paper doesn't address computational complexity of constructing adversarials in practice
- The theoretical model may not fully capture real-world data streams with noise and sampling errors

## Next Checks

1. Implement a multi-metric drift detector combining MMD with Wasserstein distance to test whether this eliminates the vulnerabilities demonstrated in the paper.
2. Add noise to the synthetic datasets and measure how it affects the success rate of adversarial attacks, particularly for window adversarials.
3. Implement a computationally efficient algorithm for constructing adversarials that scales to larger datasets and compare its performance against the theoretical construction.
