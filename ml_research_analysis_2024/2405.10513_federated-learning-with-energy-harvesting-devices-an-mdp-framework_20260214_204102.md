# Federated Learning With Energy Harvesting Devices: An MDP Framework

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.10513
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10513
- Reference count: 39
- Primary result: Joint device scheduling and power control for FL with energy harvesting using MDP framework

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of battery depletion in edge devices participating in federated learning by incorporating energy harvesting techniques. The authors establish convergence bounds for wireless federated learning systems where device participation and packet drops are influenced by energy availability. They formulate the joint device scheduling and power control problem as a Markov decision process, deriving optimal transmission policies with monotone structure properties. To address computational complexity, a low-complexity algorithm is proposed that remains asymptotically optimal as device count increases. The work also develops a structure-enhanced deep reinforcement learning approach for scenarios with unknown channel and energy statistics.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a Markov decision process framework to optimize device scheduling and power control in federated learning systems with energy harvesting. They establish convergence bounds showing how energy supply affects learning performance through partial device participation and packet drops. The MDP formulation captures the trade-off between energy consumption and learning convergence rate. A low-complexity algorithm is designed to overcome the curse of dimensionality, with theoretical guarantees of asymptotic optimality. For unknown environments, a deep reinforcement learning approach leverages the identified monotone structure of optimal policies to improve training efficiency.

## Key Results
- Established convergence bounds demonstrating dependence on energy supply through device participation and packet drops
- Derived optimal transmission policy with monotone structure properties in battery and channel states
- Proposed low-complexity algorithm asymptotically optimal as number of devices increases
- Validated effectiveness through extensive experiments on real-world datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The MDP framework works by modeling the sequential decision-making process of device scheduling and power allocation as a stochastic optimization problem. The optimal policy leverages the monotone structure - as battery state increases or channel quality improves, the optimal action (transmit or not) follows a predictable pattern. This structure enables both analytical solutions and efficient learning algorithms. The energy harvesting integration ensures sustainable device operation, preventing premature dropout that would degrade convergence. The structure-enhanced deep reinforcement learning exploits this monotonicity to guide exploration and accelerate convergence in unknown environments.

## Foundational Learning

**Markov Decision Process (MDP)**: Framework for modeling sequential decision problems under uncertainty. Needed to capture the stochastic nature of energy harvesting and wireless channels. Quick check: Verify state transition probabilities and reward structure accurately reflect system dynamics.

**Convergence Analysis**: Mathematical tools to bound learning error over time. Essential for quantifying the impact of energy harvesting on FL performance. Quick check: Confirm tightness of derived bounds through empirical validation.

**Asymptotic Optimality**: Property where algorithm performance approaches optimal as problem size grows. Required to justify low-complexity approach. Quick check: Test algorithm performance across varying device counts.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map**: Energy harvesting devices -> Battery states -> Channel states -> MDP decision maker -> Device scheduling & power control -> Federated learning aggregation

**Critical path**: Energy harvesting → Battery monitoring → Channel sensing → MDP policy evaluation → Transmission decision → Model update aggregation

**Design tradeoffs**: Low-complexity algorithm (speed) vs. exact MDP solution (optimality); exploration in RL (learning quality) vs. exploitation (immediate performance)

**Failure signatures**: Rapid battery depletion, high packet drop rate, suboptimal convergence speed, unstable training in unknown environments

**First experiments**:
1. Validate convergence bounds under varying energy harvesting rates
2. Compare low-complexity algorithm against brute-force MDP solution
3. Test structure-enhanced DRL performance with gradually increasing environmental uncertainty

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

## Limitations
- Theoretical analysis assumes specific channel and energy harvesting models that may not capture real-world variability
- MDP approach requires accurate state estimation and may struggle in highly dynamic environments
- Claim of asymptotic optimality needs validation across diverse deployment scenarios
- Does not address security considerations in energy harvesting scenarios

- Convergence analysis: **Medium**
- Algorithm optimality claims: **Medium**
- Deep reinforcement learning approach: **Low-Medium**

## Next Checks
1. Test algorithm performance under realistic energy harvesting patterns and channel conditions beyond assumed models
2. Evaluate algorithm robustness to device failures and network topology changes
3. Assess computational overhead of structure-enhanced deep reinforcement learning on resource-constrained edge devices
