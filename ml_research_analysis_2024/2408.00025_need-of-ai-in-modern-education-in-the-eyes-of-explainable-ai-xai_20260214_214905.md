# Need of AI in Modern Education: in the Eyes of Explainable AI (xAI)

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.00025
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00025
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: The study explores the application of Explainable AI (xAI) in modern education, focusing on the influence of parental income on educational opportunities

## Executive Summary
This study examines the role of Explainable AI (xAI) in modern education by analyzing how parental income influences educational opportunities. The research employs advanced xAI techniques, including LIME, SHAP, and FairML, to investigate predictive models using the Adult Census Income dataset. The findings reveal significant biases in AI models, particularly concerning sensitive features such as race, nationality, and gender, which can impact educational access. The study emphasizes the critical need to address these biases to ensure fairness and transparency in AI-driven educational policies.

## Method Summary
The study utilizes advanced xAI techniques, including LIME, SHAP, and FairML, to analyze predictive models using the Adult Census Income dataset. These methods are employed to uncover biases in AI models related to sensitive features such as race, nationality, and gender, which can impact educational access. The research focuses on the influence of parental income on educational opportunities, highlighting the importance of addressing biases to ensure fairness and transparency in AI-driven educational policies.

## Key Results
- The study reveals significant biases in AI models, particularly in relation to sensitive features such as race, nationality, and gender.
- Advanced xAI techniques, including LIME, SHAP, and FairML, are employed to analyze predictive models using the Adult Census Income dataset.
- The findings emphasize the importance of addressing biases to ensure fairness and transparency in AI-driven educational policies.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study leverages Explainable AI (xAI) techniques to uncover biases in predictive models that influence educational opportunities. By using methods such as LIME, SHAP, and FairML, the research identifies how sensitive features like race, nationality, and gender can impact educational access. This approach allows for a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms that drive educational inequalities, enabling the development of fairer AI-driven policies.

## Foundational Learning
- Explainable AI (xAI): Techniques that make AI models interpretable, allowing stakeholders to understand how decisions are made. *Why needed*: To ensure transparency and fairness in AI-driven educational policies. *Quick check*: Can the model's decision-making process be explained to a non-technical audience?
- LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations): A method that explains individual predictions by approximating the model locally. *Why needed*: To provide insights into specific decisions made by complex models. *Quick check*: Does LIME accurately reflect the model's behavior for individual cases?
- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations): A unified measure of feature importance based on game theory. *Why needed*: To quantify the contribution of each feature to the model's predictions. *Quick check*: Are the SHAP values consistent with the model's overall behavior?
- FairML: A framework for detecting and mitigating bias in machine learning models. *Why needed*: To ensure that AI models do not perpetuate or exacerbate existing inequalities. *Quick check*: Does FairML effectively identify and address biases in the model?

## Architecture Onboarding
The study employs a component map where data preprocessing feeds into model training, which is then analyzed using xAI techniques. The critical path involves data collection, model training, bias detection, and policy recommendations. Design tradeoffs include balancing model accuracy with interpretability and fairness. Failure signatures include undetected biases and overfitting to the training data. The first three experiments involve replicating the analysis with different datasets, validating the fairness metrics with domain experts, and testing the models across different cultural contexts.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The study's reliance on the Adult Census Income dataset may not fully capture the complexities of modern educational systems.
- The connection between detected model biases and actual educational access barriers remains somewhat theoretical.
- The narrow focus on parental income as the primary factor influencing educational opportunities may overlook other significant variables.

## Confidence
- Model bias detection: Medium
- Educational policy implications: Low
- Fairness assessment methodology: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Replicate the analysis using a more education-specific dataset, such as the National Center for Education Statistics' longitudinal studies, to validate whether the same biases persist in education-focused data.
2. Conduct expert review with educational policy specialists to assess whether the identified biases align with known educational access barriers and whether the proposed interventions are practically feasible.
3. Perform cross-cultural validation by testing the models on international educational datasets to determine whether the observed biases are universal or context-specific.
