# How green is continual learning, really? Analyzing the energy consumption in continual training of vision foundation models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.18664
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18664
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Representation-based continual learning methods like RanPAC achieve the best energy-accuracy trade-offs with minimal inference overhead

## Executive Summary
This paper systematically evaluates the energy consumption of continual learning (CL) approaches applied to vision foundation models, addressing a gap in understanding their environmental sustainability. The authors compare energy efficiency during training and inference across representation-, prompt-, and exemplar-based CL algorithms, as well as fine-tuning and joint training baselines, using a pre-trained ViT-B/16 backbone. They propose the Energy NetScore metric to measure energy-accuracy trade-offs and conduct extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, and DomainNet. Results show that representation-based methods like RanPAC achieve the best balance of energy efficiency and accuracy, with minimal inference overhead, while exemplar-based methods suffer from quadratic energy growth and prompt-based methods incur double inference costs. The study highlights that energy consumption during inference is critical for evaluating the sustainability of CL methods, with RanPAC emerging as the most efficient overall solution.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates continual learning methods on vision foundation models using a pre-trained ViT-B/16 backbone. Experiments are conducted across three datasets (CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, and DomainNet) with sequential task learning, 20 epochs per task, and batch size 64. The authors implement or utilize existing CL methods including iCaRL, MEMO, L2P, DualPrompt, CODA-Prompt, SimpleCIL, EASE, and RanPAC through the PILOT framework. Energy consumption is measured using CodeCarbon, tracking both training and inference phases. The Energy NetScore (Ωk) metric is introduced to capture the trade-off between accuracy and energy consumption, with α=2 and β=0.125 as weighting parameters. Results are analyzed across incremental steps to compare training energy, inference energy, and overall efficiency trade-offs.

## Key Results
- Representation-based methods like RanPAC achieve the best energy-accuracy trade-offs with minimal inference overhead
- Exemplar-based methods exhibit quadratic energy growth as task sequences increase
- Prompt-based methods incur approximately double the inference energy compared to baseline methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The study demonstrates that continual learning approaches have fundamentally different energy consumption profiles based on their underlying mechanisms. Representation-based methods like RanPAC maintain a frozen backbone while updating a small task-specific head, resulting in minimal inference overhead. Exemplar-based methods store data samples from previous tasks, leading to increased memory access and quadratic energy growth with task sequence length. Prompt-based methods add task-specific tokens to the input, effectively doubling the inference computation. The Energy NetScore metric captures these trade-offs by weighting accuracy gains against energy consumption, with higher values indicating better efficiency. The findings suggest that for practical deployment, the inference energy overhead is often more significant than training energy, making methods with lower inference costs more sustainable overall.

## Foundational Learning
- Continual learning: Learning from data streams without catastrophic forgetting - needed to understand the problem space and why traditional training fails; quick check: Can the model maintain performance on previous tasks while learning new ones?
- Energy measurement in ML: Quantifying computational resources using metrics like kWh and CodeCarbon - needed to establish baseline for environmental impact assessment; quick check: Are energy measurements consistent across different hardware configurations?
- ViT architecture: Vision Transformer with patch-based input processing - needed to understand the computational model being evaluated; quick check: Does the model use standard patch size and embedding dimensions?
- Prompt-based learning: Adding task-specific tokens to input sequences - needed to understand the overhead introduced by certain CL methods; quick check: How many additional tokens are added per task?
- Energy NetScore: Composite metric balancing accuracy and energy consumption - needed to provide a single evaluation criterion for sustainability; quick check: Does the metric properly weight accuracy gains against energy costs?

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: ViT-B/16 backbone -> CL method head updates -> Energy measurement (CodeCarbon) -> Accuracy tracking -> Energy NetScore calculation

Critical path: Data loading → Model inference → Energy measurement → Accuracy computation → NetScore aggregation

Design tradeoffs: Fixed hyperparameters vs. method-specific optimization, energy measurement overhead vs. accuracy tracking precision, sequential task order vs. random task presentation

Failure signatures: Inconsistent energy measurements due to background processes, accuracy degradation from improper CL implementation, incorrect NetScore calculations from parameter mismatches

First experiments:
1. Baseline energy consumption measurement for ViT-B/16 on CIFAR-100 without continual learning
2. Single-task continual learning implementation validation with energy tracking
3. NetScore calculation verification on a simple two-task sequence

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**
- Question: Does the Energy NetScore metric generalize across different neural architectures beyond ViT-B/16, or is it specific to vision transformer models?
- Basis in paper: The authors introduce the Energy NetScore metric and apply it to vision foundation models, but note it's "quite general and can be used to evaluate the trade-off between performance and consumption in any scenario"
- Why unresolved: The paper only validates the metric on ViT-based continual learning approaches. The authors acknowledge its general applicability but don't demonstrate this across different architectures like CNNs or other transformer variants.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative Energy NetScore calculations across multiple architectures (CNNs, ViTs, and other foundation models) on the same continual learning benchmarks would establish the metric's generalizability.

**Open Question 2**
- Question: How does the environmental impact of continual learning approaches compare to single-task learning when considering the full lifecycle of model deployment and retirement?
- Basis in paper: The study focuses on energy consumption during training and inference phases, but doesn't analyze the complete lifecycle including model development, deployment, maintenance, and eventual retirement phases.
- Why unresolved: The paper's scope is limited to training and inference energy consumption. Real-world deployment involves additional factors like model versioning, updates, and retirement that could affect overall sustainability.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive lifecycle assessment comparing continual learning approaches with single-task learning across development, deployment, maintenance, and retirement phases would provide a complete picture of environmental impact.

**Open Question 3**
- Question: What is the optimal balance between inference overhead and training efficiency for different real-world use cases with varying request frequencies?
- Basis in paper: The authors analyze break-even points for methods with inference overhead compared to JointTraining, finding that RanPAC requires over 10^7 requests to reach this point, but acknowledge this depends significantly on dataset size and use case.
- Why unresolved: The study provides break-even analysis for one specific scenario but doesn't explore how this optimal balance varies across different real-world applications with different request patterns, latency requirements, or resource constraints.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic analysis of break-even points across various request frequencies, latency constraints, and deployment scenarios would help identify optimal CL strategies for different use cases.

## Limitations
- The study focuses exclusively on vision foundation models with ViT-B/16 architecture, limiting generalizability to other model families or modalities
- Energy measurements depend heavily on specific hardware configurations and background processes, which may not be fully controlled across different experimental setups
- The analysis covers three datasets but doesn't address real-world data distribution shifts or non-stationary environments common in practical applications

## Confidence

**High Confidence** claims:
- Representation-based methods like RanPAC show superior energy-accuracy trade-offs with minimal inference overhead
- Exemplar-based methods exhibit quadratic energy growth as task sequences increase
- Prompt-based methods incur approximately double the inference energy compared to baseline

**Medium Confidence** claims:
- RanPAC consistently achieves the best Energy NetScore across all evaluated datasets
- Training energy consumption represents a smaller fraction compared to inference energy in continual learning scenarios
- The proposed Energy NetScore metric effectively captures both accuracy and energy efficiency trade-offs

**Low Confidence** claims:
- Extrapolated energy consumption patterns for longer task sequences beyond those evaluated
- Generalization of findings to foundation models with different architectures (e.g., ConvNets, different ViT sizes)
- Applicability of results to non-vision domains or multi-modal foundation models

## Next Checks

1. **Hardware Dependency Verification**: Replicate energy measurements across different GPU/CPU configurations to quantify hardware sensitivity and establish standardized measurement protocols that account for background processes and system variations.

2. **Longer Sequence Validation**: Extend experiments to include longer task sequences (10+ tasks) to validate the quadratic growth patterns predicted for exemplar-based methods and test the scalability limits of the most efficient approaches.

3. **Architecture Generalization Test**: Apply the same experimental framework to different vision foundation model architectures (e.g., ConvNeXt, ConvMixer, different ViT sizes) to assess whether the observed energy-efficiency rankings remain consistent across architectural families.
