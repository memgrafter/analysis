# What if? Causal Machine Learning in Supply Chain Risk Management

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.13556
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13556
- Reference count: 13
- Primary result: Demonstrates CML's application in predicting and mitigating supply chain delays using a case study from the maritime engineering sector.

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes and evaluates the use of causal machine learning (CML) for developing supply chain risk intervention models. The authors demonstrate CML's application in predicting and mitigating supply chain delays using a case study from the maritime engineering sector. The core method involves using double/debiased machine learning (DML) framework to estimate intervention effects and optimize interventions among groups of intervention recipients. Key findings include the identification of significant factors affecting delivery delays, such as supplier network and seasonal timing, and the development of specific intervention policies.

## Method Summary
The paper uses historical order data from 3 warehouses (2015-2022) to predict and mitigate supply chain delivery delays. The method involves generating causal graphs using both practitioner knowledge and automated methods (Hill Climbing, Tabu Search, PC algorithm), then applying an Interactive Regression Model (IRM) with DML framework to estimate Average Treatment Effects (ATE) and Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE). The approach uses XGBoost for estimating nuisance functions and decision trees for deriving treatment policies.

## Key Results
- Identified significant factors affecting delivery delays, including supplier network and seasonal timing
- Developed specific intervention policies based on estimated treatment effects
- Demonstrated CML's potential to enhance decision-making by providing actionable insights for strategic interventions in supply chain risk management

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: CML shifts focus from prediction to intervention by estimating causal effects of controllable variables on delay outcomes
- Mechanism: DML uses sample splitting and orthogonalization to remove confounding bias and isolate treatment effects
- Core assumption: The causal graph structure correctly captures the data-generating process
- Evidence anchors: Abstract statement about CML quantifying intervention changes, section on DML principles, weak corpus evidence
- Break condition: If the causal graph is misspecified or the ML model cannot capture nuisance functions

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: AutoDAG methods provide objective validation of practitioner-informed causal graphs
- Mechanism: Algorithms search over DAG structures to optimize scoring criteria, revealing alternative plausible structures
- Core assumption: Observed data contains sufficient information to identify the correct DAG structure
- Evidence anchors: Section on automatic DAG generation, Figure 3a showing algorithm performance, weak corpus evidence
- Break condition: If data is sparse or causal structure is highly complex

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Estimating CATE and deterministic treatment policies allows for granular, context-specific intervention design
- Mechanism: IRM uses B-splines and decision trees to model heterogeneous treatment effects and derive assignment rules
- Core assumption: Functional form of treatment effect heterogeneity can be captured by chosen ML methods
- Evidence anchors: Section on CATE calculation, Figure 4 showing one-dimensional CATEs, weak corpus evidence
- Break condition: If true treatment effect heterogeneity is not well approximated by the model

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Causal inference and the distinction between correlation and causation
  - Why needed here: CML explicitly models causal relationships to inform interventions, unlike traditional ML which only predicts correlations
  - Quick check question: In the context of supply chain delays, can you give an example of a spurious correlation that CML would help to distinguish from a true causal relationship?

- Concept: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and their role in causal identification
  - Why needed here: DAGs encode assumptions about causal structure, allowing identification of causal effects from observational data
  - Quick check question: What is the key assumption about the data-generating process that must hold for a DAG to be valid for causal inference?

- Concept: Double/debiased machine learning (DML) framework and its components
  - Why needed here: DML is the core method used to estimate causal effects while controlling for confounders
  - Quick check question: In the context of DML, what is the purpose of the Neyman orthogonality condition, and how does it help to reduce bias?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing -> Causal graph generation -> IRM with DML -> Treatment effect estimation -> Policy derivation -> Validation and interpretation
- Critical path: 1) Build and validate causal graph, 2) Preprocess data according to graph structure, 3) Train IRM with DML to estimate ATE, 4) Estimate CATE for heterogeneous effects, 5) Derive deterministic treatment policies, 6) Interpret and validate results
- Design tradeoffs: Model complexity vs. interpretability, autoDAG vs. practitioner DAG, sample size vs. granularity
- Failure signatures: High variance in ATE/CATE estimates, policy tree with very deep splits, contradictory results between practitioner DAG and autoDAG
- First 3 experiments: 1) Generate DAGs using practitioner knowledge and compare with autoDAGs, 2) Train IRM with DML to estimate ATE for "Multi" treatment, 3) Estimate CATE for "Multi" treatment as a function of "Quantity"

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of CML compare to traditional ML methods in terms of predictive accuracy and interpretability across different supply chain risk management tasks?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses complementary use of CML alongside traditional ML, highlighting CML's strength in providing actionable insights for interventions rather than just predictions, but does not provide direct comparison
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on demonstrating CML application in a specific case study without comparative analysis with traditional ML methods
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing CML and traditional ML methods across multiple supply chain risk management tasks with metrics for both predictive accuracy and interpretability

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can CML be effectively applied to other supply chain risk management issues, such as inventory management, predictive maintenance, and quality control, beyond delay prediction?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper suggests that CML could be applied to other SCRM-related issues but does not provide evidence or case studies demonstrating its effectiveness in these areas
- Why unresolved: The paper presents a case study focused on delay prediction and mentions potential applications without exploring or validating these possibilities
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies or experimental results showing the application and effectiveness of CML in inventory management, predictive maintenance, and quality control within supply chain contexts

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can causal federated learning be integrated with CML to address supply chain failures in a privacy-preserving manner while maintaining accuracy and reliability of causal inferences?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper proposes causal federated learning as a promising avenue for future research, highlighting potential for collaborative yet secure data analysis across different entities in a supply chain
- Why unresolved: The paper introduces the concept of causal federated learning but does not explore its implementation or effectiveness in practice
- What evidence would resolve it: Research studies or pilot projects demonstrating the integration of causal federated learning with CML, assessing both privacy preservation and quality of causal inferences

## Limitations

- Causal graph structure relies heavily on practitioner knowledge, which may introduce bias
- Effectiveness of autoDAG methods in validating causal graphs is not extensively tested in SCM domain
- Assumption that chosen ML model can accurately approximate nuisance functions is critical but not fully validated in this context

## Confidence

- CML for SCM interventions: Medium - framework is theoretically sound but application to SCM is novel and requires further validation
- DML for causal effect estimation: High - DML is well-established but performance in SCM settings is not extensively studied
- AutoDAG methods for causal graph validation: Low - while providing objective perspective, their effectiveness in SCM is not well-documented

## Next Checks

1. Compare autoDAGs with practitioner DAGs to assess alignment and identify discrepancies
2. Validate CATE estimation using out-of-sample data or sensitivity analyses
3. Assess policy robustness by testing derived treatment policies on new data or through scenario analysis
