# Machine Theory of Mind for Autonomous Cyber-Defence

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.04367
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04367
- Reference count: 40
- The paper introduces GIGO-ToM, a GNN-based Theory of Mind architecture for predicting adversarial cyber-agent behaviors in network defense.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical need for explainable AI in cybersecurity by proposing a novel Graph Neural Network-based Theory of Mind architecture, GIGO-ToM, designed to predict the goals and attack trajectories of adversarial cyber agents. The framework introduces a new metric, Network Transport Distance (NTD), for measuring similarity between graph-based probability distributions, enabling standardized comparisons across different network sizes. The authors demonstrate GIGO-ToM's effectiveness in accurately predicting adversarial behaviors across various network topologies in synthetic cyber-defense environments.

## Method Summary
The paper proposes a Graph-In, Graph-Out (GIGO)-ToM architecture built on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model Theory of Mind in cyber-defense scenarios. The framework processes graph-based state observations of network topologies to predict adversarial agent behaviors and attack trajectories. A novel Network Transport Distance (NTD) metric is introduced as a unit-bounded measure for comparing graph-based probability distributions, with the ability to incorporate custom weighting functions. The architecture is evaluated against a baseline GIDO-ToM model in synthetic cyber-defense environments, demonstrating improved prediction accuracy for adversarial goals and behaviors.

## Key Results
- GIGO-ToM accurately predicts targets and attack trajectories of adversarial cyber agents across arbitrary network topologies
- NTD enables standardized comparison between networks of different sizes and can be enriched with custom node feature weighting
- Preliminary results suggest NTD may significantly improve predicted successor representations when used as a loss function

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper's approach works by leveraging GNNs to process graph-structured network state observations and predict adversarial behaviors through a Theory of Mind framework. The Network Transport Distance metric provides a principled way to measure similarity between probability distributions over graphs, addressing the challenge of comparing networks of different sizes. The GIGO architecture's ability to process graph inputs and outputs enables it to capture the relational structure of network topologies and adversarial movement patterns.

## Foundational Learning

1. **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**: Neural networks designed to operate on graph-structured data by propagating information between nodes and edges. Needed to process network topology as input and predict adversarial movements. Quick check: Can the GNN effectively capture node relationships in varying network sizes?

2. **Theory of Mind (ToM)**: The ability to attribute mental states to agents and understand their beliefs, intentions, and goals. Needed to predict adversarial cyber agents' targets and attack trajectories. Quick check: Does the ToM framework accurately infer unseen attacker motivations?

3. **Network Transport Distance (NTD)**: A Wasserstein distance extension for measuring similarity between graph-based probability distributions with unit-bounded normalization. Needed to compare predictions across different network sizes. Quick check: Does NTD provide more meaningful distance measures than traditional metrics?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Network State Observation -> GNN Encoder -> ToM Layer -> Prediction Output

**Critical Path**: The critical path flows from graph-based network state observations through the GNN encoder to extract node features, then through the ToM layer to infer adversarial beliefs and goals, producing predicted attack trajectories.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The GIGO architecture trades computational complexity for the ability to process graph-structured inputs and outputs directly, enabling more accurate modeling of network topology relationships. The NTD metric sacrifices some mathematical elegance for practical utility in comparing networks of different sizes.

**Failure Signatures**: Potential failures include poor generalization to unseen network topologies, sensitivity to noisy network observations, and suboptimal performance when adversarial agents use unpredictable strategies not captured in training data.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate GIGO-ToM on increasingly complex network topologies to test scalability
2. Compare NTD against traditional distance metrics across diverse network configurations
3. Test ToM predictions under varying levels of network observability and noise

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How would GIGO-ToM perform on real-world cyber-defense datasets compared to synthetic environments?
- Basis in paper: The paper uses a synthetic cyber-defense environment (Y AWNING-TITAN) with custom network topologies and rule-based agents.
- Why unresolved: The paper's experiments are limited to abstract scenarios. Real-world networks have more complex dynamics, noise, and attacker strategies.
- What evidence would resolve it: Benchmarking GIGO-ToM on real-world network logs and attack data, comparing performance metrics like prediction accuracy and F1 scores against baseline models.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the Network Transport Distance (NTD) be effectively used as a loss function for optimizing predicted successor representations?
- Basis in paper: The paper proposes preliminary experiments comparing NTD loss with soft label cross-entropy loss, suggesting potential improvements.
- Why unresolved: The preliminary results are not conclusive, and the impact of different regularization parameters on performance is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive experiments varying λ and comparing NTD loss against other loss functions across diverse network topologies and agent behaviors.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does GIGO-ToM handle scenarios with partial observability of the network and attacker actions?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions that GIGO-ToM can process graph-based state observations, but experiments use full observability.
- Why unresolved: Real-world scenarios often involve limited visibility of network states and attacker actions, which could affect GIGO-ToM's predictions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing GIGO-ToM in environments with varying levels of observability, measuring prediction accuracy and robustness to missing information.

## Limitations

- Limited testing on real-world network data and attack patterns
- Synthetic environment may not capture full complexity of actual cyber-defense scenarios
- Focus on prediction without addressing defensive countermeasures or defender adaptability

## Confidence

- **GIGO-ToM architecture accuracy**: Medium
- **NTD metric utility**: Medium
- **Real-world applicability**: Low

## Next Checks

1. Test GIGO-ToM architecture on real-world network data with dynamic and evolving topologies to assess robustness and adaptability
2. Conduct comparative studies of NTD against established graph-based distance metrics across wider range of network configurations and adversarial scenarios
3. Evaluate integration of proposed framework with existing cybersecurity tools to determine practical utility and impact on real-time threat detection and response
