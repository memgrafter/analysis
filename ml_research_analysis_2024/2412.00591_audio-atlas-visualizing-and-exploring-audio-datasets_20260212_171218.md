# Audio Atlas: Visualizing and Exploring Audio Datasets

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.00591
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00591
- Reference count: 0
- Key outcome: Interactive web application for visualizing and exploring large-scale audio datasets using text-audio embeddings for semantic search and classification

## Executive Summary
Audio Atlas addresses the challenge of visualizing and exploring large-scale audio datasets by introducing an interactive web application that leverages text-audio embeddings for semantic search and classification. The system uses CLAP embeddings projected into 2D space via t-SNE and stored in Milvus for efficient semantic search. The application enables zero-shot classification and semantic search across multiple modalities without requiring metadata. An initial implementation supports six audio datasets and maintains responsiveness even with millions of samples. The ESC-50 dataset visualization demonstrates clear clustering of semantic classes in the embedding space, validating the effectiveness of the approach. The tool provides novel capabilities for browsing unannotated audio libraries through descriptive queries and exploring dataset structure. The codebase is open-sourced to advance research in large-scale audio dataset analysis and embedding model evaluation.

## Method Summary
Audio Atlas uses CLAP (Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining) to generate semantic embeddings from audio samples, creating a shared vector space for audio and text representations. These high-dimensional embeddings are projected into 2D space using t-SNE for visualization and stored in the Milvus vector database for efficient semantic search. The system employs DeepScatter for interactive WebGL-based visualization on a React frontend. Users can explore audio datasets through semantic search across modalities, zero-shot classification without metadata, and interactive navigation of the 2D embedding space. The architecture enables browsing unannotated audio libraries using descriptive queries and provides insights into dataset structure through visual clustering patterns.

## Key Results
- Clear semantic clustering demonstrated on ESC-50 dataset with all 50 sound categories forming distinct local pockets in t-SNE projection
- Zero-shot classification capability enables classification of audio samples without requiring training labels or metadata
- System maintains responsiveness on large-scale datasets with millions of audio samples through Milvus vector database optimization
- Cross-modal semantic search allows users to find audio samples using text queries or vice versa through shared embedding space

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: CLAP embeddings enable semantic search across modalities by mapping audio and text into a shared vector space
- Mechanism: The contrastive training of CLAP creates a unified embedding space where semantically similar audio and text representations are close together, allowing cross-modal similarity search using nearest-neighbor lookup
- Core assumption: The contrastive learning objective successfully aligns audio and text representations in a semantically meaningful way
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "CLAP [7], a contrastive neural network trained on audio-text pairs"
  - [section]: "To obtain semantically meaningful embeddings, we use CLAP [7], a contrastive neural network trained on audio-text pairs"
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence - no direct mentions of CLAP or contrastive learning in corpus
- Break condition: If the contrastive training fails to create meaningful alignment between audio and text representations, cross-modal search would produce irrelevant results

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: t-SNE projection enables intuitive 2D visualization of high-dimensional audio embeddings
- Mechanism: t-SNE preserves local structure in high-dimensional space when projecting to 2D, allowing users to visually identify clusters and patterns in audio data
- Core assumption: The local structure preserved by t-SNE is sufficient to reveal meaningful semantic groupings in the audio data
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The system maps audio embeddings into a two-dimensional space and leverages DeepScatter for dynamic visualization"
  - [section]: "These embeddings are then projected onto a two-dimensional plane using t-SNE [9]"
  - [section]: "In Figure 3, we use the ESC-50 classes to classify the dataset using zero-shot classification... we can see that the t-SNE projection of the CLAP embeddings for the ESC-50 dataset has clustered all classes into local pockets"
- Break condition: If the embedding space is too complex or the dataset too large, t-SNE may fail to preserve meaningful structure or become computationally prohibitive

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Milvus vector database enables efficient semantic search at scale
- Mechanism: Milvus provides optimized storage and nearest-neighbor search operations for high-dimensional vectors, allowing fast retrieval of semantically similar audio samples
- Core assumption: The vector database can handle the scale and dimensionality of CLAP embeddings while maintaining acceptable query performance
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "CLAP embeddings projected into 2D space via t-SNE and stored in Milvus for efficient semantic search"
  - [section]: "We use Milvus [10] to store the CLAP embeddings. Milvus is a high-performance open-source vector database which efficiently manages embeddings and enables nearest-neighbor lookup for semantic searches"
  - [section]: "Audio Atlas remains responsive on large-scale datasets [19]"
- Break condition: If the dataset grows beyond Milvus's optimization capabilities or if embedding dimensionality exceeds practical limits, search performance would degrade

## Foundational Learning

- CLAP (Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining)
  - Why needed here: CLAP is the core embedding model that enables cross-modal semantic search and zero-shot classification
  - Quick check question: How does contrastive learning help CLAP create a shared embedding space for audio and text?

- t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)
  - Why needed here: t-SNE reduces high-dimensional CLAP embeddings to 2D for visualization while preserving local structure
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between t-SNE and PCA in terms of what they preserve during dimensionality reduction?

- Vector databases (Milvus)
  - Why needed here: Milvus provides efficient storage and nearest-neighbor search for high-dimensional embeddings at scale
  - Quick check question: What is the primary advantage of using a purpose-built vector database like Milvus over a traditional relational database for this application?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Frontend: DeepScatter (WebGL/React) for interactive visualization
  Embedding pipeline: CLAP model for generating audio-text embeddings
  Dimensionality reduction: t-SNE for 2D projection
  Vector storage: Milvus for efficient embedding management
  Search: Approximate nearest neighbor search using Annoy
  Backend: API layer connecting frontend to Milvus and CLAP

- Critical path:
  1. User uploads or selects audio data
  2. CLAP generates embeddings for all audio samples
  3. Embeddings stored in Milvus
  4. t-SNE projects embeddings to 2D
  5. DeepScatter renders visualization
  6. User interacts via search or exploration
  7. Search queries converted to embeddings
  8. Milvus performs nearest-neighbor lookup
  9. Results displayed to user

- Design tradeoffs:
  - CLAP vs other embedding models: CLAP enables cross-modal search but may have larger model size than audio-only alternatives
  - t-SNE vs UMAP: t-SNE is more established but slower on large datasets; UMAP is faster but less commonly used for this application
  - Milvus vs FAISS: Milvus offers more features but may be heavier; FAISS is lighter but less feature-rich
  - Approximate vs exact nearest neighbor: Approximate search is faster but may miss some true nearest neighbors

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor clustering in visualization: Indicates CLAP embeddings may not capture semantic relationships well
  - Slow response times: Suggests Milvus may not be optimized for current dataset size or dimensionality
  - Search returning irrelevant results: Could indicate issues with contrastive learning or embedding quality
  - Frontend not rendering: Likely DeepScatter/WebGL compatibility issues

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Load a small, well-labeled dataset (like ESC-50) and verify that t-SNE produces clear semantic clusters that match ground truth labels
  2. Test cross-modal search by searching for audio using text queries and verifying the relevance of returned results
  3. Scale up to a larger dataset and monitor Milvus query performance, adjusting indexing parameters as needed

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the choice of t-SNE parameters affect the clustering quality and interpretability of Audio Atlas visualizations across different audio datasets?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions t-SNE is used for dimensionality reduction but does not discuss parameter sensitivity or comparative analysis with other dimensionality reduction techniques
- Why unresolved: The paper demonstrates clustering quality on ESC-50 but doesn't provide systematic evaluation of how t-SNE parameters (perplexity, learning rate, iterations) affect results across diverse datasets with varying characteristics
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative visualizations using different t-SNE parameters, quantitative metrics measuring cluster separation, and ablation studies showing parameter sensitivity

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the semantic search performance of CLAP embeddings compare to other audio-text embedding models when searching across modalities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states CLAP embeddings enable semantic searches across text and audio modalities but doesn't benchmark against alternative models like Whisper, Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) adaptations, or domain-specific audio embeddings
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates the capability, it lacks comparative analysis showing whether CLAP is optimal for this use case or how it performs relative to alternatives in terms of search accuracy and computational efficiency
- What evidence would resolve it: Head-to-head comparisons of search accuracy, response time, and memory usage across multiple embedding models on standardized audio-text retrieval benchmarks

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the limitations of zero-shot classification using CLAP embeddings for audio datasets with highly specialized or technical vocabulary?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates zero-shot classification on ESC-50 with general sound categories but doesn't address performance degradation when classifying specialized audio (e.g., medical sounds, industrial machinery, or musical instruments)
- Why unresolved: The paper shows successful classification on environmental sounds but doesn't test the embedding model's understanding of technical terminology or its ability to distinguish between semantically similar specialized categories
- What evidence would resolve it: Classification accuracy metrics on specialized audio datasets, confusion matrix analysis showing common misclassifications, and qualitative assessment of how the model handles technical vs. general vocabulary

## Limitations
- The approach relies heavily on the quality of CLAP embeddings, which were trained on a specific set of audio-text pairs without validation across diverse audio domains
- t-SNE projection may not preserve global structure in extremely large datasets, potentially limiting interpretability at scale
- System's performance with datasets containing millions of samples is claimed but not empirically demonstrated in the paper

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The core mechanism of using CLAP embeddings for semantic search across modalities (Mechanism 1) is well-supported by the demonstrated ESC-50 clustering results and the established nature of contrastive learning
- **Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of t-SNE for revealing semantic structure (Mechanism 2) is supported by the ESC-50 visualization but lacks validation on more diverse or larger datasets
- **Medium Confidence**: Milvus's ability to maintain responsiveness at scale (Mechanism 3) is claimed but not empirically demonstrated beyond "large-scale" datasets

## Next Checks

1. **Scalability Validation**: Test the system with a dataset containing over 1 million audio samples to empirically verify the claimed responsiveness and identify any performance bottlenecks in the Milvus vector database or t-SNE computation

2. **Cross-Domain Generalization**: Evaluate the semantic search and clustering performance on audio domains not represented in the original CLAP training data (e.g., industrial sounds, medical audio, or non-Western music) to assess the robustness of the embedding space

3. **Embedding Quality Assessment**: Conduct a quantitative evaluation comparing CLAP embeddings against alternative audio embedding models (such as PANNs or VGGish) on standard audio retrieval benchmarks to establish the relative effectiveness of the chosen embedding approach
