# HEMM: Holistic Evaluation of Multimodal Foundation Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.03418
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03418
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Comprehensive benchmark framework evaluating 11 multimodal models across 30 datasets spanning basic skills, information flow, and real-world use cases

## Executive Summary
HEMM (Holistic Evaluation of Multimodal Models) introduces a systematic framework for evaluating multimodal foundation models across three levels: basic multimodal skills, information flow capabilities, and real-world use cases. The framework evaluates models on dimensions including modality interactions (redundant, unique, synergistic), alignment granularity, reasoning requirements, external knowledge needs, and information flow types (querying, translation, editing, fusion). Through experiments with 11 multimodal models, the authors identify key dataset dimensions that challenge current models and analyze how modeling decisions influence performance.

## Method Summary
The HEMM framework evaluates multimodal models across 30 datasets spanning three evaluation levels: basic multimodal skills (e.g., visual question answering, image retrieval), information flow capabilities (e.g., text-to-image generation, image captioning), and real-world use cases (e.g., healthcare, HCI, science applications). Models are assessed across six dataset dimensions: modality interactions (redundant, unique, synergistic), alignment granularity, reasoning requirements, external knowledge needs, information flow types, and domain specificity. The evaluation covers models of varying sizes and architectures, analyzing how factors like scale, pre-training data diversity, architecture choices, and training objectives affect performance across different dataset characteristics.

## Key Results
- Larger models, diverse pre-training data, and instruction tuning significantly improve multimodal performance
- Healthcare, HCI, and science domains remain particularly challenging for current multimodal models
- Model performance correlates with dataset characteristics including reasoning complexity, external knowledge requirements, and information flow type
- Architecture and training decisions show measurable impact on performance across different evaluation dimensions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
HEMM's systematic approach works by providing a structured evaluation framework that captures the multifaceted nature of multimodal intelligence. The three-level evaluation hierarchy (basic skills → information flow → real-world use cases) allows for progressive assessment of model capabilities, while the six-dimensional dataset characterization enables nuanced analysis of where models succeed or fail. By correlating model performance with dataset characteristics and modeling decisions, HEMM reveals actionable insights about which architectural and training choices matter most for different types of multimodal tasks.

## Foundational Learning
1. Multimodal foundation models: AI systems that process and integrate multiple input modalities (text, images, audio) for unified understanding and generation
   - Why needed: Understanding these models is essential for grasping HEMM's evaluation framework and results
   - Quick check: Can you explain how a multimodal model differs from a single-modality model?

2. Information flow types in multimodal systems: Different ways modalities interact including querying (retrieving info from one modality using another), translation (converting between modalities), editing (modifying one modality using another), and fusion (integrating multiple modalities)
   - Why needed: HEMM systematically evaluates these different interaction patterns
   - Quick check: Can you give an example of each information flow type?

3. Dataset dimension analysis: Framework for characterizing datasets by modality interactions, alignment granularity, reasoning requirements, external knowledge needs, and domain specificity
   - Why needed: This systematic characterization reveals which dataset features challenge models most
   - Quick check: Can you categorize a simple dataset (e.g., VQA) using these dimensions?

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Data → Pre-training → Fine-tuning → Evaluation → Performance Analysis
- Pre-training involves diverse multimodal data and various objectives (contrastive, generative, discriminative)
- Fine-tuning includes instruction tuning for improved generalization
- Evaluation uses HEMM framework across 30 datasets

**Critical Path:** Pre-training with diverse data → Instruction tuning → HEMM evaluation → Performance analysis across dataset dimensions

**Design Tradeoffs:** Model scale vs. efficiency, pre-training data diversity vs. domain specificity, architecture complexity vs. training stability, instruction tuning vs. task-specific optimization

**Failure Signatures:** Poor performance on datasets requiring high reasoning complexity, external knowledge, or specific information flow types; particularly weak on healthcare, HCI, and science domains

**First Experiments:**
1. Replicate baseline evaluations on a subset of 5-10 HEMM datasets to verify core findings
2. Ablation study removing instruction tuning to quantify its impact on performance
3. Architecture comparison between models with different visual encoders (CLIP vs. custom)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How can multimodal models be improved specifically for healthcare, HCI, and science domains where they currently underperform?
- What architectural innovations could better handle datasets requiring high reasoning complexity and external knowledge?
- How do temporal and sequential reasoning capabilities affect multimodal performance, particularly in real-world use cases?

## Limitations
- Conclusions about model capabilities are primarily correlational rather than causal
- Benchmark may not capture all real-world use cases, particularly those requiring extended temporal reasoning
- Domain-specific conclusions (healthcare, HCI, science) have limited confidence due to small dataset numbers

## Confidence
- Basic benchmarking results and dataset characteristics: **High**
- Conclusions about modeling decisions influencing performance: **Medium**
- Domain-specific conclusions (healthcare, HCI, science): **Low**

## Next Checks
1. Conduct ablation studies isolating specific architectural components (e.g., visual encoders, fusion mechanisms) to better understand their individual contributions to performance
2. Expand evaluation to include temporal and sequential reasoning tasks to assess limitations in handling time-dependent multimodal scenarios
3. Perform cross-dataset validation to verify whether performance patterns observed in specific domains generalize across different datasets within those domains
