# UAV-Based Human Body Detector Selection and Fusion for Geolocated Saliency Map Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.16501
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16501
- Reference count: 8
- Detects and geolocates humans in SAR missions using UAVs with optimized detector allocation and fusion

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive system for detecting and geolocating humans in Search and Rescue operations using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The approach addresses key challenges including video compression over limited bandwidth links, computational constraints on both UAV and ground systems, and the need for accurate geolocation of detected objects. The system evaluates multiple deep neural network-based object detectors under various compression and hardware conditions, optimally allocates detectors to available resources, and fuses detection results from multiple UAVs to generate accurate geolocated saliency maps.

## Method Summary
The proposed method consists of three main components: First, a comprehensive evaluation of vision-based object detection algorithms considering factors like image compression, hardware capabilities, and communication constraints. Second, an optimal allocation algorithm that assigns object detectors to UAVs and processing sites based on evaluation results and available resources using Integer Linear Programming. Third, a novel probabilistic fusion method that combines detection results from multiple sources to generate geolocated saliency maps using voxel-based occupancy mapping with log-odds updates. The system is designed to work with real-time video streams from UAVs while maintaining detection accuracy despite compression artifacts and resource limitations.

## Key Results
- Achieved 0.9-1.15 meter average geolocation accuracy for human subjects in real-world experiments
- Demonstrated reasonable detection performance even with highly compressed video down to 2.5Mbps
- Successfully assigned optimal detectors to UAVs based on processing power and bandwidth constraints
- Generated accurate geolocated maps of detected objects through probabilistic fusion

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Optimizing object detector allocation reduces detection latency and improves mission success rates.
- Mechanism: The algorithm pre-computes execution timing and accuracy characteristics for multiple detectors across different hardware configurations. During a mission, it assigns the fastest and most accurate detectors that fit within communication and processing constraints.
- Core assumption: Execution time and accuracy are stable across frames and environmental conditions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "An optimal allocation algorithm for assigning object detectors to UAVs based on the evaluation results and available resources."
  - [section] "For off-board processing to be justified, one or both of the following has to be true: (a) the total time of remote processing has to be smaller (due to the availability of more powerful hardware), or (b) it has to provide a solution which is not achievable on the local system alone."
  - [corpus] No direct match; corpus focuses on similar UAV detection problems but not allocation optimization.
- Break condition: Changes in bandwidth, processing load, or scene complexity that invalidate pre-computed timing profiles.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Vision-based detection accuracy degrades gracefully with video compression, enabling use over low-bandwidth links.
- Mechanism: The system evaluates detectors under varying bitrates and codecs, selecting those that maintain sufficient accuracy even under heavy compression. This allows continued detection over degraded communication links.
- Core assumption: Compression artifacts affect all detectors similarly, and relative performance rankings remain consistent.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The evaluation of deep neural network-based object detectors shows that even with highly compressed video, reasonable detection performance can be achieved."
  - [section] "The performance deteriorates below the bitrate of 2.5Mbps, which is clearly visible for SSD networks."
  - [corpus] Weak match; corpus includes detection work but not compression-focused evaluation.
- Break condition: Compression artifacts exceed tolerable levels for the selected detectors, causing false positive spikes or missed detections.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Probabilistic fusion of detection results improves geolocation accuracy and reduces false positives.
- Mechanism: Each detection contributes to a voxel-based occupancy map with a probability weighted by detector accuracy, object size plausibility, and distance. Negative updates incorporate unobserved areas, refining confidence.
- Core assumption: Multiple detections of the same object reinforce its location, while conflicting detections reduce confidence.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The fusion method successfully generates accurate geolocated maps of detected objects."
  - [section] "Instead of using range measurements to update the occupancy, this paper defines the update using one or more object detections..."
  - [corpus] No direct match; corpus lacks probabilistic fusion specifics.
- Break condition: Overconfident detections from low-accuracy detectors or systematic biases in pose estimation.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Object detection evaluation metrics (AP, AR, LRP)
  - Why needed here: To compare detector performance objectively under various constraints and select the most suitable ones.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between Average Precision and Average Recall, and when would each be more appropriate?

- Concept: Integer Linear Programming (ILP) for resource allocation
  - Why needed here: To find an optimal assignment of detectors to UAVs and processing sites under bandwidth, memory, and timing constraints.
  - Quick check question: In the ILP formulation, what role does the `detPerFrame` parameter play in the constraints?

- Concept: Voxel-based probabilistic mapping
  - Why needed here: To fuse detections from multiple UAVs into a consistent geolocated saliency map.
  - Quick check question: How does the negative update in the map prevent false positives from persisting?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: UAVs with cameras -> video transmission -> detector allocation -> object detection (local/remote) -> detection fusion -> saliency map -> mission planning
- Critical path: Video acquisition -> allocation decision -> detection inference -> fusion -> geolocation output
- Design tradeoffs: Detector accuracy vs. execution time vs. bandwidth usage; grid resolution vs. geolocation accuracy vs. computational load
- Failure signatures: High false positive rate in map -> detector confidence miscalibration; mission timeout -> allocation problem unsolved; low detection rate -> communication bandwidth saturated
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run detector evaluation on sample UAV video with 1 Mbps, 5 Mbps, and 20 Mbps bitrates; compare AP@0.5 and AR@0.5:0.95.
  2. Execute the ILP solver with 10 UAVs, 3 processing sites, and 5 detector types; vary detPerStream from 1 to 3.
  3. Simulate fusion with two UAVs detecting the same object at different distances; verify map probability and geolocation error.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the proposed detector selection and allocation algorithm scale with a significantly larger number of UAVs (e.g., 50+) and detectors?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper evaluates the algorithm with up to 40 machines and 150 video streams. Scaling to larger numbers of UAVs and detectors is not explored.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not investigate the computational complexity and runtime of the algorithm for significantly larger problem instances.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing the runtime and performance of the algorithm for a larger number of UAVs (e.g., 50+) and detectors, demonstrating its scalability.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the proposed method handle dynamic changes in the operational environment, such as sudden changes in weather conditions or communication link quality?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the detector allocation is performed once before a mission. However, it does not address how the method adapts to dynamic changes in the environment.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the robustness of the method to dynamic changes in the operational environment.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results demonstrating the performance of the method under varying weather conditions and communication link qualities, and how the detector allocation adapts to these changes.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed method compare to other state-of-the-art approaches for object detection and geolocation in UAV-based search and rescue missions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper provides a comprehensive review of related work in the field but does not directly compare the proposed method to other state-of-the-art approaches.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a comparative analysis of the proposed method with other approaches in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing the performance of the proposed method with other state-of-the-art approaches in terms of object detection accuracy, geolocation accuracy, and computational efficiency.

## Limitations

- Limited real-world validation with only single experiment demonstrating 0.9-1.15m geolocation accuracy
- Compression evaluation shows significant performance degradation below 2.5Mbps without establishing practical lower bounds
- Fusion algorithm assumes accurate pose estimation and consistent object appearance, which may not hold in challenging SAR environments

## Confidence

- High Confidence: Detector evaluation methodology and relative performance rankings across compression levels and hardware configurations
- Medium Confidence: Detector allocation algorithm effectiveness and fusion method for generating geolocated maps, based on simulated validation
- Low Confidence: Real-world geolocation accuracy claims, as they are based on a single experiment with limited scope

## Next Checks

1. Conduct field experiments across diverse SAR environments (urban, forest, mountainous) with varying weather conditions to validate real-world geolocation accuracy and detector robustness.

2. Test the system's performance with compression levels below 2.5Mbps to establish practical bandwidth limits for usable detection in SAR scenarios.

3. Implement stress testing of the ILP allocation algorithm with dynamic network conditions and processing loads to verify stability and adaptability during missions.
