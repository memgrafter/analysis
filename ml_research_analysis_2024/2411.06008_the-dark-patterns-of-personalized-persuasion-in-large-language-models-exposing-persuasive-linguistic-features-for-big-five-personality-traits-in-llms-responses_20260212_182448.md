# The Dark Patterns of Personalized Persuasion in Large Language Models: Exposing Persuasive Linguistic Features for Big Five Personality Traits in LLMs Responses

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.06008
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06008
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: LLMs can personalize persuasive language based on personality traits, using different linguistic features for neuroticism, conscientiousness, and openness to experience

## Executive Summary
This study examines how large language models adjust their language in persuasive tasks based on personality traits from the Big Five model. Researchers analyzed 19 models across five families using prompts that incorporated personality trait information. They identified 13 linguistic features crucial for persuasion and found that models significantly increased anxiety-related words for neuroticism, achievement-related words for conscientiousness, and decreased cognitive process words for openness to experience. The research reveals that some model families excel at adapting language for specific traits - Anthropic models for openness to experience, Alibaba models for conscientiousness, and GPT-4 Turbo for neuroticism. These findings raise important ethical concerns about potential manipulation and mental health impacts of personality-targeted AI persuasion.

## Method Summary
The study employed a comprehensive methodology to analyze how LLMs adapt persuasive language based on personality traits. Researchers created 600 prompts per model incorporating Big Five personality traits (neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, openness to experience, conscientiousness) and collected responses from 19 models across five families. They used Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software to extract 13 linguistic features from the responses, then applied Shapley value analysis to identify the most important features for each trait. Random forest models and linear regression were used to examine relationships between personality traits and linguistic feature usage. The analysis revealed that different model families excel at using specific linguistic features for different personality traits, with significant variations in how effectively they adapt their language based on the provided personality information.

## Key Results
- Models use more anxiety-related words for neuroticism, achievement-related words for conscientiousness, and fewer cognitive process words for openness to experience
- Different model families excel at specific personality traits - Anthropic for openness, Alibaba for conscientiousness, GPT-4 Turbo for neuroticism
- Shapley value analysis identified 13 linguistic features crucial for personalized persuasion across personality trait levels

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs adjust linguistic features in responses based on personality trait information provided in prompts.
- Mechanism: The study uses a template prompt containing personality trait variables (level, trait) that influence the model's output. Through Shapley value analysis and regression modeling, researchers identify which linguistic features are most affected by different personality trait levels.
- Core assumption: The linguistic features identified by LIWC software accurately capture psychological and persuasive elements relevant to personality traits.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "models use more anxiety-related words for neuroticism, increase achievement-related words for conscientiousness, and employ fewer cognitive processes words for openness to experience"
  - [section 4.4] "increasing the level of conscientiousness leads to a greater use of achievement-related words"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence provided for mechanism validation
- Break condition: If LIWC categories don't accurately capture the psychological mechanisms they're intended to measure, or if the regression analysis fails to establish significant relationships between trait levels and linguistic features.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Different model families exhibit varying effectiveness in using linguistic features for specific personality traits.
- Mechanism: The study compares 19 models across five families (Anthropic, Alibaba, Meta, Mistral AI, OpenAI) and finds that certain families excel at adapting language for specific traits - Anthropic for openness to experience, Alibaba for conscientiousness, GPT-4 Turbo for neuroticism.
- Core assumption: Model architecture and training data differences lead to varying capabilities in understanding and applying personality-based linguistic adaptations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Some model families excel at adapting language for openness to experience, others for conscientiousness, while only one model adapts language for neuroticism"
  - [section 4.5] "Anthropic model family excels at using linguistic features that are particularly effective for individuals with the openness to experience trait"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence comparing model families' performance
- Break condition: If model performance differences are due to random variation rather than systematic architectural differences, or if the comparison methodology is flawed.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The study identifies 13 linguistic features crucial for personalized persuasion across different levels of the Big Five personality model.
- Mechanism: Through literature review and LIWC analysis, researchers select linguistic features associated with each personality trait, then use random forest models and Shapley values to determine which features are most influenced by trait information in prompts.
- Core assumption: The Big Five personality model provides a valid framework for understanding how different individuals respond to persuasive language.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "We chose LIWC because it includes broader categories than those typically used in sentiment analysis"
  - [section 4.3] "Shapley values were employed to evaluate the significance of individual variables within the predictive model"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus evidence validating the selection of these specific 13 features
- Break condition: If the Big Five model is not universally applicable, or if the selected linguistic features don't accurately capture persuasive elements for the identified personality traits.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Big Five personality model (neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, openness to experience, conscientiousness)
  - Why needed here: The study uses this model as the framework for understanding how different personality types respond to persuasive language
  - Quick check question: What are the five dimensions of the Big Five personality model and how do they differ in terms of emotional stability and social behavior?

- Concept: Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software
  - Why needed here: LIWC is used to analyze the frequency of word usage in LLM responses across psycholinguistic categories relevant to persuasion
  - Quick check question: What types of linguistic features can LIWC analyze, and how do these features relate to psychological processes?

- Concept: Shapley values in explainable AI
  - Why needed here: Shapley values are used to measure the importance of personality trait variables in predicting linguistic feature usage
  - Quick check question: How do Shapley values differ from other feature importance metrics, and why are they particularly useful for understanding model behavior?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Prompt generation (with personality variables) -> LLM response generation -> LIWC-based linguistic feature extraction -> Random forest modeling with Shapley values -> Regression analysis
- Critical path: Prompt generation → LLM response → LIWC extraction → Statistical analysis (Shapley values → Regression)
- Design tradeoffs: The study balances comprehensiveness (19 models, 5 families) with depth (13 linguistic features, 5 personality traits) while maintaining statistical rigor through multiple analysis methods
- Failure signatures: If models refuse to complete persuasive tasks, if LIWC analysis shows minimal variation across conditions, or if statistical analysis fails to find significant relationships between traits and linguistic features
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test prompt generation with different personality trait configurations to ensure models are receiving and processing the information correctly
  2. Run LIWC analysis on a small sample of responses to verify the linguistic feature extraction pipeline is working as expected
  3. Perform initial random forest modeling on a subset of data to confirm Shapley value calculations are producing meaningful importance scores

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different combinations of personality traits interact to influence the effectiveness of persuasive linguistic features in LLM responses?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that "a person is a combination of all the Big Five personality dimensions, which interact with each other" and suggests future studies could consider these interactions.
- Why unresolved: The current study only examined individual personality traits in isolation, not their combined effects.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing how different trait combinations (e.g., high neuroticism + high conscientiousness) affect the selection and impact of persuasive linguistic features in LLM responses.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Which specific metrics would best evaluate LLMs for personalized linguistic persuasion to prevent harmful manipulation while preserving beneficial personalization?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "we emphasize the need for the creation of new metric evaluating models for personalized linguistic persuasion" and notes that existing metrics like BLEU and ROUGE don't capture this aspect.
- Why unresolved: Current evaluation frameworks focus on general language quality and task completion, not the ethical implications of personality-targeted persuasion.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of new evaluation metrics that specifically measure an LLM's propensity for potentially harmful personalized persuasion while maintaining its ability to provide helpful personalized responses.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do model parameters like temperature, max tokens, and training data composition influence an LLM's tendency to use personality-targeted persuasive linguistic features?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions this as a limitation, stating "different parameters of the model, such as temperature, the user, or max tokens" could be explored in future research.
- Why unresolved: The study used default model configurations without systematically varying these parameters to understand their impact on persuasive language generation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Controlled experiments varying temperature, max tokens, and other parameters while measuring changes in the frequency and types of personality-targeted persuasive features across different LLM models.

## Limitations
- The study relies on text analysis without human evaluation of actual persuasiveness effectiveness
- LIWC categories may not fully capture nuanced persuasive elements LLMs employ
- Analysis focuses on single-turn interactions rather than dynamic conversations where persuasion typically occurs

## Confidence
- LLM personality-based language adaptation (Medium): Strong statistical evidence but limited behavioral validation
- Family-specific performance differences (Low-Medium): Based on statistical comparisons but may reflect random variation
- Ethical implications of dark patterns (Medium): Mechanistic evidence present but practical impact assessment missing

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation studies to verify that identified linguistic patterns actually increase persuasion effectiveness for target personality types
2. Test the same analysis framework on conversation-based persuasion tasks rather than single-turn responses
3. Replicate findings across different domains and task types to establish generalizability of personality-based linguistic adaptations
