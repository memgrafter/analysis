# Appraisal-Guided Proximal Policy Optimization: Modeling Psychological Disorders in Dynamic Grid World

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.20383
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20383
- Authors: Hari Prasad; Chinnu Jacob; Imthias Ahamed T. P
- Reference count: 7
- Primary result: AG-PPO with motivational relevance reward shaping (RSv1) achieves 0.8003 and 0.7066 scores in GW-A and GW-B environments, outperforming baseline PPO while inducing OCD-like and anxiety-like behaviors.

## Executive Summary
This work introduces Appraisal-Guided Proximal Policy Optimization (AG-PPO), a novel approach that integrates cognitive appraisals into reinforcement learning to simulate emotional behaviors and psychological disorders in agents. The method combines appraisal values with state inputs to the critic network and employs reward shaping strategies to guide agent behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that AG-PPO outperforms standard PPO while successfully inducing disorder-like behaviors such as OCD-like repetitive patterns and anxiety-like edge avoidance, with RSv1 configuration showing the highest generalization performance.

## Method Summary
The AG-PPO algorithm extends standard PPO by incorporating cognitive appraisals (motivational relevance, certainty, novelty, goal congruence, coping potential, and anticipation) into both the critic network input and reward shaping mechanisms. Appraisals are computed at each step and concatenated with state observations before being fed to the critic. The reward shaping module modifies immediate rewards based on different configurations (RSv1-RSv7), each emphasizing different appraisal variables to achieve specific behavioral outcomes. The approach is tested in dynamic grid world environments where agents must navigate around obstacles to reach goals while exhibiting psychologically-informed behaviors.

## Key Results
- RSv1 configuration (motivational relevance focus) achieves highest performance with 0.8003 and 0.7066 scores in GW-A and GW-B environments
- Reward shaping successfully induces OCD-like repetitive behaviors (RSv7-A) and anxiety-like edge-preference avoidance (RSv7-B)
- AG-PPO demonstrates improved generalization capabilities compared to standard PPO across test environments
- Agents exhibit controlled modeling of psychological disorder symptoms while maintaining navigational competence

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Concatenating appraisal values with state inputs enhances the critic's value estimation by providing context about the agent's emotional state.
- Mechanism: The critic network receives both state observations and appraisal variables (motivational relevance, certainty, novelty, etc.) as input. This enriched input allows the critic to better estimate value functions by incorporating the agent's current emotional and motivational context.
- Core assumption: The appraisal values meaningfully represent the agent's psychological state and are relevant to value estimation in the grid world environment.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "integrating these variables into the critic network"
  - [section]: "Appraisal information...is concatenated with state data and provided to the Critic model"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Reward shaping using cognitive appraisals guides the agent toward behaviors that mimic psychological disorders.
- Mechanism: Different reward shaping configurations (RSv1-RSv7) modify the immediate reward signal based on appraisal values. For example, RSv7-A minimizes motivational relevance while increasing coping potential, creating OCD-like repetitive behaviors.
- Core assumption: Manipulating appraisal-based rewards can reliably induce specific behavioral patterns that correspond to psychological disorder symptoms.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "investigated numerous reward-shaping strategies to simulate psychological disorders"
  - [section]: "This approach modifies immediate rewards using cognitive appraisals, guiding the agent's learning and exploration"
  - [section]: "RSv7-A agent shows repetitive behavior patterns resembling OCD symptoms"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The modified PPO framework with appraisal integration improves generalization compared to standard PPO.
- Mechanism: By incorporating appraisals into both the critic input and reward shaping, the agent learns more robust policies that transfer better to unseen environments. The combination of enhanced value estimation and guided exploration through reward shaping leads to better generalization.
- Core assumption: The appraisal-guided modifications provide meaningful information that improves learning efficiency and policy robustness.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "demonstrating controlled modeling of psychological disorder symptoms in agents. The approach improves generalization capabilities compared to standard PPO"
  - [section]: "RSv1 emerges as the top configuration, excelling in both GW-A and GW-B"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cognitive appraisal theory in psychology
  - Why needed here: Understanding how appraisals relate to emotional states is crucial for mapping psychological concepts to computational representations
  - Quick check question: How does motivational relevance appraisal differ from goal congruence appraisal in terms of what they measure?

- Concept: Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm
  - Why needed here: The base algorithm needs to be understood to appreciate how the modifications (appraisals, reward shaping) integrate into the existing framework
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between the standard PPO objective function and the modified version with appraisals?

- Concept: Reward shaping in reinforcement learning
  - Why needed here: The mechanism by which appraisals influence learning behavior depends on understanding how reward modifications affect policy updates
  - Quick check question: How does reward shaping differ from changing the environment's reward function directly?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: State observation → Convolution Block → Appraisal Calculator → Actor/Critic Networks → Action Selection → Environment Step → Reward Calculation → Reward Shaping → Advantage Estimation → Policy Update

- Critical path: The agent processes 7x7 grid observations through convolutional layers, computes six appraisal values, concatenates these with state data for the critic, selects actions via the actor network, receives environment feedback, applies reward shaping, and updates policies through PPO's advantage estimation.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using appraisals increases computational overhead but provides richer context
  - Reward shaping configurations trade off between performance and specific behavioral outcomes
  - The 7x7 view size balances computational efficiency with environmental awareness

- Failure signatures:
  - Agent getting stuck in corners or repetitive loops (reward shaping issues)
  - Poor generalization to test environments (critic input integration problems)
  - High variance in performance across runs (appreciation calculation instability)

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run baseline PPO vs PPO+Appraisal to verify that adding appraisals alone improves performance
  2. Test RSv1 configuration to confirm motivational relevance reward shaping provides the best generalization
  3. Compare RSv7-A and RSv7-B to observe OCD-like vs anxiety-like behavior patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the integration of cognitive appraisals affect the long-term generalization capabilities of RL agents in diverse and unseen environments?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that RSv1, which incorporates motivational relevance, shows superior generalization during training and testing in GW-A and GW-B environments.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on a specific set of environments (GW-A and GW-B) and a limited number of appraisal configurations. The impact of appraisals on generalization in more varied or complex environments is not fully explored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Further experiments testing the AG-PPO algorithm in a broader range of environments, including those with different dynamics, obstacles, and goal configurations, would provide insights into the generalization capabilities of the approach.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the current formulation of cognitive appraisals in AG-PPO be extended to model a wider range of psychological disorders beyond OCD and Anxiety Disorder?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies configurations that simulate OCD-like repetitive behaviors and anxiety-like edge-preference avoidance, but it does not explore other psychological disorders.
- Why unresolved: The study primarily focuses on OCD and Anxiety Disorder, leaving the potential for modeling other disorders unexplored. The formulation of appraisals may need to be adapted or expanded to capture the nuances of different disorders.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the AG-PPO algorithm with different combinations of appraisals and reward-shaping strategies, and analyzing the resulting behaviors for patterns indicative of other disorders, would help determine the approach's versatility.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do the individual components of the cognitive appraisals (motivational relevance, certainty, novelty, goal congruence, coping potential, and anticipation) contribute to the overall performance and behavior of the agent?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper combines multiple appraisals in various configurations (RSv1-7) but does not provide a detailed analysis of the individual contribution of each appraisal.
- Why unresolved: While the paper shows that certain configurations lead to specific behaviors, it does not isolate the effect of each appraisal component on the agent's performance and decision-making process.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting ablation studies where each appraisal component is individually added or removed from the AG-PPO algorithm, and comparing the resulting agent behavior and performance, would clarify the role of each appraisal in shaping the agent's actions.

## Limitations
- Behavioral patterns observed are preliminary demonstrations rather than comprehensive models of complex disorders
- Study focuses on only two psychological conditions without exploring the full spectrum of possible disorder manifestations
- Computational overhead of appraisal integration may limit scalability to larger environments

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The technical implementation of appraisal concatenation to critic input and the basic reward shaping mechanism are well-supported by the results
- **Medium confidence**: The generalization improvements over standard PPO are demonstrated but could benefit from testing across more diverse environments
- **Medium confidence**: The behavioral patterns mimicking psychological disorders are observable but require more rigorous validation to confirm they align with clinical definitions

## Next Checks

1. **Generalization testing**: Evaluate AG-PPO performance across 5+ diverse grid world environments with varying complexity to confirm robustness of generalization claims
2. **Behavioral validation**: Compare simulated OCD/anxiety behaviors against clinical case studies to assess fidelity of disorder modeling
3. **Ablation study**: Systematically disable individual appraisal variables to determine which contribute most significantly to performance improvements and behavioral control
