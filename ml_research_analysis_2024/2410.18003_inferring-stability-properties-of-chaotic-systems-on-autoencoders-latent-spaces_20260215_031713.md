# Inferring stability properties of chaotic systems on autoencoders' latent spaces

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.18003
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18003
- Reference count: 21
- One-line primary result: CAE-ESN accurately infers Lyapunov exponents, Kaplan-Yorke dimension, and covariant Lyapunov vector angles of chaotic systems in low-dimensional latent spaces

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a data-driven approach to infer stability properties of chaotic partial differential equations by combining convolutional autoencoders with echo state networks (CAE-ESN). The method first compresses high-dimensional chaotic system data into a low-dimensional latent space using a convolutional autoencoder, then propagates the temporal dynamics on this latent manifold using an echo state network. Applied to the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, the CAE-ESN successfully forecasts chaotic dynamics and accurately infers invariant stability properties including Lyapunov exponents and Kaplan-Yorke dimension in the latent space. The method also captures the geometric structure of the attractor through covariant Lyapunov vector angles with negligible numerical error.

## Method Summary
The approach combines convolutional autoencoders (CAE) for dimensionality reduction with echo state networks (ESN) for temporal dynamics propagation on the learned latent manifold. The CAE maps high-dimensional physical states to low-dimensional latent representations, preserving essential features of the chaotic attractor. The ESN then evolves these latent states, with its Jacobian defining the tangent space on which stability properties are computed. Lyapunov exponents and covariant Lyapunov vectors are calculated from the ESN dynamics, enabling analysis of chaotic behavior without explicit knowledge of the underlying governing equations.

## Key Results
- CAE-ESN successfully forecasts chaotic dynamics for approximately 2 Lyapunov times
- First 10 Lyapunov exponents are accurately reproduced with minimal numerical error
- Kaplan-Yorke dimension estimated with accuracy within 5·10^-4 of reference values
- Covariant Lyapunov vector angles preserved with Wasserstein distance of 0.001

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The CAE-ESN accurately captures Lyapunov exponents and Kaplan-Yorke dimension in the latent space because the echo state network's Jacobian defines the tangent space of the learned manifold.
- Mechanism: The ESN evolves latent representations y(t) through a fixed random reservoir with trainable output weights. The Jacobian of this system, Jesn(r(t+1)) = (1 - r(t)²)(W^T_in W^T_out + W^T), provides a linearization of the dynamics on the latent manifold. This Jacobian can then be used to compute Lyapunov exponents through standard tangent space methods, directly inferring stability properties from the learned dynamics.
- Core assumption: The learned latent manifold preserves the essential geometric and dynamic properties of the original chaotic attractor, such that stability analysis on the Jacobian yields meaningful results about the true system.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We show that the CAE-ESN model infers the invariant stability properties and the geometry of the tangent space in the low-dimensional manifold"
  - [section 3.2] "The ESN predicts the temporal dynamics on the latent manifold and the Jacobian, therefore, defines the tangent space of the latent manifold"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct corpus support found for this specific mechanism of inferring stability through ESN Jacobians on autoencoded manifolds
- Break condition: If the latent space compression discards critical dynamic information or distorts the attractor geometry, the Jacobian will not accurately represent the true tangent space dynamics, leading to incorrect stability estimates.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The convolutional autoencoder successfully compresses high-dimensional chaotic dynamics into a low-dimensional latent space that preserves the attractor structure.
- Mechanism: The CAE uses convolutional layers to spatially filter and compress the input data u(t) into a latent representation z(t) with dimension N_lat = 8. The encoder E maps the physical state u(t) ∈ R^Nx to the latent space y(t) ∈ R^Nlat, and the decoder D reconstructs the state. By minimizing reconstruction loss L(u, û) = 1/Ntr Σ∥u(t_i) - û(t_i)∥²₂, the CAE learns a manifold that retains essential features of the attractor while discarding redundant information.
- Core assumption: The chaotic attractor of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation can be effectively represented in a much lower-dimensional space (8 dimensions) than the full discretization (512 grid points) while preserving its invariant properties.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1] "The network is trained by minimizing the loss L(u, û) = 1/Ntr Σ∥u(t_i) - û(t_i)∥²₂"
  - [section 4] "The CAE-ESNs correctly reproduce the first 10 LEs, which correspond to the physical behaviour of the system"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus lacks specific evidence about CAE's ability to preserve attractor geometry in this context
- Break condition: If the latent dimension is too small, essential dynamic features will be lost; if too large, the benefit of dimensionality reduction is diminished and overfitting may occur.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The echo state network successfully propagates temporal dynamics on the latent manifold with accuracy sufficient for stability analysis.
- Mechanism: The ESN uses fixed random reservoir matrices Win and W with only the output matrix W_out trained via ridge regression. This allows fast training without backpropagation while still capturing complex temporal dependencies. The network operates in closed-loop mode after training, autonomously evolving the latent states using its own predictions as input.
- Core assumption: The random reservoir with proper scaling and regularization can capture the essential temporal dynamics of the chaotic system when combined with appropriate output training.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2] "the ESN training is performed by solving for W_out using ridge regression, speeding up the training by avoiding backpropagation"
  - [section 4] "the CAE-ESN accurately forecasts the evolution for about 2LT"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus lacks specific evidence about ESN's effectiveness for chaotic dynamics in this autoencoded context
- Break condition: If the reservoir properties (spectral radius, sparsity) are not properly tuned, the ESN may fail to capture the chaotic dynamics or become unstable, leading to divergence from the true attractor.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Lyapunov Exponents and Chaotic Dynamics
  - Why needed here: Understanding that chaotic systems are characterized by exponential sensitivity to initial conditions, quantified by Lyapunov exponents, is crucial for interpreting the results and knowing what stability properties to measure
  - Quick check question: What does a positive Lyapunov exponent indicate about a dynamical system's behavior?

- Concept: Autoencoder Architecture and Training
  - Why needed here: The convolutional autoencoder's role in dimensionality reduction and its training objective directly affects the quality of the latent representation used for stability analysis
  - Quick check question: How does the reconstruction loss function influence what information the autoencoder preserves in the latent space?

- Concept: Echo State Networks and Reservoir Computing
  - Why needed here: Understanding how ESNs work with fixed reservoirs and trained outputs is essential for implementing the temporal dynamics propagation and interpreting the resulting stability properties
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between training an ESN and training a traditional recurrent neural network?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: u(t) ∈ R^Nx -> CAE Encoder E -> y(t) ∈ R^Nlat -> ESN -> y(t) -> CAE Decoder D -> û(t) ∈ R^Nx
- Critical path: Data -> CAE training (minimize reconstruction loss) -> ESN training on latent representations (solve for W_out via ridge regression) -> Autonomous prediction in closed-loop mode -> Jacobian calculation from ESN dynamics -> Lyapunov exponent and CLV computation -> Validation against reference system
- Design tradeoffs: The choice of latent dimension (8) balances compression against information retention; smaller dimensions risk losing dynamic features while larger ones reduce computational benefits. The ESN's random reservoir provides fast training but requires careful spectral radius tuning to ensure echo state property while maintaining stability.
- Failure signatures: Poor CAE reconstruction indicates insufficient latent dimension or inadequate architecture. ESN predictions that diverge rapidly suggest reservoir properties are poorly tuned. Lyapunov exponents that don't match reference values indicate the latent space doesn't preserve essential dynamics.
- First 3 experiments: 1) Train CAE with varying latent dimensions (4, 8, 16) and measure reconstruction error to find optimal compression. 2) Train ESN with different spectral radii and regularization parameters to optimize prediction horizon. 3) Compare computed Lyapunov exponents with reference values to validate stability analysis accuracy.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Open Question 1: How does the performance of CAE-ESN stability inference scale with increasing system complexity and dimensionality?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on a relatively simple chaotic PDE (Kuramoto-Sivashinsky) with specific parameters, but doesn't explore performance on more complex systems
  - Why unresolved: The paper only demonstrates the method on one specific chaotic system (KS equation with L=22) without exploring how well it generalizes to higher-dimensional or more complex chaotic systems
  - What evidence would resolve it: Systematic testing of CAE-ESN on increasingly complex chaotic systems (e.g., higher-dimensional KS, coupled map lattices, or other turbulent PDEs) with varying levels of nonlinearity and degrees of freedom

- Open Question 2: What is the optimal balance between autoencoder compression ratio and stability property accuracy?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using Nlat=8 for a system where the Kaplan-Yorke dimension is 6.007, but doesn't systematically explore how compression affects stability inference
  - Why unresolved: The paper uses a fixed latent dimension of 8 without exploring the trade-off between compression and accuracy of stability properties, or determining the minimum latent dimension needed to capture essential dynamics
  - What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study varying latent dimensions and quantifying the impact on Lyapunov exponent accuracy, Kaplan-Yorke dimension estimation, and CLV angle preservation

- Open Question 3: How sensitive are the inferred stability properties to hyperparameters in the CAE-ESN architecture?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using Bayesian optimization for finding σin but doesn't explore sensitivity to other architectural choices
  - Why unresolved: While the paper shows successful results with specific hyperparameters, it doesn't analyze how sensitive the stability properties are to changes in network architecture, training parameters, or reservoir size
  - What evidence would resolve it: Sensitivity analysis varying network depths, filter sizes, reservoir sizes, and training parameters to determine robustness of stability property inference to architectural choices

## Limitations
- The method's generalizability to other chaotic systems with different attractor geometries and dimensionality remains uncertain
- Specific architecture choices were optimized for the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and may not transfer to different systems
- The approach depends critically on the autoencoder's ability to preserve essential dynamical features during compression

## Confidence

- High confidence: The CAE-ESN accurately forecasts chaotic dynamics for ~2 Lyapunov times and reproduces the first 10 Lyapunov exponents for the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation
- Medium confidence: The geometric structure of covariant Lyapunov vectors is preserved with negligible numerical error, as this requires precise alignment of tangent space structures
- Low confidence: Generalizability to other chaotic systems with different attractor geometries and dimensionality

## Next Checks

1. Apply the CAE-ESN approach to a different chaotic PDE (e.g., Lorenz-96 or Navier-Stokes turbulence) to test generalizability of the method and identify system-specific requirements for latent space dimensionality and ESN parameters.

2. Systematically vary the latent dimension from 4 to 16 and measure degradation in Lyapunov exponent accuracy and forecast horizon to establish theoretical bounds on information loss during compression.

3. Compare Lyapunov exponents computed from the ESN Jacobian with those obtained through direct numerical integration of tangent space equations for the same latent trajectory to validate the accuracy of the stability analysis approach.
