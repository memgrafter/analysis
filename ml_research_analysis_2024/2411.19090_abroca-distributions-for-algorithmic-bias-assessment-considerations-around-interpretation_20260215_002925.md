# ABROCA Distributions For Algorithmic Bias Assessment: Considerations Around Interpretation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.19090
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19090
- Authors: Conrad Borchers; Ryan S. Baker
- Reference count: 21
- This paper demonstrates that ABROCA distributions are highly skewed, particularly when groups and outcomes are imbalanced, complicating its use for algorithmic bias assessment.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the statistical properties of the ABROCA metric, which measures algorithmic bias by comparing Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves between majority and minority groups. Through extensive simulations, the authors find that ABROCA distributions exhibit high skewness dependent on sample sizes, AUC differences, and class imbalance. The skewness inflates ABROCA values by chance, even when data is drawn from populations with equivalent ROC curves. These findings suggest that ABROCA requires careful interpretation given its distributional properties, especially when used to assess the degree of bias and when classes are imbalanced.

## Method Summary
The study uses a simulation framework that generates synthetic data with specified AUC differences between groups, trains logistic regression models on 80% of the data, and computes ABROCA metrics on the remaining 20%. This process is repeated 1,000 times per parameter setting to build distributions of ABROCA values. The simulations systematically vary total sample size, minority group AUC values, and class imbalances to understand how these factors affect ABROCA distribution properties including median, confidence intervals, and skewness.

## Key Results
- ABROCA distributions exhibit high skewness dependent on sample sizes, AUC differences, and class imbalance
- ABROCA is skewed toward higher values for more similar AUCs and smaller sample sizes
- ABROCA skew is particularly large when group and outcome classes are imbalanced

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: ABROCA converges to the difference between AUCs for larger samples when true group-level AUCs differ
- Mechanism: With increasing sample size, random fluctuations in ROC curves diminish, and ABROCA estimates stabilize around the true population AUC difference
- Core assumption: The only difference between groups is their AUC values (no crossover points in population ROC curves)
- Break condition: If population ROC curves have genuine crossover points, ABROCA will not converge to AUC difference

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: ABROCA is skewed toward higher values when ROC curves are similar and sample sizes are small
- Mechanism: When AUCs are close, ROC curves are more likely to randomly cross by chance, creating spuriously large ABROCA values
- Core assumption: Similar AUC values imply similar population ROC curves with high probability of random crossing
- Break condition: If true population ROC curves have genuine differences beyond AUC, skew pattern changes

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: ABROCA skew is exacerbated by class imbalance in both outcome and group membership
- Mechanism: Imbalanced classes reduce effective sample size for minority classes, amplifying random fluctuations in ROC curve estimation
- Core assumption: Class imbalance reduces the reliability of performance estimates for minority classes
- Break condition: If imbalance is severe enough to prevent reliable estimation for both classes

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve interpretation
  - Why needed here: ABROCA is fundamentally based on differences between ROC curves, so understanding ROC curves is essential
  - Quick check question: What does the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) represent in binary classification?

- Concept: Statistical sampling distributions and confidence intervals
  - Why needed here: The paper extensively discusses how ABROCA distributions behave under different sampling conditions
  - Quick check question: Why do smaller sample sizes typically lead to wider confidence intervals?

- Concept: Class imbalance in machine learning
  - Why needed here: The paper shows how class imbalance affects ABROCA interpretation, which is common in educational prediction tasks
  - Quick check question: How does class imbalance affect the reliability of performance metrics in binary classification?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data generation -> Model training -> ABROCA computation -> Distribution analysis
- Critical path: Data generation → Model training → ABROCA computation → Distribution analysis
- Design tradeoffs: Simple univariate normal simulation vs. complex multivariate data; logistic regression vs. more sophisticated models
- Failure signatures: Skewed ABROCA distributions with long upper tails; ABROCA values significantly larger than AUC differences; high variance in estimates
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Replicate the equal AUC simulation (both groups AUC=0.8) to observe the skew in ABROCA distribution
  2. Vary the minority group AUC systematically (0.79, 0.75, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5) while keeping majority at 0.8 to observe convergence patterns
  3. Test class imbalance scenarios (90% vs 50% positive class) to reproduce the increased skew observed in imbalanced conditions

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do preprocessing techniques (e.g., stratification, minority class oversampling) impact ABROCA distributions?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that while preprocessing techniques could address class imbalance, they do not employ them for simplicity, leaving their impact on ABROCA distributions for future work.
- Why unresolved: The study intentionally avoids preprocessing techniques to focus on ABROCA's inherent distributional properties, making it unclear how these methods would affect ABROCA results.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical simulations applying preprocessing techniques to imbalanced datasets and comparing resulting ABROCA distributions to baseline scenarios.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How reliable are individual crossover points in ROC curves for detecting algorithmic bias using ABROCA?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors suggest that future research could study individual crossover points where ROC curves intersect, as this aspect is a unique strength of ABROCA but not explored in depth.
- Why unresolved: The current study focuses on overall ABROCA distributions and does not assess the reliability or statistical significance of specific crossover regions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Analysis of the statistical significance and variability of individual crossover points across multiple simulations, including confidence intervals for their locations.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do real-world data distributions and modeling conditions (e.g., missing data, selection effects) affect ABROCA’s distributional properties?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors acknowledge that their simulations assume normally distributed variables and single AUC values per subgroup, which may not reflect real-world complexities like missing data or selection effects.
- Why unresolved: The study uses simplified assumptions to isolate ABROCA’s properties, but real-world data often deviates from these conditions.
- What evidence would resolve it: Simulations using real-world datasets or bootstrapped distributions that incorporate missing data, selection effects, and multivariate features to compare ABROCA results with the current study.

## Limitations

- The study is based entirely on simulated data using logistic regression on normally distributed features, limiting generalizability to real-world educational datasets
- The analysis assumes logistic regression as the model choice without exploring how different algorithms might affect ABROCA distributions
- The simulation framework uses simple univariate normal distributions, which may not capture the complexity of real educational data with multiple correlated features

## Confidence

**High confidence** in the core observation that ABROCA distributions exhibit skew dependent on sample size and AUC differences, as this follows directly from statistical theory about sampling distributions. **Medium confidence** in the specific quantitative findings about skew magnitude and convergence patterns, given they are simulation-based. **Medium confidence** in the implications for bias assessment practice, as real-world applications may differ from simulation conditions.

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical validation**: Apply ABROCA analysis to real educational datasets with known bias patterns to verify simulation findings hold in practice
2. **Model sensitivity**: Test whether different classification algorithms (random forests, neural networks) produce similar ABROCA distribution patterns
3. **Feature complexity**: Extend simulations to multivariate normal distributions with correlated features to assess robustness to more realistic data structures
