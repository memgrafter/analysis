# Improving Speech Emotion Recognition in Under-Resourced Languages via Speech-to-Speech Translation with Bootstrapping Data Selection

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.10985
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10985
- Reference count: 40
- Improves SER F1 scores by up to 11 points on underperforming datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of building robust speech emotion recognition (SER) systems for under-resourced languages by leveraging large-scale datasets from high-resource languages. The core method involves using expressive Speech-to-Speech translation (S2ST) to translate speech from a high-resource language into the target language, combined with a bootstrapping data selection pipeline to iteratively select the most beneficial translated data for training. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent performance improvements across different upstream models and languages, with F1 score improvements of up to 11 points on underperforming datasets. The method proves effective even for multilingual and paralinguistic-aware pretrained models, highlighting its generalizability and potential for scalable multilingual SER systems.

## Method Summary
The proposed method leverages expressive S2ST to translate large-scale speech datasets from high-resource languages into target languages, creating synthetic emotional speech data. A novel bootstrapping data selection pipeline then iteratively filters this synthesized data using KL divergence-based selection criteria, keeping only samples that match the target distribution. The final training combines the selected synthetic data with the small target dataset to train an SER model. The approach uses Seamless Expressive for translation, which preserves paralinguistic features through an expressivity encoder, and implements a two-iteration bootstrapping process to balance performance gains with computational efficiency.

## Key Results
- F1 score improvements of up to 11 points on underperforming datasets
- Consistent improvements across different upstream models including WavLM, XLS-R, and emotion2vec
- Effectiveness demonstrated for both multilingual and paralinguistic-aware pretrained models
- Bootstrapping selection consistently outperforms naive use of all translated data

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Expressive speech-to-speech translation preserves paralinguistic emotional cues that are essential for emotion recognition.
- Mechanism: The Seamless Expressive S2ST model uses an expressivity encoder to guide the generation of speech units, ensuring appropriate rhythm, speaking rate, and pauses. These prosodic features are critical carriers of emotional information.
- Core assumption: Emotional information is primarily conveyed through paralinguistic details in speech rather than just lexical content.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "employs expressive Speech-to-Speech translation (S2ST) combined with a novel bootstrapping data selection pipeline"
  - [section II-B] "Seamless Expressive is built upon SeamlessM4T-Large v2 as its foundational model and integrates an expressivity encoder to guide the generation of speech units, ensuring appropriate rhythm, speaking rate, and pauses"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors don't directly address paralinguistic preservation in translation
- Break condition: If the expressivity encoder fails to capture or transfer paralinguistic features, the translated speech would lose critical emotional information, making the synthetic data ineffective for emotion recognition.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Bootstrapping data selection iteratively improves the quality of synthetic training data by selecting samples that match the target distribution.
- Mechanism: The bootstrapping process uses a selection criterion based on KL divergence between model predictions and soft labels to iteratively filter synthesized data, keeping only samples that the model can predict accurately.
- Core assumption: Correctly predicted samples by the current model are more likely to come from a distribution similar to the target dataset.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "combined with a novel bootstrapping data selection pipeline to generate labeled data in the target language"
  - [section II-D] "We hypothesize that the performance drop observed when naively using all Dsyn is due to a domain discrepancy between Dtgt and Dsyn"
  - [corpus] Weak - corpus neighbors don't specifically address iterative data selection for speech emotion recognition
- Break condition: If the selection criterion becomes too restrictive or the model's predictions are systematically biased, the bootstrapping process could eliminate useful data or converge to a suboptimal subset.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Large-scale high-resource datasets can effectively transfer emotional knowledge to under-resourced languages through translation.
- Mechanism: By translating a large English/Chinese dataset into target languages, the method creates a synthetic dataset that provides diverse emotional examples that would otherwise be unavailable in low-resource languages.
- Core assumption: Emotional expressions have cross-linguistic similarities that can be captured through translation, allowing knowledge transfer between languages.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "by leveraging large-scale datasets from high-resource languages"
  - [section I] "Several approaches have been investigated to address this problem, which can be broadly categorized into three groups: transfer learning, domain adaptation, and data augmentation"
  - [section IV-A] "Our experiments include models pretrained in English or multilingual settings and models pretrained for prosody or emotion awareness. The consistent improvements demonstrate the generalizability of our method across various types of upstream models"
- Break condition: If emotional expressions are too culturally specific or language-dependent, the translated data might not capture the target language's emotional nuances, limiting the effectiveness of knowledge transfer.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Speech emotion recognition fundamentals
  - Why needed here: Understanding how emotions are represented in speech features is crucial for designing effective emotion recognition systems and evaluating the quality of synthetic data
  - Quick check question: What are the primary acoustic features used to distinguish between angry and happy emotional states in speech?

- Concept: Self-supervised learning in speech processing
  - Why needed here: The upstream models used (WavLM, XLS-R, etc.) are pretrained using self-supervised learning, which is essential for understanding their capabilities and limitations
  - Quick check question: How do models like WavLM learn meaningful speech representations without labeled data?

- Concept: Speech-to-speech translation pipeline
  - Why needed here: Understanding how S2ST systems work, particularly the role of expressivity encoders, is crucial for implementing and debugging the data synthesis component
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of a textless speech-to-speech translation system and how do they interact?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Source dataset → S2ST translation → Language filtering → Bootstrapping selection → Synthetic dataset → SER training → Evaluation

- Critical path: Source dataset → S2ST translation → Language filtering → Bootstrapping selection → Synthetic dataset → SER training → Evaluation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Expressivity vs. translation quality: More expressive translation might introduce artifacts
  - Selection strictness: Too strict filtering might eliminate useful data; too lenient might include poor-quality samples
  - Number of bootstrapping iterations: More iterations increase quality but also computational cost

- Failure signatures:
  - Performance degradation when adding synthetic data indicates poor translation quality or ineffective selection
  - High variance across seeds suggests sensitivity to initialization or small target dataset issues
  - Consistent improvement across all languages suggests the method is working as intended

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline: Train SER model on target dataset alone to establish performance floor
  2. Full method: Apply the complete pipeline with default settings to verify overall effectiveness
  3. Ablation: Remove the expressivity component from S2ST to quantify its importance in the pipeline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we develop an adaptive strategy to dynamically determine the optimal number of iterations for bootstrapping in the data selection process?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that while 2 iterations achieve a good balance between performance and training time, the optimal number may vary depending on upstream models and target datasets, and there's a significant gap between fixed iterations and oracle results.
- Why unresolved: The current approach uses a fixed number of iterations (2 by default), but this may not be optimal across different scenarios, as evidenced by the gap between fixed iterations and oracle results in experiments.
- What evidence would resolve it: A method that can dynamically determine when to stop bootstrapping based on convergence metrics or performance plateau indicators would resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can we develop a data synthesis pipeline that doesn't require soft labels from the source dataset?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that achieving the highest performance gains requires access to soft labels from the source SER dataset, which limits the applicability of the method.
- Why unresolved: The current method's effectiveness is significantly reduced when only one-hot labels are available for the source dataset, as the selection criterion based on KL divergence cannot be applied.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified selection criterion or data synthesis approach that maintains effectiveness with only one-hot labels would resolve this question.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the expressiveness of the source language affect the quality of synthesized emotional speech data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper observes that switching from an English dataset (MSP-Podcast) to a Chinese dataset (BIIC-Podcast) as the source dataset generally leads to performance degradation, suggesting that more expressive languages may be preferable.
- Why unresolved: While the paper hypothesizes that Chinese may be less expressive and that subtle paralinguistic cues may be harder for the S2ST to capture, the relationship between source language expressiveness and synthesized data quality is not fully explored.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments comparing different source languages with varying levels of expressiveness, along with analysis of the synthesized data quality, would resolve this question.

## Limitations
- Cross-lingual emotional transfer validity remains unverified - the method assumes emotional expressions transfer effectively between languages through translation
- Data selection sensitivity to threshold choices and model initialization could lead to suboptimal results
- Limited evaluation to four basic emotion categories in acted speech corpora, not tested on nuanced emotional states or naturalistic speech

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core experimental methodology and reproducibility of results
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of the expressive S2ST component
- **Low confidence**: The scalability of the approach to truly low-resource scenarios

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a human evaluation study comparing the emotional prosody in translated speech samples versus original speech to verify that the expressivity encoder preserves emotional intensity and authenticity across languages.
2. Systematically vary the KL divergence threshold and selection strictness parameters across multiple runs to determine the sensitivity of the bootstrapping method to hyperparameter choices.
3. Apply the same methodology to related paralinguistic tasks (speaker emotion intensity prediction, valence/arousal estimation) to verify whether the approach generalizes beyond discrete emotion classification.
