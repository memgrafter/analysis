# StiefelGen: A Simple, Model Agnostic Approach for Time Series Data Augmentation over Riemannian Manifolds

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.19287
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19287
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Introduces StiefelGen, a model-agnostic approach for time series augmentation using Stiefel manifold geometry, demonstrating consistent accuracy improvements across diverse applications

## Executive Summary
This paper presents StiefelGen, a novel approach for time series data augmentation that leverages the geometry of Stiefel manifolds. The method provides a simple way to place time series signals on, and smoothly perturb them over the manifold, offering control over aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Key advantages include minimal hyperparameter requirements, simplicity in implementation, interpretability, and model-agnostic nature. By smoothly perturbing signals along geodesic paths on the Stiefel manifold, StiefelGen can generate both augmented data instances for enhancing model training and outlier examples for robustness analysis.

## Method Summary
StiefelGen generates time series augmentations by decomposing signals into U, Σ, V components via SVD, then perturbing the U and V matrices along geodesic paths on the Stiefel manifold. For univariate signals, a page matrix is constructed by reshaping the signal, while multivariate signals can be stacked directly. The method uses tangent space projection and exponential map retraction to move along geodesics, with perturbation scale controlled by β as a percentage of the radius of injectivity (0.89π). The choice of page matrix dimensions (m,n) determines whether augmented signals emphasize noise or basis changes.

## Key Results
- Consistently outperforms vanilla models in accuracy across diverse applications including structural health monitoring, uncertainty quantification, and dynamic mode decomposition
- Demonstrates control over aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty through page matrix dimension selection
- Requires only one hyperparameter (β) and no training, making it simple to implement and interpret

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: StiefelGen generates time series augmentations by perturbing the U and V matrices from the SVD decomposition along geodesic paths on the Stiefel manifold.
- Mechanism: The SVD decomposes a time series page matrix into U, Σ, V. Since U and V are orthonormal (lie on Stiefel manifolds), they can be smoothly perturbed along geodesics without leaving the manifold. This preserves the signal energy while changing the basis representation.
- Core assumption: Perturbing U and V along geodesics maintains signal realism while generating meaningful variations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The method relies upon the well-studied matrix differential geometry of the Stiefel manifold, as it proposes a simple way in which time series signals can placed on, and then smoothly perturbed over the manifold."
  - [section 2.2]: "Given that both U1, V1 ∈ Stm n, it is possible to perturb these matrices to a new set of matrices so that U1 → U2, and similarly, V1 → V2."
- Break condition: If perturbation scales beyond the radius of injectivity (0.89π), the exponential map may no longer be valid and signals may become unrealistic.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The choice of page matrix dimensions (m,n) controls whether generated signals emphasize noise (aleatoric) or basis changes (epistemic).
- Mechanism: The SVD separates row and column spaces. A tall-skinny page matrix (m > n) emphasizes the U matrix (column space) which contains more noise-like information. A short-fat page matrix (n > m) emphasizes the V matrix (row space) which contains more structured basis information.
- Core assumption: The SVD naturally separates noise and basis information in the row and column spaces respectively.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.2]: "Notice that if one is working with a set of multivariate signals, then there is no need to even select an m or n as this can be pre-determined by the stacking of the multivariate signals"
- Break condition: If the page matrix dimensions are poorly chosen relative to the signal characteristics, the separation of noise and basis information may be ineffective.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: StiefelGen's minimal hyperparameters (only β) and lack of training make it simple to implement and interpret.
- Mechanism: The only required hyperparameter is β, which controls perturbation scale as a percentage of the radius of injectivity. No training is needed since the method uses deterministic geometric operations on the SVD components.
- Core assumption: The simplicity of requiring only one hyperparameter and no training makes the method accessible and interpretable.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Key advantages include minimal hyperparameter requirements, simplicity in implementation, interpretability, and model-agnostic nature."
  - [section 2.2]: "The only technically required hyper parameter is β, which describes how far towards the injectivity radius one intends to move."
- Break condition: If more complex control over augmentation is needed, the single hyperparameter may be insufficient.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Riemannian geometry and manifolds
  - Why needed here: Understanding how to work with curved spaces and geodesic paths is essential for StiefelGen's core mechanism.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a Euclidean space and a Riemannian manifold?

- Concept: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
  - Why needed here: SVD is the fundamental operation that decomposes the time series into components that can be perturbed on the Stiefel manifold.
  - Quick check question: What are the properties of the U and V matrices from an SVD?

- Concept: Tangent spaces and exponential maps
  - Why needed here: These concepts allow StiefelGen to move from the current point on the manifold to a new perturbed point along a geodesic.
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between a tangent vector and a geodesic on a manifold?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Time series signal -> Page matrix construction -> SVD decomposition -> Tangent space projection -> Exponential map retraction -> Optional smoothing filter -> Augmented time series signal

- Critical path: Page matrix -> SVD -> Tangent space projection -> Exponential map -> Reshaped signal

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Simplicity vs. control: Single hyperparameter β provides ease of use but may limit fine-tuning
  - Speed vs. accuracy: Using the exponential map is faster than numerical integration but requires staying within the radius of injectivity
  - Generality vs. specificity: Model-agnostic approach works broadly but may not optimize for specific domains

- Failure signatures:
  - Signals becoming unrealistic or noisy when β approaches 1
  - Poor augmentation quality when page matrix dimensions don't match signal characteristics
  - Computational issues when working with very large matrices

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Apply StiefelGen with β=0.1 to a simple sinusoidal signal and visualize the augmented output
  2. Compare tall-skinny vs. short-fat page matrix constructions on the same signal to observe noise vs. basis emphasis
  3. Use StiefelGen to augment a univariate signal and train an LSTM classifier to verify accuracy improvement

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the optimal value of the α parameter in the generalized α-metric for different time series augmentation tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions the α-metric as a recent development and shows preliminary results comparing α = -0.5 (Euclidean) and α = 0 (canonical) metrics.
- Why unresolved: The paper only provides a brief comparison of two specific α values. It acknowledges that the choice of α impacts the perturbation behavior but does not systematically explore the parameter space or provide guidelines for selecting α based on the specific characteristics of the time series data or augmentation task.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive study varying α across a range of values for different types of time series data and augmentation scenarios, evaluating the quality of the generated signals and their impact on downstream tasks like classification accuracy.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the choice of page matrix dimensions (m and n) impact the quality and diversity of the generated time series signals?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the effect of page matrix dimensions on the type of signal generated (noise-oriented vs. basis-oriented) but does not provide a systematic analysis of how different choices of m and n affect the overall quality and diversity of the augmented dataset.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides examples showing the impact of extreme values of m and n but does not explore the full parameter space or provide guidelines for selecting these dimensions based on the characteristics of the input time series or the desired properties of the augmented dataset.
- What evidence would resolve it: An empirical study varying m and n across a range of values for different types of time series data, evaluating the diversity and representativeness of the generated signals using metrics like signal-to-noise ratio, entropy, and spectral characteristics.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can StiefelGen be adapted to handle multivariate time series with varying lengths and sampling rates?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the handling of multivariate time series by stacking them into a matrix format, but does not address the challenges posed by varying lengths and sampling rates across different signals.
- Why unresolved: The current implementation assumes that all time series in the multivariate stack have the same length and sampling rate, which may not be the case in real-world applications. The paper does not provide a clear strategy for dealing with this variability or discuss the potential impact on the quality of the generated signals.
- What evidence would resolve it: A method for preprocessing multivariate time series with varying lengths and sampling rates, such as interpolation, resampling, or alignment techniques, followed by an evaluation of the impact of these preprocessing steps on the quality of the augmented dataset and the performance of downstream tasks.

## Limitations
- Dependence on SVD decomposition quality, which can be sensitive to noise and signal-to-noise ratio
- Geometric constraints from the radius of injectivity (0.89π) on the Stiefel manifold, limiting perturbation range
- Page matrix dimension selection requires domain knowledge and may be ineffective for poorly chosen dimensions

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The core mechanism of using Stiefel manifold geometry for time series perturbation is mathematically sound and well-supported by the SVD decomposition properties
- Medium Confidence: The claims about control over aleatoric vs. epistemic uncertainty through page matrix dimension selection are plausible but require more extensive empirical validation
- Low Confidence: The broad applicability claims across diverse domains are based on limited experimental evidence and need more comprehensive testing

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a sensitivity analysis testing how StiefelGen performance varies with different page matrix dimensions (m,n) across signals with varying noise levels and structures
2. Identify practical limits of β values before signal realism degrades and test alternative manifold retraction methods beyond the exponential map
3. Apply StiefelGen to a broader set of time series domains and compare augmentation quality against established methods to validate wide applicability claims
