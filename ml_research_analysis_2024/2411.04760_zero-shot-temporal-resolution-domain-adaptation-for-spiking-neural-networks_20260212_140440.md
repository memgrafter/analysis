# Zero-Shot Temporal Resolution Domain Adaptation for Spiking Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.04760
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04760
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Three novel methods enable zero-shot temporal resolution adaptation for SNNs, significantly outperforming baselines on audio and neuromorphic vision datasets

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical challenge in spiking neural networks (SNNs): performance degradation when deployed on data with different temporal resolution than training data. The authors propose three novel domain adaptation methods (Integral, Expectation, and Euler) based on mapping SNN neuron dynamics to State Space Models (SSMs). These methods adapt neuron parameters without retraining, enabling zero-shot adaptation. Evaluated on SHD, MSWC, and NMNIST datasets, the methods significantly outperform baseline approaches, especially in coarse-to-fine scenarios. The results demonstrate that high accuracy on high-resolution data can be achieved by efficient training on lower-resolution data followed by model adaptation, supporting time- and energy-efficient SNN training pipelines.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces three zero-shot temporal resolution adaptation methods for SNNs by establishing a mapping between SNN neuron dynamics and State Space Models (SSMs). The methods leverage discretization techniques from SSM theory (Integral, Expectation, and Euler methods) to adjust neuron parameters when temporal resolution changes. The adaptation is applied to the state transition matrix (A) and input matrices (B) of the SNN's SSM representation, preserving the expected state evolution across different temporal resolutions. Additionally, the paper addresses normalization layer adaptation by scaling mean and variance statistics based on the sum-binning transformation applied to the data. The methods are evaluated on adaptive LIF (adLIF) and recurrent adaptive LIF (RadLIF) neurons across audio (SHD, MSWC) and neuromorphic vision (NMNIST) datasets.

## Key Results
- The proposed Integral, Expectation, and Euler adaptation methods significantly outperform baseline approaches (no adaptation, time-constant scaling) across all tested scenarios
- Coarse-to-fine adaptation shows the largest improvements, with Integral and Expectation methods achieving up to 6% accuracy gains on MSWC dataset
- Time-efficient training pipeline demonstrated: training on lower temporal resolution data (b=10) followed by adaptation achieves comparable accuracy to high-resolution training while being ~7x faster
- RadLIF neurons show better baseline performance but adLIF neurons demonstrate more robust adaptation behavior across different temporal resolutions

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The mapping between SNN neuron dynamics and State Space Models (SSMs) enables zero-shot temporal resolution adaptation by preserving the internal state variable dynamics.
- Mechanism: By approximating SNNs as linear SSMs (despite their nonlinear nature), the proposed Integral, Expectation, and Euler methods adjust the state transition matrix (A) and input matrices (B) to maintain consistent expected state evolution across different temporal resolutions.
- Core assumption: The SNN neuron dynamics can be adequately approximated by linear SSM dynamics for the purpose of temporal resolution adaptation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The proposed methods are based on a mapping between neuron dynamics in SNNs and State Space Models (SSMs)"
  - [section 4.2]: "we propose an approximate correspondence between the general SNN neuron model and linear SSMs"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus papers don't directly address the SSM-SNN correspondence mechanism
- Break condition: If the nonlinear spiking behavior (threshold crossing) becomes dominant in the neuron dynamics, the linear SSM approximation breaks down and adaptation accuracy degrades.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Normalization layer adaptation using scaled mean and variance compensates for feature space shifts caused by temporal resolution changes.
- Mechanism: When data resolution changes through sum-binning, the mean scales linearly with bin size and variance scales quadratically, so normalization statistics are adjusted accordingly to maintain proper feature scaling.
- Core assumption: Data statistics under sum-binning transformations follow predictable scaling patterns that can be analytically derived.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 6.1]: "under i.i.d. xi, we have µT = E[x'i] = E[Σj xi+j] = ρ E[xi] = ρµS, and σ²T = var(x'i) = var(Σj xi+j) = ρ²var(xi) = ρ²σ²S"
  - [section 4.4]: "Assume that the elements of the matrices Hk,(S) for k = v, s, f, r belong to one of three groups"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus papers don't address normalization layer adaptation for temporal resolution shifts
- Break condition: If data elements are not independent or the binning process introduces correlations that violate the i.i.d. assumption, the scaling relationships break down.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Training on lower temporal resolution data followed by model adaptation provides time-efficient training without sacrificing accuracy on high-resolution inference.
- Mechanism: Lower resolution data reduces backpropagation sequence length, decreasing training time, while model adaptation compensates for the resolution difference to recover high-resolution performance.
- Core assumption: The temporal information lost during coarse resolution training can be effectively recovered through parameter adaptation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Moreover, our results show that high accuracy on high temporal resolution data can be obtained by time efficient training on lower temporal resolution data and model adaptation"
  - [section 5.6]: "we obtain an accuracy of 93.8% instead of the baseline performance of 92.4% while training 106/15 ≈ 7 times faster"
  - [corpus]: Weak - corpus papers don't demonstrate this specific time-efficient training pipeline
- Break condition: If the resolution difference is too large, the information lost during coarse training cannot be fully recovered through adaptation.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: State Space Models (SSMs) and their discretization methods
  - Why needed here: The proposed adaptation methods are derived from continuous-to-discrete SSM conversion techniques (Integral, Euler, Expectation methods)
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between the Integral and Euler discretization methods for SSMs?

- Concept: SNN neuron dynamics and membrane potential decay
  - Why needed here: Understanding how membrane potential parameters (α, β) depend on temporal resolution is crucial for grasping why adaptation is needed
  - Quick check question: How does the membrane potential decay parameter α change when temporal resolution doubles?

- Concept: Batch normalization and its adaptation to data transformations
  - Why needed here: The paper adapts normalization layers when temporal resolution changes, requiring understanding of how data statistics transform
  - Quick check question: Under sum-binning with bin size ρ, how do the mean and variance of the data transform?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input → BatchNorm → SNN Layer (adLIF or RadLIF) → Output, with adaptation applied to SNN parameters and first BN layer
- Critical path: Data preprocessing (binning) → Model adaptation (parameter scaling) → Inference, with optional BN adaptation
- Design tradeoffs: Model adaptation vs. input adaptation (processing time vs. accuracy), recurrent vs. non-recurrent neurons (complexity vs. adaptation performance)
- Failure signatures: Significant accuracy drop when source and target resolutions differ greatly, poor performance with recurrent neurons under adaptation, normalization mismatch
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test model adaptation methods on single neuron synthetic data to verify membrane potential dynamics preservation
  2. Evaluate baseline performance across different temporal resolutions on SHD dataset
  3. Implement Coarse-to-Fine adaptation on MSWC dataset comparing all three proposed methods

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed method perform when adapting SNN parameters for temporal resolution changes beyond simple sum-binning transformations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions investigating various input transformations including binary sum-binning, max-pooling, pad-zeros, and repeat-elements, but primarily focuses on sum-binning scenarios.
- Why unresolved: The evaluation in Section 6.2 explores input adaptation for different transformations, but the performance of the proposed parameter adaptation methods (Integral, Expectation, Euler) is only demonstrated for sum-binning scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing the effectiveness of the proposed parameter adaptation methods when applied to SNNs trained on data transformed using max-pooling, zero-padding, or repeat-element methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of temporal resolution adaptation on SNN performance when applied to more complex neuron models beyond the adaptive LIF (adLIF) and recurrent adaptive LIF (RadLIF) models?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates the methods on adLIF and RadLIF models, but notes that the proposed methods can be applied to any SNN neuron model, suggesting potential applicability to more complex models.
- Why unresolved: The experiments only evaluate the proposed methods on the adLIF and RadLIF models, leaving the question of how well these methods generalize to more complex neuron models unanswered.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments showing the performance of the proposed methods on SNNs using more complex neuron models like adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire (adEIF) or Izhikevich neurons.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How do the proposed temporal resolution adaptation methods perform in scenarios where the ratio between source and target temporal resolutions is not an integer?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The Expectation method explicitly assumes that the ratio between time steps is an integer, while the paper mentions that fractional powers can be computed for the Integral and Expectation methods, but does not provide experimental results for non-integer ratios.
- Why unresolved: The paper provides theoretical derivations for non-integer ratios but only presents experimental results for integer ratios, leaving the practical effectiveness of the methods for non-integer ratios unverified.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results demonstrating the performance of the proposed methods when the ratio between source and target temporal resolutions is a non-integer value.

## Limitations
- The SSM approximation may break down for highly nonlinear spiking behavior, particularly with large resolution mismatches
- The methods are primarily validated on moderate resolution changes (b = 2, 3, 4, 10) with unknown performance bounds for extreme mismatches
- Implementation details for normalization layer adaptation across all transformation types are not fully specified

## Confidence
- High Confidence: Baseline performance degradation when temporal resolution changes is well-established and reproducible
- Medium Confidence: Proposed adaptation methods show consistent performance improvements but generalization to unseen scenarios remains partially validated
- Low Confidence: Theoretical bounds for adaptation quality degradation and exact failure conditions for different neuron types are not rigorously established

## Next Checks
1. **Extreme Resolution Testing**: Evaluate adaptation performance for b = 20, 50, 100 to identify the theoretical limits of the SSM approximation and determine when adaptation fails completely
2. **Cross-Architecture Validation**: Test the adaptation methods on different SNN architectures (different layer counts, alternative neuron models like SRM) to assess robustness beyond the specific adLIF/RadLIF configurations used in the paper
3. **Real-World Deployment Simulation**: Implement a realistic deployment scenario where models are trained on simulated low-resolution neuromorphic data and adapted to real high-resolution datasets, measuring both accuracy retention and computational overhead of adaptation versus retraining
