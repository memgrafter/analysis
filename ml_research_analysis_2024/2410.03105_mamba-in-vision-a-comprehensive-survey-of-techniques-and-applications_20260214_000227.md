## Method Summary
The survey synthesizes existing literature on Mamba models in computer vision, organizing research into a taxonomy of nine application domains. It analyzes scanning mechanisms for converting 2D images to 1D sequences, compares Mamba with traditional architectures, and identifies key challenges and future directions. The methodology involves systematic literature review, performance analysis of reported results, and identification of technical limitations across different application areas.

## Key Results
- Mamba achieves 85.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K and 48.7 AP50 with 70M parameters for object detection
- Herackles-C-L achieves 1.3 points higher Top-1 Accuracy than SwinV2-B while having 11.26% less FLOPS and 38.45% less parameters
- Mamba models offer linear complexity for long sequences through selective state space models with hardware-aware scan-based algorithms

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Mamba achieves linear complexity for long sequences through selective state space models with hardware-aware scan-based algorithms
- Mechanism: Mamba uses Selective Structured State Space Models that dynamically filter input information, avoiding the quadratic complexity of self-attention while maintaining global receptive fields through efficient 1D-to-2D scanning patterns
- Core assumption: The scan-based conversion from 2D images to 1D sequences preserves sufficient spatial relationships for effective visual processing
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Mamba addresses these limitations by leveraging Selective Structured State Space Models to effectively capture long-range dependencies with linear computational complexity."
  - [section] "Mamba models are particularly advantageous for tasks such as video processing [8], for long temporal sequences processing; remote sensing [12], for large spatial datasets; and medical imaging [159], for efficient and precise high-resolution data processing."
  - [corpus] Weak - No direct evidence in neighbors about linear complexity mechanisms.
- Break condition: If spatial relationships are not adequately preserved during scanning, visual performance degrades significantly.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Mamba's bidirectional scanning captures both local and global features more effectively than unidirectional approaches
- Mechanism: Bidirectional scanning processes image patches in both horizontal and vertical directions, creating richer feature representations by capturing dependencies in multiple orientations
- Core assumption: Multi-directional scanning provides complementary information that improves feature discriminability without excessive computational overhead
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "A comparative analysis with CNNs and Transformers shows Mamba's competitive performance in tasks like image classification (achieving 85.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K)"
  - [section] "VL-Mamba [118] uses Cross-scanning (Figure 5(c)) to capture diverse spatial features. VMamba [94] and VMRNN [140] use the similar technique called 2D Selective Scan (SS2D) that scans from four directions toward the center."
  - [corpus] Weak - Neighbors don't discuss bidirectional scanning mechanisms.
- Break condition: If bidirectional scanning introduces significant artifacts or computational overhead that outweighs benefits.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Mamba's hybrid approach combining state space models with selective scanning outperforms pure CNN or Transformer architectures
- Mechanism: Mamba integrates the local feature extraction strengths of CNNs with the global dependency modeling of Transformers through SSM-based selective scanning, achieving better balance between accuracy and efficiency
- Core assumption: The selective scanning mechanism can effectively bridge the gap between local and global feature extraction without the quadratic complexity of self-attention
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The survey identifies key limitations including domain-specific biases, scanning mechanism challenges, limited pre-trained models, interpretability issues, and security concerns"
  - [section] "Herackles-C-L [115] achieves 1.3 points higher Top-1 Accuracy than the top performing Transformer model SwinV2-B [47], while having 11.26% less FLOPS and 38.45% less parameters"
  - [corpus] Weak - No direct evidence in neighbors about hybrid performance comparisons.
- Break condition: If the selective scanning cannot maintain the performance advantages across diverse computer vision tasks.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: State Space Models (SSMs) and their discretization from continuous to discrete time
  - Why needed here: Understanding SSMs is fundamental to grasping how Mamba models work, as they form the core computational framework
  - Quick check question: What are the system matrices A, B, and C in SSMs, and how do they control state transitions?

- Concept: Scanning mechanisms for converting 2D images to 1D sequences
  - Why needed here: The scanning process is crucial for adapting Mamba's 1D sequence modeling to visual data
  - Quick check question: How does bidirectional scanning differ from sequential scanning in terms of spatial information capture?

- Concept: Selective state updates and dynamic parameter computation
  - Why needed here: Mamba's efficiency comes from dynamically computing parameters based on input, which is key to understanding its advantages
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between traditional SSM parameters (fixed) and Mamba's input-dependent parameters?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Input: 2D image patches → Scanning mechanism → 1D sequence
  - Core: Mamba blocks (linear projections, convolutional layers, SiLU activation, SSM operations)
  - Optional: Hybrid blocks (CNN/Transformer integration) → Output
  - Key components: Selective State Space Model, scanning patterns, hybrid integration modules

- Critical path: Image → Scanning → Mamba Block Processing → Feature Extraction → Task-specific Head
  - Most critical: Scanning mechanism quality and Mamba block implementation
  - Bottleneck: Scanning efficiency and memory management for large images

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs efficiency: Complex scanning patterns improve accuracy but increase computational cost
  - Local vs global: Different scanning methods balance local detail capture with global context modeling
  - Flexibility vs complexity: Hybrid approaches offer better performance but add architectural complexity

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor spatial relationship preservation → degraded segmentation performance
  - Excessive computational overhead → inability to process high-resolution images
  - Domain-specific bias → poor generalization to new datasets
  - Memory exhaustion → failure on large images or videos

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement basic bidirectional scanning on ImageNet-1K and compare with sequential scanning accuracy
  2. Test different scanning patterns (zigzag, spiral, hilbert) on a small semantic segmentation dataset
  3. Evaluate memory usage and FLOPs for different Mamba block configurations on high-resolution images

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can Mamba models effectively capture multi-dimensional spatial dependencies in visual data without losing computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses challenges in adapting Mamba's selective scanning methods from 1D sequential data to multi-dimensional visual data, noting that traditional scanning techniques often fail to preserve intricate spatial relationships needed for detailed image analysis.
- Why unresolved: While the paper mentions promising strategies like hierarchical scanning patterns and attention-guided scanning mechanisms, it does not provide definitive evidence on which approach works best for different visual tasks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing various multi-dimensional scanning techniques (hierarchical, attention-guided, sparse scanning) across diverse visual tasks and datasets, demonstrating both performance and computational efficiency.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the optimal pre-training strategies for Mamba models to improve generalizability across different domains?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies limited pre-trained model availability as a key challenge and notes that Mamba models often struggle to generalize across different domains due to domain-specific biases captured in hidden states.
- Why unresolved: While the paper suggests large-scale pre-training on diverse datasets as a potential solution, it does not provide specific guidelines on dataset composition, pre-training duration, or architecture modifications needed for optimal generalization.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies showing performance differences between Mamba models pre-trained on various dataset combinations, with analysis of how different pre-training strategies affect cross-domain generalization.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the interpretability of Mamba models be improved without significantly compromising their computational efficiency?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights that Mamba's complex sequential nature and selective state updates complicate tracing its decision-making process, making it challenging to identify which features most influence its predictions.
- Why unresolved: While recent research has reinterpreted Mamba layers as implicit self-attention mechanisms, the paper does not provide concrete methods for visualizing or explaining Mamba's decision-making process in a computationally efficient manner.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of interpretability techniques specifically designed for Mamba models that maintain or improve computational efficiency while providing clear insights into feature importance and decision-making processes.

## Limitations
- The survey lacks empirical validation of claimed performance metrics, with many results presented without detailed methodology or reproducibility information
- Limited discussion of real-world deployment challenges and edge cases where Mamba models may underperform
- Insufficient analysis of the trade-offs between different scanning mechanisms across diverse application domains

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The taxonomy structure and categorization of Mamba applications across nine domains is well-supported by existing literature
- Medium Confidence: Performance comparisons with CNNs and Transformers are based on published results but lack standardized benchmarking conditions
- Low Confidence: Claims about Mamba's superiority in specific domains are supported by only a few case studies without broader validation

## Next Checks
1. **Benchmark Reproducibility**: Implement and test 3-4 representative Mamba models on standardized datasets (ImageNet-1K, COCO) with documented hyperparameters to verify claimed performance metrics
2. **Scanning Mechanism Analysis**: Conduct ablation studies comparing different scanning patterns (bidirectional, zigzag, hierarchical) across multiple vision tasks to quantify their impact on accuracy and efficiency
3. **Cross-Domain Generalization**: Evaluate Mamba models trained on one domain (e.g., natural images) on out-of-distribution datasets (medical images, satellite imagery) to assess domain-specific biases and limitations identified in the survey
