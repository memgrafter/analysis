## Executive Summary
This paper introduces AirSketch, a method for generating clean sketches from hand motion videos captured via standard cameras. The approach uses a controllable diffusion model trained with self-supervised augmentation to learn the mapping from noisy hand-tracking images to aesthetically pleasing sketches. By simulating real-world drawing distortions through augmentations, the model learns to denoise tracking outputs and recover the intended drawing. The method achieves significant performance improvements over baselines across multiple metrics and demonstrates strong generalization to unseen object categories.

## Method Summary
AirSketch employs a controllable diffusion model (Stable Diffusion XL with ControlNet) trained through self-supervised augmentation. The method applies random augmentations to clean sketches that simulate distortions found in hand-tracking outputs (local artifacts, structural distortions, false strokes). During training, the model learns to denoise these augmented sketches back to their original form, implicitly learning to interpret noisy tracking images. The approach uses text prompts for semantic guidance and can handle both synthetic and real hand motion datasets. A LoRA fine-tuning strategy on Quick, Draw! dataset enables the model to generate sketch-style outputs.

## Key Results
- Significantly outperforms baselines on SSIM, CLIP I2I, and I2T metrics
- Reduces Chamfer Distance between generated and ground-truth sketches
- Demonstrates strong generalization to unseen object categories
- Ablation studies confirm importance of augmentation strategy and text prompts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Self-supervised augmentation-based training enables mapping from noisy hand-tracking images to clean sketches
- Core assumption: Augmented distortions during training are representative of real noise patterns in hand-tracking outputs
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "simple augmentation-based self-supervised training procedure", [section 4.2] "randomly sample combinations of augmentations"
- Break condition: If augmentations don't accurately simulate real tracking noise patterns

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: ControlNet with augmentation training can map from noisy input to clean output without precise spatial constraints
- Core assumption: ControlNet's conditioning adapter can learn mapping from distorted inputs when trained with appropriate augmentations
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "teach ControlNet to map from a noisy input condition to a clean output", [section 2.3] "spatial-conditioning does not have to be a 'hard' constraint"
- Break condition: If conditioning adapter cannot learn mapping from distorted to clean sketches

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Text prompts provide crucial semantic guidance complementing visual cues from noisy tracking images
- Core assumption: Diffusion model's text conditioning can effectively guide sketch generation when visual input is ambiguous
- Evidence anchors: [section 5.2] "CLIP I2T and CD drop 24.7% and 21.4% respectively on unseen categories" when prompts absent
- Break condition: If text conditioning fails to provide meaningful guidance for ambiguous tracking inputs

## Foundational Learning

- **Diffusion probabilistic models and reverse process**: Core method relies on diffusion model to generate sketches from noisy inputs. Quick check: How does a diffusion model gradually transform a noisy image back into a clean one during reverse process?

- **Controllable diffusion models (ControlNet and T2IAdapter)**: Method uses ControlNet for spatial conditioning. Quick check: What is the difference between ControlNet and T2IAdapter in how they incorporate conditioning signals?

- **Sketch representation and augmentation techniques**: Method relies on augmenting sketches to simulate hand-tracking noise. Quick check: What are three main categories of distortions in hand-drawn sketches and how might each be simulated through augmentation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Hand tracking → Augmentation-based training → ControlNet conditioning → SDXL generation → Clean sketch output

- **Critical path**: Hand tracking → Augmentation-based training → ControlNet conditioning → SDXL generation → Clean sketch output

- **Design tradeoffs**: Using augmentation-based training instead of paired sketch-video data (avoids data collection complexity but requires careful augmentation design); Choosing ControlNet over T2IAdapter (ControlNet showed better faithfulness to visual cues); Using rasterized sketch images vs. vector representations (simplifies pipeline but loses stroke-level information)

- **Failure signatures**: Model generates sketches that don't resemble intended object (poor text conditioning or insufficient training); Generated sketches retain artifacts from tracking images (inadequate denoising capability); Model fails to generalize to unseen categories (overfitting to training categories)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Train ControlNet without augmentations on Quick, Draw! and compare to tracking images (baseline); 2) Train with only local augmentations and evaluate on synthetic dataset (isolate effect of local distortions); 3) Train with all augmentations but no text prompts on unseen categories (test dependency on visual vs. text guidance)

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does AirSketch perform when trained on real-world datasets beyond Quick, Draw! and TUBerlin?
- How does the method handle sketches with complex backgrounds or occlusions?
- Can the method be extended to generate sketches in real-time from live hand motion videos?

## Limitations
- Performance heavily depends on quality of hand-tracking images and augmentation strategy accuracy
- Model's performance on complex sketches requiring fine motor control is not thoroughly evaluated
- Reliance on text prompts may limit ability to generate sketches purely from visual cues

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: Method's ability to generate sketches from hand motion videos using standard cameras, bypassing VR/AR hardware needs
- **Medium Confidence**: Effectiveness of augmentation-based self-supervised training procedure in teaching diffusion model to map from noisy to clean sketches
- **Low Confidence**: Generalizability to unseen object categories and complex sketches requiring fine motor control

## Next Checks
1. Validate augmentation strategy by comparing real hand-tracking noise patterns with those simulated by augmentation through user study
2. Test model performance on dataset of complex sketches requiring fine motor control to assess limitations
3. Evaluate model's ability to generate sketches without text prompts to determine dependency on text conditioning
