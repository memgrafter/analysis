# Kolmogorov-Arnold Graph Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.18354
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18354
- Reference count: 40
- Test accuracies: 82.0% on Cora, 78.0% on PubMed, 70.4% on CiteSeer

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces KANG (Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Graph), a graph neural network that integrates spline-based activation functions into the message-passing framework. By using learnable B-spline and RBF activations with data-driven initialization, KANG enhances both model expressiveness and interpretability. Experiments on five benchmark datasets show KANG outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs in node classification, link prediction, and graph classification tasks, achieving test accuracies of 82.0% on Cora, 78.0% on PubMed, and 70.4% on CiteSeer, with improved robustness to oversmoothing.

## Method Summary
KANG extends message passing neural networks by replacing fixed activation functions with learnable spline-based transformations. The core innovation is the KAND (Kolmogorov-Arnold Distribution) layer, which uses B-splines or radial basis functions with data-aligned initialization for control points. The architecture includes residual connections to preserve node information across layers, and the spline activations are initialized from a Gaussian distribution aligned with input features. Training uses the AdamW optimizer with early stopping, and the model demonstrates linear scaling with graph size.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art test accuracies of 82.0% on Cora, 78.0% on PubMed, and 70.4% on CiteSeer
- RBF activations provide 5× computational speedup over B-splines with maintained or improved accuracy
- Maintains node distinguishability in deeper networks through residual connections and spline-based transformations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** KANG's spline-based activations dynamically adapt to input data distributions, enhancing expressiveness beyond fixed activation functions.
- **Mechanism:** Spline control points are initialized from a Gaussian distribution aligned with input features, and their positions are trainable, allowing the model to learn optimal knot placement that captures complex nonlinearities.
- **Core assumption:** Data-aligned initialization improves representational flexibility by matching control point placement to feature density.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Our experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that GKAN outperforms state-of-the-art GNN models in node classification, link prediction, and graph classification tasks."
  - [section] "We introduce the KAN Distribution (KAND), a new KAN-based model featuring learnable control points with initialisation aligned to the input distribution."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence found in corpus for data-aligned initialization benefits.
- **Break condition:** If initialization doesn't match feature distribution, the model may underfit or require excessive training to adapt.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** RBFs provide computational efficiency over B-splines while maintaining or improving accuracy.
- **Mechanism:** RBFs use closed-form expressions (e.g., Gaussian kernels) instead of recursive B-spline evaluation, reducing computational overhead and enabling faster training.
- **Core assumption:** RBFs approximate the function representation capability of B-splines with less computational cost.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section] "Table 3 illustrates that RBF activations not only significantly outperform B-splines in terms of accuracy but also substantially reduce computational overhead, yielding an approximate fivefold reduction in training time per epoch."
  - [abstract] "Experiments on benchmark datasets... show that KANG consistently outperforms established GNN architectures."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence found in corpus for RBF vs B-spline performance comparison.
- **Break condition:** If RBFs cannot adequately represent complex functions required by the task, accuracy may degrade.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** KANG maintains discriminative node representations in deeper networks by mitigating oversmoothing through residual connections and spline-based transformations.
- **Mechanism:** Residual connections preserve node information across layers while spline-based transformations allow flexible, data-dependent feature mixing that prevents uniform embedding collapse.
- **Core assumption:** The combination of residual connections and adaptive spline activations preserves node distinguishability at depth.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section] "Although KANG exhibits a lower E across all examined depths, it still maintains or even surpasses the performance of compared architectures."
  - [abstract] "Experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that GKAN outperforms state-of-the-art GNN models in node classification, link prediction, and graph classification tasks."
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence found in corpus for oversmoothing mitigation mechanisms.
- **Break condition:** If residual connections are insufficient or spline transformations are too rigid, embeddings may still collapse at depth.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem and its extension to neural networks
  - **Why needed here:** KANG is built on the principle that multivariate functions can be decomposed into univariate functions and summation, providing theoretical justification for spline-based architectures.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem enable interpretable neural networks?

- **Concept:** Message passing neural networks and their limitations
  - **Why needed here:** KANG extends the message passing framework by replacing fixed activation functions with learnable splines, addressing expressiveness limitations.
  - **Quick check question:** What are the key components of a message passing neural network and how does KANG modify them?

- **Concept:** Spline basis functions and radial basis functions
  - **Why needed here:** KANG uses both B-splines and RBFs as activation functions, requiring understanding of their mathematical properties and computational characteristics.
  - **Quick check question:** What are the key differences between B-splines and radial basis functions in terms of computation and flexibility?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input layer (Graph data) → KANGConv layers (Message passing with KAND activations) → KAND layers (Spline-based transformations) → Output layer (Task-specific prediction)

- **Critical path:** Input → KANGConv layers → KAND refinement → Output
  - Focus on implementing KAND with proper initialization and RBF support
  - Ensure message passing aggregation is compatible with spline activations

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - B-splines vs RBFs: Accuracy vs computational efficiency
  - Number of control points: Expressiveness vs parameter count and overfitting risk
  - Spline grid range: Flexibility vs stability

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Poor initialization: Model fails to learn meaningful transformations
  - Insufficient control points: Underfitting, unable to capture complex patterns
  - Excessive control points: Overfitting, increased computational cost
  - Wrong spline type: Computational inefficiency or inadequate expressiveness

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Implement KAND with fixed evenly-spaced control points on Cora dataset to verify basic functionality
  2. Compare B-spline vs RBF activations on Cora to validate computational efficiency claims
  3. Test data-aligned initialization vs fixed initialization to demonstrate performance improvement

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How does the choice of initialization strategy (Gaussian vs. uniform) for spline control points affect the final learned activation functions in KANG?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Section 6.1 discusses control point initialization and spacing, comparing Gaussian (G) and evenly spaced (E) initialization strategies, showing that Gaussian initialization with trainable spacing (GT) significantly outperforms other configurations.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper demonstrates performance differences but does not analyze how these initialization strategies influence the learned activation functions or their evolution during training.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Visualizing and comparing the learned spline activations at convergence for different initialization strategies across multiple runs and datasets.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** What is the relationship between the number of spline control points and the risk of overfitting in KANG, particularly on larger graphs?
- **Basis in paper:** [inferred] Section 6.3 discusses sensitivity analysis showing a trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency as the number of control points increases, with an optimal choice at four control points for Cora. The paper also mentions that complex splines can raise memory consumption, posing scalability challenges for large graphs.
- **Why unresolved:** While the paper identifies a trade-off, it doesn't investigate the overfitting risk or the point at which additional control points cease to improve generalization.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Systematic experiments varying the number of control points on increasingly larger graphs, monitoring both training and test performance, and analyzing the complexity of learned functions.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How does KANG's performance on link prediction tasks compare to specialized GNN architectures designed specifically for link prediction, such as SEAL or other supervised graph-level models?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] Table 1 shows KANG's performance on link prediction tasks for Cora, PubMed, and CiteSeer datasets, but the paper doesn't compare against specialized link prediction models.
- **Why unresolved:** The paper demonstrates KANG's competitive performance against general GNN architectures but doesn't establish its relative standing among link prediction-specific methods.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Benchmarking KANG against state-of-the-art link prediction models on standard link prediction datasets, reporting metrics like AUC-ROC and AUPRC.

2. **Validate Data-Aligned Initialization**: Compare performance of KANG with data-aligned initialization versus fixed evenly-spaced initialization on Cora dataset, measuring both convergence speed and final accuracy.

3. **Analyze Oversmoothing Mitigation**: Monitor Dirichlet energy and node embedding pairwise distances during training across different depths (2-4 layers) to quantify KANG's effectiveness in preserving node distinguishability.
