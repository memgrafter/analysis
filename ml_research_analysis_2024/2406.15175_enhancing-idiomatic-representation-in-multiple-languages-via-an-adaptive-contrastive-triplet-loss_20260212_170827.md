# Enhancing Idiomatic Representation in Multiple Languages via an Adaptive Contrastive Triplet Loss

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.15175
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15175
- Reference count: 29
- Best model achieved Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.548 on idiom-only subset and 0.690 overall

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a novel approach to improve the representation of idiomatic expressions in language models using adaptive contrastive learning with triplet loss and resampling miners. The method addresses the challenge of capturing non-compositional and asymmetric nature of idiomatic expressions across multiple languages. By leveraging semantic similarity mining and pre-trained models, the approach effectively distinguishes idiomatic from literal meanings and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemEval-2022 task 2 multilingual idiomaticity detection challenge.

## Method Summary
The approach uses adaptive contrastive triplet loss with in-batch positive-anchor-negative triplets, where both the sentence containing the idiomatic expression (SMWE) and its correct paraphrase (S→c) can serve interchangeably as anchor. A semantic similarity miner selects informative triplets that violate a margin threshold, focusing training on challenging examples. The model is initialized with pre-trained semantic-aware models like 'paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2' and fine-tuned using the triplet loss to specialize in idiomatic expressions.

## Key Results
- Achieved 0.548 Spearman's rank correlation coefficient on idiom-only subset (SemEval-2022 Task 2B)
- Achieved 0.690 Spearman's rank correlation coefficient overall on SemEval-2022 Task 2B
- Outperformed previous approaches significantly across English, Portuguese, and Galician languages

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The adaptive contrastive triplet loss with miner effectively distinguishes idiomatic from literal meanings by enforcing asymmetric similarity constraints. By treating both SMWE and S→c interchangeably as anchor and positive, while using incorrect paraphrases as negatives, the model learns that idiomatic and literal usages should have similar similarity scores to incorrect paraphrases.

### Mechanism 2
The semantic similarity miner with batch negatives enables efficient training by focusing on informative triplets rather than all possible combinations. The miner calculates Euclidean distances between all possible pairs of embeddings in a batch and selects only those triplets that violate the miner similarity margin, ensuring the model learns from challenging examples.

### Mechanism 3
Using pre-trained semantic-aware models as initialization provides better generalization than training from scratch with limited idiomatic data. The model is initialized with pre-trained models that have learned general semantic representations from millions of paraphrases, then fine-tuned with the idiomatic-aware triplet loss to specialize in idiomatic expressions.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contrastive learning with triplet loss
  - Why needed here: Standard supervised learning with STS scores requires extensive labeled data, while contrastive learning can learn representations from relative comparisons without explicit labels.
  - Quick check question: How does triplet loss differ from standard classification loss in terms of what it optimizes for?

- Concept: Semantic similarity mining and batch negatives
  - Why needed here: Naive triplet selection would be computationally expensive and include many uninformative examples; mining focuses training on challenging examples that improve idiomatic understanding.
  - Quick check question: What criteria does the semantic similarity miner use to select which triplets to include in training?

- Concept: Asymmetric representation of idiomatic expressions
  - Why needed here: Idiomatic expressions have meanings that don't derive from their component words, so standard compositional representations fail; asymmetric treatment allows learning non-compositional patterns.
  - Quick check question: Why is it important that both SMWE and S→c can serve as anchor interchangeably in the triplet loss formulation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Pre-trained semantic model → Semantic similarity miner → Triplet loss with adaptive margins → Fine-tuned idiomatic-aware model
- Critical path: Data preprocessing (relabeling) → Miner selection → Triplet loss computation → Model parameter updates
- Design tradeoffs: Larger models provide better semantic understanding but increase computational cost; stricter miner margins reduce training time but may miss subtle idiomatic patterns
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on idiom-only subset but good on STS-only suggests miner not selecting informative triplets; good performance on idiom-only but poor overall suggests pre-training initialization issues
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test different miner similarity margins (0.3, 0.4, 0.5) on a small subset to find optimal balance between training efficiency and learning quality
  2. Compare performance with and without pre-training initialization to quantify contribution of semantic knowledge transfer
  3. Evaluate model on held-out idioms from different domains to test generalization beyond training data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed triplet loss function with adaptive contrastive learning compare to other forms of contrastive learning, such as those using pairwise comparisons or different types of miners, in terms of capturing idiomaticity?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces a triplet loss function combined with a semantic similarity miner to generate positive-anchor-negative triplets for training the model.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a direct comparison between the proposed triplet loss approach and other contrastive learning methods in terms of their effectiveness for capturing idiomaticity.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results comparing the proposed method with other contrastive learning approaches, such as those using pairwise comparisons or different types of miners, on the same idiom detection tasks.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of the margin hyperparameter in the triplet loss function on the model's ability to capture idiomaticity, and how does it interact with the miner's similarity margin?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that selecting the right margin is crucial and that both the training loss margin and the miner's similarity margin are hyperparameters that need tuning.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of how these margin values affect the model's performance or their optimal settings.
- What evidence would resolve it: A sensitivity analysis of the model's performance with respect to different margin values for both the training loss and the miner's similarity margin.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed method generalize to languages beyond English, Portuguese, and Galician, especially for languages with different idiomatic expression structures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper evaluates the method on English, Portuguese, and Galician, but does not provide results for other languages.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore the method's effectiveness on a wider range of languages, particularly those with different idiomatic expression structures or those that are less resource-rich.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results demonstrating the method's performance on a diverse set of languages, including those with different idiomatic expression structures and resource availability.

## Limitations

- The model's performance on other idiomaticity detection tasks or real-world applications remains untested, potentially limiting generalizability
- The reliance on paraphrase pairs for training may not fully capture the diverse ways idiomatic expressions appear in natural language
- The paper does not extensively analyze failure cases or provide detailed ablation studies showing which components contribute most to performance gains

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core mechanism of using adaptive contrastive triplet loss with in-batch mining is well-grounded in established contrastive learning theory
- **Medium confidence**: The claim that this approach generalizes well across multiple languages is supported by the results but lacks extensive cross-linguistic analysis
- **Low confidence**: The assertion that the model captures the "asymmetric nature" of idiomatic expressions is primarily theoretical and not empirically validated through targeted experiments

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset validation**: Evaluate the trained model on independent idiomaticity detection datasets to assess generalization beyond the SemEval challenge data

2. **Ablation study with controlled components**: Systematically remove or replace individual components (semantic similarity miner, adaptive margins, pre-training initialization) to quantify their individual contributions to performance

3. **Qualitative error analysis**: Manually examine model predictions on challenging cases where idiomatic and literal interpretations are contextually ambiguous to understand failure patterns and test the asymmetric representation claim
