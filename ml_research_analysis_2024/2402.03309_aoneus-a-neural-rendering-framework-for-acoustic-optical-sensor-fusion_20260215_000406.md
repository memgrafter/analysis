# AONeuS: A Neural Rendering Framework for Acoustic-Optical Sensor Fusion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.03309
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03309
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Outperforms camera-only and sonar-only methods in 3D surface reconstruction from multimodal acoustic-optical sensor data under restricted baselines

## Executive Summary
AONeuS is a neural rendering framework that addresses the challenge of 3D surface reconstruction from multimodal acoustic-optical sensor data in underwater environments. The method combines RGB camera and imaging sonar measurements through a shared signed distance function for geometry and separate neural networks for acoustic and optical appearance. By integrating these modalities via a physics-based forward model and an adaptive loss weighting scheme, AONeuS achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to unimodal approaches, particularly under restricted motion conditions.

## Method Summary
AONeuS uses a shared signed distance function (SDF) network to represent 3D geometry, combined with separate neural networks for acoustic and optical appearance rendering. The framework integrates camera and sonar measurements through discretized ray marching to approximate image formation models, using an adaptive two-phase training scheme that initially emphasizes sonar measurements for depth constraints before shifting focus to camera measurements for lateral resolution. The method employs a physics-based forward model for both modalities and regularizes the SDF with an eikonal loss.

## Key Results
- AONeuS outperforms camera-only (NeuS) and sonar-only (NeuSIS) methods in Chamfer distance, precision, and recall metrics
- Theoretical analysis shows acoustic-optical triangulation is better conditioned than unimodal alternatives
- Robust performance across multiple object types and baselines in both synthetic and real datasets
- Particularly effective under limited motion conditions where unimodal methods struggle

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Acoustic-optical triangulation is better conditioned than unimodal alternatives.
- Mechanism: The forward model combines orthogonal constraints (depth from camera, azimuth from sonar) into a single linear system with lower condition number, making 3D point localization more stable.
- Core assumption: The two sensor coordinate systems are non-degenerate and provide independent constraints on X, Y, Z.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "AONeuS integrates RGB and imaging sonar measurements via a physics-based forward model and an adaptive loss weighting scheme."
  - [section]: "By inverting these systems, one can triangulate P in space. Here we perform Monte Carlo sampling to compare the conditioning of Acam, Ason, and Amulti."
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence found for conditioning analysis.
- Break condition: If sensor baselines are too small or coordinate systems are degenerate (e.g., motion parallel to sonar azimuthal plane), conditioning degrades.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Separate neural renderers for acoustic and optical modalities capture material-specific reflectance properties.
- Mechanism: Different materials have different acoustic and optical signatures; separate appearance networks allow the SDF geometry to focus on shape while modality-specific networks handle appearance.
- Core assumption: Acoustic and optical appearance properties are sufficiently decoupled that separate networks improve reconstruction over shared appearance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "It uses a shared signed distance function to represent geometry and separate neural networks to model acoustic and optical appearance."
  - [section]: "This choice is motivated by the fact that different materials have different acoustic and optical reflectance properties."
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence found for separate appearance networks.
- Break condition: If materials have similar acoustic-optical signatures, separate networks may overfit and hurt generalization.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Adaptive loss weighting with two-phase training resolves elevation and depth ambiguities sequentially.
- Mechanism: Early sonar-only phase establishes depth constraints, later camera-weighted phase resolves lateral ambiguities using complementary measurements.
- Core assumption: Initial sonar measurements provide sufficient depth information to bootstrap the optimization before camera constraints become dominant.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "AONeuS integrates RGB and imaging sonar measurements via a physics-based forward model and an adaptive loss weighting scheme."
  - [section]: "In the early iterations, t < E t, the sonar measurements are used exclusively and serve to 'mask' the object... In later iterations, t > E t, more emphasis is placed on the camera measurements."
  - [corpus]: No direct corpus evidence found for two-phase weighting scheme.
- Break condition: If sonar measurements are too noisy or camera measurements lack sufficient lateral information, sequential resolution may fail.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) for implicit surface representation
  - Why needed here: SDF provides differentiable geometry representation compatible with neural rendering and volume rendering integration
  - Quick check question: How does an SDF encode surface location and what derivative information is available?

- Concept: Volume rendering integration with implicit surfaces
  - Why needed here: Combines SDF-based geometry with neural appearance networks for differentiable image formation
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between opacity accumulation and distance to surface in SDF-based rendering?

- Concept: Forward imaging sonar geometry and measurement ambiguity
  - Why needed here: Understanding how sonar resolves range/azimuth but not elevation is critical for fusion strategy
  - Quick check question: Why does forward imaging sonar lose elevation information and how does this create ambiguity?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Shared SDF network (N) -> Acoustic renderer (Mson) and Optical renderer (Mcam) -> Physics-based forward models -> Adaptive loss weighting scheduler -> Eikonal loss for regularization

- Critical path: Measurement acquisition -> Forward model evaluation -> Neural network inference -> Loss computation -> Parameter update

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Separate appearance networks add parameters but improve material handling
  - Two-phase weighting requires hyperparameter tuning but improves convergence
  - Physics-based forward models add complexity but provide better constraints than learned models

- Failure signatures:
  - Large Z-axis errors indicate camera-only reconstruction issues
  - Large X-axis errors indicate sonar-only reconstruction issues
  - High variance across random seeds indicates insufficient constraints

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run baseline comparison with camera-only and sonar-only methods on synthetic data
  2. Test adaptive weighting schedule by varying Et parameter
  3. Evaluate conditioning analysis by computing condition numbers for different baselines

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed weight scheduling heuristic for combining sonar and camera measurements affect reconstruction quality, and could a more principled, uncertainty-aware approach further improve results?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors use a two-step weight scheduling scheme (Eq. 12) that initially emphasizes sonar measurements to "mask" the object and later shifts focus to camera measurements. They suggest that a structured, uncertainty-aware approach could yield faster convergence and better reconstructions.
- Why unresolved: The current heuristic is simple and effective, but its performance may not be optimal. The paper acknowledges the potential for improvement but does not explore or compare alternative weighting strategies.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing the current heuristic against different weighting schemes, such as those based on measurement uncertainty estimates or adaptive learning rates, would clarify whether a more principled approach leads to significant gains in reconstruction quality or training efficiency.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How would AONeuS perform under turbid water conditions where light scattering significantly affects optical measurements?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors state they focused on clear-water settings due to testing facility constraints and suggest that modeling light scattering within the forward model could improve in-the-wild performance.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not include experiments in turbid water, so the method's robustness to scattering effects is untested. Incorporating scattering models into the rendering framework could be a key improvement for real-world deployment.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing AONeuS on datasets collected in turbid water conditions, or simulating scattering effects in synthetic data, would reveal how well the current framework handles degraded optical measurements and whether incorporating scattering-aware rendering is beneficial.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the reconstruction quality of AONeuS vary with different sonar types, such as side-scan or synthetic aperture sonar, or with sonars of varying ranges and wavelengths?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that they used forward-looking sonar and suggest extending the technique to other sonar types and configurations as a future direction.
- Why unresolved: The experiments only use one sonar type and configuration. Different sonar modalities may offer varying amounts of elevation or range information, which could impact the benefits of multimodal fusion.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating AONeuS on datasets captured with different sonar types and configurations, and comparing reconstruction quality across these settings, would quantify how sensor choice affects performance and guide sensor selection for optimal results.

## Limitations

- Real-world experiments limited to a single "H" object with restricted motion patterns
- Conditioning analysis lacks direct corpus validation
- Adaptive loss weighting scheme requires careful hyperparameter tuning not systematically explored
- No ablation studies on network architecture choices (number of layers, dimensions)

## Confidence

- High confidence in core methodology and implementation approach
- Medium confidence in theoretical conditioning analysis due to lack of direct corpus validation
- Medium confidence in two-phase training benefits, as results could partly stem from hyperparameter tuning
- Medium confidence in separation of appearance networks, as paper doesn't explore shared appearance alternatives

## Next Checks

1. **Conditioning analysis validation**: Compute and compare condition numbers for Acam, Ason, and Amulti across multiple baseline configurations and motion patterns to verify the theoretical advantage claimed.

2. **Architecture ablation study**: Compare AONeuS with variants using shared appearance networks and different network depths to quantify the contribution of separate appearance networks to reconstruction quality.

3. **Real-world robustness testing**: Apply AONeuS to diverse underwater objects with varying material properties and motion patterns to assess generalization beyond the single "H" object experiment.
