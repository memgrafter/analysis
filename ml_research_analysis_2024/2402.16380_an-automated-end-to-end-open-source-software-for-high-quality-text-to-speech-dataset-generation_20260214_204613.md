# An Automated End-to-End Open-Source Software for High-Quality Text-to-Speech Dataset Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.16380
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16380
- Reference count: 0
- An open-source tool for automated TTS dataset generation with 98% matching efficiency

## Executive Summary
This paper presents an automated, end-to-end open-source software tool for generating high-quality datasets for Text-to-Speech (TTS) models. The tool streamlines the dataset creation process by automating sample selection, recording, quality assurance, and preprocessing. It integrates language-specific phoneme distribution for optimal sample selection and employs both automated and human-in-the-loop quality assurance using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models. The system significantly reduces manual effort in TTS dataset generation while maintaining high quality standards across multiple languages.

## Method Summary
The proposed tool automates the entire TTS dataset generation pipeline through four main stages: sample selection, recording, quality assurance, and preprocessing. Sample selection incorporates language-specific phoneme distribution to ensure comprehensive phonetic coverage. The recording process is automated through a user-friendly interface. Quality assurance combines automated ASR-based checks with human-in-the-loop verification. Finally, preprocessing functions format the data to meet specific TTS model requirements. The tool is designed to be extensible and adaptable to different languages and TTS architectures.

## Key Results
- Achieves approximately 98% matching efficiency in sample selection
- Minimal post-editing requirements reported across multiple languages
- Demonstrated efficiency gains in streamlining TTS dataset generation
- Successfully validated across multiple language datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The tool's effectiveness stems from its comprehensive automation of the traditionally manual TTS dataset generation process. By integrating phoneme distribution analysis into sample selection, it ensures optimal phonetic coverage for training robust TTS models. The combination of automated ASR-based quality checks with human verification creates a reliable quality assurance system. The preprocessing stage standardizes data formats to meet diverse TTS model requirements, reducing integration friction. This systematic approach eliminates bottlenecks in dataset creation while maintaining quality standards.

## Foundational Learning
- **Phoneme distribution analysis**: Understanding language-specific phoneme frequencies is crucial for selecting representative samples that ensure comprehensive phonetic coverage during TTS training. Quick check: Verify phoneme coverage maps against language reference data.
- **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) integration**: ASR models provide automated quality checks by comparing reference text with recorded speech, identifying pronunciation errors and audio quality issues. Quick check: Test ASR accuracy on validation datasets.
- **Text preprocessing for TTS**: Normalizing text (handling numbers, abbreviations, special characters) ensures consistent audio generation across different TTS architectures. Quick check: Validate preprocessing output against target TTS model requirements.
- **Quality assurance workflows**: Combining automated checks with human verification creates a robust system that catches both systematic errors and nuanced quality issues. Quick check: Measure human agreement rates on quality assessments.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Text input -> Phoneme analysis -> Sample selection -> Recording interface -> ASR quality check -> Human verification -> Preprocessing -> TTS-ready dataset

**Critical Path**: The most critical sequence is Phoneme analysis → Sample selection → Recording → Quality assurance, as errors in early stages propagate through the pipeline and compromise final dataset quality.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The system prioritizes automation over complete manual control, trading some flexibility for efficiency gains. The ASR-based quality checks are faster but may miss nuanced pronunciation issues that human reviewers catch. The preprocessing standardization enables broad TTS compatibility but may require adaptation for specialized architectures.

**Failure Signatures**: 
- Low phoneme coverage in sample selection leads to poor TTS pronunciation of rare sounds
- ASR quality check failures often indicate recording quality issues or strong accents
- Preprocessing errors typically manifest as formatting inconsistencies or missing metadata

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Run the sample selection module on a small text corpus (1000 sentences) to verify phoneme distribution output
2. Test the recording interface with one speaker to validate the user workflow and audio capture quality
3. Process a small dataset (100 samples) through the complete pipeline to identify integration issues

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies heavily on subjective measures with limited objective metrics
- No detailed error analysis of the ASR-based quality assurance system provided
- Performance on low-resource languages remains unclear with limited demonstrations
- Preprocessing flexibility for diverse TTS architectures lacks thorough validation

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The core pipeline architecture and integration of multiple components are technically sound and well-documented
- **Medium confidence**: The claimed efficiency gains and quality metrics are plausible but require independent replication with standardized benchmarks
- **Low confidence**: Claims about minimal post-editing requirements across diverse languages need systematic validation with multiple annotator groups

## Next Checks
1. Conduct independent evaluation of the ASR-based quality assurance system using standardized word error rate metrics across at least 3 languages with different script types (Latin, Cyrillic, and logographic)
2. Perform a user study with 10+ TTS researchers to validate the preprocessing flexibility claims across 5 different TTS architectures
3. Implement a longitudinal study tracking dataset quality and consistency when processing 100+ hours of audio across multiple recording sessions and speakers
