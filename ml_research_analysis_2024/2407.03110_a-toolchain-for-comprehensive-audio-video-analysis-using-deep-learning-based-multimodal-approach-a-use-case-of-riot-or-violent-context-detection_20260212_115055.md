# A Toolchain for Comprehensive Audio/Video Analysis Using Deep Learning Based Multimodal Approach (A use case of riot or violent context detection)

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2407.03110
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03110
- **Reference count**: 19
- **One-line primary result**: A deep learning-based multimodal toolchain for comprehensive audio/video analysis that integrates six tasks to detect riot or violent contexts.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive toolchain for audio/video analysis using deep learning-based multimodal approaches. The system integrates six specialized tasks—Speech to Text, Acoustic Scene Classification, Acoustic Event Detection, Visual Object Detection, Image Captioning, and Video Captioning—into a flexible architecture using Docker containers. The toolchain provides three main applications: audio/video clustering, comprehensive content summarization, and riot or violent context detection through keyword-based alarming levels.

## Method Summary
The toolchain processes input videos by first extracting audio and visual data, then analyzing them using dedicated deep learning models for six specific tasks. Each model operates independently in its own Docker container, enabling flexible updates and integration of new models. Audio embeddings are extracted using S2T, ASC, and AED models, while visual embeddings come from VOD, IC, and VC models. These embeddings are combined using TSNE for clustering applications. For riot detection, the system compares generated summaries with predefined keywords organized into three alarming levels (blue, yellow, red) to estimate severity and provide early warnings.

## Key Results
- Effective integration of six deep learning models for comprehensive audio/video analysis
- Successful video clustering using combined audio-visual embeddings transformed via TSNE
- Keyword-based riot detection system with three alarming levels for severity estimation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Multimodal deep learning models integrated in Docker containers provide flexible and adaptable architecture for audio/video analysis.
- Mechanism: Each task (S2T, ASC, AED, VOD, IC, VC) is handled by a dedicated deep learning model in its own Docker container, allowing independent updates and scaling.
- Core assumption: Containerized models can be easily integrated and replaced without disrupting the entire toolchain.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the toolchain presents a flexible and adaptable architecture that is effective to integrate new models for further audio/video-based applications."
  - [section] "each specific deep learning model, which was constructed in individual Anaconda environment with Tensorflow or Pytorch framework, is packaged by Docker container. By constructing and packaging single models for specific tasks independently, the toolchain architecture shows effectiveness and adaptability to integrate new tasks."
- Break condition: If Docker containerization introduces significant latency or resource contention between models, the flexibility advantage diminishes.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Combining audio and visual embeddings using TSNE enables effective video clustering.
- Mechanism: Audio and visual data are processed separately to extract embeddings, then transformed into 2D vectors using TSNE for visualization and clustering.
- Core assumption: The combination of audio and visual features captures sufficient discriminative information for clustering videos into meaningful categories.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Given the amount of videos from various resources...clustering videos into certain categories is necessary before further analyzing the video content. Therefore, the proposed toolchain first offers the audio/video clustering application. To this end, audio and visual data extracted from input videos are fed into pre-trained models to extract audio and visual embeddings. These embeddings are transformed into two-dimensional vectors using TSNE and then visualized."
- Break condition: If TSNE fails to preserve meaningful distances in high-dimensional space, clustering results become unreliable.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Keyword-based detection with alarming levels effectively identifies riot or violent contexts.
- Mechanism: Keywords related to riot/violent contexts are defined across three alarming levels (blue, yellow, red) and compared with text summaries from audio/visual analysis to detect and estimate severity.
- Core assumption: The predefined keywords adequately capture the semantic content of violent contexts across different audio and visual modalities.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "keywords of 'gun', 'scream', 'crowd', etc., which are related to the riot or violent context, are defined in advance. These keywords are then compared with the given information from the task of audio/video summary to indicate whether the video is close to a riot or violent context. The keywords are separated into three alarming levels which correspond to blue, yellow, and red colors, respectively."
- Break condition: If keywords fail to generalize across different cultural contexts or miss emerging violent indicators, detection accuracy drops.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multimodal deep learning integration
  - Why needed here: The toolchain combines multiple specialized models (S2T, ASC, AED, VOD, IC, VC) that process different data types to provide comprehensive analysis.
  - Quick check question: What are the six specific tasks integrated in this toolchain and why is multimodal analysis important for riot detection?

- Concept: Audio-visual feature extraction and embedding
  - Why needed here: Audio and visual data must be converted into numerical representations (embeddings) that deep learning models can process and compare.
  - Quick check question: How does the toolchain extract and combine audio and visual embeddings for clustering applications?

- Concept: Keyword-based context detection with alarming levels
  - Why needed here: The toolchain uses predefined keywords across three severity levels to detect and classify riot or violent contexts from the summarized audio/visual data.
  - Quick check question: How does the alarming level system (blue, yellow, red) help in estimating the severity of detected violent contexts?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Frontend: Streamlit for user interface
  - Backend: FastAPI framework for API services
  - Container layer: Docker containers for each deep learning model
  - Models: Whisper (S2T), mBart (ET), PANN (AED), AIT-ASC (ASC), DETR (VOD), VEDA (IC), SWINBERT (VC)
  - Data processing: Audio/video extraction, JSON result aggregation
  - Applications: Audio/video clustering, comprehensive audio/video summary, riot detection

- Critical path: Video input → Audio/video extraction → Individual model processing → JSON aggregation → Application-specific analysis → Output visualization

- Design tradeoffs: Containerization provides flexibility but adds overhead; separate models enable specialization but require careful integration; keyword-based detection is interpretable but may miss nuanced contexts.

- Failure signatures: Slow processing times indicate container resource contention; inaccurate clustering suggests embedding quality issues; missed violent contexts indicate keyword coverage gaps.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test end-to-end pipeline with a short video containing known audio/visual features to verify all components work together
  2. Validate clustering accuracy by running the toolchain on the DCASE 2021 dataset and comparing results with ground truth categories
  3. Test riot detection sensitivity by creating videos with varying levels of violent content and measuring detection accuracy and alarming level assignment

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the toolchain handle variations in audio and visual quality across different video sources, and what impact does this have on the accuracy of the riot or violent context detection?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions the use of benchmark datasets but does not discuss the toolchain's performance with videos of varying quality.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide information on how the toolchain deals with variations in video quality, which is a common real-world challenge.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the toolchain on videos with known variations in quality and comparing the results to those from high-quality videos would provide insights into its robustness.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the toolchain differentiate between similar contexts, such as a sports event and a riot, based on the audio and visual cues it analyzes?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper describes the detection of riot or violent contexts but does not elaborate on the toolchain's ability to distinguish between contexts that may share similar audio and visual characteristics.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide examples or a detailed explanation of how the toolchain differentiates between contexts that might have overlapping features.
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluating the toolchain's performance on videos that depict contexts with similar audio and visual cues but different meanings (e.g., sports events vs. riots) would demonstrate its ability to make fine-grained distinctions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the scalability of the toolchain when integrating new models for additional audio/video-based applications, and how does this affect the overall system performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that the toolchain presents a flexible and adaptable architecture for integrating new models but does not provide details on the scalability or performance impact.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not discuss the computational and time resources required to integrate new models or the effect on system performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments that involve integrating various numbers and types of new models into the toolchain and measuring the changes in processing time and resource usage would provide insights into its scalability.

## Limitations
- Effectiveness depends heavily on quality and coverage of individual deep learning models, particularly for keyword-based riot detection
- Container-based architecture may introduce performance bottlenecks with high-resolution videos or concurrent analyses
- Predefined keywords may not generalize across different cultural contexts or capture emerging forms of violence

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: The multimodal integration approach and containerization strategy are technically sound and well-documented
- **Medium confidence**: Clustering effectiveness and comprehensive summary capabilities supported by benchmark dataset evaluations
- **Low confidence**: Riot detection accuracy limited by manual keyword definition and absence of quantitative evaluation metrics

## Next Checks
1. Cross-cultural keyword validation: Test the riot detection system with videos from diverse geographic and cultural contexts to assess keyword coverage gaps and false negative rates
2. Container performance benchmarking: Measure processing latency and resource utilization across different video resolutions and concurrent user loads to identify scaling limitations
3. End-to-end accuracy assessment: Conduct comprehensive testing on a mixed dataset containing both violent and non-violent content to measure true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates for the riot detection application
