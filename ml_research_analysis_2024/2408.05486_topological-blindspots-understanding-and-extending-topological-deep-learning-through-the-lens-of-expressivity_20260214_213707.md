core_contribution: This paper explores the expressivity limitations of higher-order
  message-passing (HOMP) architectures in topological deep learning (TDL). HOMP extends
  traditional graph message-passing to higher-order domains but suffers from significant
  expressive power constraints, failing to distinguish between topological objects
  based on fundamental properties like diameter, orientability, planarity, and homology.

# Topological Blindspots: Understanding and Extending Topological Deep Learning Through the Lens of Expressivity

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Introduces topological criterion for HOMP limitations and proposes SMCN architecture to address them

## Executive Summary
This paper identifies fundamental expressivity limitations in higher-order message-passing (HOMP) architectures for topological deep learning. The authors prove that HOMP cannot distinguish topological objects that share the same number of cells across ranks and admit a common cover. To overcome these limitations, they propose two new architectures: multi-cellular networks (MCN) that can achieve full expressivity, and scalable multi-cellular networks (SMCN) that offers a more practical alternative while still addressing many of HOMP's blindspots.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a theoretical framework for analyzing the expressive power of topological deep learning models. They introduce a topological criterion based on common covers to identify when HOMP architectures fail to distinguish between combinatorial complexes. Building on this analysis, they propose MCN as a fully expressive alternative, then derive SMCN as a more scalable variant that uses subgraph network updates to process higher-order structures. The Torus dataset, a synthetic benchmark of 2D tori pairs, is created to evaluate model expressivity through pair distinguishing accuracy.

## Key Results
- Proves that HOMP cannot distinguish topological objects sharing the same number of cells across ranks and admitting a common cover
- Demonstrates that SMCN successfully distinguishes all pairs of topological objects in the Torus dataset
- Shows that HOMP fails to differentiate any of the topological pairs in the synthetic benchmark
- Validates theoretical findings with empirical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: HOMP cannot distinguish topological objects that share the same number of cells across ranks and admit a common cover
- Mechanism: When two combinatorial complexes are covered by the same higher-dimensional complex, message-passing updates remain identical at every layer, making the complexes indistinguishable
- Core assumption: HOMP models are invariant to the specific covering structure when no initial cell features are provided
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We introduce a topological criterion that can be used to discern when a pair of combinatorial complexes is indistinguishable by HOMP"
  - [section 4.1]: "Theorem 4.1: Let C and C* admit decompositions into connected components... There exists a complex ~C that covers all complexes Cj and C* j* for all j ∈ J and j* ∈ J*"
  - [corpus]: "Found 25 related papers... Average neighbor FMR=0.458"
- Break condition: If initial cell features are provided or the covering structure is broken by the model's updates

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: SMCN can express fundamental topological invariants like diameter, orientability, and homology by leveraging multi-cellular cochain spaces and subgraph networks
- Mechanism: SMCN uses equivariant linear layers and subgraph network updates (PPCN and SCN) to simulate expressive graph learning primitives on higher-order structures, enabling computation of properties like shortest paths and connected components
- Core assumption: The augmented Hasse graphs preserve the necessary relational information for computing topological invariants
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "SMCN successfully distinguishes all pairs of topological objects, while HOMP fails to differentiate any of them"
  - [section 7.1]: "Proposition 7.1(Informal): Any pair of combinatorial complexes with distinct diameters can be distinguished by an SMCN model"
  - [section 6]: "PPCN aims to replace equivariant updates of the form L : C3ei → C3ei in MCN... has lower space complexity (O(n2) compared to the O(n3) for 3-IGN)"
- Break condition: When the number of higher-order cells becomes too large for the subgraph network updates to remain tractable

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: SMCN addresses the limitations of HOMP in leveraging information from lifting and pooling operations by using subgraph networks to process sparse higher-order structures
- Mechanism: SMCN applies subgraph network updates (SCN) to the Hasse graphs induced by higher-order cells, allowing it to compute properties like diameters that depend on these sparse structures
- Core assumption: The higher-order cells produced by lifting and pooling operations are sparse enough for efficient subgraph network processing
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "SMCN still mitigates many of HOMP's expressivity limitations"
  - [section 7.2]: "Proposition 7.5(Informal): There exist pairs of combinatorial complexes... that HOMP fails to distinguish, but SMCN can"
  - [section 6]: "SCN updates aim to replace equivariant updates of the form L : C2ei+ej → C2ei+ej in MCN"
- Break condition: When the lifting or pooling operations produce too many higher-order cells, making the subgraph network updates computationally expensive

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Combinatorial complexes
  - Why needed here: Understanding the basic structure of the data domain is essential for grasping how HOMP and SMCN operate
  - Quick check question: What are the three components of a combinatorial complex, and how do they relate to simplicial and cellular complexes?

- Concept: Neighborhood functions
  - Why needed here: Neighborhood functions define how information flows between cells in HOMP and SMCN models
  - Quick check question: What are the four most common types of neighborhood functions, and how do they differ in terms of the relationships they capture?

- Concept: Equivariant linear layers
  - Why needed here: Equivariant linear layers are the building blocks of MCN and SMCN, enabling them to be invariant to cell permutations
  - Quick check question: What is the key property that equivariant linear layers must satisfy, and why is this property important for topological deep learning?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Multi-cellular cochain spaces (Ck) -> Equivariant linear layers -> Subgraph network updates (PPCN and SCN) -> Neighborhood functions

- Critical path:
  1. Construct the augmented Hasse graphs for the input combinatorial complex
  2. Initialize multi-cellular cochain spaces with cell features and adjacency matrices
  3. Apply equivariant linear layers to process the multi-cellular cochain spaces
  4. Use PPCN and SCN updates to compute topological invariants and leverage sparse higher-order structures
  5. Aggregate the final representations for the desired task

- Design tradeoffs:
  - MCN vs SMCN: MCN can reach full expressivity but is highly unscalable, while SMCN is more scalable but may not capture all topological invariants
  - Using equivariant linear layers vs subgraph networks: Equivariant linear layers are more expressive but require more parameters, while subgraph networks are more efficient but may be limited in their expressivity

- Failure signatures:
  - Inability to distinguish between combinatorial complexes with different topological properties
  - High computational cost when the number of higher-order cells becomes too large
  - Poor performance on tasks that require leveraging sparse information from lifting and pooling operations

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate SMCN on the Torus dataset to verify its ability to distinguish between pairs of combinatorial complexes with different diameters and homology groups
  2. Compare the performance of SMCN with HOMP on a real-world graph dataset, such as a molecular graph dataset, to assess the benefits of leveraging topological information
  3. Investigate the scalability of SMCN by applying it to large 3D mesh datasets and measuring its computational cost and performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can SMCN fully distinguish between combinatorial complexes based on orientability and homology groups, or are there fundamental limitations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper demonstrates that SMCN can distinguish between specific pairs of CCs with different orientability (e.g., cylinder vs. Möbius strip) and homology groups, but it does not provide a complete characterization of its expressive power for these properties
- Why unresolved: The theoretical analysis focuses on specific examples and does not provide a comprehensive proof of SMCN's ability to distinguish all pairs of CCs based on these properties
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal proof or counterexample demonstrating whether SMCN can fully capture orientability and homology groups for all possible CCs

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the precise limitations of HOMP compared to hypergraph networks, and can EHNN distinguish between pairs of CCs that HOMP cannot?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper shows that HOMP can distinguish between some CCs that EHNN cannot, but it does not provide a complete comparison of their expressive power
- Why unresolved: The analysis focuses on specific examples and does not provide a comprehensive characterization of the expressive power of HOMP and EHNN
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal proof or counterexample demonstrating the exact relationship between the expressive power of HOMP and EHNN for all possible CCs

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the computational complexity of SMCN be reduced to make it more scalable for large-scale TDL applications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges that SMCN's computational complexity scales superlinearly with the number of i-rank cells, making it intractable for large-scale applications
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide specific solutions for reducing the computational complexity of SMCN while maintaining its expressive power
- What evidence would resolve it: A new architecture or optimization technique that significantly reduces the computational complexity of SMCN without sacrificing its expressive power

### Open Question 4
- Question: Can MCN and SMCN be extended to handle more complex topological structures, such as higher-dimensional manifolds or manifolds with singularities?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper focuses on the expressive power of MCN and SMCN for combinatorial complexes, but it does not explore their applicability to more complex topological structures
- Why unresolved: The theoretical analysis is limited to combinatorial complexes, and it is unclear whether the results can be extended to more complex topological structures
- What evidence would resolve it: A formal proof or experimental results demonstrating the applicability of MCN and SMCN to higher-dimensional manifolds or manifolds with singularities

### Open Question 5
- Question: How can the Torus dataset be extended to include more diverse topological structures and evaluate the expressive power of TDL models on a wider range of tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces the Torus dataset as a synthetic benchmark for evaluating the expressive power of TDL models, but it does not explore its potential for evaluating other aspects of TDL models
- Why unresolved: The Torus dataset is limited to 2-dimensional tori and does not capture the full diversity of topological structures that TDL models may encounter in real-world applications
- What evidence would resolve it: A new synthetic dataset or extension of the Torus dataset that includes a wider range of topological structures and tasks, along with experimental results evaluating the performance of TDL models on these tasks

## Limitations

- The completeness of the topological criterion for all possible combinatorial complex pairs remains uncertain, particularly for higher-dimensional cases beyond the 2D torus experiments
- Empirical scaling behavior on larger, real-world datasets is not demonstrated to validate SMCN's scalability claims
- Pair distinguishing accuracy on the synthetic Torus dataset may not fully capture the practical expressivity requirements for real-world topological learning tasks

## Confidence

- High confidence: The theoretical analysis of HOMP limitations (Theorem 4.1) and the basic architecture of SMCN are well-established with rigorous proofs
- Medium confidence: The effectiveness of SMCN in mitigating HOMP limitations is demonstrated on the synthetic Torus dataset, but generalization to real-world applications remains to be validated
- Low confidence: The scalability claims for SMCN and the completeness of the topological criterion for all combinatorial complex pairs are not fully substantiated by empirical evidence

## Next Checks

1. Apply SMCN to larger combinatorial complexes (e.g., 3D meshes with thousands of cells) and measure computational time and memory usage to validate scalability claims
2. Evaluate SMCN on a real-world topological dataset (e.g., molecular graphs or brain connectivity networks) to assess its practical expressivity and compare it to HOMP and other TDL methods
3. Conduct an ablation study on the PPCN and SCN components of SMCN to quantify their individual contributions to the model's expressivity and identify potential bottlenecks
