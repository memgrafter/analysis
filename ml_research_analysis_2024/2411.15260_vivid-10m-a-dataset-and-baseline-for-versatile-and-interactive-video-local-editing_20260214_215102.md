# VIVID-10M: A Dataset and Baseline for Versatile and Interactive Video Local Editing

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.15260
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15260
- Reference count: 40
- VIVID-10M is the first large-scale dataset for video local editing with 9.7M samples from 73.7K videos and 672.7K images

## Executive Summary
VIVID-10M introduces the first large-scale hybrid image-video dataset for video local editing, addressing the data scarcity problem in this domain. The dataset combines 9.7 million samples from both video and image sources to enable training of video editing models at reduced computational cost. The VIVID model, trained on this dataset, supports addition, modification, and deletion of entities in videos using masks and captions. A novel keyframe-guided interactive editing mechanism (KIVE) enables iterative refinement and efficient propagation of edits across frames.

## Method Summary
The approach combines automated dataset construction with multi-task joint training. VIVID-10M is built using visual perception models and LLMs to generate paired data from the PANDA-70M dataset, reducing manual annotation needs. The VIVID model uses a diffusion-based architecture with LoRA fine-tuning, incorporating both image and video data during training (10:1 ratio). The KIVE mechanism enables users to edit keyframes with an image model, then propagate edits to remaining frames using the video model. Training employs data augmentation techniques (expand, hull, box) to improve robustness.

## Key Results
- VIVID outperforms baseline models in automated metrics for temporal consistency, text alignment, and background preservation
- User studies show VIVID achieves higher win rates for visual quality, text alignment, temporal consistency, and background preservation
- The KIVE mechanism demonstrates effectiveness on long videos through iterative keyframe editing and propagation

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: VIVID-10M addresses the lack of large-scale video editing datasets by combining real-world video and image data to reduce construction and training costs
- Mechanism: The dataset is constructed using automated pipelines that leverage visual perception models and a multi-modality large language model to generate paired data for addition, modification, and deletion tasks. By using image data alongside video data, the model benefits from a broader dataset with higher quality samples, reducing the computational burden of processing video data
- Core assumption: Automated pipelines can generate high-quality paired data that is representative of real-world video editing tasks
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "VIVID-10M is the first large-scale hybrid image-video local editing dataset aimed at reducing data construction and model training costs"; [section]: "VIVID-10M contains two subsets, VIVID-10M-Video and VIVID-10M-Image, both derived from the publicly available PANDA-70M dataset [3]"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Keyframe-guided Interactive Video Editing (KIVE) mechanism enhances user interactivity by enabling iterative keyframe edits and efficient propagation of edits across frames
- Mechanism: Users can quickly edit keyframes using an image editing model and then propagate these edits to the remaining frames using VIVID. This reduces the computational cost and time required for iterative adjustments, as the video editing model is only invoked once for propagation
- Core assumption: The image editing model can generate high-quality edits that can be effectively propagated to the remaining frames
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "At its core, a keyframe-guided interactive video editing mechanism is proposed, enabling users to iteratively edit keyframes and propagate it to other frames, thereby reducing latency in achieving desired outcomes"; [section]: "The KIVE mechanism enables users to quickly edit keyframes using an image editing model and propagate these edits across the remaining frames"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multi-task joint training with a mixture of image and video data improves the model's generalization capability and editing quality
- Mechanism: By training VIVID on both image and video data, the model benefits from the diversity and higher proportion of high-quality samples in the image dataset, while also learning to handle the spatio-temporal aspects of video data. The data ratio is adjusted to favor image data, optimizing the training efficiency
- Core assumption: The image data provides sufficient diversity and quality to enhance the model's performance on video editing tasks
- Evidence anchors: [abstract]: "VIVID is a Versatile and Interactive VIdeo local eDiting model trained on VIVID-10M, which supports entity addition, modification, and deletion"; [section]: "To reduce training overhead and accelerate convergence, we incorporate both image and video data during training"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Diffusion models
  - Why needed here: VIVID is based on a diffusion model, which is a type of generative model that learns to denoise data by iteratively refining a noisy input
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between a diffusion model and a traditional generative model like a GAN?

- Concept: Video understanding
  - Why needed here: VIVID needs to understand the content and context of videos to perform accurate local editing tasks
  - Quick check question: What are some common approaches for representing and processing video data in deep learning models?

- Concept: Multi-modal learning
  - Why needed here: VIVID needs to integrate information from both visual (masks, videos) and textual (captions) modalities to perform accurate editing
  - Quick check question: What are some challenges in training models that can process multiple modalities of data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data pipeline (VIVID-10M construction) -> Model architecture (CogVideoX with LoRA) -> KIVE mechanism (keyframe editing + propagation) -> Training (multi-task joint training)
- Critical path: Data pipeline → Model training → KIVE mechanism → Inference
- Design tradeoffs: Balancing dataset size and quality, computational cost of video processing, model complexity vs. performance
- Failure signatures: Poor editing quality, inconsistent results across frames, long inference times
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the quality of the VIVID-10M dataset by comparing it to existing video editing datasets
  2. Test the effectiveness of the KIVE mechanism by comparing it to direct video editing on a set of sample videos
  3. Assess the impact of multi-task joint training by comparing VIVID's performance on image and video editing tasks to models trained on only one modality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How does the model perform on real-world video editing tasks beyond the curated evaluation set?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that VIVID-10M-Eval is manually constructed to align with real-world scenes, but does not report on testing VIVID on other real-world datasets
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on evaluating VIVID on VIVID-10M-Eval and does not explore its performance on additional real-world datasets or diverse editing scenarios
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing VIVID on multiple real-world video editing datasets or user-generated editing tasks to assess generalization and robustness

## Limitations
- The dataset construction relies heavily on automated pipelines, raising concerns about sample quality and representativeness
- The KIVE mechanism's effectiveness depends on the image editing model's output quality and propagation algorithm robustness
- Limited evaluation scope beyond the curated VIVID-10M-Eval dataset raises questions about real-world generalization

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core methodology of combining image and video data for training, the overall framework design, and the automated dataset construction approach are well-specified and technically sound
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of the KIVE mechanism in real-world scenarios, as the paper lacks detailed analysis of failure cases and edge conditions
- **Low confidence**: The long-term generalizability of the model to diverse video content beyond the PANDA-70M dataset, given the limited evaluation scope

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset quality audit**: Conduct a systematic evaluation of VIVID-10M's editing samples against human-curated ground truth to quantify accuracy rates and identify failure patterns in the automated pipeline

2. **KIVE mechanism stress test**: Create a benchmark suite of challenging editing scenarios (complex motion, occlusion, texture variations) to evaluate the propagation algorithm's robustness and identify specific failure modes

3. **Cross-dataset generalization**: Test VIVID on videos from different domains (animation, surveillance, sports) and with varying resolutions to assess model performance degradation and identify domain-specific limitations
