# Bayesian Optimization that Limits Search Region to Lower Dimensions Utilizing Local GPR

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.08331
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08331
- Authors: Yasunori Taguchi; Hiro Gangi
- Reference count: 34
- Key outcome: BOLDUC improves search efficiency in high-dimensional BO by ~69% on Ackley and ~40% on Rosenbrock compared to global GPR, and reduces MOSFET RONA by 25% in device design.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of scaling Bayesian optimization to high-dimensional problems by proposing BOLDUC (BO with Limited search region and Local Gaussian Process regression using Subset of Data). The method restricts the search to a low-dimensional affine subspace through the best observed point and uses local GPR trained on a carefully selected subset of data relevant to that subspace. This approach dramatically reduces computational complexity while maintaining or improving search efficiency. The method is validated on 20-dimensional benchmark functions and applied to automatic design of power semiconductor devices, demonstrating significant improvements over conventional methods.

## Method Summary
BOLDUC combines two key innovations: limiting the search region to a lower-dimensional affine subspace (BOLD) and using local Gaussian process regression (LGPR) trained on a local subset of data (LSoD) specific to that subspace. The LSoD is extracted based on contribution to predictions in the low-dimensional search region, reducing the number of points in the kernel matrix and thus the time complexity of matrix inversion. The method adaptively switches between global GPR (when few observations exist) and LGPR (when sufficient data accumulates), balancing exploration and exploitation. This architecture enables efficient high-dimensional optimization while maintaining prediction accuracy in the region of interest.

## Key Results
- BOLDUC achieves ~69% improvement in search efficiency on 20D Ackley function compared to global GPR
- BOLDUC achieves ~40% improvement in search efficiency on 20D Rosenbrock function compared to global GPR
- In automatic MOSFET design, BOLDUC reduces specific on-resistance by 25% compared to conventional method and 3.4% compared to without LGPR

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Limiting the search space to a low-dimensional affine subspace reduces the effective dimensionality of the acquisition function optimization.
- Mechanism: BOLD restricts evaluations to a low-dimensional subspace defined by an affine shift through the best observed point, making the search space tractable and avoiding exponential complexity growth in full high-dimensional spaces.
- Core assumption: The global optimum lies within or near the low-dimensional subspace, and the best point moves slowly enough that the subspace can be updated without losing the optimum.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "limits the search region to lower dimensions and utilizes local Gaussian process regression (LGPR) to scale the BO to higher dimensions."
  - [section] "Since 𝑦 is heavily sampled in the low-dimensional region (𝒮𝑡 ∩ 𝜒), the surrogate model is more accurate in that region."
- Break condition: If the objective function is not well-approximated by a low-dimensional manifold or if the optimum jumps far from the subspace, the method loses efficiency.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Training LGPR on a local subset of data (LSoD) improves prediction accuracy in the low-dimensional search region while reducing matrix inversion cost.
- Mechanism: LGPR extracts a subset ℰₜ of points with high contribution to predictions in (𝒮ₜ ∩ 𝜒), reducing the number of points used in the kernel matrix and lowering time complexity from O(N³) to O(M³) where M << N.
- Core assumption: Points with high similarity to the search region contribute most to accurate predictions there; irrelevant distant points can be safely excluded.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "LGPR treats the low-dimensional search region as 'local,' improving prediction accuracies there."
  - [section] "LGPR model is trained on a local subset of data specific to that region. This improves prediction accuracy and search efficiency and reduces the time complexity of matrix inversion in the Gaussian process regression."
- Break condition: If the LSoD is too small or poorly chosen, the LGPR loses global context and prediction accuracy drops.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Switching between global and local approximations during optimization balances exploration and exploitation efficiently.
- Mechanism: BOLDUC uses global GPR early (when |𝒟ₜ| ≤ M) to capture overall landscape, then switches to LGPR with LSoD later to focus on local structure, ensuring coarse global search first then fine local refinement.
- Core assumption: The structure of the objective function can be coarsely captured early and refined later; switching point can be set by |𝒟ₜ| vs M.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "GPR captures the global structure from 𝒟ₜ in the early stage, when |𝒟ₜ| ≤ M holds, and LGPR captures the local structure from ℰₜ in the later stage."
- Break condition: If the objective function changes rapidly or the global structure is complex, early global approximation may mislead the search.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)
  - Why needed here: BOLDUC and LGPR rely on GPR as the surrogate model; understanding mean/variance predictions and kernel functions is essential.
  - Quick check question: What is the computational complexity of GPR when using all N observations, and why is it problematic in high dimensions?

- Concept: Bayesian Optimization (BO) acquisition functions
  - Why needed here: BOLDUC maximizes acquisition functions in low-dimensional subspaces; knowing how acquisition functions guide search is key.
  - Quick check question: How does the Lower Confidence Bound (LCB) acquisition function balance exploration and exploitation?

- Concept: Local vs. global approximations in machine learning
  - Why needed here: LGPR is a local approximation; understanding when and why to use local models is important.
  - Quick check question: In what situations would a local model outperform a global model in prediction accuracy?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: BOLDUC -> BOLD (low-dim subspace) -> LSoD extraction -> LGPR training -> Acquisition maximization -> New observation
- Critical path:
  1. Initialize data 𝒟ₙ₀
  2. Define low-dimensional search space 𝒮ₜ
  3. Extract LSoD ℰₜ based on contribution threshold
  4. Estimate kernel hyperparameters on ℰₜ
  5. Train LGPR model
  6. Maximize acquisition function in (𝒮ₜ ∩ 𝜒)
  7. Observe new point, augment data
  8. Repeat until budget exhausted
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Subspace dimension 𝑑ₜ: smaller 𝑑ₜ reduces search space but may miss optimum if too restrictive
  - LSoD size 𝑀ₜ: larger 𝑀ₜ improves accuracy but increases computation; too small loses global context
  - Switching strategy: global-first then local vs. local-only affects exploration-exploitation balance
- Failure signatures:
  - Regret stagnates or increases: subspace may be poorly chosen or LSoD too small
  - Computation time spikes: LSoD extraction or kernel hyperparameter estimation is too expensive
  - Acquisition function flat: kernel length scale too large relative to function variation
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement BOLDUC with 𝑑ₜ=1 and 𝑀=100 on Ackley function; compare regret to standard BO
  2. Vary LSoD size 𝑀 and measure trade-off between prediction accuracy and matrix inversion time
  3. Test adaptive switching by monitoring |𝒟ₜ| and switching from global to local GPR; evaluate impact on search efficiency

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How does the choice of kernel function (e.g., squared exponential, Matérn) affect the performance of BOLDUC compared to global GPR in high-dimensional spaces?
- How does the dimensionality of the local search space (𝒮𝑡) impact the effectiveness of BOLDUC in terms of search efficiency and prediction accuracy?
- How does the choice of threshold value (𝐶𝑡) in the LSoD extraction strategy 3 affect the trade-off between approximation accuracy and computational efficiency in BOLDUC?

## Limitations
- Limited experimental diversity with only two benchmark functions and one application case
- Unknown exact implementation details of LSoD extraction strategies and hyperparameter choices
- No comparison to recent state-of-the-art high-dimensional BO methods

## Confidence
- Medium: The paper presents a novel approach supported by mathematical derivations and benchmark evaluations, but lacks direct corpus evidence for key mechanisms and has limited experimental diversity.

## Next Checks
1. Ablation study: Remove LSoD and use full data GPR in BOLDUC; measure impact on prediction accuracy and computation time to confirm the local subset selection's benefit.
2. Hyperparameter sensitivity: Systematically vary M_t and d_t across a wider range of benchmark functions to assess robustness and identify optimal settings.
3. Comparison to state-of-the-art: Benchmark BOLDUC against recent high-dimensional BO methods (e.g., TuRBO, REMBO) on more diverse and higher-dimensional problems to validate scalability and efficiency claims.
