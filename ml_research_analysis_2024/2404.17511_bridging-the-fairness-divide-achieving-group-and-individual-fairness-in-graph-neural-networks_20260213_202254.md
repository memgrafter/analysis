# Bridging the Fairness Divide: Achieving Group and Individual Fairness in Graph Neural Networks

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2404.17511
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17511
- **Reference count:** 20
- **Key outcome:** Introduces FairGI, a novel framework that simultaneously addresses both group fairness and individual fairness within groups for graph neural networks.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses a critical gap in graph neural network fairness by proposing FairGI, a framework that achieves both group fairness and individual fairness within groups. Unlike existing methods that focus on only one type of fairness, FairGI introduces a new definition of individual fairness within groups and uses a similarity matrix to enforce it, while employing adversarial learning to achieve group fairness metrics like Equal Opportunity and Statistical Parity. The framework demonstrates superior performance across three real-world datasets, achieving the best results in both group fairness and individual fairness within groups while maintaining comparable prediction accuracy to baseline models.

## Method Summary
FairGI is a graph neural network framework that simultaneously addresses group fairness and individual fairness within groups. It employs a GAT-based node classifier with three key components: (1) a sensitive attribute classifier for estimating missing sensitive labels, (2) an adversarial learning layer to achieve group fairness by removing sensitive attribute information, and (3) a novel individual fairness within groups module that uses a similarity matrix to enforce Lipschitz continuity intra-group. The total loss function combines label prediction, group fairness, and individual fairness within groups losses, optimized through adversarial training. The framework is evaluated on three real-world graph datasets (Pokec-n, NBA, Credit) with binary sensitive attributes.

## Key Results
- FairGI achieves the best performance in both group fairness (SP, EO) and individual fairness within groups (MaxIG, IF) compared to state-of-the-art baselines
- The framework maintains comparable prediction accuracy (AUC, ACC) to baseline models while improving fairness metrics
- FairGI outperforms existing methods in population-level individual fairness, even though it only explicitly constrains individual fairness within groups

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
FairGI achieves both group and individual fairness by explicitly enforcing Lipschitz continuity within groups while using adversarial learning to mask sensitive attributes across groups. The model applies a novel individual fairness within groups loss that constrains the distance between embeddings of similar nodes only within the same demographic group, avoiding conflicts between group and individual fairness across groups.

### Mechanism 2
The adversarial learning component simultaneously optimizes both Equal Opportunity and Statistical Parity through a joint loss combining LA1 (for SP) and LA2 (for EO). The model trains an adversary to predict the sensitive attribute from node embeddings, using min-max optimization to force predictions that are independent of the sensitive attribute conditioned on both the label and not just the label.

### Mechanism 3
FairGI maintains comparable prediction accuracy to baseline models by decoupling fairness constraints from the primary classification objective. The total loss is a weighted sum of classification loss, group fairness loss, and individual fairness within groups loss, allowing tunable balance between fairness improvements and accuracy preservation.

## Foundational Learning

- **Graph Neural Networks basics (message passing, aggregation, update functions):** Essential for understanding how fairness constraints are applied to embeddings. Quick check: What are the three main steps in a standard GNN layer, and how do they differ from a traditional neural network layer?
- **Fairness definitions (group fairness: SP, EO; individual fairness: Lipschitz continuity):** Crucial to understand the problem and proposed solutions. Quick check: What is the key difference between Statistical Parity and Equal Opportunity, and why might a model satisfy one but not the other?
- **Adversarial learning and min-max optimization:** Essential for grasping how the model removes sensitive attribute information. Quick check: In adversarial debiasing, what is the role of the adversary, and what does it mean for the adversary to "win" the min-max game?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** GNN Classifier (GAT) -> Sensitive Attribute Classifier (GCN) -> Adversarial Layer -> Individual Fairness Module
- **Critical path:** Input graph → GNN Classifier (GAT) → Node Embeddings → (1) Label Prediction (Loss LC), (2) Adversarial Debiasing (Loss LG), (3) Intra-group Lipschitz (Loss LIfg) → Total Loss → Parameter Updates
- **Design tradeoffs:** Fairness vs. Accuracy (stronger constraints may reduce accuracy), Computational cost (adversarial training and similarity computation add overhead), Hyperparameter sensitivity (balancing multiple loss components requires careful tuning)
- **Failure signatures:** Accuracy drops significantly (fairness constraints too strong), Fairness metrics don't improve (poor similarity matrix or weak adversary), Training instability (adversarial min-max game not converging)
- **First 3 experiments:** 1) Train FairGI on a small synthetic graph with known sensitive attributes; 2) Compare FairGI's performance on Pokec-n against GCN/GAT baselines; 3) Perform ablation study removing intra-group Lipschitz constraint and adversarial debiasing

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does FairGI's performance scale with increasing graph size and complexity? The paper doesn't explicitly address scalability, and experiments don't provide insights into performance on larger, more complex graphs.

### Open Question 2
How does FairGI handle graphs with multiple sensitive attributes or attributes with more than two values? While the paper mentions the method can be extended, it doesn't provide implementation details or analyze the impact on performance.

### Open Question 3
What is the impact of the similarity matrix used for individual fairness within groups on overall performance? The paper introduces this novel component but doesn't analyze how different similarity matrix constructions affect performance.

## Limitations
- Claims about achieving both group and individual fairness simultaneously lack full empirical support and comparison with more recent individual fairness-specific models
- Insufficient details on similarity matrix construction, a critical component for individual fairness within groups
- Computational complexity and scalability to large graphs not discussed, potentially limiting practical applicability

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Group Fairness Mechanism | Medium |
| Individual Fairness Within Groups | Low |
| Accuracy-Maintaining Claim | Medium |

## Next Checks

1. **Empirical validation of individual fairness within groups:** Implement FairGI and verify that the intra-group Lipschitz constraint effectively reduces individual unfairness within groups compared to a baseline without this constraint.

2. **Scalability assessment:** Evaluate FairGI's computational complexity on large-scale graphs, identify bottlenecks, and compare with baseline models to assess practical scalability.

3. **Comparison with state-of-the-art:** Compare FairGI's performance with more recent individual fairness-specific models (e.g., GRAPHGINI) to evaluate its relative effectiveness in achieving both group and individual fairness simultaneously.
