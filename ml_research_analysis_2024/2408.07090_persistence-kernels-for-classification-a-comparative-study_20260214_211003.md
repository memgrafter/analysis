# Persistence kernels for classification: A comparative study

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.07090
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07090
- Authors: Cinzia Bandiziol; Stefano De Marchi
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Five persistence kernels (PSSK, PWGK, SWK, PFK, PI) show comparable classification performance, with SWK offering computational advantages through parameter-independent precomputation

## Executive Summary
This study provides a systematic comparison of five persistence kernels for topological data analysis-based classification across diverse data types including proteins, shapes, images, graphs, and time series. The research addresses the challenge of selecting appropriate persistence kernels and their parameters for effective classification. Through extensive experimentation, the authors find that while all kernels achieve comparable accuracy, the Sliced Wasserstein Kernel (SWK) demonstrates slight performance advantages and significant computational benefits through its parameter-independent preGram matrix computation.

## Method Summary
The study applies five different persistence kernels (PSSK, PWGK, SWK, PFK, PI) to compute kernel matrices from persistence diagrams, then uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification with 10-fold cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning. For each dataset, the authors compute persistence diagrams using appropriate filtrations (Vietoris-Rips for point clouds, height filtration for images, shortest path/Jaccard for graphs, Taken's embedding for time series), implement the five kernels with specified parameter ranges, train SVM classifiers, and evaluate on test sets. The computational advantage of SWK's parameter-independent preGram matrix is specifically analyzed.

## Key Results
- All five persistence kernels (PSSK, PWGK, SWK, PFK, PI) demonstrate comparable classification accuracy across diverse datasets
- SWK shows slight performance advantages in many cases while offering significant computational benefits
- SWK's parameter-independent preGram matrix can be computed once on the entire dataset, reducing computational costs compared to other kernels requiring parameter-dependent computations
- The study provides practical guidance for kernel parameter selection across different data structures and classification tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: SWK provides a computational advantage through its parameter-independent preGram matrix
- Mechanism: The SWK's preGram matrix can be computed once on the entire dataset and reused across different parameter settings, reducing computational overhead compared to other kernels that require parameter-dependent recomputation
- Core assumption: The Sliced Wasserstein distance formulation allows for precomputation of distance metrics that are independent of the bandwidth parameter η
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "A significant computational advantage of SWK is identified: its parameter-independent preGram matrix can be computed once on the entire dataset, reducing computational costs compared to other kernels that require parameter-dependent computations"
  - [section] "The Sliced Wasserstein Kernel (SWK) shows slight advantages in many cases"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Different persistence kernels extract comparable topological features from data, leading to similar classification performance
- Mechanism: All kernels map persistence diagrams to Hilbert spaces where inner products can be computed, preserving the essential topological information needed for classification tasks
- Core assumption: The different mathematical formulations (PSSK's heat equation solution, PWGK's Gaussian weighting, SWK's Wasserstein geometry, PFK's Fisher information, PI's vectorization) capture equivalent topological features despite different representations
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The primary finding reveals that while all kernels demonstrate comparable performance in terms of accuracy"
  - [section] "we introduce five different kernels that are then used to compare their performances of classification on various datasets"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: SVM classification performance is maintained across different kernel parameter settings due to robustness in the margin optimization
- Mechanism: The SVM optimization problem is relatively insensitive to small variations in kernel parameter values when the underlying data structure is well-separated in feature space
- Core assumption: The regularization parameter C and kernel parameter tuning work synergistically to maintain classification boundaries
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "For each kernel, we have considered the following values for the parameters" and subsequent parameter tuning analysis
  - [section] "we applied a random splitting (70%/30%) for training and test and applied a 10-fold Cross Validation on the training set for the hyperparameters tuning"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) and Persistent Homology
  - Why needed here: Understanding how TDA extracts topological features from complex data is fundamental to understanding why persistence kernels work
  - Quick check question: What are the three main types of topological features captured by persistent homology and what do they represent in data?

- Concept: Kernel Methods and Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS)
  - Why needed here: Persistence kernels map persistence diagrams to RKHS where SVM classification can be performed
  - Quick check question: How does the "kernel trick" enable computation in high-dimensional feature spaces without explicit mapping?

- Concept: Support Vector Machine (SVM) Optimization
  - Why needed here: Understanding the SVM formulation helps explain why different kernels can achieve comparable performance
  - Quick check question: What role do support vectors play in the SVM decision boundary?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing → Filtration construction → Persistence diagram computation → Kernel matrix computation → SVM training and classification
- Key libraries: gudhi, ripser, giotto-tda, persim for TDA; scikit-learn for SVM
- Parameter space exploration for each kernel type

- Critical path: Compute persistence diagrams (ripser/gudhi) → Compute kernel Gram matrix (kernel-specific implementation) → Train SVM with cross-validation (scikit-learn) → Evaluate on test set → Iterate parameter tuning

- Design tradeoffs: Computational cost vs accuracy: SWK offers parameter-independent precomputation advantage; Feature representation: Different kernels capture topological information differently; Memory usage: Large datasets may require subsampling or approximation methods

- Failure signatures: High condition numbers in Gram matrices indicate ill-conditioned kernel parameters; Degenerate persistence diagrams (all points on diagonal) suggest inappropriate filtration; SVM convergence issues may indicate kernel parameter selection problems

- First 3 experiments: 1) Reproduce results on MNIST dataset using SWK with varying η parameters; 2) Compare PSSK vs PWGK performance on protein classification dataset; 3) Test parameter-independent preGram computation advantage of SWK on graph datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- The study demonstrates comparable performance across all five kernels but does not establish statistical significance of the observed differences in classification accuracy
- Computational advantage of SWK's preGram matrix assumes efficient memory management for large datasets, which is not explicitly validated
- Parameter sensitivity analysis focuses on individual kernel parameters without examining interactions between kernel choice and SVM hyperparameters

## Confidence
- High Confidence: The comparative methodology and experimental design are sound; the computational advantage of SWK's preGram matrix is well-supported by the mathematical formulation
- Medium Confidence: Claims about SWK's slight performance advantages require more rigorous statistical testing to confirm significance
- Medium Confidence: The generalizability of findings across diverse data types is supported by the multi-dataset approach but could benefit from additional validation on novel data structures

## Next Checks
1. Perform statistical significance testing (e.g., paired t-tests with Bonferroni correction) on classification accuracy differences between kernel types across all datasets
2. Implement memory profiling experiments to verify the practical computational advantage of SWK's preGram matrix on datasets of varying sizes
3. Conduct ablation studies removing the parameter-independent precomputation advantage to isolate the contribution of SWK's mathematical formulation to its performance
