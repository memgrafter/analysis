# Representations as Language: An Information-Theoretic Framework for Interpretability

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2406.02449
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02449
- Reference count: 10
- Key outcome: This paper addresses the challenge of interpreting the internal representations learned by transformer models, which are often viewed as black-boxes. The authors propose a novel information-theoretic framework that quantifies the structure of these representations with respect to the input. By discretizing vector representations into sequences of symbols, they measure four properties: information (compression), variation, regularity, and disentanglement. The framework reveals two distinct phases of training: an initial phase of in-distribution learning characterized by alignment and disentanglement, followed by a longer phase where representations become more robust to noise and compressed. The authors show that larger models compress their representations more than smaller ones, and that representational structure correlates with generalization performance.

## Executive Summary
This paper tackles the fundamental interpretability challenge of understanding what transformer models learn by proposing a novel information-theoretic framework. The authors introduce a method that discretizes continuous vector representations into sequences of symbols, enabling quantitative analysis of representational structure through four key properties: information (compression), variation, regularity, and disentanglement. By analyzing these properties across training, they reveal two distinct phases: an initial phase focused on alignment and disentanglement, followed by a longer phase emphasizing contextualization and compression.

The framework provides actionable insights for both researchers and practitioners, showing that larger models achieve greater compression and that representational structure correlates with generalization performance. The approach is validated on synthetic semantic parsing datasets designed to test compositional generalization, though the authors acknowledge the need for further validation on natural language data. This work represents a significant step toward making transformer representations interpretable through principled information-theoretic measures.

## Method Summary
The authors develop an information-theoretic framework that treats vector representations as sequences of symbols through discretization, enabling quantitative analysis of representational structure. The framework measures four key properties: information (how well representations compress the input), variation (diversity across examples), regularity (consistency across transformations), and disentanglement (separation of distinct information channels). By applying this framework to transformer models during training, the authors identify two distinct phases: an initial phase characterized by alignment with input structure and disentanglement of information, followed by a longer phase where representations become more compressed and robust to noise. The method involves computing these measures at different training stages and correlating them with performance metrics.

## Key Results
- The framework reveals two distinct training phases in transformers: an initial phase of in-distribution learning with alignment and disentanglement, followed by a longer phase of contextualization and compression
- Larger transformer models compress their representations more effectively than smaller ones, achieving greater information efficiency
- Representational structure as measured by the framework correlates with generalization performance, particularly for compositional generalization tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by discretizing continuous high-dimensional representations into symbolic sequences, allowing application of information-theoretic measures that quantify how information is structured and processed. By measuring compression, the method captures how efficiently models encode relevant information while discarding noise. Variation measures capture the diversity of representations across different inputs, while regularity quantifies consistency under transformations. Disentanglement measures how well distinct information channels are separated. These measures together provide a comprehensive picture of representational structure that correlates with model behavior and performance.

## Foundational Learning
- **Information Theory**: Measures of entropy, compression, and mutual information are essential for understanding how representations encode and preserve information from inputs
  - Why needed: The framework fundamentally relies on quantifying information content and efficiency in representations
  - Quick check: Can you explain the difference between Shannon entropy and compression ratio?

- **Vector Discretization**: Converting continuous vector representations into discrete symbol sequences enables application of symbolic information measures
  - Why needed: Continuous representations cannot be directly analyzed using traditional information-theoretic tools designed for discrete symbols
  - Quick check: How does vector quantization affect the information content of representations?

- **Compositional Generalization**: The ability to systematically generalize to novel combinations of known components is a key benchmark for understanding representation quality
  - Why needed: The framework's validity is tested on tasks specifically designed to measure compositional generalization
  - Quick check: What distinguishes compositional generalization from other forms of generalization?

- **Transformer Architecture**: Understanding self-attention mechanisms and how they transform input representations is crucial for interpreting the framework's findings
  - Why needed: The analysis focuses on transformer models, requiring understanding of their unique properties
  - Quick check: How do self-attention mechanisms affect the geometry of representation space?

- **Training Dynamics**: The identification of distinct training phases requires understanding how optimization progresses over time
  - Why needed: The framework's insights about phase transitions depend on tracking changes during training
  - Quick check: What characterizes the difference between early and late stages of transformer training?

## Architecture Onboarding
- **Component Map**: Input data -> Transformer encoder/decoder -> High-dimensional continuous representations -> Discretization module -> Symbolic sequences -> Information-theoretic measures (information, variation, regularity, disentanglement) -> Interpretability insights
- **Critical Path**: The most critical path is the transformation from continuous representations to discretized symbols, as this enables all subsequent information-theoretic analysis
- **Design Tradeoffs**: The discretization process involves a fundamental tradeoff between preserving information content and enabling tractable analysis; finer discretization preserves more information but increases computational complexity
- **Failure Signatures**: If the framework fails to reveal meaningful structure, it may indicate that the discretization granularity is inappropriate, the representations are too entangled, or the model hasn't learned meaningful structure
- **First Experiments**:
  1. Apply the framework to a pre-trained BERT model on a simple synthetic dataset to verify the two-phase training dynamic
  2. Compare information-theoretic measures across different layer depths within the same transformer to identify where representational structure emerges
  3. Test the framework on a non-transformer architecture (e.g., LSTM) to validate its generalizability beyond transformers

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the two-phase training dynamic (alignment and disentanglement vs. contextualisation and compression) generalize across different architectures beyond Transformers?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors identify two distinct phases of training in Transformers but note their approach could be applied to other architectures
- Why unresolved: The analysis was only conducted on Transformer models; other architectures may exhibit different training dynamics
- What evidence would resolve it: Replicating this information-theoretic analysis framework on RNNs, CNNs, and other architectures to compare phase characteristics

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the causal relationship between representational compression and generalization performance - does compression enable generalization or is it merely correlated?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors observe that larger models compress more and generalize better, but note this relationship during Phase 2
- Why unresolved: The analysis shows correlation between compression and generalization but cannot establish causation due to observational nature
- What evidence would resolve it: Intervention studies that artificially manipulate compression levels during training while controlling for other variables

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the representational structure learned by models differ when trained on natural versus synthetic language data?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors use synthetic semantic parsing datasets (SLOG, CFQ-MCD) specifically designed to test compositional generalization
- Why unresolved: The study only examines synthetic datasets; real-world language data may exhibit different structural patterns
- What evidence would resolve it: Applying the same information-theoretic measures to models trained on natural language corpora like Wikipedia or news articles

## Limitations
- The discretization process may lose important continuous information present in high-dimensional representations, particularly for complex linguistic phenomena
- The study focuses primarily on BERT and GPT-2 architectures, limiting generalizability to other transformer variants or non-transformer models
- The correlation between representational structure and generalization performance, while intriguing, requires further investigation to establish causation rather than mere association

## Confidence
- Framework methodology and four-property measurement system: **High**
- Two-phase training characterization: **Medium** (based on specific architectures studied)
- Compression differences between model sizes: **Medium** (needs broader validation)
- Correlation with generalization performance: **Low-Medium** (correlation does not imply causation)

## Next Checks
1. Apply the framework to a diverse set of transformer architectures (including non-English models, vision transformers, and encoder-decoder models) to test generalizability.
2. Conduct ablation studies removing different properties (information, variation, regularity, disentanglement) to determine their individual contributions to interpretability and performance.
3. Design controlled experiments where representational structure is explicitly manipulated to test whether it directly causes changes in generalization performance, rather than merely correlating with it.
