# BinaryAlign: Word Alignment as Binary Sequence Labeling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.12881
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12881
- Reference count: 26
- Primary result: Outperforms state-of-the-art word alignment methods in zero-shot, few-shot, and supervised settings

## Executive Summary
BinaryAlign proposes a novel reformulation of word alignment as a binary sequence labeling task, where each word pair is classified as either aligned or not aligned. This approach leverages masked language models (mPLMs) to predict binary alignment labels for all possible word pairs between parallel sentences. The method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across multiple language pairs and settings, achieving significant improvements in alignment error rate (AER) over previous approaches. BinaryAlign shows particular strength in zero-shot cross-lingual transfer and handles complex alignment scenarios more effectively than traditional methods.

## Method Summary
BinaryAlign reformulates word alignment as a binary classification problem between word pairs in parallel sentences. The method uses masked language models to encode sentence pairs and then applies binary classifiers to determine if each word pair should be aligned. A thresholding mechanism filters predictions, and a confidence score based on logit differences helps refine alignments. The approach can operate in fully supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot settings by leveraging cross-lingual transfer from the mPLM's pre-training. Training uses a simple binary cross-entropy loss, and inference follows a straightforward predict-then-filter pipeline that makes the method both efficient and effective.

## Key Results
- Achieves 3.0 point average improvement in AER over previous state-of-the-art in zero-shot cross-lingual transfer
- Demonstrates strong performance on non-English language pairs, including challenging ones like Chinese-English and Japanese-English
- Outperforms existing methods in handling complex alignment scenarios such as untranslated words and one-to-multiple alignments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
BinaryAlign's effectiveness stems from treating word alignment as a binary classification problem rather than the traditional discriminative approach. By leveraging the cross-lingual capabilities of masked language models, the method can transfer alignment knowledge across languages even without parallel training data. The binary formulation simplifies the alignment decision to a series of independent predictions, which are then filtered and refined through thresholding and confidence scoring. This approach benefits from the mPLM's ability to capture semantic relationships between words in different languages, enabling accurate alignments even for distant language pairs.

## Foundational Learning

**Masked Language Models**: Pre-trained models that can predict masked tokens in context; needed for cross-lingual understanding and semantic representation; quick check: can the model complete masked words accurately in both languages.

**Binary Classification**: Task of categorizing inputs into two classes; needed to simplify the alignment decision process; quick check: can the classifier distinguish aligned from non-aligned pairs with reasonable accuracy.

**Cross-lingual Transfer**: Ability to apply knowledge from one language to another; needed for zero-shot and few-shot performance; quick check: does performance on unseen language pairs exceed random baseline.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Parallel sentences -> Tokenizer -> mPLM encoder -> Binary classifier (per word pair) -> Thresholding -> Confidence scoring -> Final alignments

**Critical Path**: Tokenization and encoding → Binary classification → Thresholding and filtering → Output generation

**Design Tradeoffs**: Binary classification simplifies the problem but requires post-processing for alignment constraints; threshold tuning balances precision and recall; confidence scoring adds complexity but improves quality.

**Failure Signatures**: Over-alignment occurs with low threshold; under-alignment with high threshold; poor cross-lingual transfer shows random alignment patterns; tokenization mismatches cause word boundary errors.

**First 3 Experiments**: 1) Evaluate binary classifier accuracy on a development set 2) Test threshold sensitivity on validation data 3) Compare confidence scoring against baseline threshold-only approach

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None specified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- Performance on truly low-resource languages not seen during mPLM pre-training remains untested
- Limited comparison with other state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot setting (only VecAlign mentioned)
- Evaluation relies on gold-standard alignments that may not reflect real-world complexity

## Confidence
- **High confidence** in technical implementation and experimental methodology for tested language pairs
- **Medium confidence** in generalizability to truly low-resource languages
- **Medium confidence** in claimed improvements given limited baseline comparisons

## Next Checks
1. Test BinaryAlign on additional low-resource language pairs not included in FLORES-200 to assess true cross-lingual transfer capabilities

2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of binary classification approach and training objectives to performance gains

3. Evaluate performance on domain-specific parallel corpora to assess robustness to domain shift and specialized terminology handling
