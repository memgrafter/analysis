# Multiobjective Optimization Analysis for Finding Infrastructure-as-Code Deployment Configurations

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.09983
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09983
- Reference count: 37
- Primary result: NSGA-II excels for two-objective IaC problems, while NSGA-III performs better for three-objective problems, leading to a proposed multi-algorithm IOP system

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a multiobjective optimization analysis to determine the best evolutionary algorithm for optimizing Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) deployment configurations. The IaC Optimizer Platform (IOP) aims to find optimal deployment configurations that balance multiple objectives such as cost, availability, and performance. The study compares nine multiobjective evolutionary algorithms on 12 problem instances derived from real-world scenarios. Results show that NSGA-II performs best overall for two-objective problems, while NSGA-III excels for three-objective problems. Based on these findings, the authors propose implementing IOP as a multi-algorithm system that dynamically selects between NSGA-II and NSGA-III depending on the number of objectives to optimize.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates nine evolutionary algorithms (NSGA-II, NSGA-III, SPEA2, SMSEMOA, MOMBI, MOMBI2, MoCell, GWASFGA, WASFGA) on 12 DOML problem instances with 2-3 objectives. Each algorithm is run 10 times with a population size of 50 and maximum 2500 evaluations. Performance is measured using the hypervolume indicator, and statistical significance is assessed using Friedman's test. The IOP uses a DOML parser to extract requirements and an Infrastructure Elements Catalog (IEC) containing 99 VMs, 24 DBs, and 33 STs to generate deployment configurations.

## Key Results
- NSGA-II achieved the highest hypervolume scores for two-objective optimization problems
- NSGA-III outperformed other algorithms for three-objective optimization problems
- The proposed multi-algorithm IOP system that dynamically selects between NSGA-II and NSGA-III based on objective count shows promise for real-world deployment scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: NSGA-II outperforms other algorithms for two-objective optimization problems in IaC deployment configuration.
- Mechanism: NSGA-II uses fast non-dominated sorting and crowding distance to efficiently find and maintain diverse Pareto-optimal solutions when the objective space is two-dimensional.
- Core assumption: The Pareto front for two-objective IaC problems is relatively simple and well-behaved, allowing NSGA-II's sorting and crowding distance mechanisms to excel.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Results show that NSGA-II performs best overall for two-objective problems"
  - [section]: "Analyzing the results provided by the Friedman's test, we can certify that the best performing technique along the whole benchmark is the NSGA-II"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence comparing NSGA-II specifically to other algorithms for two-objective problems.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: NSGA-III outperforms other algorithms for three-objective optimization problems in IaC deployment configuration.
- Mechanism: NSGA-III uses reference-point-based selection which better handles the increased complexity of three-dimensional objective spaces by maintaining diversity across multiple reference directions.
- Core assumption: The Pareto front for three-objective IaC problems benefits from explicit diversity maintenance across reference directions rather than crowding distance.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "while NSGA-III excels for three-objective problems"
  - [section]: "Despite NSGA-II is, in overall, the method that performs better for the whole benchmark, if we undertake a separate analysis we see that NSGA-III behaves better for instances where the number of objectives to be optimized is three."
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence supporting NSGA-III's superiority specifically for three-objective problems in this domain.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Multi-algorithm system dynamically selecting between NSGA-II and NSGA-III based on objective count optimizes overall IOP performance.
- Mechanism: By matching algorithm strengths to problem dimensionality, the system leverages each algorithm's comparative advantage, achieving better results than using a single algorithm for all problem types.
- Core assumption: The problem instances in the IOP can be reliably classified by objective count, and this classification aligns with the algorithms' performance characteristics.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section]: "As a final conclusion, and after carrying out the experimentation described in this study, we determine that the most appropriate way for implementing the IOP is to convert it into a multi-method system"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence for multi-algorithm systems in IaC optimization specifically.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multiobjective optimization and Pareto optimality
  - Why needed here: The entire IOP system is built around finding optimal trade-offs between competing objectives like cost, availability, and performance.
  - Quick check question: What makes a solution "Pareto optimal" in the context of IaC deployment configurations?

- Concept: Evolutionary algorithms and their mechanisms
  - Why needed here: The paper tests nine different evolutionary algorithms, each with specific mechanisms for maintaining diversity and convergence in the objective space.
  - Quick check question: How does NSGA-II's crowding distance mechanism differ from NSGA-III's reference-point approach?

- Concept: Hypervolume as a performance metric
  - Why needed here: Hypervolume is used to quantify the quality of solution sets found by different algorithms, providing a single scalar value for comparison.
  - Quick check question: What does a higher hypervolume value indicate about the quality of solutions found by an algorithm?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - DOML parser -> IEC -> Multi-algorithm selector -> NSGA-II engine or NSGA-III engine -> Result formatter

- Critical path:
  1. User submits DOML file
  2. DOML parser extracts requirements and counts objectives
  3. Multi-algorithm selector chooses appropriate algorithm
  4. Selected algorithm runs optimization using IEC data
  5. Results are formatted and returned to user

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Single vs. multi-algorithm approach: While a single algorithm would be simpler, the multi-algorithm approach achieves better performance at the cost of increased system complexity.
  - Algorithm selection criteria: Currently based solely on objective count, but could potentially incorporate other factors like problem size or specific objective types.

- Failure signatures:
  - Consistently poor hypervolume scores across all algorithms might indicate issues with the IEC data or DOML parsing.
  - One algorithm consistently underperforming could suggest parameterization issues or incompatibility with certain problem types.
  - Failure to find feasible solutions might indicate overly restrictive requirements or insufficient element diversity in the IEC.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the multi-algorithm selector by running identical DOML files with 2 and 3 objectives through the system, verifying correct algorithm selection.
  2. Compare hypervolume scores of the multi-algorithm system against a baseline using only NSGA-II for all problem types.
  3. Stress test the IEC integration by creating DOML files that require elements not present in the catalog, verifying graceful handling of such cases.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
- How would the IOP perform when dealing with noisy objective functions that are common in real-world deployment scenarios?
- Would the proposed multi-algorithm system maintain its superiority when applied to different problem domains beyond IaC deployment?
- How would the IOP perform when scaling to problems with more than three objectives?

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to 12 problem instances with only 2-3 objectives
- Hypervolume metric may not capture all aspects of solution quality relevant to IaC deployments
- DOML instances and IEC catalog specifications are not publicly available, limiting reproducibility

## Confidence
- NSGA-II performance on two-objective problems: High confidence
- NSGA-III performance on three-objective problems: Medium confidence
- Multi-algorithm system effectiveness: Medium confidence

## Next Checks
1. Validate algorithm performance on additional DOML instances with 4+ objectives to test the generalizability of the two/three-objective classification system and identify potential performance breakpoints.
2. Conduct user studies with DevOps practitioners to assess whether the solutions found by NSGA-II and NSGA-III align with practical deployment priorities and constraints not captured in the current objective set.
3. Compare the proposed multi-algorithm IOP system against alternative approaches such as decomposition-based methods (MOEA/D) or recently developed algorithms like HypE to establish relative effectiveness across diverse IaC scenarios.
