# A Comprehensive Evaluation of Large Language Models on Temporal Event Forecasting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.11638
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11638
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Fine-tuning LLMs with raw texts significantly improves zero-shot extrapolation performance in temporal event forecasting, while RAG modules help capture temporal relational patterns but introduce popularity bias.

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) for temporal event forecasting using a newly constructed MidEast-TE-mini dataset. The authors explore various approaches including zero-shot prompting, fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation to predict future events based on historical patterns. Through extensive experiments with different LLM architectures and input formats, they identify that fine-tuning with raw text significantly improves performance while retrieval modules help capture temporal patterns. The study also reveals persistent challenges with popularity bias and the long-tail problem, particularly affecting rare entities in the forecasting task.

## Method Summary
The authors constructed a high-quality temporal event dataset (MidEast-TE-mini) by extracting structured events from news articles using GPT-4. They designed multiple baseline methods incorporating different input formats: graph-based representations, raw text, and retrieval-augmented approaches. The evaluation framework tested zero-shot prompting versus fine-tuning scenarios using open-source LLMs (LLaMA2-7b, Vicuna-7b) and GPT-3.5-turbo. Fine-tuning was performed using instruction tuning with QLoRA on task-specific data. The retrieval module used embeddings from LLMs to retrieve relevant historical news text as contextual information for forecasting. Performance was measured by accuracy on predicting missing object entities or relations in future events.

## Key Results
- Fine-tuning LLMs with raw texts significantly improves zero-shot extrapolation performance compared to zero-shot prompting
- Retrieval-augmented generation helps LLMs capture temporal relational patterns hidden in historical events
- Popularity bias and long-tail problems persist in LLMs, with sparse entities showing lower performance especially in RAG methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Fine-tuning LLMs with raw texts significantly improves zero-shot extrapolation performance in temporal event forecasting. Supervised instruction fine-tuning adapts LLMs to capture temporal relational patterns better than zero-shot prompting, especially when the training data includes rich textual context. The core assumption is that the model's internal knowledge alone is insufficient for accurate temporal reasoning; fine-tuning bridges this gap by exposing the model to domain-specific patterns. Evidence shows that open-source models like LLaMA2-7b and Vicuna-7b perform significantly worse than GPT-3.5-turbo in zero-shot settings but show significant performance gains after fine-tuning. This mechanism may break if fine-tuning data is noisy or unrepresentative of the target domain, or if over-tuning on small datasets risks overfitting.

### Mechanism 2
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances LLM-based event forecasting by incorporating relevant historical context. RAG retrieves contextually relevant historical events or news summaries and injects them into the LLM prompt, reducing hallucination and grounding predictions in factual evidence. The core assumption is that relevant historical context improves forecasting accuracy more than raw internal knowledge alone. Evidence shows that enhanced with retrieval modules, LLMs can effectively capture temporal relational patterns hidden in historical events. This mechanism may break if retrieval is noisy or biased, potentially degrading performance, or if the retrieval scope is too broad and introduces irrelevant noise.

### Mechanism 3
Popularity bias affects forecasting accuracy, with sparse entities yielding lower performance. Models trained on imbalanced datasets overfit to frequent entities, leading to poor generalization on rare/long-tail events; LLMs without fine-tuning are more robust to this bias. The core assumption is that entity frequency distribution in training data directly impacts model performance on underrepresented entities. Evidence shows that LLMs without fine-tuning are more robust to popularity bias, being able to generate better results for long-tail sparse entities. This mechanism may break if dataset rebalancing or specialized sampling is applied to mitigate the observed bias.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs)
  - Why needed here: The core data structure representing events as (subject, relation, object, timestamp) quadruples
  - Quick check question: What is the minimal representation of an atomic event in a TKG?

- **Concept**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  - Why needed here: Method for augmenting LLM prompts with retrieved evidence to reduce hallucination
  - Quick check question: How does RAG differ from standard prompting in terms of context injection?

- **Concept**: Popularity Bias / Long-tail Problem
  - Why needed here: Explains performance disparity between frequent and rare entities in forecasting
  - Quick check question: Why might an LLM without fine-tuning outperform a fine-tuned model on sparse entities?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Event extraction -> Dataset construction -> Retrieval module (BM25/Contriever/LlamaIndex) -> LLM backbone (GPT-3.5-turbo/LLaMA2-7b/Vicuna-7b) -> Fine-tuning pipeline (QLoRA) -> Evaluation
- **Critical path**: Event extraction → Dataset construction → Model training/evaluation → Analysis of bias and retrieval effects
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Fine-tuning vs. zero-shot: Fine-tuning improves accuracy but risks overfitting; zero-shot is more generalizable but less accurate
  - Retrieval scope: Narrower (complex event) retrieval improves precision but may miss broader context; global retrieval adds noise
  - Text vs. graph input: Text provides detail but increases reasoning complexity; graph is structured but may lack nuance
- **Failure signatures**: Accuracy drops when retrieval introduces irrelevant context; fine-tuned models show large performance gaps on sparse entities; open-source LLMs underperform GPT-4 in zero-shot settings
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Compare zero-shot vs. fine-tuned performance on a held-out validation set
  2. Test retrieval model variants (BM25, Contriever, LlamaIndex) on the same forecasting task
  3. Analyze performance across entity frequency bins to quantify popularity bias

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How can retrieval models be specifically designed for temporal event forecasting to better handle unstructured news articles? The paper discusses the effectiveness of retrieval modules but highlights that current text-based retrieval models may constrain the effectiveness of the retrieval process. This is unresolved because current retrieval models are not optimized for the unique challenges of temporal event forecasting, such as handling large volumes of unstructured news articles and capturing temporal relationships. Development and evaluation of retrieval models specifically designed for temporal event forecasting, showing improved performance compared to existing models, would resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
What methods can be developed to mitigate popularity bias and long-tail issues in temporal event forecasting using LLMs? The paper identifies severe popularity bias and long-tail issues, particularly in graph-based retrieval, affecting the forecasting performance. This is unresolved because current methods do not adequately address the imbalance in entity occurrence frequencies, leading to poorer performance on less frequent entities. Introduction of techniques that balance the influence of popular and rare entities, demonstrating improved accuracy across all entity frequency groups, would resolve this question.

### Open Question 3
How does the performance of LLM-based temporal event forecasting methods compare across different domains and larger, more diverse datasets? The paper acknowledges the limitation of evaluating on small-scale, noisy datasets in specific domains, which may not generalize well. This is unresolved because the study's findings are based on a limited dataset, and it's unclear how these methods would perform in other domains or with larger, cleaner datasets. Comparative studies using larger, more diverse datasets across multiple domains, showing consistent performance trends and identifying domain-specific challenges, would resolve this question.

## Limitations
- Evaluation relies heavily on a single-region dataset (Middle East), limiting generalizability to other geopolitical contexts
- Study does not explicitly address potential biases in GPT-4's event extraction process, which could systematically affect dataset quality
- Claims about popularity bias and long-tail problems are mentioned but not thoroughly quantified or analyzed in depth

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The core finding that fine-tuning improves zero-shot extrapolation performance is well-supported by experimental results showing consistent gains across multiple open-source LLMs.

**Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is supported by results, but the analysis could be strengthened by more detailed error analysis and ablation studies on retrieval components.

**Low Confidence**: The claims about popularity bias and long-tail problems are mentioned but not thoroughly quantified or analyzed in depth, making it difficult to assess the magnitude and impact of these issues.

## Next Checks

1. **Dataset Bias Analysis**: Conduct an analysis of the MidEast-TE-m dataset to quantify potential biases in event extraction and ensure the dataset is representative of the underlying news corpus.

2. **Retrieval Ablation Study**: Perform a detailed ablation study on the retrieval components (BM25, Contriever, LlamaIndex) to isolate their individual contributions to forecasting accuracy and identify sources of noise or bias.

3. **Cross-Region Generalization Test**: Evaluate the trained models on a held-out dataset from a different geopolitical region to assess the generalizability of the findings and identify any region-specific biases or limitations.
