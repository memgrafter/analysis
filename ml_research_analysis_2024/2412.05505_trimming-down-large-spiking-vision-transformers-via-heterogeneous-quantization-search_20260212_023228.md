# Trimming Down Large Spiking Vision Transformers via Heterogeneous Quantization Search

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2412.05505
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05505
- **Reference count**: 4
- **Primary result**: SpikeHQ reduces effective resolution to 3.14-3.67 bits with <1% accuracy drop on DVS Gesture and CIFAR10-DVS

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces SpikeHQ, a heterogeneous quantization method designed to compress spiking transformers for event-based vision tasks. The approach uses neural architecture search to determine optimal layer-wise quantization schemes, selecting between uniform and power-of-two quantization with mixed bit resolutions. The method achieves significant model compression (8.71x-10.19x) and energy reduction (5.69x-10.2x) while maintaining competitive accuracy across multiple datasets including N-Caltech101, DVS-Gesture, and CIFAR10-DVS.

## Method Summary
SpikeHQ employs a neural architecture search framework to find the optimal quantization strategy for each layer of spiking transformers. The method explores both uniform and power-of-two quantization schemes with mixed bit resolutions, automatically determining which quantization approach works best for each layer. This heterogeneous approach allows for fine-grained control over the compression-accuracy tradeoff, enabling aggressive compression of less sensitive layers while preserving high precision where needed. The search process identifies specific bottleneck layers that require higher-precision weights, providing insights for future efficiency improvements.

## Key Results
- Reduces average effective resolution to 3.14-3.67 bits across tested models
- Achieves 8.71x-10.19x model compression with less than 1% accuracy drop
- Delivers 5.69x-10.2x energy reduction on DVS Gesture and CIFAR10-DVS datasets
- Identifies specific bottleneck layers that require high-precision weights

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
SpikeHQ's effectiveness stems from its heterogeneous approach that recognizes different layers in spiking transformers have varying sensitivity to quantization. By using neural architecture search to automatically determine the optimal quantization scheme for each layer, the method can apply aggressive compression where it has minimal impact on accuracy while preserving precision in critical layers. The combination of uniform and power-of-two quantization options provides flexibility to match the quantization strategy to the characteristics of each layer's weights. This targeted approach allows SpikeHQ to achieve substantial compression without the accuracy degradation typically seen with uniform quantization across all layers.

## Foundational Learning

**Spiking Neural Networks**: Event-driven neural networks that communicate via discrete spikes, offering energy efficiency advantages for neuromorphic hardware. *Why needed*: Understanding the fundamental difference from traditional neural networks in how information propagates. *Quick check*: Verify that spiking networks use temporal encoding rather than continuous activation values.

**Event-based Vision**: Vision systems that process asynchronous events rather than traditional frame-based inputs, capturing changes in illumination at each pixel independently. *Why needed*: Context for why these models are important and what datasets are used. *Quick check*: Confirm that DVS datasets contain temporal event streams rather than static images.

**Neural Architecture Search (NAS)**: Automated method for discovering optimal neural network architectures or configurations by exploring a search space and evaluating candidate solutions. *Why needed*: Core mechanism behind SpikeHQ's ability to find optimal quantization schemes. *Quick check*: Understand that NAS here searches quantization configurations rather than network architectures.

**Quantization Schemes**: Methods for reducing the precision of neural network weights, including uniform quantization (linear mapping to fixed bit-width) and power-of-two quantization (restricting weights to powers of two). *Why needed*: Different schemes have different hardware efficiency and accuracy characteristics. *Quick check*: Recognize that power-of-two quantization enables more efficient fixed-point implementations.

**Heterogeneous vs. Homogeneous Quantization**: Heterogeneous applies different quantization strategies to different layers, while homogeneous applies the same scheme everywhere. *Why needed*: SpikeHQ's key innovation is recognizing that one-size-fits-all approaches are suboptimal. *Quick check*: Compare the flexibility and potential gains of heterogeneous approaches against simpler homogeneous methods.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Spike transformer layers -> Neural Architecture Search engine -> Quantization selection module -> Optimized quantized model

**Critical Path**: The quantization search process that determines layer-wise quantization schemes, as this directly impacts both model size and accuracy. The identification of bottleneck layers requiring high precision is also critical for understanding where future efficiency gains are possible.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The method trades increased search time and computational resources for the ability to achieve superior compression ratios. By allowing different quantization schemes per layer, it sacrifices the simplicity and uniformity of homogeneous approaches for better overall performance.

**Failure Signatures**: Potential failures include the search getting stuck in local optima, overestimating energy savings (since they're estimated rather than measured), or applying too aggressive quantization to sensitive layers leading to accuracy degradation beyond the 1% threshold.

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Apply SpikeHQ to a simple spiking transformer on CIFAR10-DVS to verify basic functionality
2. Compare homogeneous vs. heterogeneous quantization on the same model to quantify the benefits of the approach
3. Test SpikeHQ on a single layer at a time to understand which layers are most sensitive to quantization

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Generalizability to different spiking transformer architectures beyond tested variants is uncertain
- Energy savings are estimated rather than directly measured, introducing uncertainty about real-world benefits
- The search process requires additional computational resources and time, potentially limiting practical applicability
- The 1% accuracy drop threshold may not be acceptable for all application domains requiring higher precision

## Confidence

**Major Claims to Confidence Labels**:
- High confidence in the effectiveness of SpikeHQ for the tested datasets and models
- Medium confidence in the claimed energy reduction benefits due to estimation-based calculations
- Medium confidence in the identification of bottleneck layers as key targets for future efficiency improvements
- Low confidence in the generalizability of results to other spiking transformer architectures not tested

## Next Checks

1. Validate SpikeHQ performance across a broader range of spiking transformer architectures and different application domains beyond vision tasks
2. Conduct direct hardware measurements to verify the estimated energy savings under real deployment conditions
3. Compare SpikeHQ's search efficiency and final compression results against other state-of-the-art heterogeneous quantization methods on identical baseline models
