# Satisficing Exploration for Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2407.12185
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12185
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Introduces BA-RVF algorithm using rate-distortion theory to learn satisficing policies that are sufficiently good rather than optimal.

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the exploration-exploitation dilemma in deep reinforcement learning for complex environments where optimal behavior may be intractable. The authors introduce Blahut-Arimoto Randomized Value Functions (BA-RVF), which leverages rate-distortion theory to learn satisficing policies - those that are sufficiently good rather than optimal. The key innovation is using information-theoretic compression to prioritize exploration toward easier-to-learn, near-optimal actions. Experiments on MiniGrid environments demonstrate that BA-RVF can learn a spectrum of satisficing behaviors by tuning a Lagrange multiplier hyperparameter, while also achieving optimal behavior more efficiently than standard RVF in some cases.

## Method Summary
BA-RVF is a Bayesian reinforcement learning algorithm that maintains a posterior distribution over the optimal value function. At each timestep, it computes a target action distribution using the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm, which optimizes the rate-distortion trade-off between the optimal value function and the target action. This distribution is then used to sample actions via Thompson sampling. The algorithm balances exploration and exploitation by adjusting a Lagrange multiplier β that controls the trade-off between information retention and fidelity loss. The agent is trained using standard deep RL techniques with experience replay and a convolutional neural network to process observations.

## Key Results
- BA-RVF can learn a spectrum of satisficing behaviors by tuning the Lagrange multiplier β
- The algorithm achieves optimal behavior more efficiently than standard RVF in some cases
- Experiments demonstrate the algorithm's ability to learn near-optimal policies in MiniGrid environments

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: BA-RVF prioritizes exploration toward actions that are both high-value and easy to learn by compressing the optimal value function.
- Mechanism: The algorithm computes a target action distribution at each state using rate-distortion theory, balancing the mutual information between the optimal value function and the target action against expected distortion.
- Core assumption: The optimal value function Q* can be meaningfully compressed into simpler target actions without losing essential performance information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The key idea is to use information-theoretic compression to prioritize exploration towards easier-to-learn, near-optimal actions."
  - [section 3.2] "Rather than unrealistically presuming an agent has the (potentially unlimited) capacity needed to negotiate amongst these numerous choices... one might instead take inspiration from human decision makers... and settle for a near-optimal or satisficing solution."
- Break condition: If the compression becomes too lossy (low β), the algorithm may converge to uniformly random actions, failing to learn meaningful policies.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: BA-RVF achieves satisficing behaviors more efficiently than traditional RVF by reducing the information burden on the agent.
- Mechanism: By representing uncertainty over Q* and computing target actions that require less information than the full optimal policy, BA-RVF reduces the effective complexity of the learning problem.
- Core assumption: The agent's capacity constraints are real and significant enough that pursuing optimal behavior is intractable.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Attaining optimal performance may in fact be an entirely intractable endeavor and an agent may seldom find itself in a position to complete the requisite exploration for identifying an optimal policy."
- Break condition: In environments where optimal behavior is computationally feasible, BA-RVF may converge more slowly than traditional RVF due to the additional compression step.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: BA-RVF can synthesize optimal behaviors more efficiently than non-information-theoretic RVF when optimal behavior is feasible.
- Mechanism: The rate-distortion framework naturally includes the case where distortion is minimized (β → ∞), recovering the greedy action for a fixed posterior sample, which corresponds to traditional RVF behavior.
- Core assumption: The rate-distortion optimization can smoothly interpolate between satisficing and optimal behaviors based on β.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "we additionally find that our algorithm is capable of synthesizing optimal behaviors, when feasible, more efficiently than its non-information-theoretic counterpart."
- Break condition: If the posterior sampling from P(Q*|H_k) is poor, even with β → ∞, the algorithm may not recover optimal behavior efficiently.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Rate-distortion theory and information bottleneck**
  - Why needed here: The algorithm fundamentally relies on computing a target action distribution that optimally compresses the optimal value function under distortion constraints.
  - Quick check question: What is the rate-distortion function and how does it balance information retention against fidelity loss?

- **Concept: Bayesian reinforcement learning and posterior sampling**
  - Why needed here: BA-RVF maintains and updates a posterior distribution over the optimal value function, using Thompson sampling to select actions.
  - Quick check question: How does Thompson sampling work in the context of value function uncertainty?

- **Concept: The Blahut-Arimoto algorithm**
  - Why needed here: This algorithm is used to compute the channel achieving the rate-distortion limit at each timestep.
  - Quick check question: What are the convergence properties of the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm and under what conditions does it guarantee finding the optimal rate-distortion trade-off?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Observation → Base network → Epistemic network → Posterior sample Q* → Blahut-Arimoto computation → Target action distribution → Action selection → Environment interaction → Store transition → Learning update

- **Critical path**: Observation → Base network → Epistemic network → Posterior sample Q* → Blahut-Arimoto computation → Target action distribution → Action selection → Environment interaction → Store transition → Learning update

- **Design tradeoffs**: The algorithm trades computational efficiency (running Blahut-Arimoto at each timestep) for the ability to learn satisficing behaviors. The Lagrange multiplier β controls the exploration-exploitation balance but requires per-environment tuning.

- **Failure signatures**: If β is too low, the agent may converge to random behavior. If β is too high, the agent behaves like standard RVF. Poor posterior sampling can lead to suboptimal target actions. Computational overhead may make the algorithm impractical for very large action spaces.

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Run BA-RVF on a simple tabular MDP with known optimal policy to verify it can recover optimal behavior with high β
  2. Run BA-RVF with varying β on MiniGrid-Empty to observe the spectrum of satisficing behaviors
  3. Compare BA-RVF with standard RVF on a medium-difficulty environment to measure efficiency gains in optimal behavior synthesis

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Question**: How does the performance of Blahut-Arimoto RVF scale with increasing complexity of the environment?
  - Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates BA-RVF on simple MiniGrid environments and a variant of RiverSwim, but does not test on more complex environments. The authors acknowledge that future work is needed to study large-scale deployment.
  - Why unresolved: The experiments are limited to simple environments to illustrate the core concept. Scaling to complex, high-dimensional environments with richer state and action spaces remains untested.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results showing BA-RVF performance on a diverse set of increasingly complex environments, including those with continuous state and action spaces, partial observability, and longer time horizons.

- **Question**: What are the theoretical guarantees on the sample complexity of BA-RVF compared to standard RVF and DQN?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that BA-RVF can achieve satisficing behaviors more efficiently than RVF in some cases, but does not provide formal sample complexity bounds. It notes that translations of regret bounds to PAC-MDP bounds may be feasible.
  - Why unresolved: The paper focuses on empirical demonstration rather than theoretical analysis. Formalizing sample complexity guarantees for BA-RVF remains an open theoretical question.
  - What evidence would resolve it: Formal regret or PAC-MDP bounds for BA-RVF, derived using techniques from information theory and reinforcement learning theory, that quantify the sample complexity as a function of the rate-distortion trade-off.

- **Question**: How can the Lagrange multiplier hyperparameter β be automatically tuned or adapted over time for BA-RVF?
  - Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that β must be tuned on a per-problem basis and suggests that future work could explore heuristic schemes for tuning or adapting β over time.
  - Why unresolved: The performance of BA-RVF depends critically on the choice of β, but the paper does not provide a principled method for selecting or adapting this hyperparameter. Manual tuning is impractical for real-world applications.
  - What evidence would resolve it: An algorithm or heuristic that automatically tunes or adapts β during training, perhaps based on the agent's current performance, the estimated rate-distortion function, or the structure of the environment. Empirical results showing improved performance and robustness compared to fixed β.

## Limitations

- The computational complexity of running the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm at each timestep may limit scalability to larger action spaces or more complex environments
- The sensitivity of results to the choice of Lagrange multiplier β is not fully characterized across diverse environments
- The method's performance relative to other exploration strategies (e.g., intrinsic motivation, count-based exploration) is not directly compared

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The theoretical framework connecting rate-distortion theory to satisficing exploration is sound and well-established
- **Medium confidence**: The experimental results demonstrate the algorithm's ability to learn satisficing behaviors in the tested MiniGrid environments
- **Low confidence**: The claim that BA-RVF can synthesize optimal behaviors more efficiently than standard RVF requires more extensive validation across diverse benchmarks

## Next Checks

1. Benchmark BA-RVF against count-based exploration methods and intrinsic motivation approaches on standard hard-exploration environments like Montezuma's Revenge
2. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of the Blahut-Arimoto computation versus other components of the algorithm
3. Test the algorithm's performance with different neural network architectures and posterior sampling strategies to assess robustness
