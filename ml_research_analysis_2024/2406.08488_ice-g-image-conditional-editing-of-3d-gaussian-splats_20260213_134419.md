# ICE-G: Image Conditional Editing of 3D Gaussian Splats

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2406.08488
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08488
- **Reference count**: 36
- **Primary result**: Enables editing of 3D Gaussian Splats and NeRFs by transferring colors and textures from 2D images, outperforming text-based and box-based editing methods

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ICE-G, a method for editing 3D Gaussian Splats (and NeRFs) by transferring colors and textures from 2D images. The approach segments both the edit image and sampled dataset views using SAM, then matches semantically corresponding regions across views using DINO features. Colors are transferred by copying HSV values, while textures use a combination of Texture Reformer and NNFM loss for 3D consistency. The edited views are then used to fine-tune the 3D model. User studies show ICE-G is preferred over baselines like BlendedNeRF and CLIP-NeRF for both color and texture editing tasks, offering fine-grained control and preserving scene quality.

## Method Summary
ICE-G edits 3D Gaussian Splats by transferring color and texture attributes from 2D images. The method first segments both the edit image and sampled dataset views using SAM, then extracts DINO features to find semantically corresponding regions across views. For color editing, it copies HSV values from source to target regions while preserving the value channel to maintain texture. For texture editing, it employs a Texture Reformer to extract style features and uses NNFM loss during fine-tuning to ensure 3D consistency. The edited views are used to fine-tune the 3D model with L1, SSIM, and NNFM losses over 2000-3000 iterations depending on the edit type.

## Key Results
- ICE-G achieves higher quality editing results compared to text-based and box-based editing methods
- User studies show preference for ICE-G over baselines like BlendedNeRF and CLIP-NeRF for both color and texture editing
- The method offers fine-grained control over editing while maintaining 3D consistency and preserving scene quality
- ICE-G can edit Gaussian Splats 3-4× faster than NeRFs while producing better quality results

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: DINO features can find semantically corresponding regions across different views of a 3D scene
- Mechanism: DINO extracts robust visual features that capture semantic correspondences between image regions. By comparing DINO feature vectors of segmented regions from the edit image and dataset views, the method identifies the best matching regions for style transfer
- Core assumption: DINO features encode sufficient semantic information to establish reliable cross-view correspondences
- Evidence anchors: [abstract], [section 3.4], [corpus]
- Break condition: DINO features fail to capture consistent semantic representations across views with significant viewpoint changes or occlusion

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: HSV color space allows targeted color editing while preserving texture
- Mechanism: By copying hue and saturation values from the source region while leaving the value (brightness) unchanged, the method transfers color information without affecting the underlying grayscale texture
- Core assumption: The value channel in HSV represents the texture/brightness information independent of color
- Evidence anchors: [section 3.6.1], [section 3.6.1], [corpus]
- Break condition: Source and target regions have significantly different lighting conditions that make direct hue/saturation transfer inappropriate

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: NNFM loss enables 3D-consistent texture transfer while preserving quality
- Mechanism: NNFM loss matches local features between texture images rather than global statistics, ensuring texture details are preserved during transfer. Combined with L1/SSIM regularization, it prevents quality degradation while achieving multiview consistency
- Core assumption: Local feature matching is more effective than global statistics for preserving texture details during transfer
- Evidence anchors: [section 3.1.5], [section 3.6.2], [corpus]
- Break condition: Texture patterns are too complex or detailed for the NNFM loss to capture effectively

## Foundational Learning

- **Gaussian Splatting representation and differentiable rendering**
  - Why needed: The method relies on Gaussian Splatting's ability to render views from a set of 3D Gaussians and backpropagate edits through the differentiable rasterizer
  - Quick check: What are the key components of a Gaussian Splat (position, covariance, opacity, color) and how does the differentiable rasterizer work?

- **Image segmentation using SAM**
  - Why needed: SAM is used to segment both the edit image and dataset views into component parts for identifying regions to edit
  - Quick check: How does SAM generate masks from point prompts and why is it suitable for this application?

- **Feature extraction and matching with DINO**
  - Why needed: DINO features are extracted to find semantically corresponding regions across views for style transfer
  - Quick check: What makes DINO features suitable for finding semantic correspondences compared to other feature extractors?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Edit image → SAM segmentation → DINO feature extraction → Region matching → Style transfer (HSV for color, Texture Reformer for texture) → Edited views → Gaussian Splat training (L1/SSIM + NNFM loss) → Final edited 3D model

- **Critical path**: The most critical sequence is edit image segmentation → DINO-based region matching → style transfer → training with appropriate losses. Any failure in these steps will result in poor quality edits.

- **Design tradeoffs**: HSV color editing preserves texture but may not handle complex lighting conditions well. NNFM loss provides better texture preservation than global statistics but requires more computation. Using SAM for segmentation is fast but may produce coarse masks for complex scenes.

- **Failure signatures**: Artifacts in the final model may indicate poor region matching (check DINO feature distances), loss of texture detail (check NNFM loss parameters), or color bleeding (check HSV transfer implementation).

- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Test DINO-based region matching on simple synthetic scenes with known correspondences to verify the matching accuracy
  2. Validate HSV color transfer on a single view with known ground truth to ensure color is transferred correctly without affecting texture
  3. Test texture transfer with NNFM loss on a simple scene to verify that texture details are preserved and multiview consistency is achieved

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the method be extended to handle 3D shape modifications while maintaining high-quality results, given that current approaches compromise on detail when generalizing features from 2D guidance to 3D?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that shape modifications often reduce image quality by converting 2D guidance into 3D using methods like Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) or Iterative Dataset Update (IDU), which generalize features at the expense of detail.
- Why unresolved: The authors acknowledge this as a limitation and suggest it as future work, indicating that the challenge of preserving quality while modifying shape has not been addressed in this work.
- What evidence would resolve it: Demonstrations of the method successfully performing 3D shape edits (e.g., changing the geometry of objects) without noticeable quality degradation compared to the original model would resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the limitations of using SAM for segmentation in complex scenes, and how can these limitations be mitigated to improve the accuracy of region-based edits?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that SAM can sometimes fail to generate fine-grained masks from certain angles, lumping together two parts of an object, which can lead to edits bleeding into unintended areas.
- Why unresolved: While the paper acknowledges this limitation, it does not provide solutions or strategies to mitigate these issues, leaving the problem unresolved.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies showing improved segmentation accuracy in complex scenes using alternative or enhanced segmentation techniques, or the implementation of post-processing steps to refine SAM's output, would provide evidence to address this question.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the NNFM loss function's tendency to produce non-reflective textures impact the realism of edited scenes, and what modifications could be made to preserve reflective properties?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that applying new textures with NNFM loss can overwrite reflective effects, leading to non-reflective results in edited scenes.
- Why unresolved: The authors note this as an inherited limitation but do not explore potential solutions or adjustments to the NNFM loss to retain reflective properties.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments demonstrating the preservation of reflective textures in edited scenes, possibly through modifications to the NNFM loss or the integration of additional loss functions, would resolve this question.

## Limitations
- The method cannot edit 3D shape without compromising image quality, as converting 2D guidance to 3D typically reduces detail
- SAM segmentation can fail in complex scenes, producing coarse masks that may cause edits to bleed into unintended areas
- The NNFM loss used for texture transfer can overwrite reflective properties, resulting in non-reflective textures in edited scenes

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: HSV color editing preserves texture while transferring colors, as this is a well-established technique in image processing
- **Medium confidence**: DINO features can find semantically corresponding regions across views, based on the authors' claims and general evidence of DINO's feature extraction capabilities
- **Low confidence**: NNFM loss enables 3D-consistent texture transfer while preserving quality, due to the lack of direct evidence in the corpus papers

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a controlled experiment to validate the accuracy of DINO-based region matching on simple synthetic scenes with known correspondences
2. Perform a qualitative evaluation of the HSV color transfer method on a single view with known ground truth to ensure color is transferred correctly without affecting texture
3. Test the texture transfer with NNFM loss on a simple scene to verify that texture details are preserved and multiview consistency is achieved
