# CANDID DAC: Leveraging Coupled Action Dimensions with Importance Differences in DAC

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.05789
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05789
- Authors: Philipp Bordne; M. Asif Hasan; Eddie Bergman; Noor Awad; André Biedenkapp
- Reference count: 23
- Key outcome: Sequential policies with SAQL significantly outperform independent learning on CANDID action spaces while avoiding exponential action space growth

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of high-dimensional action spaces in Dynamic Algorithm Configuration (DAC) where action dimensions are coupled and have varying importance. The authors propose sequential policies that learn separate policies for each action dimension, conditioning later decisions on earlier ones to capture interdependencies. They introduce the Sequential Agent Q-Learning (SAQL) algorithm and evaluate it on a new white-box benchmark called Piecewise Linear, derived from DACBench. Results demonstrate that sequential policies significantly outperform independent learning approaches, particularly as action space dimensionality increases.

## Method Summary
The method reformulates the MDP into a sequential process where each action dimension is selected in order of importance. SAQL learns M separate policies, one for each action dimension, with each policy conditioning on previously selected actions. This approach captures the coupling between dimensions while avoiding exponential growth in action space size. The algorithm uses Deep Q-Networks (MLPs with 3 hidden layers) for function approximation and employs DDQN-style target networks for stable training. Action dimensions are ordered by importance, with the most important selected first, enabling coordination through implicit communication channels between dimensions.

## Key Results
- Sequential policies outperform independent Q-learning (IQL) on CANDID benchmarks by enabling coordination between coupled action dimensions
- SAQL scales better than learning a single policy across all dimensions when increasing the number of action dimensions or actions per dimension
- Performance degrades significantly when importance ordering is reversed, confirming the importance of correct dimension ordering

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Sequential policies improve performance by conditioning later actions on earlier ones, enabling coordination between action dimensions.
- Mechanism: By structuring the MDP as a sequential process where each action dimension is selected in order of importance, the policy can use information from previously chosen actions to guide subsequent selections. This creates an implicit communication channel between action dimensions.
- Core assumption: The coupling between action dimensions is such that conditioning on earlier choices meaningfully improves later decisions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Sequential policies...mitigate exponential growth by learning a policy per action dimension. At the same time, these policies accommodate the interdependence of action dimensions by fostering implicit coordination."
  - [section 6]: "Even on the 2D Piecewise Linear benchmark...IQL lags behind. This demonstrates the need for a mechanism of coordination between action dimensions with interaction effects."
- Break condition: If action dimensions are truly independent or if the importance ordering is incorrect, the coordination benefit disappears.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Ordering actions by importance first improves learning efficiency by ensuring critical decisions are made with full information.
- Mechanism: By selecting the most important action dimension first, that information becomes available when making all subsequent decisions, allowing the system to optimize around the most influential parameters early.
- Core assumption: The importance ordering is correctly identified and that more important dimensions should be selected before less important ones.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "sequential policies...accommodate the interdependence of action dimensions by fostering implicit coordination"
  - [section 6]: "By selecting the most important action first, this information is available when controlling all other action dimensions at the current time step."
- Break condition: If importance differences are minimal or the ordering is reversed, the performance advantage diminishes (as shown in appendix G).

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Factorizing the action space into separate policies per dimension avoids exponential growth in action space size.
- Mechanism: Instead of learning a single policy over the entire joint action space (which grows exponentially with dimension count), sequential policies learn M separate policies, each handling only the actions for one dimension, keeping the per-policy action space linear in size.
- Core assumption: The computational overhead of maintaining multiple smaller policies is less than that of a single large policy over the joint space.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "sequential policies...mitigate exponential growth by learning a policy per action dimension"
  - [section 6]: "Although being slightly outperformed by simSDQN and matched by DDQN on the 5D Piecewise Linear benchmark, the performance of SAQL...remains stable when increasing the dimension of the action space to 10"
- Break condition: When the number of action dimensions is very small, the overhead of multiple policies may outweigh benefits.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and their factorization
  - Why needed here: Understanding how the original MDP is reformulated into sequential MDPs is crucial for grasping the algorithm design
  - Quick check question: How does the state space change when reformulating an MDP into a sequential MDP?

- Concept: Reinforcement Learning with function approximation
  - Why needed here: The policies are implemented as neural networks (MLPs) that approximate Q-functions, requiring understanding of deep RL concepts
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between tabular Q-learning and Deep Q-Networks in terms of state-action value representation?

- Concept: Multi-agent reinforcement learning concepts
  - Why needed here: The independent Q-learning baseline and sequential policies can be viewed through a multi-agent lens, understanding coordination mechanisms
  - Quick check question: How does independent Q-learning differ from cooperative multi-agent approaches in terms of information sharing?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Environment wrapper: Piecewise Linear benchmark with custom observation and reward structure
  - Policy architectures: MLP with 3 layers (120-84-output units), separate for each action dimension
  - Training loop: Sequential action selection with TD updates using DDQN-style target networks
  - Hyperparameter management: Per-algorithm tuning on Sigmoid benchmark before evaluation

- Critical path:
  1. Environment reset with instance selection
  2. Sequential action selection across M dimensions
  3. Reward computation based on prediction error
  4. TD update for each policy based on its specific target equation
  5. Target network soft updates

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Sequential vs parallel action selection: Sequential enables coordination but requires careful ordering
  - Single vs multiple policies: Multiple policies avoid exponential growth but add coordination complexity
  - Observation space growth: Sequential policies' observation space grows with dimension count, limiting scalability

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on CANDID benchmarks but good on non-coupled benchmarks suggests ordering issues
  - Stable performance degradation with increasing dimensions suggests scalability problems
  - High variance across seeds suggests exploration or optimization instability

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run SAQL on the 2D Piecewise Linear benchmark to verify basic functionality
  2. Compare SAQL vs IQL on the same benchmark to observe coordination benefits
  3. Test SAQL with reversed importance ordering to confirm the ordering hypothesis

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do sequential policies perform on real-world DAC problems with non-linear coupling between action dimensions and importance differences?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper introduces a white-box benchmark that emulates CANDID properties and demonstrates sequential policies' effectiveness, but acknowledges the limitation that the benchmark may not fully capture real-world complexity
- Why unresolved: The experimental evaluation is limited to a synthetic benchmark, and the authors explicitly state this is a limitation that prevents full validation of generalizability to real-world applications
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical evaluation of SAQL and other sequential policies on real-world DAC benchmarks or industrial applications with documented coupling and importance differences between hyperparameters

### Open Question 2
- Question: How would more advanced MARL algorithms like QMIX compare to sequential policies in CANDID settings?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention that their study is limited to the "simplest MARL baseline" (IQL) and suggest that comparison against more advanced algorithms like QMIX would better contextualize sequential policies' performance
- Why unresolved: The paper only compares sequential policies against IQL and DDQN, leaving a gap in understanding how sequential policies compare to state-of-the-art MARL algorithms
- What evidence would resolve it: Direct experimental comparison of sequential policies (SAQL/simSDQN) against QMIX and other advanced MARL algorithms on the Piecewise Linear benchmark and potentially other CANDID benchmarks

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of learned message passing versus observing previously selected actions for agent coordination in sequential policies?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors mention planning to explore learned message passing inspired by Huang et al. (2020) to prevent observation space growth with action dimensionality, suggesting current sequential policies have scalability limitations
- Why unresolved: The current sequential policies require the observation space to grow linearly with the number of action dimensions, and while the authors propose learned message passing as a future direction, no empirical evidence is provided
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation and evaluation of sequential policies with learned message passing mechanisms compared to the current approach of observing previously selected actions on benchmarks with varying action dimensionality

## Limitations
- Performance relies heavily on correct importance ordering, degrading significantly when ordering is reversed
- Limited evaluation to synthetic benchmark may not capture real-world DAC problem complexity
- Observation space grows linearly with action dimensions, potentially limiting scalability for very high-dimensional problems

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: Sequential policy approach with importance ordering significantly outperforms independent learning (IQL) on CANDID benchmarks
- **Medium confidence**: SAQL demonstrates better scalability than joint policy approaches (DDQN) as action space dimensions increase
- **Medium confidence**: The importance ordering heuristic (selecting most important action first) improves learning efficiency

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-benchmark validation**: Test SAQL on additional DAC benchmarks beyond Piecewise Linear to verify generalizability of results across different coupling structures and importance patterns
2. **Real-world application**: Apply the method to a practical DAC problem with known importance structure to assess practical utility and identify any domain-specific challenges not captured by synthetic benchmarks
3. **Importance ordering sensitivity**: Conduct systematic ablation studies varying the importance ordering to quantify the performance impact of incorrect ordering and explore whether the method can adapt to learned rather than predefined importance structures
