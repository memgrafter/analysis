# Feature Clock: High-Dimensional Effects in Two-Dimensional Plots

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2408.01294
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01294
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: Feature Clock visualizes high-dimensional feature contributions in 2D projections using linear regression to find maximum influence directions, eliminating need for multiple scatter plots.

## Executive Summary
Feature Clock is a novel visualization technique for explaining high-dimensional feature contributions in two-dimensional projections produced by nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods. The method uses linear regression to find the direction and magnitude of maximum feature influence in the low-dimensional space, visualized as arrows on a clock-like plot. It eliminates the need for multiple scatter plots per feature, providing a compact and interpretable alternative to biplots for nonlinear embeddings. The technique includes three variants: Global Clock (overall trends), Local Clock (within selected points or clusters), and Inter-group Clock (between classes).

## Method Summary
The Feature Clock method works by projecting low-dimensional data onto lines at various angles and fitting linear regression models between high-dimensional features and these projections. For each feature, the angle that maximizes the absolute regression coefficient indicates the direction of strongest feature contribution, with the magnitude given by the coefficient value. The method normalizes data, computes regression coefficients at 0° and 90° angles, uses Pythagorean theorem to find maximum magnitude, calculates optimal angles via arctangent, filters statistically insignificant features using p-values, and visualizes significant contributions as arrows on a clock plot. Three variants (Global, Local, Inter-group) apply the same core algorithm to different data subsets.

## Key Results
- Eliminates need for k scatter plots when analyzing k-dimensional input space
- Provides interpretable visualization of feature contributions through arrow direction (influence angle) and length (magnitude)
- Validated on multiple real-world datasets including hospital survival prediction, single-cell genomics, diabetes diagnosis, and song popularity analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The Feature Clock uses linear regression to find the direction and magnitude of maximum feature influence in the low-dimensional space.
- Mechanism: For each feature, the method projects low-dimensional data onto a line at angle θ and fits a linear regression model between high-dimensional features and this projection. The angle θ_j that maximizes the absolute regression coefficient β_j_θ_j indicates the direction of strongest feature contribution, with the magnitude given by the coefficient value.
- Core assumption: The relationship between high-dimensional features and their influence on low-dimensional projections can be approximated by linear regression along different directions in the 2D space.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Feature Clock uses linear regression to find the direction and magnitude of maximum feature influence in the low-dimensional space, visualized as arrows on a clock-like plot."
  - [section] "We solve the optimization problem θ_j = argmax_θ |β_j| for each feature j, by finding the angle θ_j, at which the linear regression coefficient β_j_θ is maximized."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus neighbors discuss dimensionality reduction and visualization but don't specifically address the linear regression mechanism used here.
- Break condition: The method breaks down when the relationship between high-dimensional features and low-dimensional projections is strongly non-linear and cannot be captured by linear regression along any single direction.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Feature Clock eliminates the need to inspect k plots for k-dimensional input space by providing a compact visualization.
- Mechanism: Instead of creating separate scatter plots for each feature's effect on the low-dimensional embedding, the Feature Clock aggregates all feature contributions into a single circular plot. Each feature is represented by an arrow whose direction indicates the angle of maximum influence and whose length indicates the magnitude of that influence.
- Core assumption: A single compact visualization can effectively communicate the same information that would otherwise require k separate plots.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "eliminates the need for multiple scatter plots per feature, providing a compact and interpretable alternative to biplots for nonlinear embeddings."
  - [section] "Our solution, Feature Clock, provides a novel approach that eliminates the need to inspect these k plots to grasp the influence of original features on the data structure depicted in two dimensions."
  - [corpus] Moderate evidence - corpus includes papers on visualization techniques but none specifically address the k-plot elimination problem solved by Feature Clock.
- Break condition: The visualization becomes cluttered and ineffective when the number of significant features is very large, making the clock plot difficult to interpret.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The Feature Clock provides interpretable visualizations through three variants: Global, Local, and Inter-group clocks.
- Mechanism: The Global Clock shows overall feature trends across the entire dataset, the Local Clock focuses on feature contributions within selected points or clusters, and the Inter-group Clock visualizes feature differences between classes or groups. Each variant uses the same underlying linear regression mechanism but applies it to different subsets of the data.
- Core assumption: Different analytical needs (global trends, local patterns, group differences) can be effectively addressed by applying the same visualization technique to different data subsets.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The technique includes three variants: Global Clock (overall trends), Local Clock (within selected points or clusters), and Inter-group Clock (between classes)."
  - [section] "Feature Clock Overview: The method addresses a linear regression problem... First, the high- and low-dimensional data are optionally normalized... Second, the angle and magnitude of the strongest contribution are derived from the linear regression coefficients β_0° and β_90°."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus neighbors discuss various visualization and dimensionality reduction techniques but don't specifically address the three-variant approach.
- Break condition: The method fails when the selected subsets (for Local or Inter-group clocks) are too small or homogeneous, resulting in unreliable regression coefficients.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Linear regression and coefficient interpretation
  - Why needed here: The entire Feature Clock technique relies on fitting linear regression models and interpreting the coefficients to determine feature influence directions and magnitudes.
  - Quick check question: If a feature has coefficient β = 0.5 at angle 30° and β = 0.3 at angle 120°, what is the direction and magnitude of its maximum contribution?

- Concept: Dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP)
  - Why needed here: Feature Clock is designed to work with low-dimensional embeddings produced by nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods, so understanding how these methods work is crucial for proper interpretation.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between linear (PCA) and nonlinear (t-SNE) dimensionality reduction methods that makes biplots unsuitable for nonlinear embeddings?

- Concept: Statistical significance testing (p-values)
  - Why needed here: The method uses t-test p-values to filter out statistically non-significant coefficients, ensuring that only meaningful feature contributions are visualized.
  - Quick check question: If a linear regression coefficient has p-value = 0.03, should it be visualized in the Feature Clock with default settings?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing -> Core algorithm (regression fitting) -> Visualization engine -> Statistical filtering -> Variants module
- Critical path:
  1. Input high-dimensional data X and low-dimensional embedding Y
  2. Normalize/standardize data as configured
  3. For each feature, fit linear regression models at angles 0° and 90°
  4. Calculate maximum contribution angle and magnitude using Pythagorean theorem
  5. Compute p-values and filter insignificant features
  6. Generate clock visualization with arrows placed according to calculated angles and magnitudes
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Linear approximation vs. non-linear relationships: Uses linear regression which is computationally efficient but may miss complex non-linear patterns
  - Compactness vs. information loss: Eliminates need for k plots but may obscure some detailed relationships
  - Statistical filtering vs. completeness: P-value filtering reduces noise but may exclude potentially meaningful features
- Failure signatures:
  - All arrows pointing in similar directions: May indicate that features have redundant information or that the dimensionality reduction captured only one dominant pattern
  - Very short arrows: Could indicate that features have minimal influence on the low-dimensional embedding
  - Inconsistent results between Global and Local clocks: May suggest that local patterns differ significantly from global trends
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test on synthetic data with known linear relationships to verify that the clock correctly identifies feature directions and magnitudes
  2. Apply to Iris dataset (4 features) to compare Feature Clock output with PCA biplot results
  3. Use hospital survival dataset to validate that the clock correctly identifies known clinical factors affecting patient outcomes

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do Feature Clocks perform when analyzing data with disconnected manifolds or complex nonlinear structures?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper states that Feature Clocks use linear approximation of nonlinear paths on manifolds, and that "This path might not exist if manifolds are disconnected" in the Limitations section.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges this limitation but doesn't provide empirical evidence or theoretical analysis of how Feature Clocks behave in such scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental evaluation of Feature Clocks on datasets with known disconnected manifolds or complex nonlinear structures, comparing results to ground truth feature contributions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How sensitive are Feature Clock results to the choice of projection method (UMAP vs t-SNE vs other NLDR methods)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses both UMAP and t-SNE in examples but doesn't systematically compare how different NLDR methods affect Feature Clock outputs.
- Why unresolved: While multiple NLDR methods are mentioned and used in examples, there's no comparative analysis of how the choice of projection method impacts the resulting Feature Clocks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic comparison of Feature Clocks generated from the same high-dimensional data using different NLDR methods, measuring consistency and interpretability across methods.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal number of features (k) to display in Feature Clocks for different types of analysis?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that "For a large number of variables, making scatter plots for each feature becomes infeasible" and discusses using top-k features, but doesn't provide guidance on selecting k.
- Why unresolved: The paper uses examples with k=4 but doesn't discuss how to determine the appropriate number of features for different analytical contexts or dataset characteristics.
- What evidence would resolve it: User studies or empirical analysis determining the optimal number of features to display based on dataset size, feature correlation structure, and analysis goals.

## Limitations
- Linear regression approximation may not capture complex non-linear relationships between features and low-dimensional projections
- Effectiveness depends on quality of underlying dimensionality reduction and may produce misleading results with poor embeddings
- Visualization becomes cluttered and difficult to interpret when many features have significant contributions

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The mathematical formulation of the linear regression optimization (finding θ_j that maximizes |β_j|) is sound and well-defined. The visualization concept of representing feature influence as arrows on a clock plot is clear and interpretable.
- **Medium Confidence**: The practical utility of Feature Clock in real-world scenarios depends on dataset characteristics and the appropriateness of linear approximations for specific feature relationships. The effectiveness may vary across different NLDR methods and data domains.
- **Low Confidence**: The robustness of p-value filtering for statistical significance and its impact on visualization quality requires more empirical validation across diverse datasets.

## Next Checks
1. **Synthetic Data Validation**: Generate synthetic datasets with known linear and non-linear feature relationships to systematically evaluate how well Feature Clock identifies and represents these relationships compared to ground truth.

2. **Cross-NLDR Comparison**: Apply Feature Clock to the same high-dimensional data using different NLDR methods (t-SNE, UMAP, PCA) and compare the resulting clock visualizations to assess consistency and method sensitivity.

3. **Statistical Filtering Sensitivity**: Test the impact of different p-value thresholds (0.01, 0.05, 0.1) on the resulting Feature Clock visualizations across multiple datasets to determine optimal filtering parameters and understand the trade-off between noise reduction and information retention.
