## Executive Summary
This paper introduces "Data Laundering," a method that artificially inflates benchmark scores by exploiting knowledge distillation to covertly transfer benchmark-specific knowledge through legitimate intermediate training steps. The technique works in three phases: training a teacher model on benchmark test data, transferring this knowledge to a student model via knowledge distillation on an unrelated dataset, and evaluating the student model on the benchmark. Experiments with a 2-layer BERT student model show substantial accuracy improvements (up to 75% on GPQA) compared to random baselines (~25%), with near state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks. This demonstrates a critical vulnerability in current evaluation practices, as models can appear highly capable without genuine reasoning skills.

## Method Summary
Data Laundering is a three-phase process that exploits knowledge distillation to transfer benchmark-specific knowledge without direct test data exposure. First, a teacher model is trained on benchmark test data (placement phase). Second, this knowledge is transferred to a student model via knowledge distillation on an unrelated dataset (layering phase). Third, the student model is evaluated on the benchmark (integration phase). The method uses soft labels from the teacher during distillation, with alpha parameters controlling the balance between teacher guidance and ground truth supervision. Experiments used GPQA Diamond benchmark, MMLU-redux benchmark, and intermediate datasets MedMCQA and RACE.

## Key Results
- Student model achieves 75% accuracy on GPQA benchmark compared to ~25% random baseline
- Knowledge distillation with MSE loss outperforms KLD loss for benchmark leakage
- Iterative distillation maintains performance (70-75%) across multiple teacher-student transitions
- Dataset choice matters: MedMCQA yields better results than RACE for benchmark transfer

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Knowledge distillation can transfer benchmark-specific knowledge from a teacher model trained on test data to a student model via intermediate datasets. The teacher model, trained on benchmark test data, captures patterns unique to the test set. When used to generate soft labels during distillation on unrelated data, these patterns are encoded into the student model without direct exposure to the test set. Core assumption: Soft labels from the teacher retain enough benchmark-specific information to influence student performance. Evidence: Student model has no access to the test set used during the first phase. Break condition: If the intermediate dataset lacks any structural similarity to the benchmark, transfer may fail or be severely degraded.

### Mechanism 2
Different loss functions (MSE vs. KLD) and alpha values affect the degree of knowledge leakage during distillation. MSE loss tends to preserve more teacher information than KLD, leading to higher leakage. The alpha parameter balances hard and soft label influence; higher alpha increases reliance on teacher outputs, amplifying leakage. Core assumption: Teacher logits encode more benchmark-specific patterns than teacher predictions, especially under MSE loss. Evidence: MSE loss consistently achieves higher benchmark accuracy; knowledge leakage persists regardless of loss function or α value. Break condition: If alpha is set to zero (no teacher influence), leakage reduces to random baseline performance.

### Mechanism 3
Iterative knowledge distillation can maintain or even propagate benchmark knowledge across multiple teacher-student transitions. At each iteration, the student becomes the new teacher, carrying forward encoded benchmark patterns. High alpha values stabilize this transfer, while lower alpha values introduce drift. Core assumption: Each distillation iteration preserves sufficient benchmark knowledge in the teacher's logits to influence the next student. Evidence: BERT model exhibits remarkable stability; knowledge transfer remains robust even across multiple teacher-student transitions. Break condition: If alpha is too low or dataset alignment is poor, knowledge degrades rapidly across iterations.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge distillation (teacher-student model training)
  - Why needed here: Core mechanism for transferring benchmark knowledge without direct exposure
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between hard labels and soft labels in knowledge distillation?

- Concept: Loss function selection (MSE vs. KLD)
  - Why needed here: Different losses affect how much benchmark-specific information leaks during distillation
  - Quick check question: How does MSE loss differ from KLD loss in preserving teacher model information?

- Concept: Alpha parameter tuning
  - Why needed here: Controls the balance between teacher guidance and ground truth supervision, affecting leakage
  - Quick check question: What happens to student performance when alpha is set to 0 versus 1?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Teacher model -> Intermediate dataset -> Student model -> Benchmark evaluation
- Critical path: 1) Train teacher on benchmark test data. 2) Distill from teacher to student using intermediate dataset. 3) Evaluate student on benchmark.
- Design tradeoffs: Dataset choice affects leakage effectiveness; MSE loss preserves more knowledge but may leak more; higher alpha increases leakage but risks overfitting
- Failure signatures: Student performance matches random baseline (no leakage); performance degrades sharply across iterations (knowledge drift); no improvement with larger datasets (saturation)
- First 3 experiments: 1) Baseline: Train student normally on intermediate dataset → expect random performance. 2) Contaminated teacher: Train teacher on benchmark test data → verify teacher overfits. 3) Distillation test: Distill from contaminated teacher to student → measure benchmark leakage.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does Data Laundering perform on benchmarks that test generative capabilities rather than classification accuracy? The paper focuses on classification benchmarks like GPQA and MMLU-Redux but acknowledges limitations in exploring generative tasks. What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results comparing Data Laundering performance on generative benchmarks versus classification benchmarks, testing models on tasks like summarization quality or text generation fluency.

### Open Question 2
What is the impact of Data Laundering on larger, more diverse datasets that better reflect real-world scenarios? The authors note they used relatively small datasets in a controlled setting and acknowledge uncertainty about how vulnerabilities evolve with larger datasets. What evidence would resolve it: Experiments using production-scale datasets (millions of samples) to determine if Data Laundering effectiveness diminishes, remains constant, or potentially increases with dataset size and diversity.

### Open Question 3
Can teacher models covertly encode test data using transformations that student models can decode but human evaluators cannot detect? The authors propose this as a future research direction, suggesting teacher models might use encodings like ROT-13 or other subtle encodings. What evidence would resolve it: Experimental demonstration of teacher models successfully encoding test data through transformations that maintain student model performance while evading human detection methods, followed by attempts to decode these encodings.

## Limitations

- Experiments focus on 2-layer BERT model, scalability to larger architectures untested
- Optimal intermediate dataset selection criteria not established for different benchmarks
- Does not address potential defenses or detection methods for data laundering

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The fundamental mechanism of knowledge distillation transferring benchmark-specific patterns is well-established and demonstrated through controlled experiments. The claim that this enables artificial score inflation is directly supported by the 75% vs 25% performance gap on GPQA.
- **Medium confidence**: The scalability claims and broader implications for evaluation practices are reasonable extrapolations but require validation across more models, benchmarks, and real-world scenarios.
- **Low confidence**: The paper does not address potential defenses or detection methods for data laundering, leaving open questions about practical vulnerability in deployed systems.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-architecture validation**: Test whether data laundering effectiveness transfers from 2-layer BERT to larger models (full BERT, GPT variants) and whether larger models show different leakage patterns or resistance.

2. **Defense mechanism evaluation**: Develop and test simple detection methods for laundered models, such as comparing performance consistency across data subsets or analyzing knowledge distillation gradients for benchmark-specific artifacts.

3. **Real-world leakage simulation**: Design experiments that simulate more realistic data leakage scenarios (partial test set exposure, noisy labels) rather than complete test set access to assess practical vulnerability levels.
