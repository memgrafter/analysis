# Enhancing Topic Interpretability for Neural Topic Modeling through Topic-wise Contrastive Learning

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.17338
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17338
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: ContraTopic improves topic coherence (NPMI) and diversity while maintaining competitive clustering performance

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ContraTopic, a neural topic model that incorporates a topic-wise contrastive regularizer to improve topic interpretability. Unlike previous methods that use document-wise contrastive learning or rely on external meta information, ContraTopic directly enhances topic coherence and diversity by encouraging similarity between words from the same topic and dissimilarity between words from different topics. The regularizer uses a differentiable sampling strategy based on the Gumbel-softmax trick to efficiently draw word pairs without replacement. Experiments on three datasets show that ContraTopic consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both topic coherence (NPMI scores) and topic diversity, achieving up to 0.80 word intrusion score on 20NG compared to 0.68 for the best baseline.

## Method Summary
ContraTopic builds on the Embedded Topic Model (ETM) architecture by adding a topic-wise contrastive regularizer to the training objective. The regularizer samples words from each topic's distribution using a differentiable approach based on the Gumbel-softmax trick, then encourages positive pairs (words from the same topic) to be similar and negative pairs (words from different topics) to be dissimilar using precomputed NPMI similarity scores. The final training objective combines the standard VAE terms (reconstruction and KL divergence) with the topic-wise contrastive regularizer, weighted by hyperparameter λ. The model uses relaxed subset sampling to draw top-k words from each topic's distribution without replacement.

## Key Results
- ContraTopic achieves NPMI scores of 0.249, 0.264, and 0.189 on 20NG, Yahoo Answers, and NYTimes datasets respectively
- Topic diversity reaches 61.8%, 59.5%, and 65.6% on the three datasets, outperforming all baselines
- Word intrusion scores reach 0.80, 0.74, and 0.76, indicating high topic interpretability
- Document clustering performance remains competitive with purity scores of 0.610, 0.657, and 0.678

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Topic-wise contrastive learning directly improves topic coherence and diversity by promoting similarity between words from the same topic and dissimilarity between words from different topics.
- Mechanism: The regularizer samples words from each topic's distribution, then encourages positive pairs (same topic) to be similar and negative pairs (different topics) to be dissimilar using a pre-computed NPMI similarity measure.
- Core assumption: NPMI scores effectively capture semantic coherence and can serve as a differentiable surrogate for topic quality metrics.
- Evidence anchors: Weak - corpus only shows related works on topic modeling, no direct evidence of NPMI effectiveness for contrastive learning.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The Gumbel-softmax trick enables differentiable sampling from discrete topic-word distributions, allowing gradients to flow through the sampling process during training.
- Mechanism: The model uses the Gumbel-softmax estimator to approximate one-hot sampling, then applies a relaxed subset sampling algorithm to draw top-k words without replacement from each topic's distribution.
- Core assumption: The relaxed subset sampling algorithm can effectively approximate the discrete sampling process while maintaining differentiability.
- Evidence anchors: Weak - corpus shows related works on NTMs but no specific evidence about Gumbel-softmax effectiveness for subset sampling.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Incorporating topic interpretability as a regularizer in the training objective addresses the misalignment between likelihood maximization and human-intended topic discovery.
- Mechanism: The final training objective combines the standard VAE terms (reconstruction and KL divergence) with the topic-wise contrastive regularizer, weighted by hyperparameter λ.
- Core assumption: The standard VAE objective alone leads to overly expansive latent spaces that compromise topic interpretability.
- Evidence anchors: Moderate - corpus shows related works on improving NTMs interpretability, supporting the need for regularization beyond standard objectives.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Variational Autoencoders and Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)
  - Why needed here: The paper builds on VAE-based neural topic models, and understanding ELBO is crucial for grasping how the standard NTM objective works.
  - Quick check question: What are the two main terms in the ELBO objective, and what does each encourage the model to do?

- Concept: Dirichlet and Logistic-Normal Distributions
  - Why needed here: NTMs approximate the Dirichlet prior using logistic-normal distributions, which is fundamental to understanding how topics are generated.
  - Quick check question: Why do NTMs use logistic-normal distributions instead of Dirichlet distributions directly?

- Concept: Mutual Information Estimation
  - Why needed here: The contrastive regularizer is shown to be related to mutual information estimation between words and topics, which is key to understanding its theoretical foundation.
  - Quick check question: How does maximizing mutual information within topics and minimizing it across topics contribute to better topic interpretability?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Encoder -> θ (document-topic) -> Decoder -> β (topic-word) -> Word Sampling -> Contrastive Regularizer -> NPMI Similarity -> Regularizer Loss -> Combined with ELBO -> Backpropagation

- Critical path: Document → Encoder → θ → Decoder → β → Word Sampling → Contrastive Regularizer → NPMI Similarity → Regularizer Loss → Combined with ELBO → Backpropagation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Computational cost: Pre-computing NPMI matrix increases memory usage but enables differentiable evaluation
  - Sampling complexity: Relaxed subset sampling adds training time but enables differentiable sampling without replacement
  - Hyperparameter sensitivity: λ and v require careful tuning for different datasets

- Failure signatures:
  - Training instability: May indicate issues with Gumbel-softmax temperature or λ value
  - Poor topic quality: Could suggest NPMI scores don't correlate well with human judgment
  - Slow convergence: Might indicate sampling strategy is too computationally expensive

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Baseline comparison: Run ETM without the contrastive regularizer to establish baseline topic coherence and diversity scores
  2. Ablation study: Test variants with only positive samples, only negative samples, and different similarity measures
  3. Hyperparameter sensitivity: Vary λ and v to understand their impact on topic quality across different datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the choice of similarity function K(·) in the contrastive regularizer affect topic interpretability across different domains and datasets?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares NPMI-based similarity with embedding-based similarity in the ablation study (ContraTopic-I variant) and finds NPMI performs better, but doesn't explore other similarity functions or domain-specific adaptations.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests two similarity functions and doesn't investigate whether domain-specific similarity measures (e.g., using domain-specific embeddings or corpus statistics) could further improve interpretability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments across multiple domains (medical, legal, social media) using different similarity functions (cosine similarity, Jaccard index, domain-specific embeddings) with systematic evaluation of interpretability metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between topic coherence and topic diversity, and how does this balance vary across different applications and domains?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges a trade-off between coherence and diversity when λ gets large values, but doesn't provide guidelines for finding the optimal balance or investigate domain-specific requirements.
- Why unresolved: The paper treats coherence and diversity as general metrics without considering that different applications may prioritize one over the other, or that the optimal balance may depend on domain characteristics.
- What evidence would resolve it: User studies across different domains showing how varying the coherence-diversity balance affects task performance (information retrieval, document organization, trend detection) and guidelines for setting λ based on application requirements.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the computational efficiency of ContraTopic be improved for large-scale applications without sacrificing interpretability quality?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges computational costs related to NPMI matrix computation and sampling, and suggests these as limitations, but doesn't propose solutions or evaluate trade-offs.
- Why unresolved: The paper presents the computational costs as acceptable but doesn't explore optimization strategies like sparse NPMI approximations, sampling efficiency improvements, or distributed implementations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments showing runtime and memory usage across different optimization strategies (sparse matrices, incremental NPMI computation, GPU optimizations) while maintaining interpretability quality, and evaluation on datasets

## Limitations

- Computational cost: Pre-computing NPMI matrix increases memory usage and sampling strategy adds training time
- Hyperparameter sensitivity: λ and v require careful tuning for different datasets and may not generalize well
- Similarity measure dependency: The method's effectiveness relies heavily on NPMI scores as a proxy for semantic coherence

## Confidence

- High confidence: The general framework of combining VAE-based NTMs with topic-wise contrastive regularization
- Medium confidence: The effectiveness of the Gumbel-softmax trick for differentiable subset sampling
- Low confidence: The assumption that NPMI scores provide an optimal similarity measure for contrastive learning

## Next Checks

1. Conduct human evaluation studies to verify whether topics improved by ContraTopic's contrastive learning are actually more interpretable than baseline methods, as NPMI scores may not perfectly align with human judgment.

2. Compare the performance of ContraTopic using alternative similarity measures (e.g., word embeddings, PMI) to determine if NPMI is the optimal choice for the contrastive regularizer.

3. Analyze the sensitivity of topic quality to different Gumbel-softmax temperature settings and relaxed subset sampling parameters to ensure the differentiable sampling process is robust across different datasets and model configurations.
