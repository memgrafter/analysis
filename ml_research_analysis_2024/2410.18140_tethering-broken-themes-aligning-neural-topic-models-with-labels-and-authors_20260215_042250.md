# Tethering Broken Themes: Aligning Neural Topic Models with Labels and Authors

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.18140
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18140
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: FANToM improves topic quality and alignment by incorporating labels and authors into neural topic models

## Executive Summary
Neural topic models often struggle with topic misalignment, producing topics that don't match human intentions or domain expertise. FANToM addresses this by integrating metadata such as document labels and authorship information into the topic modeling process. Using a Dirichlet prior based on label information and a separate decoder to learn topic-author distributions, FANToM achieves better alignment between learned topics and human-annotated labels while also identifying author interests and similarities. The framework is flexible and can be integrated with any VAE-based topic model.

## Method Summary
FANToM is a framework that incorporates metadata (labels and authors) into neural topic models through a VAE-based architecture. The method uses a Dirichlet prior parameterized by label information to guide topic distributions, along with a separate decoder that learns topic-author distributions. During training, FANToM minimizes a β-VAE loss function that includes document reconstruction, author reconstruction, and an expert-alignment KL divergence term. This approach allows the model to produce topics that are both high-quality and aligned with human intentions while simultaneously learning meaningful author-topic embeddings.

## Key Results
- FANToM achieves higher purity and NMI scores compared to baseline neural topic models
- Incorporating labels improves topic quality rather than harming it, contrary to initial expectations
- The model successfully learns interpretable author-topic distributions and identifies author interests and similarities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Incorporating metadata such as labels and authorship information into neural topic models improves topic alignment and interpretability.
- Mechanism: By constraining the latent topic distribution using expert-aligned priors derived from labels and learning topic-author distributions, FANToM ensures topics are more aligned with human intentions and author interests.
- Core assumption: The latent topic distribution in neural topic models is unstable and unconstrained, leading to misalignment with human intentions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "FANToM allows for the inclusion of this metadata when available, producing interpretable topics and author distributions for each topic."
  - [section]: "We hypothesize that the misalignment observed in neural topic models, is largely a consequence of the unconstrained nature of the latent topic distribution."
  - [corpus]: Weak - the corpus provides related papers but no direct evidence for this mechanism.
- Break condition: If the metadata is inaccurate or incomplete, the alignment may be compromised, leading to poor topic quality.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Learning a shared embedding space between topics, authors, and words enhances the interpretability and utility of the topic model.
- Mechanism: FANToM learns embeddings for topics, authors, and words simultaneously, allowing for the identification of author interests and the computation of similarities between authors and topics.
- Core assumption: Authors tend to focus on a limited range of topics, and understanding these interests is fundamental for NLP and information retrieval tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Additionally, it identifies author interests and similarities."
  - [section]: "Modeling author interests enables us to answer key questions about document content, such as which subjects an author covers, which authors have similar writing styles, and which authors work on comparable topics."
  - [corpus]: Weak - the corpus provides related papers but no direct evidence for this mechanism.
- Break condition: If the author information is noisy or incomplete, the learned embeddings may not accurately reflect author interests.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: FANToM improves topic quality compared to existing neural topic models by incorporating labels and authors.
- Mechanism: By aligning topics with labels and authors, FANToM produces more expressive, homogeneous topics that are closely aligned with the labels, leading to higher topic quality scores.
- Core assumption: Incorporating metadata does not harm the quality of the topics produced; on the contrary, it even improves the quality significantly.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Experimental results show that FANToM improves upon existing models in terms of both topic quality and alignment."
  - [section]: "Contrary to our expectation of a trade-off between alignment and topic quality, incorporating labels does not harm the quality of the topics produced; on the contrary, it even improves the quality significantly."
  - [corpus]: Weak - the corpus provides related papers but no direct evidence for this mechanism.
- Break condition: If the label or author information is not relevant to the topic structure, incorporating it may not improve topic quality.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
  - Why needed here: FANToM is built upon VAE-based topic models, and understanding VAEs is crucial for understanding the architecture and training process.
  - Quick check question: What is the role of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence term in the VAE loss function?

- Concept: Dirichlet Distribution
  - Why needed here: FANToM uses Dirichlet priors and posteriors to model the document-topic distributions, and understanding the Dirichlet distribution is essential for understanding the model's behavior.
  - Quick check question: How does the Dirichlet distribution differ from the Gaussian distribution in terms of its properties and applications?

- Concept: Topic Coherence and Diversity
  - Why needed here: FANToM is evaluated using topic coherence and diversity metrics, and understanding these concepts is crucial for interpreting the results and comparing FANToM to baselines.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between topic coherence and topic diversity, and why are both important for evaluating topic models?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Encoder (document representation) -> Posterior parameters (αp) -> Sampling (z) -> Decoder (document reconstruction) + Decoder (author reconstruction) -> Expert alignment loss (KL divergence)
- Critical path: Encoder -> Sampling -> Decoder -> Reconstruction -> Loss computation -> Parameter update
- Design tradeoffs: Incorporating metadata improves alignment but may introduce additional complexity and computational overhead. Using a separate decoder for authors allows for learning topic-author distributions but requires author information.
- Failure signatures: Poor topic alignment may indicate inaccurate or incomplete metadata. Low topic quality may suggest issues with the encoder or decoder architectures.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement FANToM with a simple VAE baseline and evaluate topic quality and alignment on a small dataset.
  2. Incorporate author information and evaluate the learned topic-author distributions and author similarities.
  3. Compare FANToM to existing supervised and unsupervised neural topic models on benchmark datasets.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does FANToM perform on multilingual datasets compared to monolingual ones?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that LLMs face limitations with multilinguality and that finding small-scale LLMs for label assignment in some languages may be impractical.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide experiments or results on multilingual datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing FANToM's performance on multilingual datasets against monolingual datasets, including runtime and alignment quality metrics.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of using different expert label sources (human vs. LLM) on the alignment quality of FANToM?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using both human experts and LLMs for label assignment and notes that LLMs can achieve high accuracy (92%) in label assignment.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not compare the alignment quality of FANToM when using different expert sources.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comparison of FANToM's alignment quality (using metrics like purity and NMI) when trained with labels from human experts versus LLMs.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does FANToM's topic quality and alignment change when applied to datasets with varying label granularity (e.g., broad vs. specific labels)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses the issue of misaligned topics and the need for alignment, suggesting that label granularity could impact alignment.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore how different levels of label granularity affect FANToM's performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying FANToM to datasets with different label granularities and measuring changes in topic quality (TQ) and alignment (purity, NMI).

## Limitations
- Model performance heavily depends on the quality and completeness of metadata (labels and author information)
- Experimental evaluation focuses primarily on quantitative metrics with limited qualitative analysis of learned author-topic distributions
- Does not thoroughly explore performance when only partial metadata is available

## Confidence

- Topic quality improvement claims: High confidence - supported by quantitative metrics (Purity, NMI) and multiple datasets
- Author embedding utility claims: Medium confidence - demonstrated through similarity calculations but limited qualitative analysis
- Generalizability claims: Medium confidence - validated on three datasets but all in English and from similar domains

## Next Checks

1. Conduct ablation studies removing either labels or author information to quantify their individual contributions
2. Evaluate on multilingual datasets to test cross-lingual generalizability
3. Implement downstream tasks (e.g., author classification, document recommendation) to validate practical utility of learned author-topic distributions
