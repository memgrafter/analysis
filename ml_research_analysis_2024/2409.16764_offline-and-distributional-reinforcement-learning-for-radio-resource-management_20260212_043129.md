core_contribution: This paper addresses the challenge of radio resource management
  (RRM) in wireless networks by proposing an offline and distributional reinforcement
  learning (RL) scheme that enables safe optimization without requiring online interaction
  with the environment. The core method combines Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) with
  Quantile Regression Deep Q-Network (QR-DQN) to optimize both the weighted sum-rate
  and 5-percentile rate while considering environmental uncertainties through return
  distributions.

# Offline and Distributional Reinforcement Learning for Radio Resource Management

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.16764
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16764
- Authors: Eslam Eldeeb; Hirley Alves
- Reference count: 20
- Primary result: Proposes CQR algorithm combining CQL with QR-DQN to optimize weighted sum-rate and 5-percentile rate in offline RRM setting

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses radio resource management in wireless networks through an offline and distributional reinforcement learning approach. The authors propose a Conservative Q-Learning with Quantile Regression DQN (CQR) algorithm that enables safe optimization from static datasets without requiring online interaction with the environment. The method models return distributions to capture environmental uncertainties while using CQL regularization to avoid overestimation of out-of-distribution actions. The proposed algorithm achieves a 10% gain in the combined performance metric (Rscore) compared to online RL while requiring less data for training.

## Method Summary
The CQR algorithm combines Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) with Quantile Regression Deep Q-Network (QR-DQN) to optimize both weighted sum-rate and 5-percentile rate in wireless networks. The method uses a static dataset collected from a behavioral policy (last 20% of experiences from converged online DQN) without environment interaction. The CQR loss combines the QR-DQN quantile regression loss with CQL's conservative regularization term, enabling the agent to learn from fixed data while modeling environmental uncertainty through return distributions. The reward function uses proportional fairness with parameter λ=0.8 to balance sum-rate and fairness objectives.

## Key Results
- CQR algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods on RRM tasks
- Achieves 10% gain in Rscore (weighted combination of sum-rate and 5-percentile rate) compared to online RL
- Requires less data than online RL while achieving superior performance
- Only offline RL scheme that surpasses online RL performance in the evaluated setting

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Combining CQL with QR-DQN overcomes distributional shift and uncertainty problems in offline RL for RRM
- Mechanism: CQL regularizes Q-function to avoid overestimation of OOD actions by penalizing values of unseen actions, while QR-DQN models full return distribution through quantile estimates, capturing uncertainty and risk
- Core assumption: Offline dataset contains sufficient coverage of relevant state-action pairs and behavioral policy is reasonably close to optimal
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states CQR "outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods" and is "only scheme that surpasses online RL"; section explains CQL adds regularization to overcome overestimation from OOD actions; QR-DQN section describes estimation of return distributions using fixed dirac delta functions
- Break condition: If dataset is too sparse or biased, CQL penalty may be insufficient and QR-DQN may produce unreliable quantiles

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Using proportional fairness (PF) factor as reward enables stable and fair optimization
- Mechanism: PF factor wm(t) inversely proportional to long-term rate of user, giving higher priority to users with lower throughput; transforms hard-to-optimize Rscore objective into sum of weighted rates that DRL algorithms can handle more stably
- Core assumption: PF formulation correctly reflects desired fairness and rate trade-off in wireless network setting
- Evidence anchors: Section shows reward function formulated as rt = MX m=1 (wm(t))λ Rm(t); section proves objective simplified using PF
- Break condition: If λ set too high or low, PF reward may overly favor one objective, degrading other

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Offline training with CQR enables safe and efficient policy learning without online interaction
- Mechanism: Training entirely from static dataset collected via behavioral policy avoids exploration phase that causes poor service and resource waste in online RL; CQR loss ensures conservative updates while learning full return distribution
- Core assumption: Static dataset is representative enough to learn good policy and behavioral policy is not too suboptimal
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states algorithm enables safe optimization without online interaction; section explains offline RL uses static dataset without online interaction; Fig. 4 shows CQR outperforms online RL by 20% in Rscore
- Break condition: If behavioral policy is highly suboptimal or dataset too small, offline policy may never recover online RL performance

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation for RRM
  - Why needed here: RRM problem modeled as MDP so RL algorithms can find optimal scheduling policy maximizing weighted sum and 5-percentile rate
  - Quick check question: What are the state, action, and reward components in the RRM MDP described in the paper?

- Concept: Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) for offline RL
  - Why needed here: CQL addresses distributional shift problem by penalizing Q-values of OOD actions, enabling safe learning from static data
  - Quick check question: How does CQL loss function differ from standard DQN loss?

- Concept: Distributional RL and Quantile Regression
  - Why needed here: Distributional RL models full return distribution instead of expected return, allowing agent to account for uncertainty and risk in wireless environment
  - Quick check question: What is role of quantile regression Huber loss in QR-DQN?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Wireless network (N APs, M UEs) -> State representation (SINR measurements, weighting factors) -> CQR agent (neural network) -> Action selection (scheduling decisions) -> Reward (PF-based) -> Performance evaluation (sum-rate, 5-percentile rate, Rscore)

- Critical path:
  1. Collect static dataset using behavioral policy
  2. Initialize CQR neural network with 2 hidden layers of 256 neurons each
  3. Sample mini-batches from dataset
  4. Compute CQR loss combining LCQR = 1/2 LQR-DQN + α E[log ∑ exp(θj(s, ˜a)) - θj(s, a)]
  5. Perform gradient update
  6. Evaluate policy on test episodes

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Dataset size vs. performance: Larger datasets (20% of online DQN experience) yield better performance than smaller ones (10%)
  - Number of quantiles I: More quantiles provide better distribution estimates but increase computational cost
  - Conservative penalty α: Higher values increase conservatism but may slow learning

- Failure signatures:
  - Policy collapse: If CQL penalty too high, agent may assign near-zero value to all actions
  - Distributional instability: If quantile estimates diverge, return distribution may become unreliable
  - Overfitting to dataset: If behavioral policy too suboptimal, learned policy may inherit its flaws

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train CQR on small dataset (10% of online DQN experience) and evaluate sum-rate, 5-percentile rate, and Rscore
  2. Train CQR on larger dataset (20% of online DQN experience) and compare performance metrics
  3. Vary number of quantiles I and observe effect on performance and training stability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does performance of CQR algorithm scale with network size and varying mobility patterns?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper notes scalability evaluated on 100 unique test episodes but does not investigate performance under different network sizes or mobility scenarios
- Why unresolved: Current results limited to fixed network size (4 APs, 24 UEs) and constant mobility (1 m/s), leaving impact of scaling and dynamic mobility unexplored
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments with varying numbers of APs and UEs, testing different mobility patterns (variable speeds or user densities) would provide insights into algorithm's scalability and robustness

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does quality of offline dataset affect CQR performance, and what is minimum dataset size required for reliable convergence?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper mentions dataset quality heavily affects convergence and compares performance using 20% and 10% of converged online DQN's experiences, but does not explore impact of dataset diversity or size thresholds
- Why unresolved: Analysis focuses on two fixed dataset sizes, leaving relationship between dataset quality, size, and algorithm performance unclear
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying dataset size, diversity, and collection strategies would clarify minimum requirements for reliable performance

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does proposed CQR algorithm perform in multi-agent settings with decentralized decision-making or coordination challenges?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Paper focuses on centralized training approach for RRM but does not address complexities of multi-agent RL such as decentralized execution or inter-agent coordination
- Why unresolved: Current formulation assumes centralized control framework, and extending to decentralized or distributed settings introduces challenges like communication overhead and non-stationarity
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing and evaluating CQR algorithm in multi-agent RRM scenarios with varying degrees of decentralization and coordination requirements would demonstrate applicability to more complex wireless network environments

## Limitations

- Reliance on dataset collected from converged online DQN agent may not reflect realistic offline RL scenarios where data comes from potentially suboptimal behavioral policies
- Claim of "10% gain over online RL" should be interpreted cautiously as maximum observed gain (20%) and may not be consistently reproducible
- Paper does not provide statistical significance testing across multiple runs, which is critical for RL evaluation

## Confidence

- High confidence: Theoretical framework combining CQL and QR-DQN is sound and well-established in literature
- Medium confidence: Implementation details and experimental results are likely correct but lack statistical validation
- Low confidence: Generalizability of results to different network configurations and behavioral policies

## Next Checks

1. Perform statistical significance testing across at least 5 independent runs to establish confidence intervals for reported performance metrics
2. Evaluate CQR on datasets collected from varying quality behavioral policies (including suboptimal ones) to test robustness
3. Test algorithm on different network configurations (varying N, M, and user densities) to assess scalability and generalization
