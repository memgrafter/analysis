# Automated Extraction and Creation of FBS Design Reasoning Knowledge Graphs from Structured Data in Product Catalogues Lacking Contextual Information

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.05868
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05868
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: 71% overall classification accuracy for automated FBS knowledge graph construction from structured legacy data

## Executive Summary
This research addresses the challenge of extracting design reasoning knowledge from legacy product catalogues that lack contextual information by developing an automated FBS (Function-Behaviour-Structure) ontology-based knowledge graph creation system. The method employs rule-based techniques and NLP to classify product catalogue data into FBS categories, overcoming the inherent difficulties of ontological incongruence and absent relationship mapping in structured datasets. The workflow integrates a custom FBS classification system validated through expert review and iterative refinement, demonstrating practical effectiveness for industrial applications despite classification limitations. The system provides a foundation for automated knowledge representation and retrieval from specification sheets, enabling future design generation and innovation within the FBS framework.

## Method Summary
The approach combines rule-based classification techniques with natural language processing to extract and classify product catalogue data into FBS ontology categories. The workflow begins with data preprocessing and segmentation, followed by application of custom classification rules to assign FBS categories to product attributes. A knowledge graph is then populated using these classifications, with relationship mapping established through predefined FBS ontologies. The system employs iterative refinement through expert review to improve classification accuracy, with the final model achieving 71% overall accuracy across validation datasets.

## Key Results
- Achieved 71% overall classification accuracy across FBS categories
- Function classification performed best at 73% precision, followed by Structure at 78% precision
- Behaviour classification showed the lowest performance at 57% precision
- Successfully demonstrated knowledge graph population and querying capabilities for industrial applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The system leverages rule-based classification combined with NLP techniques to extract meaningful design reasoning patterns from structured data lacking contextual information. By applying predefined FBS ontologies and classification rules to product catalogue attributes, the method systematically categorizes product features into functional, behavioural, and structural components. This approach enables the creation of knowledge graphs that capture design intent and relationships, even when original contextual information is absent from legacy datasets.

## Foundational Learning
- **FBS Ontology Framework**: Why needed: Provides structured representation of design reasoning relationships; Quick check: Verify FBS categories align with product domain specifications
- **Rule-based Classification**: Why needed: Enables deterministic categorization without extensive training data; Quick check: Validate rule coverage across product attribute types
- **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Why needed: Facilitates semantic relationships and query capabilities; Quick check: Test graph traversal and relationship extraction
- **Expert Validation**: Why needed: Ensures classification accuracy and domain relevance; Quick check: Review classification results against expert annotations
- **Iterative Refinement**: Why needed: Improves model performance through feedback loops; Quick check: Measure accuracy improvements across refinement cycles

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Preprocessing -> Rule-based Classification -> Knowledge Graph Population -> Expert Validation -> Iterative Refinement

**Critical Path**: Raw product data flows through preprocessing, classification rules extract FBS categories, knowledge graph constructs semantic relationships, expert review validates results, refinement improves future classifications.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Rule-based approach offers transparency and deterministic behavior but sacrifices adaptability compared to machine learning methods; custom FBS system provides domain specificity but limits generalizability across product categories.

**Failure Signatures**: Low classification precision indicates rule coverage gaps or ambiguous product attributes; inconsistent knowledge graph relationships suggest FBS category misclassification or incomplete ontology definitions.

**First Experiments**: 1) Test classification accuracy on a single product category with known ground truth; 2) Evaluate knowledge graph query performance on sample design problems; 3) Measure classification performance across different data formats (CSV, JSON, XML).

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Rule-based approach may not generalize well across diverse product domains or data formats
- Classification accuracy of 71% overall indicates significant room for improvement
- Small validation sample size (n=10 datasets) may not capture all edge cases in real-world applications
- Absence of comparison with alternative NLP or machine learning approaches limits performance context

## Confidence
**High confidence**: Feasibility of automated FBS classification from structured data without contextual information; overall workflow architecture
**Medium confidence**: Classification accuracy figures and their interpretation; effectiveness of custom FBS system
**Low confidence**: Generalizability across different product domains; long-term sustainability of rule-based classification system

## Next Checks
1. Test classification system on diverse product categories (electronics, machinery, consumer goods) to assess domain generalizability and identify category-specific rule modifications needed.
2. Conduct comparative evaluation against modern machine learning approaches (e.g., transformer-based models) using same validation datasets to benchmark performance improvements.
3. Implement longitudinal study tracking knowledge graph's utility in actual design innovation tasks, measuring time savings and design quality improvements in industrial applications.
