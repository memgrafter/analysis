# A Survey on Complex Tasks for Goal-Directed Interactive Agents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.18538
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18538
- Authors: Mareike Hartmann; Alexander Koller
- Reference count: 35
- One-line primary result: This survey compiles and structures the current landscape of tasks for evaluating goal-directed interactive agents, highlighting the diverse challenges they pose.

## Executive Summary
This survey systematically examines tasks for evaluating goal-directed interactive agents, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding and comparing different evaluation approaches. The authors introduce a formal POMDP-based framework to characterize tasks, distinguishing between those requiring world state manipulation versus information retrieval or transformation. The survey reveals trends toward increasingly complex environments and action spaces, emphasizing the need for agents capable of sophisticated reasoning and planning. Key findings highlight the impact of task properties like action space size, trajectory length, and domain specificity on agent performance, while underscoring the importance of standardized evaluation methods for reproducible research.

## Method Summary
The survey employs a systematic literature review approach, analyzing 26 task datasets and environments across physical simulation, digital interface, and information retrieval domains. Tasks are formalized as Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) with explicit goal specifications. The authors categorize tasks based on action space types (discrete, parameterized, natural language), observation modalities (visual, textual, structured), and goal types (world state vs. question answering). Evaluation methods are classified into goal state, reference answer, and trajectory-based approaches. The analysis considers task difficulty indicators including trajectory length, action space size, and domain specificity.

## Key Results
- Task diversity forces agents to develop general reasoning strategies rather than domain-specific heuristics
- POMDP formalization enables systematic analysis of task difficulty and agent capabilities
- Standardized evaluation metrics are crucial for fair comparison across diverse agent architectures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Task diversity forces agents to learn general reasoning strategies rather than domain-specific heuristics.
- Mechanism: By exposing agents to tasks spanning physical simulations, digital interfaces, and information retrieval, the survey creates a curriculum that requires flexible abstraction across modalities.
- Core assumption: Performance improvements in one task domain transfer to others through shared underlying reasoning patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The survey reveals a trend towards increasingly complex environments and action spaces, necessitating agents capable of sophisticated reasoning and planning."
  - [section] "We consider as observation any information the environment exposes to the agent as a result of action execution. Tasks differ in how much and what type of information an observation conveys."
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers focus on GUI agents and multimodal agents, but don't explicitly discuss transfer across diverse task domains.
- Break condition: If agents show poor cross-task generalization despite training on multiple domains, indicating domain-specific rather than general reasoning.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Formal POMDP framework enables systematic analysis of task difficulty and agent capabilities.
- Mechanism: The survey's formalization of tasks as POMDPs with explicit goal specifications allows researchers to isolate and measure specific challenges like partial observability or complex action spaces.
- Core assumption: POMDP formalization captures the essential elements of interactive agent tasks in a way that enables meaningful comparison and analysis.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We formally define a task instance as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) ⟨S, A, T, O, Ω⟩, augmented with an initial state S0 and a goal specification G."
  - [section] "The agent's objective is to come up with a sequence of actions from A to complete the goal specified by G by interacting with the environment."
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers mention POMDPs but don't extensively use the framework for systematic task analysis.
- Break condition: If the POMDP formalization fails to capture key aspects of agent tasks, leading to misleading conclusions about task difficulty or agent capabilities.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Standardized evaluation metrics enable fair comparison across diverse agent architectures.
- Mechanism: By distinguishing between goal state evaluation, reference answer evaluation, and trajectory evaluation, the survey provides a framework for assessing different aspects of agent performance.
- Core assumption: Different evaluation methods capture complementary aspects of agent capability, and standardization enables meaningful comparisons.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Key findings include the impact of task properties like action space size, trajectory length, and domain specificity on agent performance, as well as the importance of standardized evaluation methods for reproducible research."
  - [section] "Task evaluation serves to determine if an agent successfully completed a given task, i.e. established goal conditions. Most tasks included in our survey specify goal conditions which can objectively be assessed as satisfied or violated."
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers mention evaluation but don't provide the comprehensive framework described in the survey.
- Break condition: If different evaluation methods produce contradictory assessments of agent performance, suggesting they don't measure the same underlying capabilities.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs)
  - Why needed here: The survey uses POMDPs as the formal framework for defining agent tasks, so understanding POMDPs is essential for interpreting the analysis.
  - Quick check question: What are the key components of a POMDP and how do they relate to the elements of an interactive agent task?

- Concept: Action space parameterization
  - Why needed here: The survey distinguishes between different types of action spaces (discrete, parametric, natural language), which affects how agents interact with environments.
  - Quick check question: How does the size and structure of an action space impact the difficulty of a task for an agent?

- Concept: Goal specification and evaluation
  - Why needed here: The survey categorizes tasks by goal type (world state vs. question answering) and evaluation method, which determines how agent success is measured.
  - Quick check question: What are the differences between goal state evaluation, reference answer evaluation, and trajectory evaluation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Task specification → POMDP formalization → action space design → observation space design → evaluation method selection → agent architecture choice
- Critical path: From raw task description through POMDP formalization to final agent implementation and evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: More complex action spaces enable more sophisticated interactions but increase computational cost; partial observability adds realism but makes learning harder; standardized evaluation enables comparison but may not capture all aspects of agent capability
- Failure signatures: Poor cross-task generalization despite training on multiple domains; inability to handle tasks requiring domain-specific knowledge; evaluation methods producing contradictory assessments
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a simple agent that solves a single task from each of the three major categories (physical simulation, digital interface, information retrieval) to establish baseline capabilities.
  2. Test the agent's ability to generalize to unseen tasks within each category by training on a subset and evaluating on held-out tasks.
  3. Compare different evaluation methods (goal state, reference answer, trajectory) on the same agent performance to understand their relative strengths and weaknesses.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we design a standardized framework for evaluating the reliability of LLM-based evaluators for task completion?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights the use of LLMs as evaluators and notes that their reliability is an open question, citing variance in correlation with human judgments across tasks and models.
- Why unresolved: LLM-based evaluators are increasingly used for their scalability, but their judgments may lack consistency and alignment with human preferences. This is critical for ensuring fair and reproducible evaluations.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing LLM-based evaluators with human judgments across diverse tasks, along with metrics to quantify evaluator reliability and robustness.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the key factors that make a task inherently difficult for LLM-based agents, and how can these be objectively measured?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses indicators of task difficulty, such as trajectory length, action space size, and domain specificity, but notes that a comprehensive and objective measure is lacking.
- Why unresolved: While subjective measures like human completion time exist, an objective metric would enable better task design and agent evaluation, but such a metric has not been established.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and validation of a standardized difficulty metric, tested across a wide range of tasks and agent architectures.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can agent-user interaction be effectively integrated into goal-directed tasks to handle incomplete or ambiguous goal specifications?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies the need for agent-user interaction in realistic scenarios where users cannot fully specify their goals upfront and highlights the challenges in combining this with tool use.
- Why unresolved: Current agent architectures struggle with interactive scenarios, and there is limited research on frameworks that combine goal-directed interaction with user collaboration.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of benchmarks and evaluation protocols for agent-user interaction, along with empirical studies demonstrating improved task completion in ambiguous scenarios.

## Limitations

- POMDP Formalization Scope: The extent to which POMDPs capture all relevant aspects of complex interactive tasks remains unclear, potentially oversimplifying certain nuances.
- Evaluation Method Standardization: Practical implementation of consistent metrics across diverse task domains presents significant challenges.
- Generalization Claims: Evidence for cross-domain transfer remains largely theoretical and requires more empirical validation.

## Confidence

- High Confidence: Systematic categorization of task properties and comprehensive coverage of existing benchmark datasets
- Medium Confidence: Claims about relationship between task properties and agent performance
- Low Confidence: Predictions about future trends and effectiveness of proposed evaluation frameworks

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Task Transfer Validation**: Design and execute experiments to test whether agents trained on diverse task sets show improved generalization compared to agents trained on homogeneous task sets, using the POMDP framework to ensure consistent task representation.

2. **Evaluation Method Consistency**: Conduct a systematic comparison of different evaluation approaches (goal state, reference answer, trajectory) across multiple agent architectures and task types to assess their reliability and consistency in measuring agent capability.

3. **POMDP Framework Completeness**: Test the POMDP formalization against a set of complex real-world tasks to identify any significant aspects of agent-environment interaction that are not captured by the current framework, particularly for tasks involving extensive tool use or natural language interaction.
