# ElectroVizQA: How well do Multi-modal LLMs perform in Electronics Visual Question Answering?

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2412.00102
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00102
- **Reference count:** 20
- **Primary result:** MLLMs achieve only 54-62% accuracy on electronics visual QA tasks, with significant limitations in visual understanding

## Executive Summary
This work introduces ElectroVizQA, a new benchmark dataset of 626 visual question-answering tasks focused on digital electronics problems. The dataset is designed to assess the capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) in solving engineering-related visual tasks, with detailed annotations across conceptual, visual context, and solving strategy dimensions. Experiments on state-of-the-art MLLMs, including GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-sonnet, show that these models achieve only moderate accuracy (around 54–62%) on the VQA subset, with significantly lower performance in visual understanding tasks such as gate recognition and transistor diagrams. The study highlights key limitations in current MLLMs for engineering domains and provides insights for future improvements.

## Method Summary
The ElectroVizQA benchmark was created through a systematic data collection process involving electronics experts who curated 626 visual question-answering tasks focused on digital electronics. Each task includes detailed annotations across three dimensions: conceptual understanding requirements, visual context elements, and solving strategy approaches. The dataset encompasses various electronics topics including logic gates, transistor diagrams, and circuit analysis problems. State-of-the-art MLLMs including GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-sonnet were evaluated on this benchmark using standardized evaluation metrics to assess their performance in interpreting and solving visual electronics problems.

## Key Results
- MLLMs achieved only 54-62% accuracy on the VQA subset of ElectroVizQA
- Visual understanding tasks (gate recognition, transistor diagrams) showed significantly lower performance than conceptual tasks
- GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-sonnet demonstrated similar performance patterns, suggesting fundamental limitations in MLLM visual understanding for electronics
- The benchmark successfully identified specific failure modes in MLLM reasoning about visual electronics problems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The benchmark works by systematically evaluating MLLM capabilities through structured visual electronics problems that require both domain knowledge and visual interpretation skills. The three-dimensional annotation framework captures the complexity of electronics visual reasoning tasks, enabling detailed analysis of model performance across different cognitive dimensions. The curated dataset includes diverse visual elements (logic gates, transistor symbols, circuit diagrams) that challenge MLLMs' ability to extract and reason about visual information in technical contexts.

## Foundational Learning
**Digital Electronics Fundamentals** - Understanding of logic gates, Boolean algebra, and basic circuit principles is essential because the benchmark focuses on digital electronics problems that require technical domain knowledge. Quick check: Verify understanding of basic logic gate operations and truth tables.

**Visual Pattern Recognition** - Ability to identify and interpret schematic symbols, circuit diagrams, and electronic components is critical since the tasks involve complex visual elements. Quick check: Test ability to recognize standard electronic symbols and diagram conventions.

**Multi-modal Integration** - Combining textual reasoning with visual interpretation skills is necessary as tasks require both reading comprehension and visual analysis. Quick check: Practice solving problems that require simultaneous text and image interpretation.

## Architecture Onboarding
**Component Map:** ElectroVizQA Dataset -> Annotation Framework -> MLLM Evaluation Pipeline -> Performance Analysis
**Critical Path:** Visual Electronics Problem → MLLM Input Processing → Visual Understanding → Domain Reasoning → Answer Generation → Accuracy Measurement
**Design Tradeoffs:** Dataset size vs. comprehensiveness, annotation depth vs. annotation time, evaluation breadth vs. evaluation depth
**Failure Signatures:** Inability to recognize standard electronic symbols, confusion between similar circuit elements, failure to extract relevant visual information, incorrect application of domain knowledge to visual contexts
**3 First Experiments:**
1. Evaluate baseline MLLM performance on simple logic gate recognition tasks
2. Test MLLM ability to interpret basic transistor circuit diagrams
3. Assess performance on combined visual-textual electronics problems requiring both visual understanding and domain reasoning

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Dataset size of 626 tasks may be insufficient for robust statistical analysis
- Focus on digital electronics limits generalizability to other engineering domains
- Evaluation limited to only two state-of-the-art MLLMs
- Lack of detailed error analysis beyond visual understanding limitations

## Confidence
- High confidence in core findings about MLLM limitations in electronics visual understanding
- Medium confidence in dataset representativeness and generalizability to broader engineering domains
- Medium confidence in relative performance comparisons between evaluated models

## Next Checks
1. Expand dataset evaluation to include at least 5-10 additional MLLM models across different architectural families to establish broader performance baselines and identify model-specific strengths/weaknesses.

2. Conduct inter-annotator reliability testing on a subset of tasks to quantify annotation consistency and identify potential sources of bias in the three-dimensional annotation framework.

3. Perform detailed error analysis categorizing failures by visual element type (e.g., gate symbols, transistor diagrams, timing diagrams) to identify specific visual understanding bottlenecks requiring targeted model improvements.
