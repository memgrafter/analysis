core_contribution: This paper presents Lantern, a framework that improves multi-modal
  emotion recognition by leveraging large language models (LLMs) through prompting
  with receptive-field-aware attention weighting. The method trains a multi-task vanilla

  these predictions as references to prompt LLMs for refinement.

# Push the Limit of Multi-modal Emotion Recognition by Prompting LLMs with Receptive-Field-Aware Attention Weighting

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.17674
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17674
- Reference count: 37
- Primary result: Up to 1.80% accuracy gain on IEMOCAP using LLM prompting with receptive-field-aware attention weighting

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces Lantern, a framework that enhances multi-modal emotion recognition by leveraging large language models (LLMs) through strategic prompting. The approach addresses the challenge of incorporating external knowledge and contextual understanding from LLMs while avoiding the computational expense of processing multimedia directly. By training a multi-task vanilla model to predict emotion class probabilities and dimension scores, Lantern uses these predictions as references to prompt LLMs for refinement, achieving significant improvements on the IEMOCAP dataset.

## Method Summary
Lantern employs a two-stage approach where a vanilla model first predicts emotion classes and dimension scores from multi-modal inputs. These predictions serve as references for prompting LLMs, which provide refined emotional understanding through their contextual knowledge. The framework slices dialogues into different receptive fields and applies an attention-driven weighting mechanism to merge predictions from both the vanilla model and LLMs. This approach effectively combines the precision of trained models with the broad contextual understanding of LLMs without requiring direct multimedia processing by the LLMs.

## Key Results
- Up to 1.23% accuracy gain in 6-way emotion classification using CORECT as vanilla model
- Up to 1.80% accuracy gain in 4-way emotion classification using CORECT as vanilla model
- 0.79% accuracy improvement using SDT in 6-way settings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The framework works by creating a synergistic relationship between traditional multi-modal models and LLMs. The vanilla model handles the computationally expensive task of processing raw multimedia data, while LLMs contribute their extensive external knowledge and contextual understanding through prompt-based refinement. The receptive-field-aware attention weighting mechanism ensures that predictions are appropriately weighted based on their relevance and confidence, allowing the system to leverage the strengths of both approaches effectively.

## Foundational Learning

**Multi-modal Emotion Recognition**
- Why needed: Understanding how different modalities (audio, visual, text) contribute to emotional state prediction
- Quick check: Verify that the vanilla model processes all available modalities and captures their interactions

**Receptive Field Analysis**
- Why needed: Determines how much contextual information is considered for each prediction
- Quick check: Confirm that dialogue slicing captures relevant temporal context for emotion recognition

**Attention Weighting Mechanisms**
- Why needed: Ensures appropriate integration of predictions from multiple sources
- Quick check: Validate that attention weights reflect prediction confidence and contextual relevance

**LLM Prompt Engineering**
- Why needed: Maximizes the utility of LLM knowledge without direct multimedia processing
- Quick check: Test different prompt formulations to optimize LLM response quality

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**
Vanilla Model -> Receptive Field Slicer -> Attention Weighting -> LLM Prompting -> Prediction Fusion

**Critical Path**
1. Multi-modal input processing by vanilla model
2. Dialogue slicing into receptive fields
3. Attention-driven prediction weighting
4. LLM-based refinement through prompting
5. Final prediction fusion

**Design Tradeoffs**
- Computational efficiency vs. accuracy (using LLMs only for refinement rather than direct processing)
- Model complexity vs. generalization (balancing vanilla model sophistication with LLM integration)
- Temporal context vs. processing overhead (receptive field sizing)

**Failure Signatures**
- Poor performance if vanilla model predictions are consistently inaccurate
- Degraded results if attention weighting fails to appropriately weight predictions
- LLM prompt failures leading to irrelevant or incorrect refinements

**First 3 Experiments to Run**
1. Baseline comparison using only the vanilla model without LLM prompting
2. Ablation study with different receptive field sizes to find optimal context window
3. Cross-dataset validation on MELD or MOSEI to test generalizability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to IEMOCAP dataset, raising generalizability concerns
- Modest accuracy improvements (maximum 1.80%) may not justify computational overhead
- Potential cascading errors from vanilla model predictions affecting LLM refinement quality

## Confidence
- Core methodology and implementation: High
- Quantitative results on IEMOCAP: High
- Generalizability to other datasets and domains: Medium
- Practical deployment viability and scalability: Low
- Robustness across different LLM architectures: Low

## Next Checks
1. Test the framework on additional multi-modal emotion recognition datasets (e.g., MELD, MOSEI) to assess cross-dataset generalization
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing different receptive field sizes and attention weighting strategies to optimize computational efficiency
3. Evaluate performance using multiple LLM architectures (GPT, Claude, LLaMA) to determine dependency on specific model characteristics
