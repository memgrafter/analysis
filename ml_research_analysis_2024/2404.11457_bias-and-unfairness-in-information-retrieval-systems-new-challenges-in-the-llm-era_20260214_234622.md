# Bias and Unfairness in Information Retrieval Systems: New Challenges in the LLM Era

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.11457
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11457
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Comprehensive survey of bias and unfairness in IR systems with LLMs, unifying these issues as distribution mismatch problems and categorizing mitigation strategies.

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive survey of bias and unfairness in information retrieval (IR) systems integrated with large language models (LLMs). The authors present a unified perspective that treats both bias and unfairness as distribution mismatch problems, enabling systematic categorization of mitigation strategies. The survey identifies specific bias and unfairness issues arising at three critical stages of LLM integration: data collection, model development, and result evaluation. By organizing mitigation strategies into data sampling and distribution reconstruction approaches, the paper offers a practical framework for researchers and practitioners to address these emerging challenges in IR systems.

## Method Summary
The paper uses a unified theoretical framework of distribution mismatch to analyze and categorize bias and unfairness in LLM-integrated IR systems. The authors systematically review literature to identify bias types (such as source bias, factuality bias, position bias, popularity bias, and instruction-hallucination bias) and unfairness issues across three stages of IR system development. Mitigation strategies are organized into two principal categories: data sampling (data augmentation and filtering) and distribution reconstruction (rebalancing, regularization, and prompting). The paper synthesizes findings from 40+ sources and maintains a GitHub repository with relevant papers and resources to support the research community.

## Key Results
- Unifies bias and unfairness as distribution mismatch problems, providing a common theoretical foundation for analysis
- Identifies stage-specific bias types in LLM-integrated IR systems: source bias, factuality bias, position bias, popularity bias, and instruction-hallucination bias
- Organizes mitigation strategies into six sub-categories across data sampling and distribution reconstruction approaches
- Highlights open problems including unified mitigation frameworks, feedback loops, and the need for theoretical analysis to complement empirical findings

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Unifying bias and unfairness as distribution mismatch problems provides a common theoretical foundation for analyzing and mitigating both issues.
- Mechanism: By framing both bias and unfairness as instances where the predicted result distribution (𝑃(b𝑅)) diverges from a target distribution (𝑃(𝑅)), the paper enables a systematic categorization of mitigation strategies into data sampling (augmentation, filtering) and distribution reconstruction (rebalancing, regularization, prompting).
- Core assumption: Distribution alignment is a sufficient and practical abstraction to unify diverse bias and fairness issues across different stages of IR systems.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We first unify bias and unfairness issues as distribution mismatch problems, providing a groundwork for categorizing various mitigation strategies through distribution alignment."
  - [section 2.2] "Based on the Equation 1, the bias and unfairness problem can be explained as follows: • Bias stems from systemic deviations... • Unfairness deeply rooted in cultural and societal notions of fairness..."
- Break condition: If certain bias or unfairness issues cannot be meaningfully expressed as distribution mismatches, the unification would fail to capture them.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Different stages of LLM integration into IR systems (data collection, model development, result evaluation) each introduce distinct types of bias and unfairness.
- Mechanism: The paper identifies specific biases (e.g., source bias, factuality bias, position bias, popularity bias) and unfairness (e.g., user unfairness, item unfairness) that arise uniquely at each stage due to LLM-generated content, model behavior, or evaluation practices.
- Core assumption: The integration of LLMs introduces qualitatively new challenges compared to traditional IR systems.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Subsequently, we systematically delve into the specific bias and unfairness issues arising from three critical stages of LLMs integration into IR systems: data collection, model development, and result evaluation."
  - [section 3.1.1] "Source Bias: IR models tend to rank content generated by LLMs higher than content authored by humans."
  - [section 3.3.2] "Egocentric Bias: LLM-based evaluators prefer the responses generated by themselves or LLMs from the same family."
- Break condition: If empirical studies show that these stage-specific issues are not significant or can be fully explained by traditional IR biases, the claim would weaken.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Mitigation strategies can be systematically organized into two principal categories: data sampling and distribution reconstruction, each with specific sub-strategies.
- Mechanism: Data sampling modifies the input data to better match the target distribution (augmentation completes the distribution, filtering truncates it). Distribution reconstruction adjusts the model or output to align with the target (rebalancing transforms the distribution, regularization narrows it, prompting extracts the best aligned distribution).
- Core assumption: All effective mitigation strategies can be mapped onto one of these six sub-categories.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Based on this unified view, we categorize mitigation strategies into two principal groups: data sampling and distribution reconstruction."
  - [section 2.3] "Data Sampling focuses on directly modifying the data: • Data Augmentation... • Data Filtering... Distribution Reconstruction aims at adjusting the predicted distribution: • Rebalancing... • Regularization... • Prompting..."
- Break condition: If a new mitigation strategy emerges that cannot be classified into any of these sub-categories, the taxonomy would need revision.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Distribution alignment and its role in unifying bias and unfairness.
  - Why needed here: This concept is the foundation for the paper's unified perspective and categorization of mitigation strategies.
  - Quick check question: What is the core equation that represents the distribution mismatch problem in the paper?

- Concept: Types of bias and unfairness introduced by LLM integration at different stages.
  - Why needed here: Understanding these specific issues is crucial for identifying appropriate mitigation strategies.
  - Quick check question: Which type of bias emerges when LLM-generated content is included in the IR corpus?

- Concept: The distinction between data sampling and distribution reconstruction as mitigation approaches.
  - Why needed here: This distinction guides the selection and implementation of mitigation strategies.
  - Quick check question: How does data augmentation differ from data filtering in the context of distribution alignment?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data Collection -> Model Development -> Result Evaluation. LLM integration affects each stage differently, introducing specific biases and unfairness. Mitigation strategies operate on either the data (sampling) or the model/output (reconstruction).
- Critical path: The most critical path for addressing bias and unfairness is likely: identify the stage and type of issue -> select the appropriate mitigation strategy category -> implement the specific sub-strategy -> evaluate effectiveness.
- Design tradeoffs: Data sampling strategies may require more data preprocessing but can be model-agnostic. Distribution reconstruction strategies are model-specific but can be more targeted. Balancing effectiveness and computational cost is crucial.
- Failure signatures: If mitigation strategies do not improve fairness metrics or introduce new biases, it may indicate a mismatch between the strategy and the underlying issue, or unintended consequences of the approach.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a data augmentation strategy to address source bias by adding more human-written content to the training corpus.
  2. Apply a prompting strategy to mitigate position bias by designing instructions that encourage the model to disregard input order.
  3. Use a rebalancing strategy to address popularity bias by adjusting the loss weights for popular and long-tail items during training.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can unified mitigation frameworks effectively address multiple types of bias and unfairness simultaneously in IR systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies this as a key challenge, noting that current methods primarily address individual instances of bias or unfairness, but there is a need for unified solutions that consider interconnected relationships between different types of bias and unfairness.
- Why unresolved: Different types of bias and unfairness are interconnected, and addressing them in isolation may be ineffective or even counterproductive. A unified framework would need to balance competing objectives and trade-offs.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and empirical validation of unified mitigation frameworks that can effectively address multiple types of bias and unfairness simultaneously in IR systems, with measurable improvements in overall fairness and bias reduction.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What are the long-term impacts of feedback loops between users, models, and information on bias and unfairness in IR systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper highlights this as an important problem, noting that feedback loops can significantly shape user perceptions, behaviors, and preferences, which in turn influence the training data for IR models, creating a cycle that may reinforce and amplify existing biases and unfairness.
- Why unresolved: Feedback loops are complex and dynamic, and their long-term impacts are difficult to predict and measure. Understanding these impacts requires longitudinal studies and careful analysis of user behavior and model performance over time.
- What evidence would resolve it: Longitudinal studies tracking the evolution of bias and unfairness in IR systems over extended periods, along with analysis of user behavior and model performance data to identify patterns and causal relationships.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can robust theoretical analysis augment empirical findings on bias and unfairness in IR systems?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper identifies this as a critical need, noting that current exploration of bias and unfairness has predominantly been through empirical studies, but there is a need for robust theoretical analysis to augment these findings.
- Why unresolved: Theoretical analysis requires developing formal models and mathematical frameworks to capture the complex interactions between bias, unfairness, and IR systems. This is a challenging task that requires interdisciplinary collaboration between computer scientists, statisticians, and social scientists.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of rigorous theoretical frameworks that can explain the emergence and persistence of bias and unfairness in IR systems, along with empirical validation of these frameworks through experiments and case studies.

## Limitations

- The theoretical framework of distribution mismatch may not capture all nuances of bias and fairness in practice.
- Effectiveness of proposed mitigation strategies may vary significantly across different IR tasks and LLM architectures.
- Many identified issues are based on emerging research rather than extensive empirical validation, suggesting some findings may evolve as the field matures.

## Confidence

- High: The categorization of mitigation strategies into data sampling and distribution reconstruction is well-founded and practically useful.
- Medium: The identification of stage-specific bias types (source bias, factuality bias, etc.) is supported by current research but requires further empirical validation.
- Medium: The unified framework treating bias and unfairness as distribution mismatches is theoretically sound but may have practical limitations.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct empirical studies measuring the prevalence and impact of source bias and factuality bias across different IR benchmarks with LLM-generated content.
2. Evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed taxonomy of mitigation strategies by implementing and comparing multiple approaches on a common set of bias/fairness issues.
3. Investigate the generalizability of the distribution mismatch framework by testing it against cases where bias/fairness issues arise from structural constraints rather than distributional differences.
