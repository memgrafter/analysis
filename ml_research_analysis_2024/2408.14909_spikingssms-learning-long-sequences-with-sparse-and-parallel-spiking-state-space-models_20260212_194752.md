# SpikingSSMs: Learning Long Sequences with Sparse and Parallel Spiking State Space Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.14909
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14909
- Reference count: 10
- Combines SSMs with spiking neurons to achieve sparse, energy-efficient long-sequence modeling with 90% sparsity

## Executive Summary
SpikingSSMs integrate spiking neural networks with state space models to enable efficient long-sequence modeling. By combining the long-range dependency modeling capabilities of SSMs with the sparse, event-driven computation of spiking neurons, SpikingSSMs achieve competitive performance while maintaining high sparsity. A surrogate dynamic network (SDN) is introduced to approximate leaky integrate-and-fire neuron dynamics, enabling efficient parallel training. Experiments demonstrate that SpikingSSMs achieve state-of-the-art performance among spiking models while using only one-third the size of existing spiking large language models.

## Method Summary
The SpikingSSM architecture hierarchically integrates spiking neurons with SSM blocks to achieve sparse synaptic computation. The key innovation is the surrogate dynamic network (SDN) that approximates LIF neuron dynamics, addressing the challenge of parallelizing event-driven neuronal computation. The SDN enables efficient training by replacing complex spiking dynamics with a differentiable approximation while preserving the essential temporal properties of spiking behavior. This allows SpikingSSMs to be trained efficiently on standard hardware while maintaining the energy efficiency characteristics of spiking neural networks.

## Key Results
- Achieves 90% network sparsity on average across benchmarks
- Outperforms existing spiking large language models on WikiText-103 with only one-third the model size
- Maintains competitive performance with state-of-the-art SSMs on sequential MNIST and Long Range Arena tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The success of SpikingSSMs stems from combining the sequential modeling strength of SSMs with the sparse, event-driven computation of spiking neurons. SSMs excel at capturing long-range dependencies through their continuous-time formulation, while spiking neurons provide natural sparsity through discrete spiking events. The SDN approximation bridges these paradigms by enabling efficient training of spiking dynamics on parallel hardware. The hierarchical integration allows different layers to specialize - lower layers capture local features through spiking activity while higher layers leverage SSMs for long-range context. This complementary combination achieves both computational efficiency and modeling power.

## Foundational Learning

**State Space Models**: Continuous-time dynamical systems for sequence modeling. Needed for capturing long-range dependencies efficiently. Quick check: Verify that the HiPPO framework is properly implemented for the SSM components.

**Spiking Neural Networks**: Event-driven neural networks where computation occurs only on spikes. Needed for achieving sparse, energy-efficient computation. Quick check: Confirm that the LIF neuron dynamics are correctly approximated by the SDN.

**Surrogate Gradients**: Differentiable approximations for non-differentiable functions. Needed for training spiking neurons with backpropagation. Quick check: Validate that the SDN provides accurate gradients for the spiking dynamics.

**Hierarchical Integration**: Combining different computational paradigms at different network layers. Needed to leverage complementary strengths of spiking and SSM approaches. Quick check: Ensure that the hierarchical design properly balances local and global feature extraction.

**Continuous-Time Dynamics**: Mathematical framework for modeling systems that evolve continuously over time. Needed for the SSM component's theoretical foundation. Quick check: Verify that the discretization of continuous dynamics preserves essential properties.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input -> Spiking SSM Blocks -> SDN Approximation -> SSM Blocks -> Output. The architecture alternates between spiking computation layers and SSM layers, with SDN providing the training bridge.

**Critical Path**: Data flows through the hierarchical structure where spiking neurons in early layers provide sparse activation patterns, which are then processed by SSM blocks that capture temporal dependencies. The SDN runs in parallel during training to provide gradient signals.

**Design Tradeoffs**: The main tradeoff is between the accuracy of spiking dynamics approximation (SDN) and training efficiency. A more accurate SDN would be more computationally expensive, while a simpler approximation might degrade performance. The choice of where to place spiking versus SSM layers also represents a design decision balancing local versus global processing.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation would likely manifest as either (1) loss of sparsity benefits if SDN approximation becomes too dense, or (2) insufficient modeling capacity if the spiking component cannot capture necessary temporal patterns. Hardware-specific failures might include inefficient spiking patterns that don't translate to real energy savings.

**First Experiments**: 1) Verify sparsity levels on synthetic sequential data to confirm the 90% target, 2) Test SDN approximation accuracy by comparing learned weights with and without spiking dynamics, 3) Benchmark computational efficiency on both standard and neuromorphic hardware platforms.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper acknowledges that empirical validation of energy savings and actual inference latency gains on neuromorphic hardware remains to be demonstrated. Additionally, the scalability of SpikingSSMs to extremely long sequences and their performance in real-world deployment scenarios with noisy or non-stationary data distributions are identified as open questions requiring further investigation.

## Limitations

- Energy savings and inference latency gains remain theoretical without hardware validation on neuromorphic platforms
- SDN approximation fidelity across diverse tasks and distributions has not been rigorously tested
- Comparisons against standard transformer architectures are limited, making efficiency claims difficult to contextualize

## Confidence

- High confidence in the methodological framework combining SSMs with spiking neurons and SDN approximation
- Medium confidence in the reported sparsity metrics and their relationship to actual energy savings
- Low confidence in the scalability claims beyond the evaluated benchmarks without hardware validation

## Next Checks

1. Conduct experiments measuring actual energy consumption and latency on neuromorphic hardware platforms to validate the claimed efficiency benefits

2. Perform systematic ablation studies on SDN approximation accuracy across diverse sequential tasks and data distributions

3. Compare SpikingSSM performance against standard transformer architectures with equivalent parameter counts on language modeling benchmarks to contextualize the efficiency claims
