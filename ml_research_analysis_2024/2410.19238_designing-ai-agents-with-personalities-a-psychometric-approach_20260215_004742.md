# Designing AI-Agents with Personalities: A Psychometric Approach

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.19238
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19238
- Reference count: 19
- Key outcome: AI agents created using BFI-2 prompts align more closely with human responses on Mini-Markers tests than simpler personality assignment methods.

## Executive Summary
This research introduces a psychometric methodology for assigning quantifiable, controllable, and validated personalities to AI agents using the Big Five personality framework. Across four studies, it demonstrates that large language models can capture semantic similarities among Big Five measures, and that AI agents created using BFI-2 prompts align more closely with human responses on Mini-Markers tests than simpler personality assignment methods. In risk-taking scenarios, agents with similar Big Five traits to humans showed comparable behavioral patterns, though results were less consistent in moral dilemma contexts. The approach provides a systematic method for creating personality-valid agents, though discrepancies in finer response patterns indicate they cannot yet fully substitute for human participants in precision or high-stakes research.

## Method Summary
The methodology involves creating AI agents with specific Big Five personality traits through prompt engineering based on the BFI-2 assessment, then validating their responses against human personality test data. The approach uses embedding techniques to analyze semantic relationships between personality constructs, creates agents using both Likert and Expanded prompt formats, and validates them through convergent correlations and confirmatory factor analysis. The research also explores parametric simulation using sample statistics to generate personality data for agent creation, and tests behavioral validity through risk-taking and moral dilemma scenarios.

## Key Results
- LLMs capture semantic similarities among Big Five measures with moderate FMR scores (0.41-0.65) in related literature
- AI agents created using BFI-2 prompts show convergent correlations with human responses on Mini-Markers tests
- Agents with similar Big Five traits to humans show comparable behavioral patterns in risk-taking scenarios
- Safety alignment and context forgetting limit agents' ability to simulate complex human decision-making in moral dilemmas

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Large language models can capture semantic similarities among Big Five personality measures through embedding techniques.
- Mechanism: Personality-related words and phrases are converted into high-dimensional vectors (3072 dimensions) that capture their semantic meaning. Cosine similarity between these vectors quantifies construct overlap between different personality assessment items, while t-SNE visualization reveals clusters of semantically similar items.
- Core assumption: LLMs trained on natural language data contain sufficient semantic information about personality constructs to represent them meaningfully in embedding space.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Across three studies, we evaluate its feasibility and limitations. In Study 1, we show that large language models (LLMs) capture semantic similarities among Big Five measures, providing a basis for personality assignment."
  - [section] "Embeddings Techniques: To analyze these embeddings, we employed two main techniques, namely, cosine similarity and t-SNE."
  - [corpus] Found 8 related papers with FMR scores ranging from 0.41 to 0.65, indicating moderate semantic overlap in the literature on personality traits and LLMs.
- Break condition: If embedding models fail to capture nuanced distinctions between personality constructs (e.g., treating "envious" and "jealous" as identical), the semantic similarity approach breaks down.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: AI agents can internalize and manifest human psychological traits when prompted with psychometrically validated personality data.
- Mechanism: Agents are created by embedding participants' Big Five Inventory-2 responses into prompts, then validated by comparing their responses to alternative Big Five tests. High convergent correlations between input personality scores and agent responses indicate successful trait internalization.
- Core assumption: LLMs can process personality assessment data and generate responses consistent with those personality profiles.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "In Study 2, we create AI-Agents using prompts designed based on the Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2) in different format, and find that AI-Agents powered by new models align more closely with human responses on the Mini-Markers test."
  - [section] "Convergent Correlations: Table 2 shows the convergent correlation coefficients between the Agents' Mini-Markers scores and input BFI2 scores, and the participants' real Mini-Markers scores."
  - [corpus] Papers on "Deterministic AI Agent Personality Expression" and "SAC: A Framework for Measuring and Inducing Personality Traits" suggest broader research interest in personality-based LLM behavior.
- Break condition: If agents show inconsistent response patterns or extreme bias (e.g., perfect correlation between distinct items like "envious" and "jealous"), the internalization mechanism fails.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Parametric approaches using sample statistics can effectively create AI agents with simulated personality data.
- Mechanism: Key statistics (facet means, standard deviations, correlations) are extracted from empirical data and used to simulate personality responses. These simulated responses are then assigned to agents, which are validated using the same methods as empirical data.
- Core assumption: Sample statistics capture sufficient information about personality distributions to generate realistic synthetic responses.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Study 3 introduces a parametric approach for developing Agents using sample statistics derived from existing personality data."
  - [section] "Using these statistics, we simulated BFI2 responses based on several assumptions: (1) normal distribution of domain scores, facet scores, and errors; (2) a linear relationship between correlated facets; and (3) domain scores are independent."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence for parametric personality simulation; this represents a novel methodological contribution.
- Break condition: If simulated responses fail to match the psychometric properties of empirical data (e.g., reliability coefficients or factor loading patterns), the parametric approach breaks down.

## Foundational Learning

- Big Five Personality Framework
  - Why needed here: This research specifically uses the Big Five framework as the theoretical foundation for personality assignment to AI agents. Understanding the framework is essential for interpreting the results and methodology.
  - Quick check question: What are the five broad domains of personality in the Big Five framework, and what does each represent?

- Psychometric Validation Methods
  - Why needed here: The research employs convergent correlations and confirmatory factor analysis to validate that AI agents' responses align with human personality patterns. These methods are central to establishing the approach's validity.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between convergent validity and discriminant validity in psychometric testing?

- Embedding and Vector Space Models
  - Why needed here: The first study uses text embeddings to analyze semantic relationships between personality items. Understanding how embeddings work is crucial for grasping the methodology.
  - Quick check question: How does cosine similarity between embeddings relate to semantic similarity of text?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data collection → Embedding analysis → Personality assignment via prompting → Psychometric validation → Behavioral validation
- Critical path: Personality assignment → Validation testing → Behavioral validation. Each stage must succeed for the overall approach to be valid.
- Design tradeoffs: Likert vs. Expanded format prompts - Likert is traditional but shows more bias, while Expanded is more robust but requires careful prompt engineering.
- Failure signatures: (1) Low convergent correlations indicating poor personality internalization, (2) Factor loading inconsistencies suggesting different response patterns, (3) Cultural/ethical misalignment in behavioral scenarios.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test embedding-based semantic similarity between different personality assessments using cosine similarity and t-SNE.
  2. Create agents using both Likert and Expanded formats, then validate against human responses on alternative personality tests.
  3. Simulate personality data from sample statistics and compare psychometric properties to empirical agent data.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can we develop a systematic framework for validating AI agents across different personality assessments beyond the Big Five?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates validation within the Big Five framework but notes the need for broader psychometric test coverage
- Why unresolved: The current methodology is limited to Big Five personality traits and hasn't been tested with other personality frameworks or psychometric instruments
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies demonstrating successful validation of AI agents using multiple personality assessment frameworks, including HEXACO, Myers-Briggs, and other established psychometric instruments

### Open Question 2
- Question: What mechanisms can be implemented to ensure AI agents maintain personality consistency across different contexts and over time?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions "context forgetting" and "hallucination" as limitations, and notes that personality traits should be "stable and reflective of their programmed characteristics"
- Why unresolved: Current models experience context forgetting and may not maintain consistent personality traits across extended interactions or different scenarios
- What evidence would resolve it: Development of AI architectures or training methods that demonstrate stable personality trait expression across diverse contexts and extended interaction periods

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can we quantify and mitigate the impact of safety alignment on AI agents' ability to simulate human personality traits, particularly for less socially desirable traits?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper notes that "market-available LLMs are intricately engineered to exhibit socially desirable traits" and that safety alignment "skews them away from engaging in severe moral judgments"
- Why unresolved: Safety alignment may suppress certain personality traits and behaviors, potentially limiting the validity of AI agents as human substitutes in research
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative studies measuring personality trait expression in aligned versus unaligned models, and development of alignment techniques that preserve authentic personality trait expression while maintaining safety

## Limitations

- Embedding-based semantic similarity may not capture nuanced distinctions between personality constructs, as evidenced by perfect correlation between "envious" and "jealous" items
- Agents show inconsistent patterns in moral dilemma scenarios, suggesting limitations in replicating complex human decision-making
- The parametric simulation approach relies on assumptions about normal distributions and linear relationships that may not hold for all personality facets

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The basic premise that LLMs can capture semantic relationships between personality constructs is well-supported by Study 1's embedding analysis and moderate FMR scores (0.41-0.65) with related literature.
- **Medium Confidence**: The personality assignment methodology shows validity through convergent correlations and CFA results, but the inconsistent moral dilemma outcomes and Neuroticism convergence issues indicate room for improvement.
- **Low Confidence**: The parametric simulation approach lacks direct validation against empirical data and represents a novel methodological contribution without established benchmarks.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-Cultural Validation**: Test the personality assignment approach with non-Western samples to assess cultural generalizability and identify potential cultural biases in agent responses.
2. **Fine-Grained Behavioral Analysis**: Conduct more granular analysis of agent decision patterns in moral dilemmas to understand why alignment breaks down in complex ethical scenarios.
3. **Longitudinal Stability Testing**: Evaluate whether personality-consistent agent behaviors remain stable across multiple interactions and scenarios, addressing potential drift in trait manifestation over time.
