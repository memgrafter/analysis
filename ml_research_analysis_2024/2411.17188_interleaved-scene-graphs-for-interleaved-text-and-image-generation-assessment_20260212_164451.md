# Interleaved Scene Graphs for Interleaved Text-and-Image Generation Assessment

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2411.17188
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17188
- **Reference count:** 40
- **Primary result:** ISG-Agent achieves 122% performance improvement over baselines in interleaved text-and-image generation

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ISG, a multi-granular evaluation framework for interleaved text-and-image generation, leveraging scene graphs to assess consistency across four levels: holistic, structural, block, and image. It also presents ISG-Bench, a benchmark of 1,150 samples across 8 categories and 21 subcategories, including vision-centric tasks like style transfer. Evaluations using ISG-Bench show that unified models struggle with interleaved generation, while compositional approaches improve holistic performance by 111% but still underperform at finer levels. The proposed ISG-Agent, using a "plan-execute-refine" pipeline, achieves a 122% performance gain over baselines, demonstrating improved coherence and accuracy in multimodal generation.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces ISG, an evaluation framework that uses scene graphs to capture relationships between text and image blocks in interleaved generation. It evaluates responses at four granularity levels using question-answering modules. ISG-Bench provides 1,150 samples across 8 categories and 21 subcategories. The framework includes ISG-Agent, which employs a "plan-execute-refine" pipeline to invoke specialized tools for improved performance. The evaluation uses VQA modules and MLLM-as-a-Judge for scoring.

## Key Results
- ISG-Agent achieves a 122% performance improvement over baselines
- Compositional approaches show 111% improvement over unified models at holistic level
- Unified models struggle with vision-centric tasks like style transfer and image decomposition
- ISG-Bench provides 1,150 samples across 8 categories and 21 subcategories

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** The ISG framework enables fine-grained, interpretable evaluation of multimodal content by translating structural requirements into question-answer pairs across four granular levels.
- **Mechanism:** ISG parses a multimodal query into a scene-graph-like structure where text and image blocks are nodes and their relationships are edges. At each evaluation level (holistic, structural, block, image), it generates specific question-answer pairs that assess the generated response's adherence to the query's requirements.
- **Core assumption:** Scene graph representation can accurately capture the semantic relationships between text and image blocks in interleaved content, and question-answering can reliably evaluate these relationships.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "ISG leverages a scene graph structure to capture relationships between text and image blocks, evaluating responses on four levels of granularity: holistic, structural, block-level, and image-specific."
  - [section] "ISG automatically parses queries into a scene-graph-like structure, where text and image blocks serve as nodes and their relationships as edges."
  - [corpus] Found 25 related papers with average neighbor FMR=0.508, indicating moderate similarity to existing interleaved generation work.
- **Break condition:** If the scene graph parsing fails to capture critical relationships or if the question-answering module cannot accurately assess the semantic content, the evaluation loses granularity and interpretability.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Compositional frameworks outperform unified models in interleaved generation by leveraging specialized models for perception and generation separately.
- **Mechanism:** The compositional approach uses separate models for understanding (MLLM) and generation (diffusion model), allowing each to specialize in its modality. This separation enables better handling of complex vision-language dependencies compared to unified models that must balance both tasks simultaneously.
- **Core assumption:** Specialized models for each modality can process and generate content more accurately than unified models that must handle both tasks end-to-end.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Compositional approaches that combine separate language and image models show a 111% improvement over unified models at the holistic level."
  - [section] "While compositional approaches that combine separate language and image models show a 111% improvement over unified models at the holistic level, their performance remains suboptimal at both block and image levels."
  - [corpus] Moderate FMR scores suggest related work exists but indicates room for improvement in unified approaches.
- **Break condition:** If the integration between perception and generation components introduces significant latency or synchronization issues, or if the separate models cannot maintain consistency across modalities.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** The "plan-execute-refine" pipeline in ISG-Agent achieves superior performance by systematically addressing generation challenges through structured planning and iterative refinement.
- **Mechanism:** ISG-Agent first plans tool usage based on the query, then executes the plan using specialized tools (image generation, editing, etc.), and finally refines the output by analyzing errors and improving text-image alignment. This structured approach ensures adherence to requirements and consistency.
- **Core assumption:** Systematic planning and iterative refinement can overcome the limitations of both unified and compositional approaches by providing explicit control over the generation process.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "To facilitate future work, we develop ISG-AGENT, a baseline agent employing a 'plan-execute-refine' pipeline to invoke tools, achieving a 122% performance improvement."
  - [section] "ISG-A GENT generates interleaved text and images through a 'Plan-Execute-Refine' pipeline... achieving a 122% performance improvement."
  - [corpus] The framework's novel approach to interleaved generation suggests it addresses gaps in existing methodologies.
- **Break condition:** If the planning component cannot accurately interpret complex queries or if the refinement process introduces inconsistencies, the pipeline's performance degrades.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Scene graph representation and its application to multimodal content
  - Why needed here: ISG relies on scene graphs to capture relationships between text and image blocks, which is fundamental to its evaluation framework
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how scene graphs represent entities, attributes, and relationships in multimodal content?

- **Concept:** Question-answering evaluation methodology for multimodal content
  - Why needed here: The framework generates questions from structural requirements and evaluates responses through VQA modules, which is central to its evaluation approach
  - Quick check question: How does the VQA module assess both textual and visual content in the generated responses?

- **Concept:** Compositional vs. unified model architectures in multimodal generation
  - Why needed here: The paper contrasts compositional frameworks (separate models) with unified models (end-to-end), which is crucial for understanding performance differences
  - Quick check question: What are the key architectural differences between compositional and unified approaches to interleaved generation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Query → Scene graph parsing → Question generation → VQA evaluation → Score aggregation (ISG Framework); Task collection → Query generation → Golden answer creation → Cross-validation → Safety checking (ISG-Bench); Planning component → Tool usage component → Refinement component → Tool library integration (ISG-Agent)

- **Critical path:** For ISG evaluation: Query → Scene graph parsing → Question generation → VQA evaluation → Score calculation. For ISG-Agent: Query → Planning → Tool execution → Refinement → Final output.

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Granularity vs. efficiency: Four-level evaluation provides detailed assessment but increases computational cost
  - Automation vs. accuracy: Automated evaluation enables scalability but may miss nuanced quality aspects
  - Specialization vs. integration: Compositional approaches offer better performance but require complex coordination

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Low structural accuracy: Indicates failure in understanding query format requirements
  - Poor block-level scores: Suggests issues with individual content generation accuracy
  - Weak image-level performance: Points to problems with visual content generation or evaluation

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Implement basic scene graph parsing on simple interleaved queries and verify node/edge extraction accuracy
  2. Test question generation for structural requirements and validate against human-annotated ground truth
  3. Evaluate VQA module performance on simple text-image relationships before scaling to complex cases

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** How can unified models be improved to better handle vision-centric tasks like style transfer and image decomposition?
- **Basis in paper:** Explicit - The paper shows unified models underperform in vision-dominant tasks, with Anole and Show-o failing to generate accurate images for tasks like "Style Transfer" and "Image Decomposition."
- **Why unresolved:** Unified models lack sufficient vision-dominant instruction tuning samples, and current datasets are language-centric, failing to establish robust vision-language dependencies.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Performance improvements in unified models on vision-dominant tasks after training on interleaved datasets with vision-centric instructions.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** Can the evaluation framework be simplified to reduce reliance on AI models while maintaining transparency and reliability?
- **Basis in paper:** Inferred - The paper mentions potential trustworthiness issues with LLMs in evaluation and suggests reducing AI models in the evaluation process, similar to Task Me Anything.
- **Why unresolved:** LLMs used in ISG still make mistakes in evaluation and lack transparent, interpretable results.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** A new evaluation framework that uses fewer AI models but achieves similar or better alignment with human judgments.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** How can compositional frameworks be optimized to improve continuity and reduce resource intensity?
- **Basis in paper:** Explicit - The paper identifies continuity issues in ISG-Agent and notes that large language models operate as black boxes, making it difficult to control exact prompts input into the Tool Agent.
- **Why unresolved:** The Tool Agent struggles with accessing information from earlier stages and providing accurate information into the tool, leading to discontinuity and high resource consumption.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Improved compositional frameworks that maintain continuity across steps and demonstrate reduced computational resource usage while maintaining or improving performance.

## Limitations
- The framework's reliance on automated evaluation may miss subtle nuances in multimodal coherence
- Performance gaps at block and image levels suggest fundamental limitations in current interleaved generation approaches
- The benchmark's focus on 8 categories may not represent real-world interleaved generation diversity

## Confidence
- **High Confidence:** The 122% performance improvement claim for ISG-Agent over baselines, supported by systematic methodology and clear metrics
- **Medium Confidence:** The 111% improvement for compositional approaches over unified models, as this comparison depends on specific model implementations and configurations
- **Medium Confidence:** The framework's ability to capture complex language-vision dependencies through scene graphs, though effectiveness may vary with query complexity

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation studies to validate automated ISG scores against human judgments of multimodal coherence and quality
2. Test ISG evaluation on a broader range of interleaved generation scenarios beyond the 8 benchmark categories
3. Perform ablation studies on the ISG-Agent pipeline to isolate the contribution of each component (planning, execution, refinement) to overall performance gains
