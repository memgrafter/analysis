# Evaluating geometric accuracy of NeRF reconstructions compared to SLAM method

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.11238
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11238

- Primary result: SLAM method achieved 5 mm diameter error vs 22-27 mm for NeRF methods

## Executive Summary
This paper compares NeRF-based 3D reconstruction methods with traditional LiDAR-inertial SLAM for measuring PVC pipe diameter. Two NeRF reconstructions were created using iPhone 14 camera data with ARKit poses and robot-sourced imagery with LIOSAM-derived poses, compared against a LiDAR-inertial SLAM point cloud. While NeRF reconstructions showed visually impressive results with less surface noise than SLAM, the SLAM method provided the most accurate diameter estimates (within 5 mm), while NeRF methods achieved 2.2-2.7 cm error (5.68-7.12%). The study demonstrates NeRFs can produce metrically-relevant scene geometry from mobile phone and robot imagery, offering promising accessible alternatives to expensive LiDAR-inertial SLAM systems.

## Method Summary
The study evaluated geometric accuracy of NeRF reconstructions by training two models on different datasets: iPhone 14 imagery with ARKit poses and robot imagery with LIOSAM-derived poses. Both used the nerfacto method for training. A LiDAR-inertial SLAM point cloud reconstruction served as baseline comparison. PVC pipe diameter was estimated using TreeTool's RANSAC-based circle fitting. Image quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) were computed to compare reconstruction quality. The approach tested whether NeRF methods could match SLAM accuracy for metric measurements while offering advantages in surface noise reduction.

## Key Results
- SLAM method achieved 5 mm diameter error (within 1.28% of expected size)
- iPhone NeRF achieved 22 mm error (5.68% of expected size)
- Robot NeRF achieved 27 mm error (7.12% of expected size)
- NeRF reconstructions exhibited significantly less surface noise than SLAM point clouds

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
NeRFs work by learning a continuous volumetric representation of a scene from 2D images and camera poses. The nerfacto implementation improves on base-NeRF with pose refinement and ray-sampling enhancements. When trained on sufficient views of an object like a PVC pipe, NeRFs can reconstruct surface geometry that enables metric measurements, though with less accuracy than LiDAR-based methods. The reduction in surface noise compared to SLAM occurs because NeRFs produce smooth, interpolated surfaces rather than discrete point clouds with measurement uncertainty.

## Foundational Learning
**Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)**: Learn continuous 3D scene representation from 2D images and poses. Why needed: Enables 3D reconstruction from sparse imagery without depth sensors. Quick check: Can reconstruct novel views of a scene from trained model.

**Pose Estimation**: ARKit for iPhone and LIOSAM for robot provide camera poses. Why needed: Accurate poses are critical for proper NeRF training and reconstruction. Quick check: Verify pose consistency across overlapping views.

**RANSAC Circle Fitting**: Used in TreeTool to estimate diameters from point clouds. Why needed: Robust method for fitting circles to noisy 3D point data. Quick check: Should produce reasonable estimates on clean circular data.

**Image Quality Metrics**: PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS measure reconstruction fidelity. Why needed: Quantify differences between reconstructions and ground truth. Quick check: Higher values indicate better reconstruction quality.

**Surface Noise**: Random variations in point cloud or mesh surfaces. Why needed: Affects measurement accuracy and visual quality. Quick check: Can be visually inspected or measured statistically.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: iPhone/Robot Camera -> Pose Estimation (ARKit/LIOSAM) -> NeRF Training (nerfacto) -> 3D Reconstruction -> TreeTool Analysis -> Diameter Estimation

**Critical Path**: Image capture → Pose estimation → NeRF training → 3D reconstruction → Diameter measurement

**Design Tradeoffs**: NeRFs offer smoother surfaces and accessibility without specialized hardware, but sacrifice accuracy compared to LiDAR-inertial SLAM. SLAM provides higher precision measurements but with more surface noise and requires expensive sensors.

**Failure Signatures**: Poor pose estimation causes reconstruction artifacts; insufficient image coverage leads to holes or inaccuracies; lighting variations affect NeRF training stability.

**First Experiments**: 1) Verify pose quality before training NeRFs; 2) Test NeRF reconstruction on simple geometric shapes; 3) Compare diameter estimates on objects with known dimensions.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

**Open Question 1**: How do different neural radiance field architectures compare in terms of geometric accuracy and noise reduction for 3D reconstruction tasks? The paper only evaluates nerfacto and doesn't compare to other state-of-the-art NeRF architectures.

**Open Question 2**: How does the accuracy of NeRF-based 3D reconstructions vary with the number and distribution of input images? The study uses fixed input data without exploring this relationship.

**Open Question 3**: What are the limitations of using RANSAC-based circle fitting for diameter estimation in noisy 3D point clouds, and how can these be addressed? The paper identifies bias in the current method but doesn't propose solutions.

## Limitations
- Single-object study limits generalizability to other geometries and materials
- 4-5x increase in measurement uncertainty compared to SLAM may be critical for precision applications
- No statistical analysis across multiple objects or scenes to strengthen conclusions

## Confidence
- **High confidence**: NeRF reconstructions exhibit less surface noise than SLAM point clouds
- **Medium confidence**: Relative performance ranking between iPhone NeRF and robot NeRF for diameter estimation
- **Medium confidence**: NeRFs offer accessible alternatives to LiDAR-inertial SLAM systems

## Next Checks
1. Test methodology on multiple objects with varying geometries and materials
2. Independently validate ARKit and LIOSAM pose accuracy using ground truth motion capture data
3. Evaluate NeRF reconstruction quality across different lighting conditions and times of day
