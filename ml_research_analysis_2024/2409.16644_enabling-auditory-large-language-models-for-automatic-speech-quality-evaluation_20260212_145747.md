# Enabling Auditory Large Language Models for Automatic Speech Quality Evaluation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.16644
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16644
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: Finetuned auditory LLMs achieve competitive performance with specialized models in MOS/SIM prediction, showing significant A/B testing accuracy improvements for large MOS differences, while natural language descriptions show promise but need refinement

## Executive Summary
This paper explores the use of auditory large language models (LLMs) for automatic speech quality evaluation across multiple tasks including MOS and SIM prediction, A/B testing, and natural language descriptions. The approach involves finetuning auditory LLMs like SALMONN, Qwen-Audio, and Qwen2-Audio with task-specific prompts. Experiments on NISQA, BVCC, SOMOS, and VoxSim datasets demonstrate that these finetuned models achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art task-specific models, particularly in MOS and SIM prediction. The results show that auditory LLMs can serve as versatile, general-purpose speech quality evaluators while providing more interpretable outputs through natural language descriptions.

## Method Summary
The method involves finetuning auditory LLMs using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) with task-specific prompts for speech quality assessment. Three auditory LLM architectures (SALMONN, Qwen-Audio, Qwen2-Audio) are trained on four datasets (NISQA, BVCC, SOMOS, VoxSim) for MOS prediction, SIM prediction, A/B testing, and natural language description generation. Dataset-specific prompts are designed to help the model adapt to different evaluation standards, and the models are trained for 10 epochs with the best model selected based on validation performance. WavLM-based SSL models serve as baselines with task-specific weights for comparison.

## Key Results
- Finetuned auditory LLMs achieve competitive LCC/SRCC scores with state-of-the-art task-specific models in MOS and SIM prediction across multiple datasets
- A/B testing accuracy improves significantly (up to 75.5%) when MOS score differences are large (>0.5), but drops for smaller differences
- Natural language descriptions show improved correlation scores after finetuning, though still require refinement for practical deployment
- SALMONN models generally outperform Qwen variants for MOS/SIM prediction, while Qwen-Audio performs better for A/B testing tasks

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Finetuning auditory LLMs with task-specific prompts enables them to predict MOS and SIM scores competitively with specialized models.
- Mechanism: Task-specific prompts guide the LLM to focus on relevant speech quality dimensions during finetuning, allowing the model to learn dataset-specific evaluation criteria while maintaining general speech understanding.
- Core assumption: The auditory LLM's pre-trained speech perception capabilities can be effectively adapted through instruction tuning to handle structured evaluation tasks without catastrophic forgetting.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "By employing task-specific prompts, auditory LLMs are finetuned to predict MOS, SIM and A/B testing results"
  - [section] "For MOS prediction task, all three datasets are used, with the SOMOS-clean scores used for the SOMOS dataset"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct comparison of finetuned vs non-finetuned performance in related works

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Using dataset-specific prompts improves MOS prediction accuracy by helping the LLM adapt to different evaluation standards.
- Mechanism: Prompts explicitly mention dataset names and standards, allowing the model to adjust its scoring behavior based on the specific characteristics and rating scales of each dataset (NISQA, BVCC, SOMOS).
- Core assumption: The auditory LLM can distinguish between different dataset standards and apply appropriate evaluation criteria when prompted with dataset-specific information.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "dataset-specific prompts are designed...allowing the model to adjust its predictions based on the particular characteristics of each dataset"
  - [section] "dataset-specific prompts are designed...incorporating the phrase 'according to Dataset standards'"
  - [corpus] Missing - no related work specifically addresses dataset-specific prompting for speech quality evaluation

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The ability to generate natural language descriptions for speech quality assessment provides more interpretable outputs compared to numerical scores alone.
- Mechanism: The LLM's text generation capabilities allow it to produce detailed evaluations covering multiple aspects (noisiness, distortion, discontinuity, overall quality) based on the audio input and task-specific prompts.
- Core assumption: The finetuned LLM can accurately ground its natural language descriptions in the actual auditory features present in the speech samples.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the finetuned auditory LLM is able to generate natural language descriptions assessing aspects like noisiness, distortion, discontinuity, and overall quality"
  - [section] "Natural language descriptions for speech quality: Auditory LLMs provide a detailed evaluation of speech samples, assessing aspects such as noisiness, distortion, discontinuity, and overall quality"
  - [corpus] Weak - while related work mentions descriptive evaluation, none specifically validates the grounding of descriptions in auditory evidence

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Multimodal instruction tuning
  - Why needed here: Auditory LLMs must learn to process both audio and text inputs simultaneously, requiring instruction tuning to align the audio encoder outputs with the LLM's text processing capabilities
  - Quick check question: How does the connection module align audio features with the LLM's textual input space?

- Concept: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA)
  - Why needed here: LoRA enables efficient finetuning of large LLMs by modifying only a small subset of parameters, making it practical to adapt large auditory models for speech quality tasks
  - Quick check question: What is the rank and scale used for LoRA in the finetuning process described?

- Concept: Speech quality metrics correlation
  - Why needed here: Understanding how different metrics (LCC, SRCC, MSE) evaluate model performance helps interpret results and compare against baselines
  - Quick check question: What are the three evaluation metrics used for MOS and SIM prediction?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Audio encoder → Connection module → LLM backbone → Task-specific output generation
- Critical path: Audio input → Feature extraction → Prompt concatenation → LLM response generation → Task-specific parsing
- Design tradeoffs: Larger LLM backbones provide better performance but increase computational cost; LoRA vs full finetuning affects parameter efficiency and performance
- Failure signatures: Poor MOS/SIM correlation scores, inconsistent A/B testing results, generic or irrelevant natural language descriptions
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test MOS prediction on NISQA dataset with and without dataset-specific prompts
  2. Evaluate A/B testing accuracy on SOMOS dataset for MOS score differences > 0.5
  3. Compare natural language description correlation scores before and after finetuning on NISQA dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different auditory LLM architectures (SALMONN vs Qwen-Audio/Qwen2-Audio) perform when fine-tuned for speech quality assessment tasks?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper compares multiple auditory LLM models (SALMONN, Qwen-Audio, Qwen2-Audio) across various speech quality tasks.
- Why unresolved: The paper shows varying performance across different tasks and datasets, with SALMONN generally performing better for MOS and SIM prediction while Qwen-Audio performs better for A/B testing. The underlying reasons for these architectural differences remain unclear.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic ablation studies comparing architectural components, additional fine-tuning experiments with modified architectures, and detailed error analysis across tasks would help explain the performance differences.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal prompt strategy for different speech quality assessment tasks when using auditory LLMs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper experiments with dataset-specific prompts and averaging across multiple prompts, showing different optimal strategies for different tasks and datasets.
- Why unresolved: While the paper demonstrates that prompt strategies affect performance, it doesn't establish a comprehensive framework for determining optimal prompts for new tasks or datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study varying prompt formulations, lengths, and structures across tasks, along with automated prompt optimization techniques, would establish best practices.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can auditory LLMs effectively handle speech quality assessment in real-world, out-of-domain scenarios?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper uses controlled datasets and mentions that using dataset-specific prompts with untrained models slightly hurts performance, suggesting potential generalization challenges.
- Why unresolved: The experiments focus on specific datasets with particular characteristics, and the paper acknowledges that averaging prompts might be more robust for out-of-domain samples without comprehensive validation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Extensive testing on diverse, real-world speech samples across different domains, acoustic conditions, and languages would demonstrate generalization capabilities.

## Limitations
- A/B testing performance degrades significantly for small MOS score differences (< 0.3), limiting practical applicability
- Natural language description evaluation relies on automated scoring by GPT-4o mini without human validation
- Limited comparison against specialized state-of-the-art models for A/B testing and description generation tasks

## Confidence
- **MOS and SIM Prediction Performance**: High confidence - Well-documented experimental results with multiple datasets and consistent improvements over baselines using established correlation metrics
- **A/B Testing Accuracy**: Medium confidence - Clear performance trend with larger MOS differences, but absolute accuracy values and variability need further investigation
- **Natural Language Description Quality**: Low confidence - Evaluation method relies on automated scoring without human validation, and the paper acknowledges descriptions still need refinement

## Next Checks
1. Conduct human evaluation of the natural language descriptions to validate the correlation scores obtained from GPT-4o mini and establish ground truth quality benchmarks
2. Perform detailed analysis of A/B testing accuracy across different MOS score difference ranges to identify the threshold where performance degrades and optimize model behavior for those cases
3. Evaluate the finetuned models on datasets not seen during training to assess their ability to generalize across different speech quality evaluation standards and recording conditions
