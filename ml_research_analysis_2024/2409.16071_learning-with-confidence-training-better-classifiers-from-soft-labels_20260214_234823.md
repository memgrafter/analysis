# Learning with Confidence: Training Better Classifiers from Soft Labels

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.16071
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16071
- Authors: Sjoerd de Vries; Dirk Thierens
- Reference count: 8
- Primary result: Soft label learning methods consistently outperform hard label methods across synthetic and real datasets, especially in low-data and imbalanced scenarios

## Executive Summary
This study investigates whether incorporating label uncertainty, represented as discrete probability distributions over class labels (soft labels), improves classification model performance compared to traditional hard labels. The authors developed wrapper methods for learning from soft labels, compatible with any classifier that can provide probability estimates and handle weights, enabling fair comparisons with hard label learning (HLL) methods. Experiments on synthetic data showed that soft label learning (SLL) methods significantly outperformed HLL methods, especially for small sample sizes and imbalanced datasets. When noise was introduced, including miscalibration models specific to human annotators, SLL methods still generally outperformed HLL methods. On a real-world dataset with confidence scores, SLL methods matched HLL performance for predicting hard labels while providing more accurate confidence estimates. Overall, SLL methods nearly always outperformed or matched HLL methods across all experiments, demonstrating the value of incorporating label uncertainty in classification tasks.

## Method Summary
The authors developed wrapper methods for learning from both hard and soft labels using identical base classifiers. These methods include thresholding, plurality voting, instance sampling (bootstrap/max), duplication, weighting, label sampling, and ensemble learning. The approach is compatible with any classifier supporting probability estimates and weights, tested with Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM (SGD), and Gaussian Naive Bayes. Synthetic datasets were generated using the SYNLABEL framework with ground truth models and partial ground truth with varying uncertainty levels. Noise was introduced through NCAR, NAR, and miscalibration models. Performance was evaluated using AUC for hard label prediction and TVD for soft label prediction, with statistical significance testing via Friedman Aligned-Ranks and Finner methods.

## Key Results
- Soft label learning methods consistently outperformed hard label methods across all experiments, achieving higher AUC scores
- The advantage of SLL methods increased with greater class imbalance and smaller sample sizes
- On the real-world UrinCheck dataset, SLL methods matched HLL performance for predicting hard labels while providing more accurate confidence estimates (lower TVD)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Soft label learning (SLL) methods consistently outperform hard label learning (HLL) methods when using the same base classifiers, especially in ensemble settings.
- Mechanism: Soft labels encode uncertainty as probability distributions over classes, allowing the model to weight training examples by confidence rather than treating them as definitively correct or incorrect. This preserves richer information per instance compared to hard labels, which collapse all probability mass onto a single class.
- Core assumption: The classifier used can accept example weights and produce probability estimates.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "wrapper methods for learning from both hard and soft labels using identical base classifiers"
  - [section] "the SoftEns methods consistently achieve the highest baseline AUC across the base classifiers"
  - [corpus] Weak—no direct citations yet, but closely related to "Learning from Ambiguous Data with Hard Labels" (arxiv:2501.01844)

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Soft labels provide greater advantage in low-data regimes and with imbalanced datasets.
- Mechanism: With few samples, each soft label carries more information than a single hard label because it approximates the distribution of possible true labels. This reduces variance in parameter estimates, especially when one class is underrepresented.
- Core assumption: Soft labels are well-calibrated (i.e., their probabilities reflect true class likelihoods).
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "soft labels can be used successfully for learning more accurate model parameters...especially for small sample sizes"
  - [section] "the distinction between soft and hard label performance increases with greater class imbalance"
  - [corpus] Weak—no direct citations yet, but closely related to "Soft-Label Training Preserves Epistemic Uncertainty" (arxiv:2511.14117)

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Miscalibration noise affects SLL and HLL differently; SLL is more sensitive to random noise but less affected by systematic miscalibration.
- Mechanism: Random noise (e.g., NCAR, NAR) directly corrupts probability estimates, hurting SLL more because it relies on the full distribution. Miscalibration (e.g., overprediction) systematically biases probabilities but can sometimes be partially corrected by the weighting scheme in SLL.
- Core assumption: Noise models used reflect realistic annotator behavior.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "the reaction of the HLL methods to the miscalibration noise models at the lower noise levels is the opposite of that of the SLL methods"
  - [section] "the SLL approaches were affected slightly more by noise, but nevertheless had better performance than the HLL methods"
  - [corpus] Weak—no direct citations yet, but closely related to "Soft-Label Training Preserves Epistemic Uncertainty" (arxiv:2511.14117)

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Wrapper methods for soft label learning
  - Why needed here: To enable fair comparison between soft and hard label methods using the same base classifiers.
  - Quick check question: Can the base classifier accept sample weights and output calibrated probabilities?

- Concept: Ensemble learning with instance sampling
  - Why needed here: Ensembles improve robustness to noise and leverage diversity, especially important when soft labels are uncertain.
  - Quick check question: Does the sampling strategy (bootstrap vs max) preserve the uncertainty information in soft labels?

- Concept: Label noise models and miscalibration
  - Why needed here: To simulate realistic annotation errors and understand how different noise types impact learning from soft labels.
  - Quick check question: Does the noise model applied depend only on the label (NAR) or also on the features (NNAR)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Base classifier → Wrapper method (thresholding, plurality voting, instance sampling, duplication, weighting) → Ensemble (optional) → Evaluation (AUC or TVD)
- Critical path: Soft label → Wrapper method preprocessing → Weighted training → Probability estimation → Evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: SLL gains information richness but adds sensitivity to noise; HLL is simpler but discards uncertainty information.
- Failure signatures: Poor performance with base classifiers that cannot handle weights; degradation when soft labels are highly noisy; overfitting when using single classifiers without ensemble diversity.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Train a DT base classifier with PluralityBootstrapClassifier on a small synthetic dataset; compare AUC to a hard label baseline.
  2. Introduce NCAR noise to soft labels; evaluate whether SoftEns methods maintain advantage over HardEns.
  3. Use a real-world dataset with confidence scores; compare calibration (TVD) between SLL and HLL methods.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Does the performance of soft label learning methods degrade linearly with increasing noise strength across all noise types?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Section 5.3 states that "β scales differently for the different noise models" making direct comparison between noise types impossible, and discusses varied reactions to noise levels
- Why unresolved: The paper shows non-linear and noise-type-specific performance degradation patterns, particularly for miscalibration noise versus random noise, but does not quantify whether degradation follows a consistent mathematical relationship
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments measuring performance degradation curves for each noise type at multiple β values, with statistical analysis of whether degradation patterns are linear or non-linear

### Open Question 2
- Question: How do soft label learning methods perform when the noise distribution changes over time or is instance-dependent?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper only examines static noise models (NCAR, NAR, miscalibration) applied uniformly to all instances, while real-world scenarios often involve dynamic or instance-specific noise patterns
- Why unresolved: The experimental design uses fixed noise parameters applied to all training instances, preventing analysis of method robustness to changing or heterogeneous noise distributions
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments with time-varying noise parameters and instance-specific noise rates, comparing method performance stability across different noise dynamics

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can soft label learning methods effectively handle multi-annotator scenarios where individual annotator quality varies?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper assumes soft labels are aggregated and treats them as black-box probability distributions, while many real-world scenarios involve multiple annotators with varying expertise levels
- Why unresolved: The wrapper method design discards information about individual annotator identities and quality, preventing analysis of whether maintaining this information improves performance
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments using methods that incorporate annotator-specific information versus black-box soft labels, measuring performance differences in multi-annotator settings

### Open Question 4
- Question: What is the computational complexity trade-off between soft label learning methods and traditional hard label learning methods?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper extensively compares method performance but does not analyze the computational resources required by different approaches, particularly for the ensemble-based soft label methods
- Why unresolved: While the paper mentions using SGD for speed in SVM implementation, it does not provide runtime comparisons or scalability analysis across different dataset sizes and method types
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic runtime measurements for each method across datasets of varying sizes, including analysis of how ensemble methods scale compared to single classifiers

## Limitations
- The wrapper methods assume base classifiers can handle sample weights and probability estimates; performance degrades if this assumption is violated
- Soft label effectiveness depends on calibration quality - poorly calibrated soft labels may not provide the claimed advantage
- Noise model realism is uncertain - the NCAR/NAR/miscalibration models may not fully capture complex real-world annotation behavior

## Confidence
- High confidence: SLL methods generally outperform HLL methods across synthetic and real datasets
- Medium confidence: Specific mechanisms explaining when and why SLL excels (low data, imbalance, noise sensitivity)
- Low confidence: Generalizability to all classifier types - some base classifiers may not support the required probability and weighting interfaces

## Next Checks
1. Test SLL methods with base classifiers that cannot handle weights to verify the dependency claim
2. Evaluate SLL performance on real-world datasets with known label noise patterns beyond the synthetic noise models
3. Compare SLL methods against state-of-the-art soft label approaches from the related literature to benchmark relative performance
