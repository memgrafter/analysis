# Two-stage Framework for Robust Speech Emotion Recognition Using Target Speaker Extraction in Human Speech Noise Conditions

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.19585
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19585
- Reference count: 31
- Key outcome: 14.33% improvement in unweighted accuracy (UA) using TSE-SER framework

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of robust speech emotion recognition (SER) in noisy conditions with human speech interference. The proposed two-stage framework first extracts target speaker speech from mixtures using target speaker extraction (TSE), then uses the extracted speech for SER training. Two training methods are explored: TSE-SER-base (sequential training) and TSE-SER-ft (joint fine-tuning of TSE and SER). Experiments on IEMOCAP dataset with LibriSpeech and ESD as noise sources show significant performance improvements compared to baseline SER without TSE, particularly for different-gender mixtures.

## Method Summary
The framework employs a two-stage cascaded architecture where a TD-SpeakerBeam model first extracts the target speaker's speech from mixed audio using an enrollment utterance as auxiliary information. The extracted speech is then fed into a ShiftCNN model for emotion classification. Two training approaches are implemented: sequential training where TSE and SER are trained independently (TSE-SER-base), and joint fine-tuning where both models are updated simultaneously using combined SiSNR and cross-entropy losses (TSE-SER-ft). The system was evaluated on IEMOCAP with artificially mixed human speech noise from LibriSpeech and ESD corpora, using 2-speaker mixtures with leave-one-session-out 5-fold cross-validation.

## Key Results
- 14.33% improvement in unweighted accuracy (UA) compared to baseline SER without TSE
- Joint training (TSE-SER-ft) outperforms sequential training with SI-SDRi improvement of 12.90 dB versus 7.68 dB
- Superior performance on different-gender mixtures (61.32% UA) compared to same-gender mixtures (55.95% UA)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The two-stage cascaded architecture improves emotion recognition by first isolating the target speaker's speech, thereby reducing interference from overlapping speakers.
- Mechanism: Target speaker extraction (TSE) uses auxiliary information (enrollment utterance) to compute an embedding vector representing the target speaker's acoustic characteristics. This embedding drives a mask estimator to separate the target speaker's speech from the mixture, which is then used as cleaner input for emotion recognition.
- Core assumption: Human speech noise from overlapping speakers significantly degrades emotion recognition performance, and isolating the target speaker's speech improves feature extraction for emotion classification.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our developed system achieves a 14.33% improvement in unweighted accuracy (UA) compared to a baseline without using TSE method, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework in mitigating the impact of human speech noise."
  - [section II-A] "the goal of the proposed framework is to extract the target speaker signal s0 from the mixture signal y for SER training."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related papers focus on speaker diarization and emotion recognition but don't specifically address TSE for emotion recognition in overlapping speech.
- Break condition: If the TSE model fails to accurately separate speakers (e.g., same-gender mixtures with similar acoustic characteristics), the extracted speech may still contain interfering signals, reducing the effectiveness of the framework.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Joint fine-tuning of TSE and SER models (TSE-SER-ft) performs better than sequential training (TSE-SER-base) because it allows the TSE model to adapt to task-specific emotional data.
- Mechanism: During joint training, both the TSE and SER models are updated simultaneously using both SiSNR loss (for TSE) and CE loss (for SER). This allows the TSE model to learn to extract features that are more beneficial for emotion recognition rather than just general speech separation.
- Core assumption: The features that are optimal for general speech separation may not be optimal for emotion recognition, and task-specific fine-tuning can improve the quality of extracted features.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Joint training (TSE-SER-ft) performs better than sequential training, with SI-SDRi improvement of 12.90 dB versus 7.68 dB."
  - [section II-C] "we further propose another training method called TSE-SER-ft... This joint training process not only refines the TSE system by adjusting its parameters but also benefits the SER training."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related papers discuss fine-tuning for emotion recognition but not specifically in the context of joint TSE-SER training.
- Break condition: If the emotional data distribution is very different from the pretraining data, joint fine-tuning might overfit to the limited emotional dataset and degrade generalization.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The framework performs better on different-gender mixtures compared to same-gender mixtures due to acoustic similarity challenges in same-gender separation.
- Mechanism: Same-gender speakers have more similar acoustic characteristics, making it harder for the TSE model to discriminate between speakers. Different-gender mixtures have more distinct acoustic features, allowing for more accurate separation and cleaner target speech extraction.
- Core assumption: Speaker gender affects the acoustic similarity between overlapping speakers, and this similarity directly impacts the performance of target speaker extraction.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The framework shows superior performance on different-gender mixtures (61.32% UA) compared to same-gender mixtures (55.95% UA), likely due to acoustic similarity challenges in same-gender separation."
  - [section III-D4] "same-gender mixture with the similar acoustic characteristics is more difficult for TSE model to separate."
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - related papers discuss speaker diarization but don't specifically analyze gender-based performance differences in TSE for emotion recognition.
- Break condition: If the enrollment utterance is not representative of the target speaker's emotional speech, or if the TSE model is not robust to gender-based acoustic similarities, the performance gap between same and different-gender mixtures may narrow or reverse.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Speech signal processing and time-domain target speaker extraction
  - Why needed here: Understanding how the TSE model processes time-domain signals and uses embedding vectors to separate target speakers is crucial for implementing and debugging the framework.
  - Quick check question: How does the TD-SpeakerBeam model use the enrollment utterance to compute the embedding vector that drives speaker separation?

- Concept: Speech emotion recognition feature extraction and classification
  - Why needed here: Knowledge of how emotional features are extracted from speech and classified is essential for understanding how cleaner target speech improves emotion recognition performance.
  - Quick check question: What acoustic features are most relevant for distinguishing between different emotional states in speech?

- Concept: Loss functions for multi-task learning (SiSNR and cross-entropy)
  - Why needed here: Understanding how to balance different loss functions during joint training is critical for optimizing the TSE-SER-ft approach.
  - Quick check question: How does combining SiSNR loss for TSE and CE loss for SER affect the gradient updates during joint training?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Mixed speech signal -> TD-SpeakerBeam TSE model -> Extracted target speech -> ShiftCNN SER model -> Emotion classification

- Critical path:
  1. Input mixed speech signal and enrollment utterance
  2. TSE model computes embedding vector and extracts target speaker speech
  3. Extracted speech fed into SER model
  4. SER model outputs emotion classification
  5. Backpropagation through joint loss functions (SiSNR + CE)

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Sequential vs. joint training: Sequential training is simpler but may not optimize for emotion-specific features; joint training is more complex but potentially more effective
  - Enrollment utterance selection: Neutral speech is more convenient but may not capture emotional variability
  - Gender-based mixture design: Different-gender mixtures are easier to separate but may not reflect real-world scenarios

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor emotion recognition accuracy despite good TSE performance: Indicates that the extracted features are not optimal for emotion classification
  - Good emotion recognition accuracy but poor TSE performance: Suggests the SER model is robust to interference or overfitting to noisy data
  - Significant performance gap between same and different-gender mixtures: Indicates TSE model struggles with acoustic similarity

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare baseline SER performance on clean vs. noisy data to quantify the impact of human speech noise
  2. Implement TSE-SER-base and evaluate on denoised data to verify the effectiveness of the cascaded approach
  3. Implement TSE-SER-ft and compare with TSE-SER-base to validate the benefits of joint training

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed framework perform when human speech noise contains emotional content versus neutral content?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using neutral speech for enrollment but doesn't test emotional speech as interference
- Why unresolved: The experiments only used neutral speech from LibriSpeech and ESD as noise sources, leaving open whether emotional interference affects performance differently
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments comparing performance when noise speech has varying emotional content (angry, happy, sad) versus neutral speech

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the performance limit of the framework when multiple interfering speakers are present?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states "The number of speakers in the mixture of speech was limited to two" in experimental setup
- Why unresolved: Only tested with two-speaker mixtures (target + one interferer), but real-world scenarios often involve more speakers
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments with three or more speakers in the mixture showing degradation curves of SER performance

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the framework perform across different languages and cultural contexts?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses English datasets (IEMOCAP, LibriSpeech, ESD) but doesn't test other languages
- Why unresolved: The framework was only evaluated on English speech, leaving questions about cross-linguistic applicability
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments using corpora in other languages (Mandarin, Spanish, Arabic) to test robustness across linguistic and cultural boundaries

### Open Question 4
- Question: What is the optimal amount of TSE pretraining data needed for best SER performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses 100 hours of LibriSpeech for TSE pretraining but doesn't explore data quantity effects
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't investigate how varying amounts of pretraining data affects final SER performance
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments showing SER performance curves as pretraining data varies from small amounts (10 hours) to very large amounts (1000+ hours)

## Limitations

- Gender-based performance analysis relies on synthetic data creation methodology that may not generalize to real-world scenarios
- Performance improvements demonstrated primarily on controlled experimental conditions rather than naturally occurring overlapping speech
- Only tested with two-speaker mixtures, leaving open questions about scalability to more complex multi-talker environments

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The core mechanism of using target speaker extraction to improve emotion recognition by reducing speech interference is well-supported by the experimental results (14.33% UA improvement).
- **Medium Confidence:** The joint training approach (TSE-SER-ft) showing better performance than sequential training is supported by the data, but the specific contribution of task-specific fine-tuning versus general parameter optimization is not fully isolated.
- **Medium Confidence:** The gender-based performance differences are observed in the experimental data, but the causal mechanism (acoustic similarity) is inferred rather than directly measured or validated.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-corpus validation:** Test the framework on additional emotion recognition datasets (e.g., MSP-IMPROV, Emo-DB) with different emotional categories and recording conditions to verify generalization across datasets and emotional taxonomies.

2. **Real-world interference testing:** Evaluate the framework using naturally occurring overlapping speech (e.g., meeting recordings, multi-party conversations) rather than synthetically mixed data to assess real-world robustness.

3. **Feature importance analysis:** Conduct ablation studies to determine which acoustic features (prosodic, spectral, temporal) contribute most to the performance differences between same and different-gender mixtures, and whether the TSE model actually preserves emotion-relevant features better than baseline approaches.
