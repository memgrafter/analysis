## Executive Summary
This thesis develops acoustic word embeddings (AWEs) for zero-resource languages using multilingual transfer learning. The work introduces a novel ContrastiveRNN model that outperforms existing AWE models in unsupervised monolingual settings. It explores unsupervised adaptation of multilingual AWE models using target language unlabelled data, achieving up to 5% improvement. The research also investigates language choice in multilingual transfer, applies AWEs to hate speech detection in Swahili radio broadcasts, and proposes three novel semantic AWE models.

## Method Summary
The thesis employs unsupervised monolingual and supervised multilingual approaches to train AWE models. The unsupervised method discovers word pairs from unlabelled speech using UTD systems, while the multilingual approach leverages labelled data from well-resourced languages. A novel ContrastiveRNN model is introduced using contrastive loss to optimize embedding distances. Unsupervised adaptation fine-tunes pre-trained multilingual models on target language data. For semantic AWEs, a cluster+skip-gram approach derives soft pseudo-word labels from multilingual AWE clustering. Experiments span multiple corpora including GlobalPhone, NCHLT, and Common Voice across diverse language families.

## Key Results
- ContrastiveRNN model outperforms CAE-RNN and SiameseRNN by 3.3%-17.8% absolute average precision in unsupervised monolingual settings
- Unsupervised adaptation of multilingual AWE models achieves up to 5% improvement using target language unlabelled data
- Training on related languages from the same family as the target significantly improves multilingual transfer performance
- AWEs demonstrate more robust performance than ASR-based approaches in hate speech detection for Swahili radio broadcasts with domain mismatch

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Related languages share phonetic and lexical features, allowing multilingual models to learn universal acoustic patterns that transfer more effectively to target languages. This works because languages from the same family have sufficient phonetic/lexical overlap. Evidence shows training on related languages significantly improves performance compared to unrelated languages. Break condition: If languages in the same family have minimal phonetic overlap or the target language is highly distinct phonologically.

### Mechanism 2
Unsupervised adaptation of multilingual AWE models using target language unlabelled data improves performance by fine-tuning pre-trained models on discovered word pairs from the target language. This allows adaptation to language-specific acoustic properties. Core assumption: Discovered word pairs are sufficiently accurate to guide adaptation. Evidence shows up to 5% improvement with adaptation. Break condition: If discovered word pairs are too noisy or the target language has very different acoustic properties.

### Mechanism 3
Semantic AWEs can be learned by leveraging multilingual phonetic AWEs to assist in semantic modeling. Pre-trained multilingual AWEs provide phonetic grounding, allowing semantic models to focus on contextual meaning rather than acoustic similarity. Core assumption: Phonetic and semantic information can be disentangled in the embedding space. Evidence shows the best approach leveraging multilingual AWEs outperforms previous methods in word similarity tasks. Break condition: If phonetic and semantic information are too entangled to separate effectively.

## Foundational Learning

- **Acoustic Word Embeddings (AWEs)**: Core representation being developed and transferred across languages. Quick check: What is the difference between AWEs and textual word embeddings in terms of what they capture?

- **Multilingual Transfer Learning**: Essential for transferring knowledge from well-resourced to zero-resource languages. Quick check: How does multilingual transfer differ from traditional supervised learning in terms of data requirements?

- **Unsupervised Term Discovery (UTD)**: Used to find word-like pairs in unlabelled target language data for adaptation. Quick check: What is the main challenge in using UTD for adaptation, and how might it affect model performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data preprocessing → Feature extraction (MFCC/XLSR) → AWE model (CAE-RNN/SiameseRNN/ContrastiveRNN) → Evaluation (word discrimination/QbE/KWS) → For semantic AWEs: Add clustering step → Skip-gram training with soft labels

- **Critical path**: Train multilingual AWE model on well-resourced languages → Apply to target language → (Optional) Adapt with UTD pairs → Evaluate performance

- **Design tradeoffs**: MFCC vs XLSR features (traditional vs self-supervised), Monolingual vs multilingual training (data efficiency vs language-specific adaptation), Hard vs soft clustering for semantic AWEs (simplicity vs capturing uncertainty)

- **Failure signatures**: Poor word discrimination scores (model not learning phonetic distinctions), Low speaker classification scores (model capturing too much speaker-specific information), Semantic AWEs not correlating with word similarity (failure to disentangle phonetic and semantic information)

- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Replicate baseline AWE models (CAE-RNN, SiameseRNN) on development data, 2) Train multilingual ContrastiveRNN and evaluate on target languages, 3) Apply unsupervised adaptation to multilingual models and measure performance gains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How do semantic AWEs scale to vocabularies of millions of words compared to text-based word embeddings? The authors acknowledge this scalability question was not directly addressed due to the limited vocabulary of the FACC dataset used for training and evaluation.

### Open Question 2
Can semantic AWEs be learned without assuming known word boundaries, using unsupervised word segmentation methods? The authors note this as a limitation since their experiments used true word boundaries from forced alignments.

### Open Question 3
What is the optimal threshold value for AWE-based keyword spotting, and can it be determined based on properties of the keyword? The authors hypothesize thresholds might be correlated with factors like segment length or phonetic properties but only explored per-keyword and global thresholds.

## Limitations

- Language Family Assumption Validity: The thesis assumes languages from the same family benefit from transfer learning, but this relies on shared phonetic/lexical features that may not hold for languages with significant phonological differences.

- Unsupervised Adaptation Quality: The adaptation mechanism depends heavily on UTD system quality for discovering word pairs, but the thesis does not provide detailed validation of discovered pair accuracy across different languages and domains.

- Semantic AWE Model Generalization: While semantic AWE models show improved performance on word similarity tasks, their generalization to truly unseen languages and diverse domains remains untested.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: ContrastiveRNN model's superior performance in unsupervised monolingual settings is well-supported by experimental results across six languages with consistent improvements.

**Medium Confidence**: Effectiveness of multilingual transfer learning for zero-resource languages is demonstrated through controlled experiments, but optimal language selection and transfer mechanisms remain partially understood.

**Medium Confidence**: AWE application to hate speech detection shows promising results in domain mismatch scenarios, but evaluation is limited to specific dataset and application.

**Low Confidence**: Assumption that languages from the same family automatically benefit from transfer learning is not rigorously tested across diverse language pairs.

## Next Checks

1. **UTD System Validation**: Conduct systematic evaluation of UTD system's performance across different languages and domains, measuring precision and recall of discovered word pairs against ground truth annotations.

2. **Language Family Transfer Analysis**: Design experiments testing transfer learning hypothesis across broader range of language families, including cases where target language is distantly related or unrelated to training languages.

3. **Semantic AWE Generalization Testing**: Evaluate semantic AWE models on diverse, multilingual datasets representing different domains and cultural contexts, comparing semantic representations against other semantic models.
