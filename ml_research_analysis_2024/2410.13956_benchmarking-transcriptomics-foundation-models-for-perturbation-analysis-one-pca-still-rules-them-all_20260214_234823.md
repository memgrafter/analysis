# Benchmarking Transcriptomics Foundation Models for Perturbation Analysis : one PCA still rules them all

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.13956
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13956
- Reference count: 40
- Major result: Simpler methods like PCA and scVI outperform transcriptomics foundation models in perturbation analysis tasks

## Executive Summary
This study benchmarks various transcriptomics foundation models including scGPT, Geneformer, CellPLM, and UCE against simpler approaches like PCA and scVI for perturbation analysis tasks. The evaluation covers a hierarchy of biologically-motivated tasks including batch effect reduction, perturbation separability, consistency, and biological relationship recall. Results consistently show that scVI and PCA outperform foundation models across perturbation-related tasks, with scVI demonstrating strong performance even with minimal training data and effective transfer learning capabilities.

The study introduces a novel "Structural Integrity" metric for assessing gene activity structure preservation and reveals that gene distribution assumptions significantly impact model performance. While foundation models show effectiveness in batch effect reduction, they struggle with complex biological tasks, suggesting their training objectives may not fully capture the requirements of perturbation analysis. These findings challenge the assumption that more complex models necessarily perform better in transcriptomic analysis.

## Method Summary
The study employs a comprehensive benchmarking approach using a hierarchy of biologically-motivated tasks to evaluate transcriptomics foundation models. The evaluation framework includes tasks such as batch effect reduction, perturbation separability, consistency, and biological relationship recall. Multiple models including scGPT, Geneformer, CellPLM, UCE, scVI, and PCA are compared across these tasks using standardized metrics. The researchers also introduce a novel "Structural Integrity" metric specifically designed to assess how well models preserve gene activity structure during perturbation analysis. Gene distribution assumptions are systematically varied to understand their impact on model performance.

## Key Results
- scVI and PCA consistently outperform foundation models in perturbation-related tasks
- scVI demonstrates strong performance with minimal training data and effective transfer learning capabilities
- Gene distribution assumptions significantly impact model performance
- Foundation models struggle with complex biological tasks despite strong batch effect reduction performance

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The superior performance of simpler methods like PCA and scVI in perturbation analysis stems from their more direct optimization objectives that align with perturbation detection requirements. These methods maintain structural integrity of gene expression patterns while effectively separating biological signals from technical noise. The study suggests that foundation models' training objectives, optimized for general representation learning rather than perturbation-specific tasks, may not capture the nuanced biological relationships needed for accurate perturbation analysis.

## Foundational Learning

   - Quick check: Knowledge of common distributions used in transcriptomics

4. Transfer learning in biological contexts
   - Why needed: Explains scVI's effectiveness with minimal training data
   - Quick check: Understanding of how biological knowledge transfers across datasets

5. Model evaluation metrics for biological data
   - Why needed: Critical for interpreting benchmarking results
   - Quick check: Familiarity with metrics like Structural Integrity and perturbation separability

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:** Data Preprocessing -> Model Training -> Perturbation Analysis -> Evaluation Metrics -> Result Comparison

**Critical Path:** The critical path follows the evaluation framework where models are first trained on reference datasets, then applied to perturbation analysis tasks, and finally evaluated using standardized metrics including the novel Structural Integrity measure.

**Design Tradeoffs:** The study trades model complexity for interpretability and performance, showing that simpler models with more targeted objectives can outperform complex foundation models in specific biological tasks.

**Failure Signatures:** Foundation models fail particularly in perturbation separability and biological relationship recall tasks, likely due to misalignment between their pretraining objectives and perturbation analysis requirements.

**3 First Experiments:**
1. Replicate benchmark using different perturbation types to test generalizability
2. Modify foundation model training objectives to explicitly include perturbation analysis tasks
3. Compare model performance across different gene distribution assumptions systematically

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The study identifies several open questions regarding the generalizability of results across different transcriptomic datasets and biological contexts. The evaluation primarily focuses on specific perturbation scenarios, potentially limiting broader applicability. The novel "Structural Integrity" metric, while promising, lacks extensive validation across diverse biological systems. Additionally, the computational efficiency claims require further investigation across different hardware configurations and implementation details.

## Limitations
- Evaluation scope limited to specific perturbation scenarios, potentially restricting generalizability
- "Structural Integrity" metric lacks extensive validation across diverse biological systems
- Computational efficiency findings may vary based on implementation details not fully disclosed
- Limited testing of modified training objectives for foundation models

## Confidence
- Foundation models underperform in perturbation analysis: Medium
- scVI and PCA superiority: Medium
- Gene distribution assumptions impact: Medium
- Computational efficiency claims: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Expand benchmark datasets to include diverse biological perturbations across multiple species and experimental conditions to test generalizability
2. Conduct ablation studies on the "Structural Integrity" metric to validate its sensitivity and specificity across different types of perturbations
3. Test foundation models with modified training objectives specifically designed for perturbation analysis to assess potential performance improvements
