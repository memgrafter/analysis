# Simulation-based inference with scattering representations: scattering is all you need

## Quick Facts

- Primary result: Wavelet scattering representations alone achieve effective field-level simulation-based inference of cosmological parameters without requiring additional neural compression

## Executive Summary
This paper demonstrates that wavelet scattering representations can serve as a standalone compression method for field-level simulation-based inference (SBI) of cosmological parameters. The approach addresses the high-dimensionality challenge of scattering representations by incorporating spatial averaging and using ensemble Masked Autoregressive Flows as density estimators. Applied to dark matter field data from Quijote N-body simulations, the method achieves tight parameter constraints with 60% improvement over traditional bandpowers for σ8. The scattering-only approach offers advantages including no need for additional simulations for training or derivatives, interpretability, and resilience to covariate shift.

## Method Summary
The method employs wavelet scattering transforms as a fixed, non-trainable compression of cosmological fields, followed by ensemble Masked Autoregressive Flows (MAF) for density estimation. The scattering transform provides a hierarchical, multi-scale representation that captures essential features while the spatial averaging component reduces dimensionality. The ensemble MAF approach addresses the limitation of standard MAFs in handling high-dimensional scattering coefficients. The framework uses gradient-based SBI to estimate posterior distributions of cosmological parameters directly from the compressed representations, eliminating the need for traditional summary statistics or neural network-based compression.

## Key Results
- Scattering-only approach achieves σ8 constraint of 0.876 ± 0.018, improving 60% over bandpowers (0.894 ± 0.046)
- Coverage tests show good empirical coverage approximating ideal performance
- Method requires no additional simulations for training or derivatives
- Demonstrated on Quijote N-body simulations of dark matter fields

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The wavelet scattering transform provides a stable, informative representation of cosmological fields that captures essential non-Gaussian features while being invariant to local translations. The multi-scale nature of scattering coefficients preserves hierarchical structure in the data, and spatial averaging reduces dimensionality without losing critical information. Ensemble Masked Autoregressive Flows provide sufficient expressivity to model the complex likelihood functions arising from these compressed representations, enabling accurate posterior inference.

## Foundational Learning
- Wavelet scattering transform: Why needed - provides multi-scale, stable representation of cosmological fields; Quick check - verify coefficients capture known features like peaks and voids
- Spatial averaging: Why needed - reduces dimensionality of scattering representations; Quick check - confirm dimensionality reduction maintains parameter sensitivity
- Masked Autoregressive Flows: Why needed - flexible density estimation for high-dimensional compressed data; Quick check - validate posterior recovery on simple test cases
- Ensemble methods: Why needed - improves expressivity and stability of density estimation; Quick check - compare performance against single MAF models
- Gradient-based SBI: Why needed - enables efficient parameter inference from compressed representations; Quick check - verify gradient accuracy for parameter estimation

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Cosmological field -> Wavelet scattering transform -> Spatial averaging -> Ensemble MAF density estimation -> Posterior inference

Critical path: The scattering transform and spatial averaging provide the essential compression that enables tractable density estimation. The ensemble MAF is critical for modeling the complex likelihood functions from high-dimensional scattering coefficients.

Design tradeoffs: Fixed scattering transform vs. learned compression (interpretable vs. potentially more optimal), spatial averaging for dimensionality reduction vs. information loss, ensemble MAF for expressivity vs. computational cost.

Failure signatures: Poor parameter constraints indicate inadequate compression or insufficient density estimation expressivity; computational bottlenecks suggest scalability issues with ensemble methods.

First experiments: 1) Test scattering transform on simple Gaussian fields to verify stability, 2) Compare single vs. ensemble MAF performance on low-dimensional examples, 3) Validate parameter recovery on idealized test cases before full cosmological application.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Results demonstrated only on Quijote N-body simulations; generalizability to other datasets unknown
- Computational cost and scalability of ensemble MAF approach not fully characterized
- Claims about interpretability and covariate shift resilience based on theory rather than extensive empirical validation

## Confidence
- Scattering representations alone are sufficient for effective field-level SBI: High
- 60% improvement over bandpowers for σ8 constraints: Medium (based on single dataset)
- Scattering provides resilience to covariate shift and interpretability: Low (theoretical claims with limited empirical validation)
- No additional simulations needed for training or derivatives: High

## Next Checks
1. Test the scattering-only approach on multiple independent N-body simulation suites (beyond Quijote) with varying resolutions and cosmological models to assess generalizability.

2. Conduct systematic ablation studies comparing different density estimators (beyond MAF ensembles) to quantify the trade-off between expressivity and computational efficiency.

3. Perform extensive coverage analysis across different parameter regimes and compare the performance of scattering representations against other neural compression methods under realistic observational conditions.
