# A Review of Multimodal Explainable Artificial Intelligence: Past, Present and Future

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.14056
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14056
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Comprehensive historical review of Multimodal Explainable Artificial Intelligence (MXAI) methods across four eras, categorizing techniques into data, model, and post-hoc explainability approaches

## Executive Summary
This paper provides a systematic historical review of Multimodal Explainable Artificial Intelligence (MXAI) methods, tracing their evolution from traditional machine learning approaches to modern generative large language models. The review organizes MXAI techniques into three distinct categories based on when explainability is incorporated: data explainability (pre-model), model explainability (in-model), and post-hoc explainability (post-model). By examining each era's contributions to interpretability and transparency, the paper offers valuable insights into how explainability methods have developed alongside advances in multimodal AI capabilities.

The review's significance lies in its comprehensive categorization of MXAI methods and its analysis of the evolution of evaluation datasets and metrics. The paper identifies key challenges and future directions for enhancing model transparency and trustworthiness, making it a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working on interpretable multimodal AI systems.

## Method Summary
The paper employs a systematic literature review methodology to analyze MXAI methods across four distinct historical eras: traditional machine learning (2000-2009), deep learning (2010-2016), discriminative foundation models (2017-2021), and generative large language models (2022-2024). The authors categorize reviewed methods into three types based on data processing sequence: data explainability, model explainability, and post-hoc explainability. Each era's methods are analyzed for their contributions to interpretability and transparency, with particular attention to how they handle diverse data types. The review also examines evaluation datasets and metrics used in MXAI research, providing a comprehensive overview of the field's development.

## Key Results
- MXAI methods have evolved through four distinct eras, each characterized by advances in both model capabilities and explainability techniques
- Three fundamental categories of explainability methods have emerged: data explainability (pre-model), model explainability (in-model), and post-hoc explainability (post-model)
- The review identifies key challenges in MXAI development, including the trade-offs between explainability and model performance, and the need for domain-specific evaluation metrics

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The paper's systematic categorization of MXAI methods provides a clear framework for understanding how explainability techniques have evolved alongside multimodal AI capabilities. By organizing methods into three temporal categories (pre-model, in-model, and post-model), the review reveals patterns in how researchers have approached the challenge of making complex multimodal systems interpretable. This framework helps identify gaps in the literature and suggests directions for future research in developing more transparent and trustworthy AI systems.

## Foundational Learning

**Multimodal AI**: Why needed: Understanding how different data types (text, image, audio) are processed together; Quick check: Verify that MXAI methods can handle at least two different data modalities simultaneously.

**Explainability Taxonomy**: Why needed: Provides a framework for classifying different approaches to making AI systems interpretable; Quick check: Ensure that reviewed methods can be clearly categorized into data, model, or post-hoc explainability.

**Historical Era Analysis**: Why needed: Helps identify patterns and trends in the development of MXAI methods; Quick check: Confirm that methods are appropriately assigned to their corresponding historical era based on publication date and technological context.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Data Processing -> Explainability Method -> Output/Interpretation

**Critical Path**: Data Input -> Preprocessing (optional) -> Model Architecture -> Explanation Generation -> User Interpretation

**Design Tradeoffs**: 
- Complexity vs. interpretability: More complex models may require more sophisticated explanation methods
- Real-time requirements vs. explanation depth: Faster explanations may sacrifice detail
- Domain specificity vs. generalizability: Specialized explanation methods may not transfer well to other domains

**Failure Signatures**:
- Explanations that don't align with model decisions
- Methods that fail on certain data modalities
- Performance degradation when explainability is added
- User misunderstanding of explanations

**3 First Experiments**:
1. Test MXAI method on a simple multimodal dataset (e.g., image-text pairs) to verify basic functionality
2. Evaluate explanation quality using human evaluators across different domains
3. Measure performance impact of adding explainability to a baseline multimodal model

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions for future research. However, it implies several areas for further investigation, including the development of more effective evaluation metrics for MXAI methods, the creation of standardized benchmarks for comparing different approaches, and the exploration of new techniques for handling the increasing complexity of multimodal AI systems.

## Limitations

- The historical categorization may oversimplify the complex evolution of MXAI techniques, as methodological developments often overlap across eras
- The classification into three categories may not capture all nuanced approaches that combine multiple techniques
- The review may be influenced by selection bias in choosing representative methods for each era

## Confidence

High: The systematic categorization of MXAI methods provides a valuable framework for understanding the field's development

Medium: The historical analysis of MXAI evolution offers insights into trends and patterns, though some oversimplification may occur

Low: The assessment of each era's contributions could be influenced by the authors' selection bias in choosing representative methods

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a systematic citation analysis to verify the completeness of the reviewed literature and identify any significant omissions in each era's coverage

2. Implement a cross-validation study comparing the effectiveness of different MXAI methods across multiple datasets and tasks to empirically assess the claimed advancements in each era

3. Perform a user study with domain experts to evaluate the practical utility and interpretability of MXAI methods in real-world applications, focusing on the trade-offs between explainability and model performance
