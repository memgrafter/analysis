# High-Frequency Enhanced Hybrid Neural Representation for Video Compression

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.06685
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06685
- Reference count: 9
- Primary result: +0.87 dB PSNR and +0.0182 MS-SSIM improvement over existing methods

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the critical limitation of neural video representation methods: poor preservation of high-frequency details in reconstructed videos. The proposed High-Frequency Enhanced Hybrid Neural Representation Network introduces a wavelet-based frequency decomposition approach to extract high-frequency embeddings, which are then integrated into the decoder through a High-Frequency Feature Modulation block. The method also incorporates a refined Harmonic decoder block with adaptive harmonic activation and a Dynamic Weighted Frequency Loss to enhance high-frequency detail reconstruction. Experiments on Bunny and UVG datasets demonstrate significant improvements in both detail preservation and compression performance compared to existing neural video compression methods.

## Method Summary
The method employs a hybrid neural representation framework where spatial features are decomposed using wavelet transform to extract high-frequency embeddings. These embeddings are processed through ConvNeXt blocks and encoded separately from content embeddings. A High-Frequency Feature Modulation block modulates the high-frequency embeddings into the decoder's content embeddings, enhancing the network's ability to synthesize fine details. The decoder uses Harmonic blocks with adaptive harmonic activation functions to introduce periodic inductive bias, improving the capture of complex textures and periodic content. Training employs a composite loss function combining spatial domain loss (L1 + SSIM) with a frequency domain loss weighted by a dynamic spectral difference matrix.

## Key Results
- Achieves +0.87 dB average PSNR improvement over existing methods
- Demonstrates +0.0182 MS-SSIM improvement in detail preservation
- Outperforms traditional codecs in high-frequency detail reconstruction while maintaining competitive compression ratios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: High-frequency feature embeddings extracted by wavelet transform improve detail synthesis in neural video representations
- Mechanism: Wavelet Frequency Decomposer (WFD) blocks decompose spatial features into frequency components, sum high-frequency components (FLH, FHL, FHH), and encode them as separate embeddings. These embeddings are then modulated into the decoder to enhance detail synthesis
- Core assumption: The network's spectral bias causes it to undersynthesize high-frequency details, and providing explicit high-frequency embeddings mitigates this limitation
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Our method focuses on leveraging high-frequency information to improve the synthesis of fine details by the network."
  - [section 2.3] "The wavelet transform offers an effective method for extracting and utilizing high-frequency information in images."
  - [corpus] Weak support; related work focuses on implicit neural representations and frequency-aware GANs but does not validate wavelet-based high-frequency embeddings in video compression
- Break Condition: If the decoder cannot effectively integrate high-frequency embeddings due to aliasing or fusion inefficiency, performance gains will diminish

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Adaptive Harmonic activation function improves the decoder's ability to capture periodic structures and complex textures
- Mechanism: Replaces GELU activation with a learnable harmonic activation function defined as σ(x) = ω1 · sin(x) + ω2 · cos(x), introducing periodic inductive bias into the decoder
- Core assumption: Neural networks have spectral bias toward low frequencies, and introducing periodic activation helps fit high-frequency content more accurately
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.2] "These functions result in significantly higher representation accuracy than the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function."
  - [section 3.3] "This Harmonic block introduces periodic inductive bias while maintaining strong nonlinear capabilities, thereby enhancing the network's ability to capture complex texture patterns and periodic content."
  - [corpus] Weak; most corpus entries do not address activation function choices in implicit neural video compression
- Break Condition: If the network fails to learn appropriate ω1 and ω2 values, the harmonic activation may not provide meaningful improvements over standard activations

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Dynamic Weighted Frequency Loss enhances high-frequency detail reconstruction by focusing training on challenging frequency components
- Mechanism: Computes frequency-domain L1 loss weighted by a log-transformed spectral difference matrix W = ln(1 + |FFT(bxt) - FFT(xt)|), emphasizing high-frequency reconstruction errors
- Core assumption: Standard spatial-domain losses are insufficient for high-frequency detail recovery, and frequency-domain supervision with adaptive weighting improves reconstruction quality
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.4] "To focus the network on synthesizing challenging high-frequency details, we apply a dynamic weighting strategy... This transformation provides effective supervision of the network's adaptive behavior across different frequency components."
  - [section 3.4] "The frequency loss Lf re is then defined as: Lf re = W · |F F T(bxt) - F F T(xt)|"
  - [corpus] Weak; related works on frequency-aware losses exist but are not validated for neural video compression with wavelet-based embeddings
- Break Condition: If the weighting matrix becomes unstable due to extreme frequency differences, training may diverge or produce artifacts

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Wavelet transform and frequency decomposition
  - Why needed here: Understanding how Haar wavelet decomposes signals into low and high-frequency sub-bands is critical for implementing the WFD block and interpreting frequency component selection
  - Quick check question: What are the four frequency sub-bands produced by a 2D Haar wavelet transform, and which contain high-frequency information?

- Concept: Spectral bias in neural networks
  - Why needed here: Recognizing that neural networks inherently prioritize low-frequency fitting explains why high-frequency detail loss occurs and justifies the proposed frequency-enhanced methods
  - Quick check question: Why do neural networks tend to produce overly smooth reconstructions in implicit representations, and how does spectral bias contribute to this?

- Concept: Implicit neural representations for videos
  - Why needed here: Grasping the NeRV framework and hybrid embedding approaches is essential for understanding how the proposed method extends existing video compression paradigms
- Quick check question: How does the hybrid NeRV approach differ from frame-wise implicit representations, and why is this distinction relevant for compression efficiency?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input video frames → Content encoder (ConvNeXt blocks + strided conv) → Content embeddings
  Input video frames → Wavelet high-frequency encoder (ConvNeXt + WFD blocks) → High-frequency embeddings
  High-frequency embeddings → High-Frequency Feature Modulation (HFM) block → Modulated content embeddings
  Modulated embeddings → Harmonic decoder blocks (adaptive harmonic activation) → Reconstructed frames
  Loss: Lspa (L1 + SSIM) + μ·Lf re (frequency loss with dynamic weighting)

- Critical path: Frame → Content encoder → Wavelet high-frequency encoder → HFM block → Harmonic decoder → Output frame
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Wavelet vs. DCT for frequency decomposition: Haar wavelet provides multi-resolution analysis and frequency disentanglement but adds computational overhead
  - HFM vs. attention-based fusion: HFM balances performance and computational cost but may not capture complex cross-frequency interactions as well as attention mechanisms
  - Harmonic vs. GELU activation: Harmonic activation introduces periodic bias beneficial for textures but requires careful initialization and learning of ω parameters

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor high-frequency detail reconstruction despite frequency embeddings: Indicates HFM block inefficiency or decoder inability to integrate high-frequency information
  - Unstable training or divergence: Suggests issues with Dynamic Weighted Frequency Loss, particularly in spectral weighting matrix computation
  - Blurry outputs with minimal texture: Points to spectral bias still dominating despite harmonic activation, possibly due to insufficient frequency loss weighting

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation: Remove wavelet high-frequency encoder, retrain, and compare PSNR/MS-SSIM to validate frequency embedding contribution
  2. Ablation: Replace Harmonic block with GELU, retrain, and measure impact on high-frequency detail preservation
  3. Ablation: Remove Dynamic Weighted Frequency Loss, use only L1+SSIM, and assess degradation in texture reconstruction quality
