core_contribution: The paper introduces LLMTemporalComparator, a system for automatically
  analyzing temporal differences between large language models trained on data from
  different time periods. The system generates a hierarchical topic structure from
  a user-specified keyword and compares outputs from two models using SBERT or LLM
  Comparator to identify differences in vocabulary, information presentation, and
  themes.

# LLMTemporalComparator: A Tool for Analysing Differences in Temporal Adaptations of Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.04195
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04195
- Authors: Reinhard Friedrich Fritsch; Adam Jatowt
- Reference count: 11
- Primary result: LLMTemporalComparator enables automatic analysis of temporal differences between LLMs trained on different time periods through hierarchical topic generation and similarity scoring

## Executive Summary
LLMTemporalComparator is a system designed to analyze temporal differences between large language models trained on data from different time periods. The system generates hierarchical topic structures from user-specified keywords and compares model outputs using either SBERT or LLM Comparator to identify differences in vocabulary, information presentation, and underlying themes. A case study using models trained on 1987-1995 and 2000-2007 news data demonstrates the tool's ability to reveal temporal shifts in public opinion and cultural norms, providing a more efficient alternative to manual analysis for research in continual model adaptation and comparative summarization.

## Method Summary
The system operates through a hierarchical topic generation approach where a user-specified root keyword initiates the creation of a topic tree with dynamically generated subcategories. The two LLMs (trained on different time periods) generate text for each node in the tree, which is then evaluated using either SBERT for efficient similarity scoring or LLM Comparator for detailed explanations of differences. The system employs parameters to merge similar categories and skip exploration of areas where models agree, optimizing the discovery of meaningful temporal differences. Results are visualized as both a tree structure and treemap, with JSON output available for further analysis.

## Key Results
- Successfully identified temporal shifts in public opinion and cultural norms between 1987-1995 and 2000-2007 news data
- Demonstrated the ability to generate comprehensive hierarchical topic structures that capture meaningful differences between temporal LLM versions
- Showed that the tool can reveal differences in vocabulary, information presentation, and underlying themes more efficiently than manual analysis

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Hierarchical topic generation enables systematic comparison of LLM outputs across time periods. The system builds a hierarchical tree of subcategories from a user-specified keyword, ensuring comprehensive coverage while maintaining contextual relationships through "category chains."

### Mechanism 2
Similarity scoring through SBERT and LLM Comparator identifies meaningful temporal differences. SBERT provides efficient similarity scores while LLM Comparator offers detailed explanations, creating a balance between speed and interpretability.

### Mechanism 3
Merging and skipping parameters optimize exploration of temporal differences. Thresholds for similarity classes and skip node exploration prevent duplication and focus on areas with larger differences.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Hierarchical topic modeling
  - Why needed here: Automatically generates meaningful topic hierarchies to structure comparison between temporal LLM versions
  - Quick check question: How would you verify that automatically generated subcategories maintain semantic coherence with their parent categories?

- Concept: Sentence embedding similarity
  - Why needed here: SBERT efficiently compares generated texts to identify semantic differences between models trained on different time periods
  - Quick check question: What are the limitations of using cosine similarity between sentence embeddings for detecting temporal shifts in language use?

- Concept: Multi-agent evaluation systems
  - Why needed here: LLM Comparator uses multiple judges to evaluate text differences, providing both scores and reasoning for the comparison
  - Quick check question: How would you validate that the LLM Comparator's reasoning about differences is reliable and consistent?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Root category input → Category Tree Generator (with context chains) → Text Generation (two time periods) → Node Evaluation (SBERT + LLM Comparator) → Visualization (Tree + Treemap) → JSON output
- Critical path: Category Tree Generation → Node Evaluation → Visualization
- Design tradeoffs: Hierarchical generation provides comprehensive coverage but increases runtime; SBERT offers speed but less interpretability than LLM Comparator; merging parameters reduce redundancy but may hide differences
- Failure signatures: Similar similarity scores across all nodes (thresholds too high), excessively deep trees with shallow content (depth parameter too large), or visualization showing disconnected category clusters (context chains failing)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run with a simple keyword (e.g., "climate change") with minimum parameters to verify basic tree generation and comparison works
  2. Test with two different threshold_similarity_classes values (0.8 vs 0.5) to observe impact on category merging
  3. Compare SBERT-only vs LLM Comparator results on the same nodes to evaluate the tradeoff between speed and interpretability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How do different similarity comparison methods (SBERT vs LLM Comparator) affect the identification of temporal shifts in LLM outputs? The paper presents both methods but doesn't provide systematic comparison of their effectiveness in identifying temporal shifts or their trade-offs in different contexts.

### Open Question 2
What is the optimal depth and breadth for the category tree generation to balance comprehensiveness with computational efficiency? The paper mentions that depth and breadth significantly influence runtime but doesn't establish optimal values or guidelines for different use cases.

### Open Question 3
How does the choice of root keyword affect the discovery and analysis of temporal differences in LLM outputs? The paper demonstrates the system with specific examples but doesn't systematically explore how different starting points might affect results.

## Limitations

- The finetuned Llama2 models trained on specific time periods are not publicly available, limiting reproducibility
- The system's behavior depends heavily on similarity thresholds with limited guidance on optimal settings
- Despite automation, the system relies on LLM Comparator for explanation generation, creating potential circular dependency

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The hierarchical topic generation approach and general workflow are well-specified and theoretically sound
- Medium Confidence: The effectiveness of SBERT for detecting temporal differences and the utility of LLM Comparator for providing explanations are supported by the case study but lack extensive validation
- Low Confidence: The generalizability of findings to other domains beyond news articles and the robustness of parameter settings across different use cases remain uncertain

## Next Checks

1. Run the system with multiple combinations of threshold_similarity_classes and threshold_skip_node_exploration values (e.g., 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9) to determine how parameter choices affect the number and quality of differences identified.

2. Apply the system to a different domain (e.g., scientific literature or social media posts) with clearly defined temporal boundaries to evaluate whether the approach generalizes beyond news articles.

3. Have human experts review a sample of LLM Comparator explanations and similarity scores to assess the reliability of the automated reasoning and identify cases where the system may miss meaningful differences.
