# FairJob: A Real-World Dataset for Fairness in Online Systems

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.03059
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03059
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Real-world dataset for fairness in online job advertising with gender proxy

## Executive Summary
FairJob introduces a novel real-world dataset designed to study fairness in online advertising systems where sensitive attributes are unavailable due to privacy constraints. The dataset addresses the critical challenge of algorithmic bias in job advertising by providing a gender proxy derived from non-protected features, enabling researchers to evaluate fairness-utility trade-offs in click prediction models. The authors demonstrate that fairness can be improved through bias mitigation techniques while maintaining reasonable utility levels, making FairJob a valuable benchmark for fairness research in advertising and similar domains.

## Method Summary
The authors construct FairJob by collecting real-world advertising data and developing a gender proxy using non-protected features when direct gender information is unavailable. They implement fairness-inducing penalties in logistic regression models to mitigate bias and propose a fair utility metric that accounts for selection bias in the data. The experimental framework evaluates the effectiveness of these techniques in improving fairness metrics while monitoring the trade-off with prediction utility, providing a comprehensive methodology for assessing fairness in advertising systems.

## Key Results
- Fairness can be enhanced in online advertising systems with manageable utility trade-offs
- Gender proxy derived from non-protected features enables fairness analysis under privacy constraints
- Bias mitigation techniques like fairness-inducing penalties in logistic regression show measurable improvements

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The approach works by creating a practical workaround for privacy constraints through gender proxy inference, enabling fairness analysis without violating data protection requirements. The fairness-inducing penalties in logistic regression models directly optimize for equitable outcomes across different groups, while the fair utility metric properly accounts for selection bias that would otherwise distort performance measurements.

## Foundational Learning
- Gender proxy inference: Why needed - enables fairness analysis when sensitive data is unavailable; Quick check - validate proxy accuracy against ground truth when available
- Fairness-inducing penalties: Why needed - directly optimizes for equitable outcomes in prediction models; Quick check - measure fairness metrics before and after penalty application
- Selection bias correction: Why needed - prevents distorted utility measurements in observational data; Quick check - compare utility metrics with and without bias correction

## Architecture Onboarding
Component map: Data collection -> Gender proxy inference -> Click prediction model -> Fairness evaluation
Critical path: Data preprocessing → Proxy generation → Model training → Fairness-utility evaluation
Design tradeoffs: Privacy vs. fairness accuracy (proxy quality) vs. model complexity
Failure signatures: Proxy inaccuracy leading to false fairness conclusions, selection bias causing inflated utility metrics
First experiments:
1. Test gender proxy accuracy across different demographic subgroups
2. Compare fairness-utility trade-offs across multiple bias mitigation techniques
3. Evaluate model performance with varying levels of fairness penalty strength

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Gender proxy representativeness may not capture intersectional effects
- Findings may not generalize beyond job advertising context
- Limited experimental validation to specific bias mitigation techniques

## Confidence
- Dataset construction methodology: Medium
- Proxy effectiveness: Medium
- Generalizability of results: Medium
- Experimental validation: Medium

## Next Checks
1. Validate the gender proxy accuracy and fairness impact across multiple demographic subgroups and geographic regions
2. Test the fairness-utility trade-offs with additional bias mitigation techniques beyond logistic regression penalties
3. Conduct cross-domain experiments to assess generalizability to other recommendation systems beyond job advertising
