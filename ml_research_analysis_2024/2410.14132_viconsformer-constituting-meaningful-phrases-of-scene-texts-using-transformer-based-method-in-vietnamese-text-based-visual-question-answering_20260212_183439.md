# ViConsFormer: Constituting Meaningful Phrases of Scene Texts using Transformer-based Method in Vietnamese Text-based Visual Question Answering

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.14132
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14132
- Reference count: 17
- Key outcome: Achieves state-of-the-art results on Vietnamese Text-based VQA datasets with 45.58 F1-token and 22.72 EM on ViTextVQA, and 70.92 F1-token and 37.65 EM on ViOCRVQA

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces ViConsFormer, a novel transformer-based method for Vietnamese Text-based Visual Question Answering (VQA) that effectively exploits the meaning and information from scene texts. The key innovation is the Constituent module, which identifies meaningful Vietnamese words in scene text sequences by learning semantic relations between tokens and correcting unnecessary connections. The method combines this linguistic insight with standard transformer architectures to achieve state-of-the-art performance on two large Vietnamese Text-based VQA datasets.

## Method Summary
ViConsFormer addresses Vietnamese Text-based VQA by incorporating linguistic principles to better exploit scene text information. The method uses a Constituent module that computes attention scores and constituent scores to model how Vietnamese tokens form meaningful words. The module learns pairwise semantic relations between consecutive tokens using a bilinear function, normalizes these into probabilities, and uses them to reweight attention scores element-wise. The combined features are then processed through a ViT5-based multimodal backbone to generate answers. The approach is specifically designed for Vietnamese text, leveraging its unique morphological properties where words are composed of contiguous syllables.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ViTextVQA with 45.58 F1-token and 22.72 EM
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ViOCRVQA with 70.92 F1-token and 37.65 EM
- Ablation studies show the Constituent module significantly improves performance
- Scene text tokens are more informative than object labels for this task

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The Constituent module corrects attention scores by modeling Vietnamese word boundaries through neighbor token probabilities. It computes pairwise semantic relations between consecutive tokens using a bilinear function, normalizes these into probabilities, aggregates across spans, and reweights attention scores element-wise. The core assumption is that Vietnamese words are composed of contiguous syllables where semantic relations are strongest between neighboring tokens. This works because Vietnamese word formation follows this pattern, though it may fail if words include non-contiguous syllables or have non-local semantic relations.

### Mechanism 2
Element-wise multiplication of attention and constituent scores is more effective than addition because both matrices are in exponential form (attention from softmax, constituent from product of probabilities). This preserves relative scale and ensures constituent scores modulate attention multiplicatively. The core assumption is that constituent scores should act as a gating function rather than a bias term, and both matrices are normalized appropriately for multiplicative combination. This may fail if constituent scores are not properly normalized or their distribution is misaligned with attention scores.

### Mechanism 3
Removing object labels from the image module does not degrade performance because scene text tokens are more informative for answering questions. The ablation study shows stable performance when object labels are omitted but drops when scene text tokens are omitted, indicating scene text carries more discriminative information. This assumes the dataset and question distribution depend primarily on scene text content rather than object labels. This may fail if questions begin to rely more on object attributes or spatial relationships not captured by text.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Vietnamese morphology and word structure
  - Why needed here: The method relies on the assumption that Vietnamese words are composed of contiguous syllables separated by spaces, and that semantic relations are strongest between neighboring tokens.
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between Vietnamese and English word tokenization that makes this method necessary?

- Concept: Self-attention and multi-head attention mechanisms
  - Why needed here: The Constituent module builds on standard self-attention to model token relationships, then modifies the attention scores using linguistic information.
  - Quick check question: How does the standard self-attention mechanism work, and what are its limitations for Vietnamese text?

- Concept: Distributionalism and observable linguistic units
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly follows American Distributionalism, which defines meaning through observable distributions of linguistic units rather than abstract semantics.
  - Quick check question: How does the distributionalist approach to meaning differ from semantic approaches in linguistics?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Image Embedding module -> Scene Text Embedding module -> Constituent module -> Multimodal backbone -> Answer generation
- Critical path: Scene Text Embedding → Constituent module → Multimodal backbone → Answer generation
  - The Constituent module is the novel contribution that differentiates this architecture
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Linearity assumption for semantic relations vs. more complex non-linear models
  - Neighbor-only modeling vs. capturing long-range dependencies within words
  - Element-wise multiplication vs. addition for combining matrices
  - Omitting object labels to simplify the model vs. potential loss of complementary information
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on questions requiring object-attribute reasoning
  - Degradation when scene text includes non-contiguous word components
  - Instability when constituent scores are not well-calibrated
  - Performance drops on datasets with different Vietnamese word segmentation patterns
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation study: Remove the Constituent module entirely and compare with full model on both datasets
  2. Replace element-wise multiplication with addition in the Constituent module and measure performance impact
  3. Test the model on a dataset with non-standard Vietnamese word boundaries to evaluate the neighbor assumption

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How would the Constituent module perform if the linearity assumption for modeling semantic relationships between Vietnamese scene text tokens is relaxed or replaced with a non-linear approach? The paper acknowledges that the current linear assumption is proposed for simplicity and that exploring non-linear forms of semantic relationships is necessary for future work. This remains unresolved because the current method oversimplifies the complex nature of Vietnamese word formation, and the impact of non-linear modeling techniques on accuracy remains unexplored. Comparative experiments evaluating linear versus non-linear semantic relationship models on Vietnamese Text-based VQA datasets would resolve this.

### Open Question 2
How would different fusion strategies for combining image, scene text, and question features (e.g., Co-Attention or multilinear functions) impact the overall performance of ViConsFormer compared to the current naive concatenation approach? The paper mentions that the current treatment of fused features is naive and suggests that other methods like Co-Attention or multilinear functions could be explored. This remains unresolved because the simple concatenation approach may not optimally capture complex interactions between modalities. Empirical comparison of different fusion strategies versus the current concatenation method on Vietnamese Text-based VQA datasets would resolve this.

### Open Question 3
How does the performance of ViConsFormer vary when using scene text tokens versus object labels as additional input features, and what does this reveal about the relative importance of scene text information in Vietnamese Text-based VQA tasks? While the ablation study shows that scene text tokens are crucial, it does not quantify the exact contribution of object labels or explore scenarios where object information might be more or less important. Systematic experiments varying the amount and type of object information provided to ViConsFormer would resolve this.

## Limitations

- The method's reliance on contiguous Vietnamese word structure is not empirically validated against alternative tokenization approaches
- The paper does not provide sufficient detail on the Vietnamese text preprocessing pipeline, making faithful reproduction challenging
- The model's performance on questions requiring object-attribute reasoning or spatial relationships remains untested

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: Experimental results showing state-of-the-art performance on both ViTextVQA and ViOCRVQA datasets (45.58 F1-token, 22.72 EM on ViTextVQA; 70.92 F1-token, 37.65 EM on ViOCRVQA)
- **Medium Confidence**: Mechanism claims regarding element-wise multiplication superiority and the decision to omit object labels, supported by ablation studies but lacking broader empirical validation
- **Low Confidence**: Foundational linguistic assumptions about Vietnamese word structure and the absence of comparative analysis with other Vietnamese tokenization methods

## Next Checks

1. Implement a controlled experiment comparing element-wise multiplication versus addition for combining attention and constituent matrices across multiple Vietnamese datasets
2. Conduct a systematic ablation study testing the model's performance when object labels are reintroduced, particularly for questions requiring object-attribute reasoning
3. Evaluate the model's robustness on a dataset with non-standard Vietnamese word boundaries to test the neighbor-only assumption's validity
