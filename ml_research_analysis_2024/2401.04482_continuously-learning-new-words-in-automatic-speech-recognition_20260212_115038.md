# Continuously Learning New Words in Automatic Speech Recognition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.04482
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04482
- Authors: Christian Huber; Alexander Waibel
- Reference count: 25
- Primary result: Achieves over 80% recall of new words in lecture ASR while maintaining baseline WER

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of recognizing acronyms, named entities, and domain-specific words in automatic speech recognition systems. The authors propose a self-supervised continual learning approach that leverages lecture slides and audio recordings to iteratively learn new words without requiring labeled data. Their method combines a memory-enhanced ASR model to bias recognition toward words from slides, followed by collecting utterances containing detected new words to adapt the model using factorization-based low-rank weight updates. The approach is evaluated on 66 lecture talks, showing that it increases recall of new words to over 80% as they occur more frequently while preserving overall model performance.

## Method Summary
The method uses a memory-enhanced ASR model that biases recognition toward words extracted from lecture slides, followed by pseudo-label collection of utterances containing these new words. The model is then adapted using factorization-based low-rank weight updates, which add a low-rank matrix decomposition to each weight matrix, allowing efficient adaptation without full fine-tuning. This process is iterated over multiple talks, with the model learning new words as they occur more frequently. The approach uses a pre-trained Wav2Vec 2.0 encoder and mBART 50 decoder as the baseline ASR model, and evaluates performance on both word error rate and new word recall metrics.

## Key Results
- Achieves over 80% recall of new words as they occur more frequently in lecture talks
- Maintains baseline WER on held-out Tedlium test set throughout continual learning
- Demonstrates improved forward transfer, with newly learned words better recognized in later talks
- Shows no catastrophic forgetting across 66 learning cycles while improving new word recognition

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Factorized low-rank weight updates allow efficient adaptation of ASR models to new words without full fine-tuning.
- Mechanism: By adding a low-rank matrix decomposition to each weight matrix, only the factorization weights (k ≪ min{n,m}) are trained, leaving the original model weights frozen. This reduces computation and memory usage while preserving the model's core knowledge.
- Core assumption: The original model has sufficient capacity to recognize new words when the factorization weights are optimized, and the low-rank decomposition is expressive enough to model the necessary changes.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "Continual learning is then performed by training adaptation weights added to the model on this data set."
  - [section]: "We use the factorization approach mentioned above together with a memory-enhanced ASR model similar to [5] to first extract pseudo-labels of utterances containing new words and then adapt the model with this new data."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; no directly relevant citations found.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Memory-enhanced ASR models bias recognition towards words present in the memory, improving recall of new words from slides.
- Mechanism: The memory-enhanced model uses attention mechanisms to extract information from a memory containing new words, biasing the prediction of the next token towards these words. This increases the likelihood of recognizing new words in the audio.
- Core assumption: The memory entries are accurately represented and the attention mechanisms effectively extract relevant information to influence the model's predictions.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We bias the model towards decoding new words from the slides by using a memory-enhanced ASR model from the literature."
  - [section]: "The model extracts information from Z through attention mechanisms, and therefore the prediction of the next token is biased towards the words/phrases in the memory Z."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; no directly relevant citations found.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Self-supervised learning with pseudo-labels and iterative adaptation enables continual learning of new words without catastrophic forgetting.
- Mechanism: The approach iteratively uses slides to extract new words, performs inference on the audio to collect pseudo-labels of utterances containing these words, and adapts the model using the collected data. This process is repeated for many talks, allowing the model to learn new words as they occur more frequently.
- Core assumption: The pseudo-labels generated from the memory-enhanced model are sufficiently accurate to guide the adaptation process, and the iterative approach allows the model to incrementally learn new words without forgetting previously learned ones.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "We show that with this approach, we obtain increasing performance on the new words when they occur more frequently ( >80 % recall) while preserving the general performance of the model."
  - [section]: "We empirically show that this approach does not lead to catastrophic forgetting even for a large number of learning cycles (66), while improving the recall of new words to more than 80% as new words occur more frequently."
  - [corpus]: Weak evidence; no directly relevant citations found.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Low-rank matrix factorization
  - Why needed here: Enables efficient adaptation of the ASR model to new words without full fine-tuning, reducing computation and memory usage.
  - Quick check question: What is the benefit of using low-rank matrix factorization in this context, and how does it differ from standard fine-tuning?

- Concept: Attention mechanisms
  - Why needed here: Allows the memory-enhanced ASR model to effectively extract information from the memory and bias recognition towards new words.
  - Quick check question: How do attention mechanisms in the memory-enhanced ASR model contribute to improved recognition of new words from slides?

- Concept: Self-supervised learning
  - Why needed here: Enables the model to learn new words from unlabeled audio and slide data, reducing the need for manually labeled data.
  - Quick check question: What are the key advantages of using self-supervised learning in this continual learning approach, and what challenges might arise?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Baseline ASR model (mBART 50 + Wav2Vec 2.0) -> Memory-enhanced ASR model (adds memory encoder/decoder) -> Factorization module (adds low-rank weight updates) -> Slide processing pipeline -> Audio processing pipeline -> Adaptation pipeline

- Critical path: 1. Extract new words from slides 2. Perform inference on audio using memory-enhanced model 3. Collect pseudo-labels of utterances containing new words 4. Adapt model using factorization-based low-rank weight updates 5. Repeat for many talks

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Accuracy vs. efficiency: Factorized adaptation is more efficient but may be less accurate than full fine-tuning
  - Memory vs. bias: Larger memory increases bias towards new words but may also increase false positives
  - Self-supervision vs. supervision: Self-supervised learning reduces manual labeling but may introduce errors in pseudo-labels

- Failure signatures:
  - Decreased recall of new words over time (catastrophic forgetting)
  - Increased word error rate on held-out test set
  - High false positive rate for new words

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the effectiveness of factorization-based adaptation on a small dataset of new words
  2. Assess the impact of memory size on recall and false positive rate
  3. Compare the performance of self-supervised learning with manual labeling on a subset of the data

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- **Generalization to other domains**: How does the proposed approach perform on non-lecture domains, such as conversational speech or technical meetings? The paper focuses solely on lecture data, leaving its generalizability to other speech types untested.

- **Handling morphological variations**: What is the impact of morphological variations of new words on the accuracy of the continual learning approach? The experiments do not investigate whether incorporating morphological variants of new words improves recognition or reduces false positives.

- **Scalability with larger vocabularies**: How does the method scale with a larger number of learning cycles or a significantly larger vocabulary of new words? The study does not explore scenarios with hundreds of learning cycles or tens of thousands of new words.

- **Multilingual adaptation**: Can the approach be adapted to handle out-of-vocabulary words in multilingual settings without retraining on multilingual data? The experiments focus on a single language (English) and do not address cross-lingual new-word learning.

## Limitations

- Evaluation limited to lecture talks only, with unknown performance on conversational speech or other domains
- Factorization-based adaptation details not fully specified, making exact reproduction difficult
- Long-term stability beyond 66 learning cycles not explored, leaving questions about scalability
- Sensitivity to pseudo-label quality not systematically investigated, potentially affecting self-supervised learning reliability

## Confidence

**Confidence: Medium** - The paper provides empirical results showing improved recall of new words (over 80%) while maintaining baseline WER on held-out test sets. However, the evaluation is limited to a single domain (lecture talks) and doesn't address potential degradation in recognizing words outside the learned domain.

**Confidence: Medium** - The factorization-based low-rank weight updates are described but lack detailed implementation specifics. Without knowing exact initialization procedures, learning rates, and regularization parameters, it's difficult to assess whether the reported improvements are robust or dependent on specific hyperparameter choices.

**Confidence: Low** - The paper claims to prevent catastrophic forgetting across 66 learning cycles, but provides limited analysis of what happens beyond this point or under different data distributions. The long-term stability of the approach remains unclear.

## Next Checks

1. **Generalization Test**: Evaluate the adapted model on ASR datasets from different domains (e.g., conversational speech, news broadcasts) to verify that learning new words from lectures doesn't impair recognition of words in other contexts.

2. **Ablation Study on Factorization**: Systematically vary the rank k in the low-rank factorization and compare against full fine-tuning and other parameter-efficient adaptation methods to quantify the trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy.

3. **Robustness to Label Noise**: Introduce controlled amounts of error into the pseudo-labels and measure how this affects both new word recognition and baseline performance to understand the sensitivity of the self-supervised learning approach to label quality.
