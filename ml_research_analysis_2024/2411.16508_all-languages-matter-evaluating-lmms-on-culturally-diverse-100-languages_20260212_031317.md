# All Languages Matter: Evaluating LMMs on Culturally Diverse 100 Languages

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.16508
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16508
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: ALM-bench reveals significant performance gaps between open and closed-source LMMs on culturally diverse visual question answering across 100 languages

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces the All Languages Matter Benchmark (ALM-bench), a large-scale multimodal evaluation benchmark covering 100 languages and 19 cultural domains. The benchmark includes 22,763 manually verified question-answer pairs across multiple formats, with native language expert annotations ensuring cultural relevance and accuracy. Evaluations on 16 state-of-the-art LMMs reveal a significant performance gap between open and closed-source models, and highlight challenges with low-resource languages and underrepresented scripts. The study emphasizes the importance of cultural and linguistic inclusivity in global AI development.

## Method Summary
The benchmark was constructed through a multi-stage pipeline: web scraping and targeted keyword search for cultural images, face detection with PID blurring, GPT-4o-based QA generation using structured prompts (language, country, cultural domain), translation to 100 languages, and native speaker verification. The evaluation uses four question types (MCQ, true/false, short/long VQA) and GPT-4o as a judge scoring responses on accuracy, correctness, consistency, fluency, and relevance. The dataset covers 73 countries, 24 scripts, and 15 language families, with particular attention to low-resource languages.

## Key Results
- GPT-4o achieves 78.8% accuracy while the best open-source model (GLM-4V-9B) reaches only 51.9%
- Significant performance gaps exist between high-resource and low-resource languages (GPT-4o shows 6% drop)
- Location-aware prompts provide notable performance boosts for closed-source models but minimal improvement for open-source models
- Cultural domains like 'Notable Key Figures' show much lower performance (42.1%) compared to 'Education' (81.4%) and 'Heritage' (80.4%)

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Human expert verification of cultural and linguistic content significantly improves benchmark quality. Native speakers review, correct, and validate both cultural images and automatically generated QA pairs, ensuring semantic accuracy, cultural grounding, and proper grammar. This addresses limitations in automated models that miss subtle cultural nuances and linguistic errors.

### Mechanism 2
Location-aware prompts improve LMM performance by providing contextual grounding. When prompts explicitly state country and cultural domain, LMMs can better contextualize visual content and retrieve relevant cultural knowledge, leading to improved accuracy.

### Mechanism 3
Evaluating on low-resource languages and underrepresented scripts reveals performance gaps missed by focusing only on high-resource languages. The benchmark exposes limitations in current LMMs' handling of diverse linguistic and script-based challenges.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cultural context in visual question answering
  - Why needed here: LMMs must understand not just what is visually present but also cultural significance across different languages and regions
  - Quick check question: How would you design a VQA system that can distinguish between culturally similar but contextually different visual elements (e.g., wedding attire across cultures)?

- Concept: Multilingual evaluation methodology
  - Why needed here: Evaluating across 100 languages requires careful consideration of translation quality and cultural adaptation
  - Quick check question: What are key differences between evaluating LMMs on high-resource versus low-resource languages, and how would you adjust methodology accordingly?

- Concept: Script diversity and visual processing
  - Why needed here: Different scripts present unique visual processing challenges affecting text recognition and cultural understanding
  - Quick check question: How might visual complexity of different writing systems impact LMM's ability to process culturally relevant text in images?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Web scraping -> Image processing (face detection + blurring) -> QA generation -> Translation -> Native speaker verification -> Model evaluation
- Critical path: Image collection and filtering -> QA generation and translation -> Native speaker verification -> Model evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Automated vs human verification (accuracy vs scalability), script coverage vs annotation feasibility, question complexity vs model capability
- Failure signatures: High semantic/cultural error rates in translations, performance gaps between resource levels, inconsistent scores across LMM judges
- First 3 experiments: 1) Test GPT-4o translation accuracy across 10 diverse languages with native verification, 2) Compare model performance with/without location-aware prompts on 20 languages, 3) Evaluate model performance on single script groups to isolate script-specific challenges

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How do LMMs perform on extremely low-resource languages with unique scripts, such as Sanskrit or Ge'ez, compared to more widely spoken low-resource languages? The paper identifies performance drops for low-resource languages and underrepresented scripts but lacks detailed comparative analysis across a spectrum of low-resource languages with varying script complexities.

### Open Question 2
To what extent does inclusion of culturally specific location-aware information in prompts improve open-source LMM performance compared to closed-source models? The paper observes different degrees of improvement but does not explore underlying reasons or investigate whether further prompt optimization could enhance open-source model performance.

### Open Question 3
What are primary factors contributing to significant performance gaps observed in LMMs when evaluating cultural domains such as 'Notable Key Figures' compared to domains like 'Education' and 'Heritage'? The paper conjectures that variation arises from training data coverage but does not investigate specific cultural and contextual factors that make certain domains more challenging.

## Limitations

- Benchmark relies heavily on GPT-4o for both content generation and evaluation, introducing potential bias
- Native speaker verification covers only 3 annotators per language, potentially missing cultural diversity within language communities
- Study does not address potential biases in image selection or whether cultural domains adequately represent full spectrum of cultural practices

## Confidence

- High Confidence: Open-source models significantly underperform closed-source models (GPT-4o 78.8% vs GLM-4V-9B 51.9%)
- Medium Confidence: Location-aware prompts improve performance, but effect size varies significantly across models
- Low Confidence: Benchmark successfully evaluates all 100 languages equally well given varying expertise availability and training data differences

## Next Checks

1. Conduct blind evaluation using multiple LMM judges beyond GPT-4o to assess performance ranking consistency and quantify inter-judge agreement rates.

2. Perform linguistic diversity analysis by evaluating models on parallel questions across languages within same language family to determine if performance gaps stem from script differences, cultural context, or fundamental language model limitations.

3. Test benchmark's sensitivity by introducing controlled variations in cultural context within same language (e.g., same language, different regional variations) to determine whether performance gaps reflect genuine cultural understanding or overfitting to specific training distributions.
