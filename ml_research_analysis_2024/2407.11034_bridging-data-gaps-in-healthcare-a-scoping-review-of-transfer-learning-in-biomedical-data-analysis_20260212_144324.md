# Bridging Data Gaps in Healthcare: A Scoping Review of Transfer Learning in Biomedical Data Analysis

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.11034
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11034
- Reference count: 40
- Only 2% of studies used external studies as source domains, and only 7% addressed privacy-constrained multi-site collaborations

## Executive Summary
This scoping review analyzed 55 studies to assess transfer learning (TL) applications for structured biomedical data, revealing significant gaps in addressing privacy constraints and multi-site collaborations in healthcare settings. While parameter transfer dominates TL applications (67.3%), these methods typically require unrestricted access to source data, limiting their utility in low-resource environments. The authors emphasize the need for privacy-preserving methods, proper baseline validation, and frameworks that can handle covariate effects heterogeneity.

## Method Summary
The review systematically screened 3,515 articles, ultimately analyzing 55 studies that applied transfer learning to structured biomedical data. The analysis categorized TL strategies into parameter transfer, feature representation, and instance re-weighting, examining their effectiveness across different healthcare scenarios. The methodology focused on identifying gaps in current TL applications, particularly regarding privacy constraints, multi-site collaborations, and temporal adaptations.

## Key Results
- Only 2% of studies used external studies as source domains
- 67.3% of TL applications relied on parameter transfer requiring unrestricted source data access
- Only 35 out of 55 studies employed privacy-preserving methods
- Just 5% of studies addressed temporal adaptation in TL models

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Transfer learning enables bridging data gaps in low-resource healthcare settings by leveraging pre-trained models from high-resource regions. Pre-trained models from high-resource regions are fine-tuned using limited target data, allowing low-resource settings to benefit from existing knowledge without requiring large local datasets. Core assumption: The source and target domains share sufficient similarity in disease patterns and data characteristics to enable meaningful knowledge transfer. Evidence anchors: "TL shows promise for bridging data gaps and regional disparities"; "TL is particularly beneficial in low-resource settings, where using external information can help overcome challenges posed by factors such as physician shortages and limited infrastructure resources".

### Mechanism 2
Privacy-preserving transfer learning methods enable multi-site collaborations without data sharing. Source-free transfer learning techniques use only pre-trained models (without source data) to update target models, maintaining privacy while enabling knowledge transfer across institutional boundaries. Core assumption: Model parameters alone contain sufficient information for meaningful transfer without requiring access to raw source data. Evidence anchors: "Only 35 out of 55 studies used privacy-preserving methods"; "Unlike FL, source-free TL can utilize existing information—such as model parameters from published works—to update individual models without a co-training process".

### Mechanism 3
Transfer learning addresses temporal performance drift in clinical prediction models by incorporating evolving knowledge. Temporal adaptation in transfer learning allows models to be updated over time as new data becomes available, preventing degradation of prediction accuracy due to changing disease patterns or population characteristics. Core assumption: The underlying relationships between predictors and outcomes remain stable enough that knowledge from earlier periods can be meaningfully adapted to later periods. Evidence anchors: "Only 5% (3 out of 55) of the reviewed articles involve TL with temporal adaptations"; "Additionally, while TL with temporal adaptation shows promise, its application is still limited and warrants further investigation".

## Foundational Learning

- **Domain similarity assessment**: Understanding the degree of similarity between source and target domains is critical for determining whether transfer learning is appropriate and which methods to use. Quick check: How would you assess whether two clinical datasets are sufficiently similar for transfer learning to be effective?

- **Privacy-preserving machine learning techniques**: Most healthcare data has privacy constraints, making it essential to understand methods that enable knowledge transfer without sharing raw data. Quick check: What are the key differences between federated learning and source-free transfer learning in terms of privacy guarantees?

- **Heterogeneity in covariate effects vs. covariate distributions**: Transfer learning methods handle these types of heterogeneity differently, and understanding the distinction is crucial for method selection. Quick check: Why might a method that handles covariate distribution heterogeneity fail when covariate effects are heterogeneous?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Source domain data/model → Transfer learning method → Target domain model → Validation framework → Deployment
- **Critical path**: Data identification → Method selection → Model training → Baseline comparison → Validation → Deployment
- **Design tradeoffs**: Privacy vs. performance (source-free vs. data-sharing methods), complexity vs. interpretability (neural networks vs. statistical models), computational cost vs. accuracy
- **Failure signatures**: Performance degradation when domain similarity decreases, privacy violations when inappropriate methods are used, model drift over time without temporal adaptation
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Implement parameter transfer using a pre-trained model from a public dataset on a local dataset with similar characteristics
  2. Compare privacy-preserving (source-free) vs. non-privacy-preserving transfer learning methods on a multi-site dataset
  3. Evaluate temporal adaptation by transferring knowledge across different time periods within the same healthcare system

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

1. How effective are transfer learning methods in bridging data gaps between high-resource and low-resource settings in healthcare, specifically for structured data beyond image analysis? Basis: The review highlights that most studies (67.3%) rely on parameter transfer, but these typically require unrestricted access to source data, limiting utility in low-resource settings. Why unresolved: The paper notes a gap in applying transfer learning to low-resource settings but does not provide empirical evidence or specific examples of successful applications.

2. What are the most effective transfer learning frameworks for handling heterogeneity in covariate effects across different healthcare domains? Basis: The paper mentions that only 8 out of 55 studies employed methods capable of handling heterogeneity in covariate effects, primarily through simulation studies. Why unresolved: The paper discusses the importance of addressing covariate effects heterogeneity but does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of different frameworks' effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

3. How can transfer learning be integrated with federated learning to enhance privacy-preserving collaborative model training in multi-site healthcare research? Basis: The paper suggests that source-free transfer learning can achieve functions similar to federated learning and can be integrated with federated learning for client-specific model personalization. Why unresolved: While the potential integration is mentioned, the paper does not explore specific methodologies or empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of such integration.

## Limitations

- Data selection bias: Only 55 studies from 3,515 screened articles (1.56% inclusion rate) may not fully represent TL applications in healthcare
- Methodological gaps: Only 2% used external studies as source domains and 5% addressed temporal adaptation
- Implementation details missing: Specific performance metrics and validation approaches across studies are not specified

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The fundamental premise that transfer learning can bridge data gaps in low-resource healthcare settings
- **Medium confidence**: The effectiveness of privacy-preserving transfer learning methods based on 35 of 55 studies
- **Low confidence**: Claims about temporal adaptation effectiveness based on only 3 of 55 studies

## Next Checks

1. Conduct systematic evaluation of how source-target domain similarity affects transfer learning performance in clinical settings using multiple similarity metrics
2. Implement and compare three different privacy-preserving transfer learning approaches (source-free TL, federated learning, synthetic data generation) on the same multi-site healthcare dataset
3. Establish standardized validation protocol including comparisons against target-only models, source-only models, and pooled models with statistical significance testing across multiple datasets
