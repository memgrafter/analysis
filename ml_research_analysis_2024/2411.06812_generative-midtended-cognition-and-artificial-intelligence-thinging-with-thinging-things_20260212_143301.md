## Executive Summary
This paper proposes "generative midtended cognition" as a new framework for understanding how generative AI technologies integrate with human cognitive processes. The authors argue that current extended cognition theories fail to adequately characterize the new forms of cognition and agency enabled by generative AI, which involves a hybrid (human-AI) process situated between internal intention and external extension. They provide an explicit definition of generative midtended cognition where AI interventions become constitutive of the agent's intentional creative processes, and distinguish two dimensions: width (sensitivity to context) and depth (granularity of integration). The paper discusses potential risks and benefits including authenticity challenges, generative power asymmetry, and creative boost or atrophy.

## Method Summary
The authors develop their theoretical framework through conceptual analysis of existing literature on extended cognition, enactive cognition, and social cognition, combined with examination of current generative AI technologies (LLMs, diffusion models). They articulate the concept of generative midtended cognition through theoretical argumentation, distinguishing it from traditional extended cognition and social cognition frameworks. The methodology relies on philosophical reasoning and thought experiments rather than empirical studies, using examples from contemporary AI systems to illustrate their theoretical claims.

## Key Results
- Generative midtended cognition captures hybrid human-AI cognitive processes that integrate AI-generated tokens into human intentional creative loops while preserving some sense of authorship.
- Two key dimensions characterize generative midtended cognition: width (contextual sensitivity from single tokens to full personal history) and depth (granularity from conversational units to sensorimotor levels).
- The framework addresses authenticity challenges and creative atrophy risks while potentially enabling creative enhancement through AI augmentation.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Generative midtended cognition emerges when AI-generated tokens are recursively adopted by human agents during creative processes, forming hybrid loops that retain the agent's sense of authorship.
- **Mechanism:** AI outputs are iteratively fed back into the human's creative loop (A-loop) and accepted as constitutive of the intentional creative process, enabling midtended cognition.
- **Core assumption:** The human agent can retain a sense of agency or authorship even when AI interventions are constitutive of the creative process.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "interventions by AI systems as constitutive of the agent's intentional creative processes"
  - [section 3.2] "midtention takes place when generative interventions produced by Y become constitutive of the intentional generation of Z by X, whereby X keeps some sense of agency or authorship over Z."
- **Break condition:** If AI interventions override the human's intentional agency so completely that no sense of authorship remains, the process no longer qualifies as generative midtended cognition.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** The depth dimension of generative midtended cognition distinguishes between integration at different granularities, from conversational (creative unit) level to sensorimotor (subpersonal) level.
- **Mechanism:** Integration at deeper levels (e.g., token-by-token or sensorimotor) enables more intimate hybrid agency, whereas higher levels (e.g., complete creative units) resemble traditional social collaboration.
- **Core assumption:** The scale of integration along the depth dimension correlates with the intimacy and nature of the hybrid cognitive process.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [section 3.3] "Depth: captures the granularity of iteration loops involved in the process. Generative midtended cognition stands in the middle depth between conversational forms of cognition in which complete utterances or creative units are exchanged, and micro-cognitive (e.g. neural) subpersonal processes."
  - [section 3.3] "The possibility of this occurring with generative technologies is, we argue, what remains within the blind spot of previous theorising of extended or social cognition."
- **Break condition:** If integration occurs only at the conversational level, the process is not generative midtended cognition but rather traditional collaborative creativity.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** The width dimension captures the sensitivity of the generative process to context, ranging from single-token input to full personal and historical context.
- **Mechanism:** AI systems trained on wider contexts (e.g., personal history, surrounding data) can generate more contextually relevant interventions, enhancing integration along the width dimension.
- **Core assumption:** Wider contextual sensitivity enables more seamless integration of AI-generated tokens into the human's intentional creative process.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract] "Width: captures the sensitivity of the context of the generative process (from the single letter to the whole historical and surrounding data)"
  - [section 3.3] "Level 4 includes everything you have ever written and read (or even from multimodal sources: heard, seen, etc.)."
- **Break condition:** If contextual sensitivity is too narrow (e.g., only single-token input), the AI interventions may feel disconnected and fail to integrate into the human's intentional process.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Extended cognition theories and their limitations in capturing generative AI integration
  - **Why needed here:** Understanding why traditional extended cognition frameworks (e.g., Clark & Chalmers) are insufficient for generative AI is crucial to grasping the novelty of generative midtended cognition.
  - **Quick check question:** What is the key limitation of extended cognition theories in characterizing generative AI's role in creative processes?

- **Concept:** The distinction between intrinsic and derived intentionality
  - **Why needed here:** Recognizing that generative AI has derived intentionality (from human training data) but is not intrinsically intentional helps clarify the nature of its generative power.
  - **Quick check question:** How does the concept of derived intentionality apply to generative AI systems?

- **Concept:** The role of participatory sense-making in social cognition
  - **Why needed here:** Understanding participatory sense-making (De Jaegher & Di Paolo) is important for distinguishing generative midtended cognition from true social interaction.
  - **Quick check question:** Why can't generative AI systems be fully characterized using participatory sense-making frameworks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Human agent (X) -> Generative system (Y) -> Cognitive product (Z) with A-loop (human creative process) and B-loop (AI autoregressive generation) forming hybrid integration
- **Critical path:** 1. Human initiates creative process 2. AI system generates interventions based on context and training 3. Human adopts AI interventions into their intentional creative loop 4. Hybrid A-loop and B-loop interactions produce cognitive product Z 5. Human retains sense of agency or authorship over Z
- **Design tradeoffs:** Wider context sensitivity (width) vs. computational efficiency and privacy concerns; Deeper integration (depth) vs. maintaining human agency and avoiding creative atrophy; Open-source vs. proprietary AI systems for transparency and trust
- **Failure signatures:** Human loses sense of authorship over the creative product; AI interventions feel disconnected or irrelevant to the human's intentional process; Overreliance on AI leads to creative atrophy or diminished human agency; AI system generates biased or hallucinated content that disrupts the creative process
- **First 3 experiments:** 1. Compare the creative outputs of human-AI collaboration at different depth levels (e.g., token-by-token vs. creative unit) to assess the impact on integration and authorship. 2. Measure the effect of varying context sensitivity (width) on the relevance and adoption of AI-generated interventions in a creative task. 3. Investigate the long-term effects of generative midtended cognition on human creative abilities and agency through longitudinal studies.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- **Question:** What specific empirical evidence would demonstrate the existence of generative midtended cognition as distinct from traditional extended cognition or social cognition?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors explicitly define generative midtended cognition and distinguish it from other forms of cognition, but acknowledge that "current problems with hallucinations, reasoning limitations and deviant chained errors make midtended cognition a relevant but narrowed phenomenon."
- **Why unresolved:** The paper provides a theoretical framework but does not present empirical studies demonstrating the phenomenon. The authors acknowledge technical limitations in current generative AI systems that prevent full realization of midtended cognition.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Empirical studies comparing cognitive processes in human-AI collaborative creative tasks versus human-human collaboration or traditional extended cognition scenarios, measuring factors like integration depth, context sensitivity, and sense of agency/authorship.

### Open Question 2
- **Question:** How can we develop reliable methods to distinguish between authentic human creativity and creativity that is significantly midtended by AI systems?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors discuss authenticity challenges, noting that "if personal identity is the result of our creative and narrative capacity to write and tell ourselves in the world... and generative interventions occur at scales that usually fall outside our awareness by technologies that we are unable to regulate, our personal autonomy and identity will be at stake."
- **Why unresolved:** The paper identifies authenticity as a key concern but does not provide concrete methodologies for assessment. The complexity of integration makes it difficult to establish clear boundaries between human and AI contributions.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Development of analytical frameworks or experimental paradigms that can reliably measure the degree of AI influence on creative outputs while preserving the user's sense of agency and authenticity.

### Open Question 3
- **Question:** What are the long-term cognitive effects of widespread generative AI adoption on human creative capabilities and originality?
- **Basis in paper:** [explicit] The authors raise concerns about "creative atrophy" noting that "generative AI can also collapse when recursively trained and tuned to cannibalised content" and questioning whether "a generalized adoption of generative AI result in a global creative atrophy, incapable of generating sufficiently rich and original content to feed itself forward?"
- **Why unresolved:** The technology is too new for longitudinal studies, and the recursive nature of AI training creates complex feedback loops that are difficult to predict or measure.
- **What evidence would resolve it:** Longitudinal studies tracking creative output quality and originality across generations of AI users, combined with analysis of training data evolution and diversity over time.

## Limitations

- The framework remains largely conceptual with limited empirical validation and lacks concrete measurement criteria for the width and depth dimensions.
- The assumption that humans can retain agency while AI interventions become constitutive of creative processes requires empirical testing that the paper does not provide.
- Current technical limitations in generative AI systems (hallucinations, reasoning limitations) constrain the practical realization of generative midtended cognition.

## Confidence

- **High Confidence:** The argument that traditional extended cognition theories are insufficient for characterizing generative AI integration is well-supported by existing literature and current technological capabilities.
- **Medium Confidence:** The distinction between conversational and sensorimotor levels of integration, while theoretically sound, requires empirical validation to confirm its practical relevance and impact on creative outcomes.
- **Medium Confidence:** The proposed two-dimensional framework (width and depth) provides a useful conceptual model, but its operationalization and measurement remain unclear and require further development.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct empirical studies measuring human agency perception and creative output quality across different integration levels (depth) with generative AI systems to validate the theoretical claims about agency retention and creative enhancement.

2. Develop and test quantitative metrics for measuring "width" (contextual sensitivity) and "depth" (integration granularity) in human-AI creative collaborations to enable empirical validation of the framework.

3. Perform longitudinal studies examining the long-term effects of generative midtended cognition on human creative abilities, agency perception, and potential atrophy, comparing users with varying levels of AI integration.
