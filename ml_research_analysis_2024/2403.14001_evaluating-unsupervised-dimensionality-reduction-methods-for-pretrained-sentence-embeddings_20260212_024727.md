# Evaluating Unsupervised Dimensionality Reduction Methods for Pretrained Sentence Embeddings

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID:** 2403.14001
- **Source URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14001
- **Reference count:** 23
- **Primary result:** PCA achieves 50% dimensionality reduction with <1% performance loss across most tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates five unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods for compressing high-dimensional sentence embeddings from pretrained language models. The methods compared include PCA, truncated SVD, KPCA, Gaussian Random Projections, and Autoencoders across three NLP tasks using six different sentence encoders. The experiments demonstrate that PCA provides the best balance of performance retention and computational efficiency, with some models even showing improved performance after dimensionality reduction.

## Method Summary
The study evaluates five dimensionality reduction methods on sentence embeddings from six pretrained language models across three tasks: semantic textual similarity (STS-B), entailment prediction (SICK-E), and question-type classification (TREC). The methods tested include PCA, truncated SVD, KPCA, Gaussian Random Projections, and Autoencoders. Performance is measured using cosine similarity, Pearson correlation, and F1 scores, with computational efficiency assessed through training and inference times. The experiments systematically compare the trade-off between dimensionality reduction ratios and performance retention.

## Key Results
- PCA achieves nearly 50% dimensionality reduction with less than 1% loss in performance across most tasks
- For mpnet and roberta encoders, reduced-dimensional embeddings sometimes outperform original high-dimensional embeddings in certain tasks
- PCA offers the fastest training and inference times among all evaluated methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The effectiveness of dimensionality reduction methods depends on their ability to preserve the most informative dimensions of sentence embeddings while reducing redundancy. PCA works by identifying orthogonal principal components that capture maximum variance in the data, effectively compressing information into fewer dimensions. Other methods like truncated SVD and KPCA attempt similar variance preservation through different mathematical approaches, while random projections rely on dimensionality reduction preserving distances between points with high probability. The observed performance improvements with reduced dimensions for certain models suggest that high-dimensional embeddings may contain redundant or noisy dimensions that interfere with downstream task performance.

## Foundational Learning
1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** - why needed: identifies orthogonal directions of maximum variance; quick check: verify eigenvectors capture most data variance
2. **Cosine Similarity** - why needed: standard metric for measuring embedding similarity; quick check: confirm vectors are normalized before comparison
3. **Semantic Textual Similarity (STS)** - why needed: benchmark for evaluating embedding quality; quick check: ensure human-annotated similarity scores are properly aligned
4. **Embedding Dimensionality** - why needed: affects both performance and computational efficiency; quick check: verify reduced dimensions retain task-relevant information
5. **Pretrained Language Models** - why needed: source of high-dimensional sentence embeddings; quick check: confirm consistent tokenization and pooling across experiments
6. **Downstream Task Evaluation** - why needed: measures practical utility of reduced embeddings; quick check: validate metric consistency across different tasks

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map:**
Sentence Encoder -> Dimensionality Reduction Method -> Task-specific Evaluation

**Critical Path:**
PLM generates embeddings → Reduction method processes embeddings → Task-specific model uses reduced embeddings → Performance metrics computed

**Design Tradeoffs:**
Memory vs. performance: Higher reduction ratios save memory but may degrade performance. Computational cost vs. accuracy: More complex methods (KPCA, Autoencoders) may achieve better compression but require more training time. Linear vs. non-linear methods: Linear methods (PCA, SVD) are faster but may miss complex relationships that non-linear methods (KPCA, Autoencoders) could capture.

**Failure Signatures:**
Performance degradation beyond acceptable thresholds (typically >5% drop in task metrics). Training instability or convergence issues, particularly with Autoencoders. Memory errors when reduction ratios are too aggressive for available computational resources.

**First 3 Experiments:**
1. Compare cosine similarity preservation across different reduction ratios for each method
2. Measure task performance degradation as a function of reduction ratio for each encoder-method combination
3. Benchmark training and inference times for each method at various reduction ratios

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None identified in the provided content.

## Limitations
- The study treats dimensionality reduction as a one-time preprocessing step without investigating performance when embeddings are fine-tuned on downstream tasks
- Experimental setup assumes static PLM encoders and doesn't account for interactions between reduction methods and different PLM architectures or training objectives
- Findings about performance improvements with reduced dimensions for specific models require further investigation to determine generalizability

## Confidence

| Claim | Confidence Level |
|-------|------------------|
| PCA provides best performance retention and computational efficiency | High |
| PCA sometimes outperforms original embeddings for specific models | Medium |
| Time complexity claims about PCA | High |

## Next Checks

1. Evaluate reduced-dimensional embeddings in downstream fine-tuning scenarios across diverse NLP tasks to assess whether performance benefits generalize beyond linear evaluation protocols

2. Test the stability of the PCA superiority finding across different PLM families with varying architectural designs (e.g., convolutional, recurrent, or hybrid models) and training objectives

3. Investigate whether the observed performance improvements with reduced dimensions persist when using different random seeds and training data subsets to rule out potential artifacts of specific experimental conditions
