# Node Classification With Integrated Reject Option

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.03190
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03190
- Reference count: 25
- Introduces NCwR method with reject option for high-risk node classification in GNNs

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes NCwR (Node Classification with Rejection), a novel approach to node classification in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with an integrated reject option. The method allows the model to abstain from making predictions when uncertainty is high, addressing high-risk applications where incorrect predictions are costly. Two variants are introduced: NCwR-Cov (coverage-based) and NCwR-Cost (cost-based), both extending GAT to handle rejection. Experiments on Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed datasets show NCwR-Cost consistently outperforms baselines like Softmax-Response and CF-GNN in accuracy on unrejected samples.

## Method Summary
NCwR introduces two variants for node classification with reject option: NCwR-Cov and NCwR-Cost. NCwR-Cov uses a coverage constraint to maintain a target coverage rate, while NCwR-Cost treats rejection as an additional class and uses cost-sensitive learning. Both methods extend GAT (Graph Attention Networks) with 8 attention heads and 64 features per node. The models are trained with early stopping (patience of 100 epochs) and evaluated on benchmark citation networks and the ILDC legal dataset. The approach allows selective abstention from predictions when uncertainty exceeds a calibrated threshold.

## Key Results
- NCwR-Cost consistently outperforms Softmax-Response and CF-GNN baselines in accuracy on unrejected samples across Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed datasets
- NCwR-Cov achieves strong performance, particularly for coverage rates above 60%
- ILDC dataset experiments demonstrate effectiveness in real-world high-risk legal judgment prediction scenarios
- t-SNE visualizations and SHAP explanations provide insights into rejection behavior and model interpretability

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The method works by integrating uncertainty estimation directly into the GNN architecture through two complementary approaches. NCwR-Cov maintains a coverage constraint that ensures the model abstains from a controllable fraction of predictions, while NCwR-Cost explicitly learns to identify when to reject by treating rejection as an additional class. Both approaches leverage the attention mechanism in GAT to compute uncertainty estimates, allowing the model to make informed decisions about when to abstain from predictions.

## Foundational Learning
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): Deep learning models for graph-structured data that aggregate information from neighboring nodes; needed to understand the base architecture being extended
- Coverage constraint: A regularization technique that ensures a minimum fraction of predictions are made; needed to understand NCwR-Cov's approach to controlling rejection rate
- Cost-sensitive learning: Training approach that accounts for different costs of different prediction outcomes; needed to understand NCwR-Cost's rejection-as-class approach

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component map:** Input graph -> GAT layers (8 heads, 64 features) -> Uncertainty estimation -> Rejection decision -> Output (prediction or reject)

**Critical path:** Graph features → GAT attention → Uncertainty score → Threshold comparison → Final output (class label or reject)

**Design tradeoffs:** Coverage-based (NCwR-Cov) vs cost-based (NCwR-Cost) approaches offer different control over rejection behavior; coverage-based gives direct control over abstention rate but requires careful threshold calibration, while cost-based learns rejection decision but may have less predictable coverage rates

**Failure signatures:** Poor coverage calibration in NCwR-Cov leading to under/over-rejection; performance degradation in NCwR-Cost when reject threshold d is too small; both can be diagnosed by monitoring reject rate and accuracy on unrejected samples

**First experiments:** 1) Implement GAT base model with 8 attention heads and 64 features per node; 2) Train NCwR-Cov with coverage constraint λ=32 and α=0.5, calibrate threshold on validation set; 3) Train NCwR-Cost treating rejection as (K+1)th class with ld_ce loss and evaluate on Cora dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper doesn't explicitly call out open questions, but several important questions remain unresolved:
- How does the proposed method handle out-of-distribution (OOD) nodes in node classification tasks?
- What is the impact of different GNN architectures on the effectiveness of the rejection mechanism?
- How does the method scale to large graphs with millions of nodes and edges?
- How robust is the rejection mechanism to adversarial attacks on graph data?

## Limitations
- Exact architectural details for NCwR-Cov and NCwR-Cost implementations are not fully specified, particularly layer configurations and dropout rates
- Hyperparameter settings for training on ILDC and tabular datasets are not provided
- Computational complexity and scalability to large graphs are not addressed
- Adversarial robustness of the rejection mechanism is not evaluated

## Confidence
High: Conceptual framework and motivation are clearly articulated with meaningful real-world validation
Medium: Comparative performance results are well-documented with statistical reporting but lack full architectural transparency
Low: Scalability and computational requirements are not addressed, limiting practical deployment assessment

## Next Checks
1. Implement and test the exact NCwR-Cov and NCwR-Cost architectures with the specified GAT base model to confirm that the coverage constraint and cost-sensitive loss functions behave as described
2. Replicate the ablation study on the Cora dataset by varying the reject threshold d in NCwR-Cost and documenting the trade-off between coverage rate and accuracy on unrejected samples
3. Conduct a hyperparameter sensitivity analysis for both NCwR variants on ILDC and tabular datasets to assess robustness and generalizability beyond the citation network experiments
