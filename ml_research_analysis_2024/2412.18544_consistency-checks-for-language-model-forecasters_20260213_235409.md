# Consistency Checks for Language Model Forecasters

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.18544
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18544
- Reference count: 40
- The paper proposes using consistency checks—logical rules that LLM forecasters must satisfy—as a ground-truth-free evaluation method, showing strong correlation with future forecasting accuracy.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to evaluate LLM forecasters without waiting for ground truth by measuring violations of logical consistency rules. The authors generate synthetic and scraped forecasting questions, instantiate them into logically related tuples, and compute arbitrage and frequentist metrics for consistency violations. They demonstrate that these consistency metrics strongly correlate with actual forecasting accuracy (measured by Brier scores) and release a long-horizon 2028 consistency benchmark. The paper also explores using ArbitrageForecaster to improve consistency, finding it fixes specific violations but doesn't generalize to better overall accuracy.

## Method Summary
The method involves generating or scraping binary forecasting questions, instantiating them into tuples that satisfy logical consistency rules (e.g., Negation, Conjunction, Implication), and eliciting forecasts from LLM forecasters. For each tuple, consistency violations are computed using arbitrage metrics (based on market scoring rules) and frequentist metrics (based on hypothesis testing). These violations are aggregated across checks and compared to ground truth Brier scores. The approach is validated on both scraped questions and synthetic questions with 2028 resolution dates. An ArbitrageForecaster is also implemented to patch base forecaster outputs and reduce consistency violations on specific checks.

## Key Results
- Consistency metrics (arbitrage and frequentist violations) show strong correlation with ground truth Brier scores, providing an instantaneous proxy for future forecasting accuracy.
- The ArbitrageForecaster successfully reduces consistency violations on the specific checks it optimizes against but fails to generalize to held-out checks or improve overall forecasting accuracy.
- A long-horizon consistency benchmark with 2028 resolution dates is established, enabling evaluation of forecasters without ground truth for extended periods.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Consistency violations measured via arbitrage or frequentist metrics provide an instantaneous proxy for future forecasting accuracy. Logical consistency rules create testable constraints, and violations indicate underlying model limitations that also impair accurate probability estimation on independent questions.

### Mechanism 2
ArbitrageForecaster improves consistency on the specific checks it optimizes against by computing improved forecasts through optimization problems that enforce logical consistency. However, this patching process doesn't generalize to other consistency checks or improve ground truth accuracy due to overfitting to specific tuples.

### Mechanism 3
Long-horizon consistency benchmarks provide scalable evaluation tools without ground truth by using synthetic questions with distant resolution dates. Consistency metrics computed on these tuples offer instantaneous evaluation signals, as logical consistency remains a valid proxy for forecasting accuracy even for questions resolving far in the future.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Proper scoring rules (e.g., logarithmic scoring rule, Brier score)
  - Why needed here: The arbitrage metric is based on a logarithmic market maker, which uses proper scoring rules to update prices. Understanding proper scoring rules is essential to grasp how the arbitrage metric works and why it's a principled measure of inconsistency.
  - Quick check question: What property must a scoring rule have to incentivize honest probability reporting, and why is this important for the arbitrage metric?

- Concept: Hypothesis testing and p-values
  - Why needed here: The frequentist metric uses hypothesis testing to determine whether a forecaster's predictions deviate significantly from expected behavior under a null hypothesis of consistency. Understanding hypothesis testing is crucial for interpreting the frequentist metric and its violation thresholds.
  - Quick check question: In the context of the frequentist metric, what does it mean for a forecaster to violate the null hypothesis of consistency, and how is this quantified?

- Concept: Logical consistency rules (e.g., Negation, Conjunction, Implication)
  - Why needed here: The paper defines various logical consistency rules that forecasting questions must satisfy. Understanding these rules is essential for generating the question tuples, computing consistency violations, and interpreting the results.
  - Quick check question: For the Negation check, what constraint must the forecaster's probabilities satisfy, and what does a violation of this constraint indicate?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Question generation -> Tuple instantiation -> Forecast elicitation -> Consistency evaluation -> Aggregation -> Correlation analysis

- Critical path:
  1. Generate or scrape base questions
  2. Instantiate tuples of logically related questions
  3. Elicit forecasts from the forecaster
  4. Compute consistency violations (arbitrage and frequentist)
  5. Aggregate violations and correlate with ground truth Brier scores

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using synthetic questions vs. scraped questions: Synthetic questions offer more control over resolution dates and topics, but may lack real-world complexity. Scraped questions are more realistic but may have limited resolution dates and topics.
  - Arbitrage metric vs. frequentist metric: The arbitrage metric is based on market scoring rules and provides a principled measure of inconsistency, but can be computationally expensive. The frequentist metric is based on hypothesis testing and is computationally cheaper, but may be less intuitive.
  - Including conditional questions vs. only binary questions: Conditional questions allow for more complex logical relationships, but may be harder to generate and evaluate.

- Failure signatures:
  - Low correlation between consistency metrics and ground truth Brier scores: This could indicate that consistency violations are not a good proxy for forecasting accuracy, or that the consistency checks are not comprehensive enough.
  - High variance in consistency violations across different checks: This could indicate that some consistency checks are more sensitive to forecaster quality than others, or that the forecaster is inconsistent in specific ways.
  - ArbitrageForecaster overfitting to specific checks: This could indicate that the patching mechanism is not generalizing to overall model capability or consistency under unseen logical relationships.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate a basic forecaster (e.g., GPT-4o) on the scraped question dataset and compute consistency violations for each check. Compare the average violations with the ground truth Brier score.
  2. Generate synthetic questions with 2028 resolution dates and instantiate tuples for each consistency check. Evaluate a basic forecaster on this dataset and compute consistency violations.
  3. Implement ArbitrageForecaster for a single check (e.g., Negation) and evaluate its consistency on held-out questions. Compare the consistency violations with the base forecaster.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Can consistency metrics reliably predict long-term forecasting performance for future LLM forecasters? The paper only tested a limited set of current forecasters and did not extend the analysis to longer time horizons or future models.

### Open Question 2
Does training LLM forecasters to be more consistent improve their overall forecasting accuracy? The paper only tested simple arbitrage-based consistency improvements, not comprehensive training approaches.

### Open Question 3
How effective would dynamic generation of adversarial consistency checks be compared to static checks? The paper only implemented static consistency checks, not dynamic adversarial generation.

### Open Question 4
Can the consistency framework be extended to evaluate decision-making systems beyond forecasting? The paper focused solely on forecasting applications.

### Open Question 5
What is the optimal balance between arbitrage and frequentist metrics for measuring forecaster consistency? The paper used both metrics but did not systematically compare their effectiveness.

## Limitations
- Consistency violations remain a proxy rather than a direct measure of forecasting performance.
- ArbitrageForecaster patching of specific violations doesn't generalize to improved overall accuracy.
- Synthetic question generation process and exact LLM prompting parameters are not fully specified, potentially affecting reproducibility.

## Confidence
- High confidence: The correlation between consistency metrics and ground truth Brier scores is well-supported by empirical results.
- Medium confidence: ArbitrageForecaster results showing lack of generalization are compelling but limited to specific patching approaches tested.
- Medium confidence: Long-horizon benchmark utility assumes logical consistency remains meaningful for distant resolution dates, which is plausible but untested with actual ground truth.

## Next Checks
1. Test consistency metrics correlation with ground truth accuracy on a held-out dataset of real forecasting questions with known resolutions.
2. Implement and evaluate alternative patching strategies for ArbitrageForecaster that might achieve generalization.
3. Conduct a sensitivity analysis on the synthetic question generation parameters to quantify their impact on consistency violation measurements and correlation strength.
