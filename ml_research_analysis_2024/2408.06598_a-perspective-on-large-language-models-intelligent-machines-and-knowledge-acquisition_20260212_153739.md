# A Perspective on Large Language Models, Intelligent Machines, and Knowledge Acquisition

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.06598
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06598
- Authors: Vladimir Cherkassky; Eng Hock Lee
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: GPT-4 lacks true understanding and reasoning abilities, instead generating responses based on statistical correlations in training data.

## Executive Summary
This paper evaluates the reasoning and understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly GPT-4, through carefully designed questions from mathematics, science, machine learning, and common sense reasoning. The authors find that GPT-4 often provides inconsistent and incorrect answers, even for questions requiring understanding of the same concept. The results indicate that LLMs lack true understanding and reasoning abilities, with their responses generated based on statistical correlations rather than conceptual comprehension. The paper discusses implications for knowledge acquisition, education, and the development of more advanced AI systems.

## Method Summary
The evaluation uses GPT-4 (version gpt-4-0125) and presents carefully designed questions covering mathematics, science, machine learning, and common sense reasoning. The method involves analyzing GPT-4's responses to assess its understanding of abstract concepts and reasoning abilities. Questions are designed to test the same underlying concepts in different contexts to identify inconsistencies that would indicate a lack of true understanding. The analysis compares responses to expected answers based on conceptual understanding.

## Key Results
- GPT-4 provides inconsistent and incorrect answers to questions requiring understanding of the same concept
- The model generates verbose, non-specific answers and cannot confidently qualify responses as correct or wrong
- GPT-4 struggles with combining multiple abstract concepts through logical reasoning, particularly in novel problem combinations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: GPT-4 lacks understanding of abstract concepts and instead generates responses based on statistical correlations in the training data.
- Mechanism: When asked questions requiring conceptual understanding, GPT-4 produces answers by retrieving and recombining patterns from its training corpus rather than performing logical reasoning. This leads to inconsistent and incorrect answers even for questions about the same concept.
- Core assumption: The responses are generated through statistical pattern matching rather than true comprehension of the underlying mathematical or scientific principles.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "GPT-4 often provides inconsistent and incorrect answers, even for questions that require understanding of the same concept"
  - [section 2] "Analysis of GPT-4 responses to such questions helps to evaluate its limitations and capabilities... humans who understand a particular concept typically provide correct answers to all questions (based on this concept). In contrast, GPT-4 may provide inconsistent responses, suggesting that it lacks understanding."
  - [corpus] Weak - only 5 related papers found, none directly discussing the specific mechanisms of GPT-4's reasoning failures
- Break condition: When questions require novel combinations of concepts not well-represented in the training data, or when logical consistency is explicitly tested through follow-up questions.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: GPT-4 struggles with combining multiple abstract concepts through logical reasoning, leading to failures on problems requiring multi-step inference.
- Mechanism: The model can handle individual concepts when they appear frequently in training data, but fails when required to integrate multiple concepts simultaneously. This is evident in questions about prime numbers combined with base representations, or mathematical concepts combined with programming tasks.
- Core assumption: The inability to combine concepts stems from the model's reliance on statistical associations rather than building hierarchical conceptual structures.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 2.1] "GPT-4 cannot combine two concepts, prime numbers and base of numbers, via logical reasoning" - illustrated by Question 8 where GPT-4 correctly answers Question 7 (known base) but fails Question 8 (unknown base)
  - [section 2.2] "GPT-4 cannot combine two concepts, prime numbers and base of numbers, via logical reasoning"
  - [corpus] Weak - related papers focus on general reasoning limitations rather than specific multi-concept integration failures
- Break condition: When problems require explicit logical chaining between multiple previously learned concepts that don't frequently appear together in training data.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: GPT-4 generates verbose, non-specific answers to well-posed questions and cannot confidently qualify its answers as correct or wrong.
- Mechanism: The model tends to produce lengthy responses with multiple possible explanations, even when a single, specific answer is required. This stems from its training to cover all bases rather than making definitive judgments based on understanding.
- Core assumption: The model's training objective prioritizes covering potential interpretations over committing to the most likely correct answer.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "GPT-4 often generates verbose and non-specific answers to well-posed questions"
  - [section 2] "GPT-4 cannot confidently qualify its answers as correct or wrong or 'don't know'. This may result in correct answers accompanied by inconsistent or contradictory explanations"
  - [corpus] Weak - no direct evidence in corpus about verbosity patterns or confidence qualification
- Break condition: When explicit binary or specific answers are required, and the model's tendency toward hedging becomes apparent through follow-up questioning.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Distinction between observer-independent and observer-relative knowledge
  - Why needed here: The paper emphasizes that LLMs perform differently on objective mathematical/scientific questions versus subjective social/political questions. Understanding this distinction is crucial for properly evaluating LLM capabilities.
  - Quick check question: Can you identify which of these questions requires observer-independent knowledge versus observer-relative knowledge: "What is the derivative of x²?" versus "Is democracy the best form of government?"

- Concept: Turing test limitations and the Reverse Turing Test
  - Why needed here: The evaluation framework uses Turing test methodology, and understanding its limitations (subjective, depends on interviewer quality) is essential for interpreting the results correctly.
  - Quick check question: Why might two different interviewers get different impressions of GPT-4's intelligence when asking the same type of question?

- Concept: Bloom's taxonomy of learning levels
  - Why needed here: The paper discusses how LLMs can shortcut memorization but cannot replace higher-level understanding, making this framework relevant for educational implications.
  - Quick check question: At which level of Bloom's taxonomy does simple memorization occur, and at which level does true understanding of abstract concepts occur?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Question bank -> GPT-4 evaluation -> Response analysis -> Consistency checking -> Understanding assessment
- Critical path: Design questions → Query GPT-4 → Analyze responses for consistency and correctness → Categorize failures (lack of understanding vs. statistical generation) → Draw conclusions about LLM limitations
- Design tradeoffs: The evaluation uses subjective Turing test methodology (flexible but potentially inconsistent) rather than standardized benchmarking (objective but may miss nuanced understanding failures). This tradeoff allows detection of subtle reasoning failures but requires careful question design.
- Failure signatures: Inconsistent answers to questions about the same concept, verbose non-specific responses, inability to handle multi-concept integration, failure on novel problem combinations, and inability to qualify answer confidence.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test prime number understanding: Ask GPT-4 to identify primes, continue prime sequences in different bases, and explain prime properties. Compare consistency across these related questions.
  2. Test continuous function understanding: Present questions about intermediate value theorem applications with varying complexity. Check if correct answers are accompanied by correct explanations.
  3. Test VC-dimension comprehension: Ask about shattering concepts with different function classes. Verify if the model can apply the same abstract concept across varied examples.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: Can large language models truly achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) within the next 5-10 years as some researchers predict?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that there is a view that LLMs will achieve AGI in the next 5-10 years, but the authors' analysis suggests that LLMs lack true understanding and reasoning abilities.
- Why unresolved: This question remains unresolved because it depends on future technological developments and the definition of AGI. The paper's analysis suggests that current LLMs have limitations in understanding abstract concepts and reasoning, which are crucial for AGI.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical evidence demonstrating that LLMs can consistently perform tasks requiring true understanding and reasoning across various domains, not just memorization and statistical correlations.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the educational system be revised to accommodate large language models while ensuring students develop critical thinking and understanding skills?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper discusses the impact of LLMs on education, highlighting the risk of students using LLMs as a shortcut for memorization, which could deprive them of critical learning levels.
- Why unresolved: This question is unresolved because it requires a fundamental rethinking of educational methods and assessment techniques. The paper suggests that the current educational system may not adequately evaluate higher-level learning skills that LLMs cannot easily imitate.
- What evidence would resolve it: Successful implementation of new educational approaches that effectively integrate LLMs while promoting deep understanding and critical thinking skills in students.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can we develop scalable parallel implementations of other learning methods that can match or surpass the performance of deep learning networks for large datasets?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper suggests that the superior performance of large deep learning networks may be due to good computational scaling for large datasets, achieved through parallel implementation of the SGD learning algorithm using many GPUs.
- Why unresolved: This question is unresolved because it challenges the current dominance of deep learning and requires further research into alternative learning methods and their scalability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Development and successful application of alternative learning methods that can scale efficiently to large datasets and demonstrate superior or comparable performance to deep learning networks in various tasks.

## Limitations

- The evaluation methodology relies on subjective Turing test-style questioning rather than standardized benchmarks
- Limited detail is provided on the specific questions used, making independent verification difficult
- The evaluation focuses on GPT-4 specifically without testing other contemporary LLMs for comparison

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: LLMs lack true conceptual understanding and rely on statistical pattern matching
**Medium Confidence**: GPT-4 struggles with multi-concept integration through logical reasoning
**Low Confidence**: LLMs cannot qualify their answers as correct or wrong

## Next Checks

1. **Replication with Standardized Question Bank**: Obtain or recreate the exact question set used in the evaluation and systematically test multiple contemporary LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Llama, etc.) to determine if the observed reasoning failures are specific to GPT-4 or represent broader LLM limitations.

2. **Prompt Engineering Stress Test**: For each identified failure mode, design targeted prompt variations that explicitly request logical reasoning chains, confidence qualifiers, or multi-step problem-solving approaches to assess whether the observed limitations are inherent or can be mitigated through better prompting.

3. **Conceptual Understanding Probe**: Design a controlled experiment testing whether LLMs can learn to correctly apply abstract concepts across novel contexts after being explicitly taught the underlying principles, rather than simply retrieving patterns from training data.
