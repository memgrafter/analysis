# Future Language Modeling from Temporal Document History

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2404.10297
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10297
- Reference count: 30
- The paper introduces future language modeling and proposes three temporal models that outperform non-temporal baselines in predicting future text content.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces future language modeling as a task of generating future text based on temporal document history. The authors propose three models that incorporate temporal information into language models to predict future textual content. By adding temporal biases to the generation probability, these models can generate content that follows predicted future trends. Experiments on predicting future abstracts for NLP papers show that the proposed approaches outperform non-temporal baselines on both automatic metrics and human evaluation, with the doubly contextualized model achieving the best results.

## Method Summary
The paper introduces future language modeling, where the goal is to generate future text based on historical document data. Three models are proposed: (1) Word Frequency Model - uses LSTM to predict word biases from historical frequency data, (2) Contextual Temporal Model - leverages contextualized embeddings pooled by year to predict future biases, and (3) Doubly Contextualized Model - gates temporal biases based on current generation context. All models use GPT-2 as the base model with temporal biases added to the softmax layer. The models are trained on NLP paper abstracts from 2003-2019 and evaluated on predicting 2021 abstracts.

## Key Results
- The doubly contextualized model achieves the best performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating temporal information into language models for predicting future text
- All three proposed models outperform non-temporal baselines on automatic metrics (PPL, CPL, CM) and human evaluation
- The contextual temporal model shows improvement over the word frequency model by incorporating contextualized information

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The temporal bias term in the word frequency model captures general trends in word usage over time without relying on contextual information.
- Mechanism: The LSTM processes the log frequencies of a word over a window of previous years, producing a bias vector Biw that is added to the final softmax layer. This bias adjusts the probability distribution to favor words that are trending up or down based on historical frequency data.
- Core assumption: Changes in word frequency over time are predictive of future usage patterns.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The word frequency model... only uses the raw counts of the word over time to compute a bias."
  - [section]: "Our intuition is to use a temporal neural network to try to predict biases for words based on historical frequency data of words."
  - [corpus]: Weak. The corpus contains related work on temporal modeling but no direct evaluation of raw frequency trends.
- Break condition: If word frequency trends are disrupted by external events or the trends reverse unexpectedly, the bias will no longer be predictive.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The contextual temporal model leverages contextualized embeddings from previous years to predict future word biases.
- Mechanism: For each word, the model computes a pooled representation by averaging its contextualized embeddings over all instances in a given year. These pooled representations are fed into an LSTM to predict the temporal bias for the next year. The bias is then added to the transformer's output before the softmax.
- Core assumption: Contextualized embeddings capture semantic shifts in word usage over time, which can be modeled to predict future trends.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "While the previous method models the change in the frequency of words over time, it does not have contextualized information to help it make its predictions."
  - [section]: "To account for contextualized information contained in prior abstracts, we develop a temporally contextualized model."
  - [corpus]: Weak. The corpus contains papers on temporal language models but does not provide direct evidence for the effectiveness of pooled contextualized embeddings.
- Break condition: If the semantic meaning of words changes abruptly or if the context in which words are used becomes too diverse, the pooled representation may not accurately capture the necessary information.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The doubly contextualized model gates the temporal bias based on the current generation context to improve coherence and relevance.
- Mechanism: The model projects the temporal bias Biw into the embedding space and computes an attention score between the transformer's output Hk and the projected bias. This attention score modulates the influence of the temporal bias on the final prediction, allowing the model to decide when to introduce new terms versus reusing existing ones.
- Core assumption: The generation context provides signals on whether introducing a new term is appropriate, and gating the temporal bias based on this context improves coherence.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The doubly contextualized model achieves the best results, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating temporal information into language models for predicting future text."
  - [section]: "We hypothesize that the contextual model can predict good terms to use, but cannot decide when to use the terms while generating."
  - [corpus]: Weak. The corpus does not contain specific evidence for the effectiveness of gating mechanisms in temporal language models.
- Break condition: If the gating mechanism fails to accurately assess the appropriateness of introducing new terms, the model may either overuse new terms or fail to introduce them when needed.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Transformer Language Models
  - Why needed here: The paper uses GPT-2 as the base model for all experiments, and understanding transformers is crucial for grasping how the temporal biases are integrated into the model.
  - Quick check question: How does a transformer decoder process input tokens to generate output probabilities?

- Concept: LSTM Networks
  - Why needed here: LSTMs are used in all three proposed models to process temporal information and predict future biases.
  - Quick check question: What is the advantage of using an LSTM over a simple feedforward network for modeling temporal dependencies?

- Concept: Softmax Function and Probability Distributions
  - Why needed here: The softmax function is used to convert the model's raw outputs into probability distributions over the vocabulary, and the temporal biases are added to this process.
  - Quick check question: How does adding a bias term to the logits before the softmax affect the resulting probability distribution?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Pre-trained GPT-2 model (base language model) -> LSTM network for processing temporal information -> Temporal bias computation and integration modules -> Gating mechanism (for the doubly contextualized model)

- Critical path:
  1. Tokenize input abstracts using the GPT-2 tokenizer.
  2. Process the tokens through the GPT-2 transformer layers to obtain contextualized embeddings.
  3. Compute the temporal bias based on the chosen model (word frequency, contextual, or doubly contextualized).
  4. Add the temporal bias to the transformer's output before the softmax.
  5. Generate the next token based on the modified probability distribution.

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using LSTMs for temporal modeling adds complexity but allows for better capture of long-term dependencies compared to simpler methods.
  - The gating mechanism in the doubly contextualized model adds another layer of complexity but improves coherence by modulating the influence of the temporal bias.

- Failure signatures:
  - If the model generates repetitive or incoherent text, it may indicate that the temporal bias is not being gated effectively.
  - If the model fails to introduce new terms that are trending in the future, it may suggest that the LSTM is not accurately predicting the temporal biases.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Evaluate the perplexity of the baseline GPT-2 model on the test set to establish a performance benchmark.
  2. Train and evaluate the word frequency model to assess the impact of incorporating raw frequency trends.
  3. Train and evaluate the contextual temporal model to determine the benefit of using contextualized embeddings for temporal modeling.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the fundamental limitations of predicting future text content, and how can these limitations be quantified or mitigated?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper acknowledges that not all future text can be predicted due to random events, new named entities, and serendipitous discoveries. It also mentions that experts are often wrong in their predictions.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a concrete framework for quantifying the predictability of future text or for identifying the types of content that are inherently unpredictable.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study that categorizes different types of textual content based on their predictability, along with empirical data on the accuracy of future text predictions for each category.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How can the proposed future language models be adapted to generate text about specific topics or domains, rather than being topic-agnostic?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the proposed models are topic-agnostic and suggests that future work could focus on improving the model to generate text about specific topics.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a concrete approach for incorporating topic-specific information into the future language models.
- What evidence would resolve it: A modified version of the future language models that incorporates topic-specific information, along with experiments demonstrating improved performance on topic-specific future text generation tasks.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What are the most effective methods for incorporating temporal information into large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, without the need for fine-tuning on temporal data?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that the proposed models need to change the model architecture and fine-tune on temporal text data, which makes it hard to apply to LLMs. It suggests that developing better prompting techniques with temporal information could be a potential solution.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a concrete approach for incorporating temporal information into LLMs using prompting techniques.
- What evidence would resolve it: A set of prompting techniques that effectively incorporate temporal information into LLMs, along with experiments demonstrating improved performance on future text generation tasks.

## Limitations
- The models are evaluated on a narrow domain (NLP paper abstracts) over a limited time span, limiting generalizability to other domains and longer time horizons
- The human evaluation focuses specifically on topic, problem, and method clarity/novelty, leaving open questions about overall text quality and coherence
- The doubly contextualized model adds significant complexity through the gating mechanism without thorough analysis of whether this complexity is justified

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The basic framework of adding temporal biases to language model predictions is sound and well-implemented. The experimental methodology is rigorous with appropriate baselines and evaluation metrics.

**Medium Confidence**: The effectiveness of the three specific mechanisms (word frequency, contextual, doubly contextualized) is demonstrated within the narrow evaluation scope, but generalization to other domains and time scales remains uncertain.

**Low Confidence**: The paper doesn't provide strong theoretical justification for why the gating mechanism in the doubly contextualized model improves performance, nor does it thoroughly analyze failure modes or limitations of the approach.

## Next Checks

1. **Domain Generalization Test**: Apply the proposed models to a different domain (e.g., news articles, social media posts) with a longer temporal span to evaluate whether the temporal modeling approach generalizes beyond NLP paper abstracts.

2. **Ablation Study on Temporal Components**: Systematically remove or modify each temporal component (LSTM, bias addition, gating mechanism) to quantify their individual contributions to performance and determine if simpler alternatives could achieve similar results.

3. **Long-term Trend Robustness**: Create synthetic test cases where temporal trends reverse or become disrupted, then evaluate how well each model adapts to these changes compared to baseline models that don't use temporal information.
