# TIMBA: Time series Imputation with Bi-directional Mamba Blocks and Diffusion models

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2410.05916
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05916
- **Reference count**: 12
- **Primary result**: TIMBA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on traffic and air quality datasets using bi-directional Mamba blocks for multivariate time series imputation

## Executive Summary
TIMBA introduces a novel diffusion-based approach for multivariate time series imputation that replaces traditional time-oriented transformers with bi-directional Mamba blocks. The method combines State Space Models, Graph Neural Networks, and node-oriented transformers to create enhanced spatiotemporal representations. By leveraging the selective SSM mechanism of Mamba blocks, TIMBA achieves superior performance on three real-world datasets while maintaining computational efficiency. The bidirectional processing capability allows for more effective capture of temporal dependencies compared to unidirectional approaches.

## Method Summary
TIMBA employs a diffusion model framework for time series imputation, utilizing bi-directional Mamba blocks as the core temporal processing component. The architecture integrates State Space Models (SSMs) with Graph Neural Networks to capture both temporal and spatial relationships in multivariate time series data. Unlike transformer-based approaches, the selective SSM mechanism in Mamba blocks enables efficient long-range dependency modeling without quadratic computational complexity. The diffusion process iteratively refines imputed values through denoising steps, with the bi-directional Mamba blocks processing information in both forward and backward temporal directions to enhance context awareness.

## Key Results
- Achieves lower MAE and MSE values compared to state-of-the-art methods on AQI-36, METR-LA, and PEMS-BAY datasets
- Demonstrates superior performance across most missing data scenarios with varying levels of missingness
- Ablation study confirms the importance of bidirectional processing for imputation accuracy
- Shows improved performance on downstream tasks compared to baseline imputation methods

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
TIMBA's effectiveness stems from the combination of diffusion models with bi-directional Mamba blocks. The diffusion framework provides a principled approach to gradual denoising and imputation, while the bi-directional Mamba blocks capture temporal dependencies more efficiently than transformers. The selective SSM mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant temporal patterns without the computational burden of full attention mechanisms. By processing information in both temporal directions, the model gains better context for imputing missing values, particularly in cases where future information is crucial for accurate reconstruction.

## Foundational Learning

**State Space Models (SSMs)**: Discrete-time linear dynamical systems that model temporal sequences through state transitions. Needed for efficient long-range temporal modeling without attention's quadratic complexity. Quick check: Verify that state transitions capture relevant temporal dynamics in your data.

**Diffusion Models**: Generative models that learn to reverse a gradual noising process through iterative denoising steps. Required for principled handling of uncertainty in missing data imputation. Quick check: Ensure the noising schedule matches your data's missingness characteristics.

**Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**: Neural architectures that operate on graph-structured data by propagating information through edges. Essential for capturing spatial relationships between multivariate time series variables. Quick check: Validate that the graph structure reflects true dependencies in your data.

**Selective Scanning Mechanism**: Mamba's hardware-aware algorithm that computes selective matrices for efficient SSM approximation. Critical for maintaining performance while reducing computational overhead. Quick check: Compare parameter efficiency against attention-based alternatives.

## Architecture Onboarding

**Component Map**: Input Data -> Graph Encoder -> Bi-directional Mamba Blocks -> Diffusion Denoiser -> Output Imputed Series

**Critical Path**: The forward-backward processing through bi-directional Mamba blocks represents the critical path, as it captures the essential temporal context needed for accurate imputation. The diffusion denoising steps then iteratively refine these representations.

**Design Tradeoffs**: Mamba blocks sacrifice the global context awareness of full attention for linear complexity and hardware efficiency. This tradeoff favors longer sequences but may miss some fine-grained interactions that attention could capture. The bidirectional processing adds computational overhead but significantly improves imputation accuracy.

**Failure Signatures**: Performance degradation occurs when temporal dependencies are highly non-linear or when missing patterns violate the assumed noising distribution. The model may struggle with abrupt regime changes or when spatial correlations are weak.

**Three First Experiments**:
1. Evaluate imputation accuracy on synthetic data with known missing patterns to establish baseline performance
2. Test bidirectional vs unidirectional Mamba blocks on datasets with varying missingness ratios
3. Compare computational efficiency against transformer-based imputation methods using identical hardware

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out specific open questions in the abstract or conclusion sections.

## Limitations

- Generalizability beyond traffic and air quality datasets remains unproven, particularly for domains with different temporal patterns and missingness characteristics
- Absence of statistical significance testing makes it difficult to assess whether performance improvements are meaningful rather than random variation
- Limited computational efficiency analysis lacks absolute resource requirements and inference latency measurements critical for real-world deployment

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The technical architecture combining bi-directional Mamba blocks with diffusion models is sound and well-documented
- **Medium confidence**: The ablation study methodology is appropriate, though the specific findings could benefit from more extensive hyperparameter analysis
- **Low confidence**: Claims about downstream task improvements require more rigorous validation across diverse task types

## Next Checks

1. Conduct cross-domain evaluation testing TIMBA on financial time series, medical sensor data, and climate data to verify performance consistency across different missingness patterns and correlation structures

2. Perform statistical significance testing (paired t-tests or bootstrap confidence intervals) on all reported performance metrics to establish whether observed improvements exceed random variation

3. Measure and report absolute computational requirements including GPU memory consumption, inference latency, and training time scaling with sequence length to assess practical deployment feasibility
