# Large Language Models Offer an Alternative to the Traditional Approach of Topic Modelling

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.16248
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16248
- Reference count: 23
- Key outcome: LLMs with appropriate prompts can generate relevant topic titles and adhere to human guidelines to refine and merge topics, offering a viable alternative to traditional topic modeling approaches.

## Executive Summary
This paper investigates large language models (LLMs) as a novel approach for topic extraction from text corpora, addressing limitations of traditional methods like LDA. The authors propose a framework that prompts LLMs to generate topics from documents and develop evaluation protocols to assess topic quality. Their findings indicate that LLMs with appropriate prompts can produce relevant topic titles, adhere to human guidelines for refinement, and adapt to evolving language trends. The paper introduces new metrics to evaluate topic quality and demonstrates the approach through a case study analyzing COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy trends over time.

## Method Summary
The authors develop a prompt-based LLM inference pipeline for topic extraction, testing on two datasets: 20 Newsgroups (open-domain) and CAVS (COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy on Twitter). The method involves preprocessing documents by filtering out user mentions and hyperlinks, then implementing progressive prompt strategies: basic prompt, manual constraints, seed topics, and topic summarization. Generated topics are evaluated using Jaccard Distance, semantic similarity (BERT embeddings), recall, and precision against seed topics. The approach leverages zero-shot and few-shot capabilities of LLMs to produce human-readable topic descriptions without task-specific fine-tuning.

## Key Results
- LLMs with appropriate prompts can generate relevant topic titles and adhere to human guidelines to refine and merge topics
- The paper introduces metrics to evaluate topic quality including Jaccard Distance, semantic similarity, recall, and precision
- Case study on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy trends demonstrates LLMs' ability to adapt to evolving language trends

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LLMs can generate coherent, interpretable topics from text corpora without requiring labeled training data.
- Mechanism: By leveraging pre-trained transformer architectures with instruction fine-tuning (RLHF), LLMs can map input documents to natural language topic descriptions that reflect semantic patterns.
- Core assumption: The model's training corpus and instruction-tuning phase provide sufficient world knowledge and language understanding to infer topical structure from raw text.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract confirms LLMs can generate relevant topic titles; related papers show LLMs can directly produce topic labels from text.
- Break condition: If input text is too short, domain-specific vocabulary is highly specialized, or prompt lacks task-specific guidance.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: LLMs can reduce the need for manual post-processing (e.g., topic labeling, merging) that is typical in classic topic modeling.
- Mechanism: The model's generation process inherently produces human-readable topic titles and explanations, effectively performing both clustering and labeling in one step.
- Core assumption: The LLM's generative capacity is robust enough to handle both extraction and interpretation tasks without external topic model outputs as input.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states LLMs can condense overarching topics from outputs; related paper suggests moving beyond token-based outputs is feasible.
- Break condition: When topics are highly granular or overlapping, model may produce repetitive or redundant topic titles without explicit merging instructions.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: LLMs can dynamically adapt to evolving language trends and unseen topics without re-training.
- Mechanism: Zero-shot and few-shot capabilities allow model to generalize from training distribution to novel vocabularies and emerging themes.
- Core assumption: Model's training corpus is sufficiently diverse and recent to capture general topical patterns that transfer to new domains.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract mentions LLMs can adapt to evolving language trends and emerging topics; prompt-based inference allows customized outputs.
- Break condition: If domain shift is too large or new vocabulary entirely absent from training data, model may fail to produce accurate or relevant topics.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Zero-shot learning
  - Why needed here: The approach relies on LLMs generating topics without task-specific fine-tuning.
  - Quick check question: Can you describe a scenario where a zero-shot LLM would outperform a fine-tuned model in topic extraction?

- Concept: Prompt engineering and in-context learning
  - Why needed here: Success depends on crafting prompts that guide the LLM to produce the desired granularity and format.
  - Quick check question: What prompt components would you add to reduce overly general topics?

- Concept: Semantic similarity and clustering evaluation
  - Why needed here: Evaluating quality of LLM-generated topics requires metrics beyond standard topic modeling scores.
  - Quick check question: How would you compute topic distinctiveness using cosine similarity of BERT embeddings?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input preprocessor -> Prompt generator -> LLM inference module -> Post-processor -> Evaluator
- Critical path:
  1. Clean and batch documents for LLM input
  2. Generate prompts with constraints and seed topics
  3. Run LLM inference to extract raw topics
  4. Apply post-processing rules (lowercase, lemmatization)
  5. Summarize or merge topics to final list
  6. Evaluate using custom metrics
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Prompt complexity vs. inference cost: More detailed prompts yield better results but may increase API calls
  - Batch size vs. context length: Larger batches reduce cost but risk exceeding model context limits
  - Granularity control vs. model autonomy: Providing seed topics improves alignment but may bias outputs
- Failure signatures:
  - Too many repetitive or overly general topics → need stronger constraints or seed topics
  - High semantic similarity between final topics → increase number of seed topics or refine merging logic
  - Low recall on seed topics → adjust prompt wording or provide more examples
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test basic prompt (no constraints) on a small subset; observe topic relevance and redundancy
  2. Add constraints and seed topics; compare output granularity and adherence to expected topics
  3. Implement topic summarization prompt; evaluate final topic distinctiveness and interpretability

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do the evaluation metrics proposed in this paper compare to traditional topic modeling evaluation metrics (perplexity, coherence) when applied to LLM-generated topics?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - The paper introduces new evaluation metrics specifically designed for LLM-generated topics, noting that existing evaluation protocols cannot fully handle the new format.
- Why unresolved: The paper proposes these metrics but does not conduct a comparative analysis against traditional topic modeling evaluation metrics.
- What evidence would resolve it: A direct comparison study applying both traditional metrics (perplexity, coherence) and the proposed metrics to the same set of topics generated by LLMs and traditional methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the performance of LLM-based topic extraction vary across different domains and text lengths?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - The paper mentions testing on one open-domain dataset and one domain-specific dataset, and notes that topic modeling approaches might struggle with very short texts.
- Why unresolved: While the paper tests on two datasets, it doesn't provide a comprehensive analysis of performance variation across different domains and text lengths.
- What evidence would resolve it: A systematic study testing LLM-based topic extraction on a wide range of datasets varying in domain (e.g., biomedical, legal, social media) and text length (e.g., tweets, articles, books).

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can LLM-based topic extraction be effectively applied to streaming data without complete re-runs?
- Basis in paper: Explicit - The paper mentions that traditional approaches don't perform well on handling unseen documents without a complete re-run, and suggests LLMs can adapt to evolving language trends.
- Why unresolved: While the paper hints at this potential, it doesn't provide empirical evidence of LLM-based topic extraction performance on streaming data.
- What evidence would resolve it: A case study applying LLM-based topic extraction to a streaming dataset (e.g., Twitter) and evaluating its ability to adapt to new topics and maintain topic consistency over time.

## Limitations
- Lack of detailed prompt specifications and constraint definitions critical for reproducibility
- Evaluation metrics may not fully capture topic quality in complex, real-world scenarios
- Case study based on single dataset may not generalize to all domains

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: LLMs can generate interpretable topic titles from text corpora using appropriate prompts
- **Medium Confidence**: LLMs can dynamically adapt to evolving language trends without re-training, based on general LLM capabilities rather than direct evidence in this paper
- **Medium Confidence**: LLMs reduce the need for manual post-processing compared to traditional topic modeling, though some human intervention is still required for merging and refining topics

## Next Checks
1. Reproduce prompt effectiveness by testing proposed prompt strategies (basic, with constraints, with seed topics, summarization) on a different dataset to validate generalizability and prompt robustness
2. Benchmark against traditional methods by comparing LLM-generated topics with LDA/BTM outputs on same datasets using both quantitative metrics and human evaluation
3. Evaluate computational efficiency by measuring inference time and cost for LLM-based topic extraction versus traditional methods on large-scale corpora to determine practical feasibility
