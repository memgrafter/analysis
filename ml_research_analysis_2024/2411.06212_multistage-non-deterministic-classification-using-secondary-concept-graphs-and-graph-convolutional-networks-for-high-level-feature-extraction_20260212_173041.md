# Multistage non-deterministic classification using secondary concept graphs and graph convolutional networks for high-level feature extraction

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2411.06212
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06212
- Reference count: 5
- Primary result: Achieved 96%, 93%, and 95% accuracy on Cora, Citeseer, and PubMed datasets respectively

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes a multistage non-deterministic classification method for node classification in graph-structured data where samples may belong to multiple classes. The approach uses graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to extract high-level features, followed by incomplete non-deterministic models to generate intermediate predictions, which are organized into a secondary conceptual graph. A final GCN layer performs classification based on these logical representations. The method demonstrates 5% improvement over existing approaches on three benchmark datasets.

## Method Summary
The method employs a four-step process: first, a GCN extracts 12 high-level features from nodes; second, incomplete non-deterministic models generate intermediate predictions; third, these predictions are organized into a secondary conceptual graph representing logical relationships; finally, a second GCN performs the definitive classification based on the conceptual graph. The architecture uses attention mechanisms and processes graphs with varying dimensions (Cora: 1433, Citeseer: 3703, PubMed: 500 features) through layers sized at 16, 32, and 64 respectively.

## Key Results
- Achieved 96% accuracy on Cora dataset
- Achieved 93% accuracy on Citeseer dataset  
- Achieved 95% accuracy on PubMed dataset
- Outperformed GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, APPNP, and GCNII by at least 5%

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Intermediate logical graphs improve classification by capturing partial membership information before final assignment
- Mechanism: The multistage approach first extracts high-level features via GCN, then uses incomplete/non-deterministic models to generate intermediate predictions, which are organized into a secondary conceptual graph. This graph acts as a logical representation of uncertain memberships, allowing the final GCN layer to make more informed decisions
- Core assumption: Partial or multi-class membership can be better represented through logical graphs than direct classification
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] states: "employing incomplete, non-deterministic models for feature extraction, conducted before reaching a definitive prediction"
  - [section] describes: "using incomplete (non-deterministic) models for non-deterministic forecasting" and "creating a secondary conceptual graph based on non-deterministic prediction"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Two-stage GCN processing allows for better feature refinement and reduces over-smoothing
- Mechanism: The first GCN layer extracts high-level features from raw inputs. These features are then processed through incomplete models and logical graphs before being fed into a second GCN layer for final classification. This separation allows each GCN layer to focus on different aspects of the classification task
- Core assumption: Separating feature extraction and final classification into distinct GCN layers improves performance compared to single-stage approaches
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] mentions: "leverage GCN for the extraction and generation of 12 high-level features" followed by "formulating definitive forecasts grounded in conceptual (logical) graphs"
  - [section] describes: "The first GCN doesn't engage in prediction or conclusive decision-making; instead, it focuses on extracting high-level features" and "this layer determines the final and conclusive prediction based on these logical graphs"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Non-deterministic intermediate predictions allow handling of multi-class membership more effectively than deterministic approaches
- Mechanism: By using incomplete models that generate non-deterministic predictions at the intermediate stage, the method can represent uncertainty about class membership. This is particularly valuable when samples may belong to multiple classes, which is common in real-world graph data
- Core assumption: Many real-world samples belong to multiple classes rather than a single class, and deterministic classification fails to capture this complexity
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] states: "predicting and assigning 9 deterministic classes often involves errors" and proposes a "multi-stage non-deterministic classification method"
  - [section] mentions: "The samples in the used data set may be members of several classes instead of being members of one class"

## Foundational Learning

  - Quick check question: How does a GCN layer aggregate information from neighboring nodes?

- Concept: Graph embedding techniques
  - Why needed here: Understanding how to represent graph data in lower-dimensional spaces is crucial for feature extraction
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between node embedding and graph embedding?

- Concept: Multi-class classification challenges
  - Why needed here: The method specifically addresses cases where samples may belong to multiple classes
  - Quick check question: What are the limitations of deterministic classification when samples can belong to multiple classes?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input layer -> First GCN -> Incomplete models -> Conceptual graph -> Second GCN -> Output layer
- Critical path: Graph input → First GCN → Incomplete models → Conceptual graph → Second GCN → Classification output
- Design tradeoffs:
  - Complexity vs. performance: The multistage approach adds complexity but improves accuracy by ~5% over single-stage methods
  - Interpretability vs. performance: The logical graph provides interpretability but may add computational overhead
  - Non-determinism vs. certainty: Allows handling multi-class membership but introduces uncertainty in intermediate steps
- Failure signatures:
  - Accuracy plateaus or decreases after adding the conceptual graph stage
  - The intermediate non-deterministic predictions show no correlation with final classification quality
  - Overfitting occurs due to the increased model complexity
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement a baseline single GCN layer classifier and measure accuracy on Cora/Citeseer/PubMed
  2. Add the intermediate non-deterministic prediction stage and measure accuracy improvement
  3. Implement the full multistage architecture with conceptual graph and measure final classification accuracy

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of the multistage non-deterministic classification method scale with increasing graph size and complexity?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper demonstrates effectiveness on three benchmark datasets but does not explore scalability to larger or more complex graphs
- Why unresolved: The experimental evaluation is limited to relatively small datasets (Cora, Citeseer, PubMed), leaving uncertainty about performance on larger-scale graphs
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the method on larger datasets with millions of nodes and edges, comparing runtime and accuracy degradation with graph size

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of different incomplete model architectures on the non-deterministic prediction stage?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions using "incomplete, non-deterministic models" but does not specify or compare different model architectures for this stage
- Why unresolved: Without comparing different incomplete model architectures, it's unclear which designs are most effective for the non-deterministic prediction step
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic comparison of various incomplete model architectures (e.g., different numbers of layers, attention mechanisms, or aggregation strategies) and their effects on final classification accuracy

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the method handle graphs with evolving structures or dynamic node attributes?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on static graph classification and does not address scenarios where graph structure or node features change over time
- Why unresolved: Real-world applications often involve dynamic graphs, and the method's performance in such scenarios is unknown
- What evidence would resolve it: Evaluation of the method on dynamic graph datasets where nodes, edges, or attributes change over time, measuring accuracy and adaptation speed

## Limitations

- The exact implementation details of incomplete non-deterministic models and conceptual graph layer are not specified
- No ablation studies provided to isolate the contribution of each component to performance gains
- The claimed 5% improvement over baselines lacks statistical significance testing

## Confidence

- High confidence: The general framework of using GCN for feature extraction is well-established
- Medium confidence: The accuracy results on benchmark datasets appear plausible but need independent verification
- Low confidence: The specific mechanisms by which the secondary concept graphs improve classification are not clearly demonstrated

## Next Checks

1. Reimplement the baseline GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, APPNP, and GCNII models on the three datasets to verify the claimed 5% performance gap
2. Conduct ablation studies removing the secondary concept graph stage to measure its isolated contribution
3. Perform statistical significance testing comparing the proposed method against baselines across multiple random seeds
