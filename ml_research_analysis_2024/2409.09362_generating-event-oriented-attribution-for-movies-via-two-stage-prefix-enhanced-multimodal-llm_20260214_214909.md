# Generating Event-oriented Attribution for Movies via Two-Stage Prefix-Enhanced Multimodal LLM

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.09362
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09362
- Reference count: 40
- Two-stage prefix-enhanced multimodal LLM approach achieves BLEU-1 scores of 0.196 (local) and 0.150 (global) on MovieGraph dataset

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of event attribution in long videos like movies, where the goal is to connect events with their underlying causal semantics across an entire video. The key innovation is a Two-Stage Prefix-Enhanced MLLM (TSPE) approach that uses interaction-aware prefixes to summarize events within individual clips, followed by event-aware prefixes to link events across the full video using commonsense knowledge from ATOMIC. The method demonstrates significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art approaches on two real-world movie datasets.

## Method Summary
The proposed Two-Stage Prefix-Enhanced MLLM (TSPE) approach processes event attribution in movies through two distinct stages. In the local stage, an interaction-aware prefix guides the model to focus on relevant multimodal information within a single clip, summarizing the event by measuring semantic relevance between social interactions and multimodal cues. In the global stage, an event-aware prefix directs the model to focus on associated events rather than all preceding clips, using an inferential knowledge graph (ATOMIC) to strengthen connections between events. The model is built on the BLIP-2 backbone and fine-tuned on both MovieGraph and CHAR datasets.

## Key Results
- TSPE achieves BLEU-1 scores of 0.196 in the local stage and 0.150 in the global stage on the MovieGraph dataset
- The CHAR dataset results show significant improvements despite its greater difficulty (longer clips averaging 5 minutes)
- TSPE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the prefix-enhanced approach

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Interaction-aware prefixes enable the model to focus on multimodal cues relevant to specific events, reducing interference from overlapping events within the same clip.
- Mechanism: The model uses an attention mechanism to measure semantic relevance between social interactions and multimodal cues (frames and subtitles). These relevance scores are used to weight the visual and textual information, compressing it into event-related embeddings that serve as prefixes guiding the LLM's focus.
- Core assumption: Social interactions are reliable indicators of the core events in video clips, and their semantic relevance to multimodal content can be effectively measured using attention mechanisms.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "In the local stage, we introduce an interaction-aware prefix that guides the model to focus on the relevant multimodal information within a single clip, briefly summarizing the single event."
  - [section]: "To capture the most relevant details for events, we propose the Interaction-Aware Prefix-Enhance mechanism. As Figure 3 shows, this mechanism assigns varying weights to short-term subtitles and frames based on their relevance to the event, and then fuses them into an embedding."
- Break condition: If social interactions are not good indicators of events, or if the attention mechanism fails to accurately measure semantic relevance, the interaction-aware prefix will not effectively guide the model.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Event-aware prefixes enable the model to focus on relevant preceding events for event attribution, rather than all prior events, by leveraging inferential knowledge from ATOMIC.
- Mechanism: The model uses an attention mechanism to measure semantic relevance between the current event and previous events, weighted by additional information from ATOMIC predictions. These relevance scores are used to compress previous events into event-related embeddings that serve as prefixes guiding the LLM's focus on relevant causal information.
- Core assumption: ATOMIC can provide useful inferential knowledge to enhance semantic similarity between related events, and attention mechanisms can effectively identify relevant causal relationships.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "In the global stage, we strengthen the connections between associated events using an inferential knowledge graph, and design an event-aware prefix that directs the model to focus on associated events rather than all preceding clips, resulting in accurate event attribution."
  - [section]: "To address this issue, we incorporate an external knowledge graph, ATOMIC [10], designed to predict potential outcomes based on previous events... Using ATOMIC's predictions as contextual information, we enhance semantic connections between events."
- Break condition: If ATOMIC fails to provide useful inferential knowledge, or if attention mechanisms cannot accurately identify relevant causal relationships, the event-aware prefix will not effectively guide the model.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The two-stage approach with prefix enhancement effectively addresses the challenge of processing extensive multimodal information within the limited context length of MLLMs for long video event attribution.
- Mechanism: The local stage first extracts and summarizes events within individual clips using interaction-aware prefixes, reducing the complexity of information. The global stage then uses event-aware prefixes to focus on relevant causal relationships between summarized events, avoiding the need to process all preceding clips.
- Core assumption: Processing events in stages (local summarization followed by global attribution) is more effective than trying to process all information at once, and prefix enhancement can effectively guide the model's focus at each stage.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "To address this issue, we propose a Two-Stage Prefix-Enhanced MLLM (TSPE) approach for event attribution, i.e., connecting associated events with their causal semantics, in movie videos."
  - [section]: "After summarizing the single event in the local stage, we shift our focus to exploring relationships between events across the entire movie in the global stage... We also develop an event-aware prefix, which ensures the model focuses on relevant preceding events, rather than all prior events."
- Break condition: If the staged approach fails to capture necessary information, or if prefix enhancement does not effectively guide the model's focus, the overall method will not achieve accurate event attribution.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Attention mechanisms in neural networks
  - Why needed here: The paper relies heavily on attention mechanisms to measure semantic relevance between different types of information (social interactions and multimodal cues, current and previous events).
  - Quick check question: Can you explain how dot-product attention works and why it's useful for measuring semantic similarity?

- Concept: Knowledge graphs and commonsense reasoning
  - Why needed here: The paper uses ATOMIC, a commonsense knowledge graph, to enhance semantic connections between events for global stage attribution.
  - Quick check question: What is the purpose of using external knowledge graphs like ATOMIC in natural language processing tasks?

- Concept: Multimodal learning and representation
  - Why needed here: The paper deals with integrating visual (frames) and textual (subtitles) information for event understanding and attribution in videos.
  - Quick check question: How do multimodal models typically handle the integration of different types of input data (e.g., images and text)?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: BLIP-2 backbone (visual and text encoders, Q-former, LLM) -> Interaction-aware prefix module (attention mechanism, social interaction detection) -> Event-aware prefix module (ATOMIC integration, attention mechanism) -> Fine-tuning layers for both stages

- Critical path:
  1. Video clip segmentation and preprocessing
  2. Local stage: Interaction-aware prefix generation and event summarization
  3. Global stage: Event-aware prefix generation and event attribution

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using prefix enhancement vs. directly inputting all information to the LLM
  - Focusing on social interactions vs. other event indicators
  - Using ATOMIC vs. other knowledge sources or no external knowledge

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance on either stage indicates issues with prefix generation or guidance
  - Overfitting to training data suggests need for regularization or more diverse training data
  - Inconsistent results across different types of movies suggests domain bias

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test interaction-aware prefix generation on a small dataset with known social interactions and events
  2. Test event-aware prefix generation using a simplified knowledge graph on a small set of related events
  3. Evaluate the complete two-stage pipeline on a held-out portion of the MovieGraph dataset

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

The paper does not explicitly call out open questions, but several areas for future research are implied by the limitations discussed in the paper, particularly regarding the scalability of the approach to other types of long videos beyond movies.

## Limitations

- Limited Context Window: The model still faces constraints from the LLM's context length, requiring the staged approach and potentially missing longer-range dependencies beyond what prefixes can capture.
- Knowledge Graph Dependency: The effectiveness of event-aware prefixes depends on ATOMIC's coverage and quality, which may not contain all relevant commonsense knowledge for movie-specific events.
- Annotation Quality: The approach depends on accurate social interaction annotations and ground truth event descriptions, which may introduce noise or bias.

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The general framework of using prefix enhancement for multimodal event attribution, and the reported performance improvements on benchmark datasets (MovieGraph and CHAR).

**Medium Confidence**: The specific mechanisms of interaction-aware and event-aware prefixes, as the paper provides conceptual descriptions but limited implementation details.

**Low Confidence**: The scalability of this approach to videos longer than movies, or to domains outside of movies where different types of events and causal relationships may dominate.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset generalization test**: Evaluate the trained model on a third, held-out movie dataset not used in training or development to verify the approach generalizes beyond the two tested datasets.

2. **Ablation study on prefix components**: Systematically remove either the interaction-aware prefix or event-aware prefix components to quantify their individual contributions to performance gains, particularly focusing on which component drives the larger improvement.

3. **Error analysis on failure cases**: Manually examine 50-100 cases where the model fails to generate correct event attributions to identify patterns (e.g., specific genres, types of causal relationships, or event complexities) that reveal fundamental limitations of the prefix approach.
