# Predicting from a Different Perspective: A Re-ranking Model for Inductive Knowledge Graph Completion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.16902
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16902
- Reference count: 12
- Primary result: ReDistLP achieves state-of-the-art Hits@1 improvements of up to 3.3% on WN18RR and FB15k-237 using rule-length differentiated re-ranking

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses inductive knowledge graph completion by proposing ReDistLP, a re-ranking approach that leverages two BERTRL models trained on different rule lengths. The method uses a 2-hop rule model as an initial retriever and a 3-hop rule model as a re-ranker, exploiting the complementary prediction patterns between them. Theoretical analysis using fuzzy set theory shows that prediction differences between models improve re-ranking effectiveness. Experiments demonstrate significant performance gains on standard KGC benchmarks, establishing new state-of-the-art results on two datasets.

## Method Summary
ReDistLP employs a two-stage re-ranking pipeline for inductive knowledge graph completion. First, a BERTRL model trained on 2-hop rules generates candidate entities as an initial retriever. Second, these candidates are re-ranked by another BERTRL model trained on 3-hop rules. The approach exploits differences in prediction patterns between models trained on different rule lengths - shorter rules produce broader predictions while longer rules yield narrower, more specific predictions. Fuzzy set theory provides the theoretical framework for optimizing re-ranking effectiveness by minimizing the intersection of prediction α-cuts. The model also explores various threshold optimization methods to determine the optimal cutoff point for the initial retriever's results.

## Key Results
- Achieves state-of-the-art Hits@1 performance on WN18RR and FB15k-237 datasets
- Demonstrates up to 3.3% improvement in Hits@1 over existing methods
- Shows theoretical justification for using prediction differences between models trained on different rule lengths
- Validates the effectiveness of fuzzy set-based re-ranking optimization

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
ReDistLP improves accuracy by leveraging prediction differences between models trained on different rule lengths. The model uses BERTRL trained on 2-hop rules as an initial retriever and BERTRL trained on 3-hop rules as a re-ranker. The 3-hop model predicts entities within narrower regions of the KG, while the 2-hop model has broader predictions. This difference creates complementary prediction sets that enhance re-ranking effectiveness. The core assumption is that the prediction sets of the initial retriever and re-ranker are not subsets of each other, maximizing the effectiveness of re-ranking.

### Mechanism 2
Fuzzy set theory provides a theoretical framework for optimizing re-ranking effectiveness. The paper uses fuzzy sets to model model predictions, where the membership function is the model's score. The re-ranking effectiveness is maximized when the intersection of the α-cuts of the initial retriever and re-ranker is minimized. The performance of a model can be represented by the size of the α-cut of its fuzzy set. This theoretical approach guides the optimization of the re-ranking process.

### Mechanism 3
The optimal cutoff point for the initial retriever's results directly affects the accuracy of the re-ranking model. The paper explores different threshold optimization methods, including classical sets approach (threshold, top-k cutoff, k-means clustering) and fuzzy sets approach (intersection, union, convex combination). The fuzzy sets approach is used in the final model. The assumption is that the optimal cutoff can be determined using either classical or fuzzy set theory, with the choice affecting overall performance.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC)
  - Why needed here: The paper focuses on inductive KGC, which requires the model to generalize to unseen entities
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between transductive and inductive KGC?

- Concept: Rule-induction models
  - Why needed here: The paper uses rule-induction models, specifically BERTRL, to learn relation patterns as rules
  - Quick check question: How do rule-induction models differ from embedding-based models in KGC?

- Concept: Fuzzy set theory
  - Why needed here: The paper uses fuzzy set theory to model model predictions and optimize re-ranking effectiveness
  - Quick check question: What is the relationship between fuzzy sets and classical sets?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: BERTRL (2-hop) -> Initial retriever -> BERTRL (3-hop) -> Re-ranker -> Fuzzy set combination -> Final predictions

- Critical path: Train BERTRL models on different rule lengths → Use BERTRL (2-hop) to generate candidate entities → Use BERTRL (3-hop) to re-rank candidate entities → Optimize cutoff point using fuzzy set theory

- Design tradeoffs: Using different rule lengths for initial retriever and re-ranker vs. using same length; using fuzzy set theory vs. classical sets approach; exploring different threshold optimization methods

- Failure signatures: Prediction sets of initial retriever and re-ranker become too similar; fuzzy set representation does not accurately capture model performance; optimal cutoff cannot be determined

- First 3 experiments: 1) Train BERTRL models on different rule lengths and analyze prediction differences 2) Implement re-ranking pipeline using BERTRL (2-hop) and BERTRL (3-hop) 3) Explore different threshold optimization methods and compare performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
What specific factors contribute to the prediction set differences between BERTRL models trained with different hop rules? While the paper demonstrates the existence of these differences, it does not explore the underlying factors driving this behavior, such as the impact of rule complexity or the distribution of entities in the KG.

### Open Question 2
How can the rank threshold for re-ranking be optimally determined in the actual setting? The paper acknowledges that determining an optimal cutoff for the initial retriever's results is challenging and limits the model's accuracy, but does not provide a definitive solution for determining the optimal threshold when the correct entity is not guaranteed to be in the initial pool.

### Open Question 3
How does the performance of ReDistLP vary with different KG characteristics, such as entity density and relation diversity? The paper evaluates ReDistLP on three KGs but does not analyze its performance in relation to KG characteristics, which could provide insights into its generalizability and limitations.

## Limitations

- Theoretical claims about fuzzy set optimization rely heavily on mathematical proofs without empirical validation
- Performance gains depend critically on the assumption that 2-hop and 3-hop models produce non-overlapping prediction sets, but this overlap ratio is not reported
- BERTRL model architecture and training details are underspecified, making exact reproduction challenging

## Confidence

- Mechanism 1 (Prediction difference): Medium confidence - the concept is sound but overlap analysis is missing
- Mechanism 2 (Fuzzy set theory): Low confidence - theoretical framework is presented but lacks empirical validation
- Experimental results: Medium confidence - state-of-the-art claims on two datasets but with limited ablation studies

## Next Checks

1. Measure and report the intersection ratio of top-10 predictions between 2-hop and 3-hop BERTRL models to verify the non-overlapping prediction assumption
2. Conduct ablation studies comparing fuzzy set re-ranking vs simple score averaging to validate the theoretical framework
3. Test the re-ranking approach with other model pairs (e.g., embedding-based + rule-based) to assess generalizability beyond BERTRL
