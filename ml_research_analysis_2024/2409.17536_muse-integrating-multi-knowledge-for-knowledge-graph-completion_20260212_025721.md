# MUSE: Integrating Multi-Knowledge for Knowledge Graph Completion

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.17536
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17536
- Authors: Pengjie Liu
- Reference count: 40
- Key outcome: MUSE achieves over 5.50% H@1 and 4.20% MRR improvement on NELL995 by integrating fine-tuned BERT descriptions, graph attention networks, and path-based reasoning for knowledge graph completion

## Executive Summary
MUSE addresses Knowledge Graph Completion by integrating three complementary knowledge sources: semantic descriptions, neighbor context, and relational paths. The model fine-tunes BERT on entity descriptions to capture semantic knowledge, uses graph attention networks to aggregate neighbor context messages, and employs path-based reasoning to capture multi-hop relationships. MUSE demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing baselines, particularly on datasets with sparse entity distributions and long-tail entities, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple public benchmarks.

## Method Summary
MUSE employs a three-component architecture for knowledge graph completion: (1) Prior Knowledge Learning fine-tunes BERT on entity descriptions through a classification task to encode semantic representations; (2) Context Message Passing uses a graph attention network with edge-based message passing to aggregate neighbor entity representations; (3) Relational Path Aggregation identifies all paths from head to tail entities and computes attention scores to weight path contributions. These components are combined through a softmax layer to predict missing relations in (head entity)–[relation]–(tail entity) triplets, trained using cross-entropy loss.

## Key Results
- MUSE achieves over 5.50% H@1 and 4.20% MRR improvement on NELL995 dataset
- Strong performance on datasets with sparse entity distributions and long-tail entities
- Outperforms existing baselines on four public datasets (FB15k-237, WN18, WN18RR, NELL995)
- Particularly effective in LIS (Low-Indegree and Sparsity) scenarios with sparse graphs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
Fine-tuning BERT on entity descriptions provides semantic grounding that compensates for sparse graph structure. The Prior Knowledge Learning component fine-tunes BERT through a relation classification task, then uses the fine-tuned model to encode descriptions of head and tail entities into semantic representations (SD). This works when entity descriptions contain sufficient semantic information to guide relation prediction when graph topology is limited.

### Mechanism 2
Edge-based message passing aggregates neighbor context to enrich entity representations when direct connections are sparse. Context Message Passing uses a graph attention network that iteratively aggregates neighbor entity representations through edge-based attention, updating context representations over K iterations. This works when neighbor entities provide relevant contextual information that, when properly aggregated through attention mechanisms, improves relation prediction accuracy.

### Mechanism 3
Relational path aggregation captures multi-hop reasoning patterns that single-hop methods miss. Relational Path Aggregation identifies all paths from head to tail entities, computes attention scores based on context representations, and aggregates path representations weighted by their attention scores. This works when the correct relation can be inferred by reasoning over the sequence of entities and relations along connecting paths, especially when direct connections are missing or ambiguous.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Knowledge Graph Completion task formulation
  - Why needed here: Understanding the triplet prediction problem (head entity, relation, tail entity) is fundamental to grasping how MUSE operates
  - Quick check question: What is the goal of predicting the missing relation in a (head, ?, tail) triplet?

- Concept: Graph neural networks and message passing
  - Why needed here: MUSE's Context Message Passing component relies on GNN concepts like node aggregation and edge-based attention
  - Quick check question: How does node-based message passing differ from edge-based message passing in GNNs?

- Concept: Pre-trained language model fine-tuning
  - Why needed here: Prior Knowledge Learning depends on understanding how BERT fine-tuning works for classification tasks
  - Quick check question: What is the difference between feature-based and fine-tuning-based approaches when using PLMs for KG tasks?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Prior Knowledge Learning -> Context Message Passing -> Relational Path Aggregation -> Softmax layer
- Critical path: For each test triplet, run entity descriptions through fine-tuned BERT, build graph with neighbor connections, enumerate paths from head to tail, aggregate all three knowledge sources, apply softmax to predict relation
- Design tradeoffs: BERT fine-tuning adds training complexity but provides semantic grounding; GNN parameters vs. path enumeration tradeoffs; attention mechanisms add parameters but enable selective knowledge integration
- Failure signatures: Poor performance on LIS scenarios suggests insufficient semantic grounding; poor performance on RIS scenarios suggests inadequate context/message passing; inconsistent results across datasets suggest overfitting to specific graph structures
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement and test Prior Knowledge Learning component alone on FB15k-237 to verify BERT fine-tuning improves semantic representation
  2. Implement Context Message Passing with simple aggregation (no attention) to establish baseline for neighbor context enrichment
  3. Add edge-based attention mechanism to Context Message Passing and measure improvement over baseline

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does MUSE's performance scale with increasing graph sparsity, particularly for datasets with degree distributions more extreme than NELL995? The paper demonstrates MUSE's effectiveness on NELL995 (31% LIS) but doesn't explore scalability beyond this. Testing MUSE on synthetic datasets with controlled degree distributions would clarify performance boundaries.

### Open Question 2
What is the relative contribution of each knowledge component when entity descriptions contain conflicting or noisy information? The ablation study shows all three components improve performance, but doesn't analyze their behavior under noisy description conditions. Controlled experiments introducing noise in entity descriptions would reveal their relative importance under imperfect conditions.

### Open Question 3
How does MUSE's fine-tuning approach for BERT compare to alternative pre-training strategies specifically designed for knowledge graph tasks? MUSE uses BERT fine-tuning for prior knowledge learning but doesn't compare to KG-specific pre-training methods. Direct comparison with KG-BERT variants would establish whether MUSE's approach is optimal.

## Limitations

- Performance variability across datasets: MUSE shows strong improvements on NELL995 but detailed performance gains on other datasets are not specified
- Computational complexity: The three-component architecture likely increases computational overhead compared to simpler KGC models, though this trade-off is not quantified
- Generalization to unseen entities: Reliance on entity descriptions may limit performance on entities without descriptions or with poor-quality descriptions

## Confidence

- High confidence: The core architectural claims are well-specified and align with established methods in the literature
- Medium confidence: The reported performance improvements are substantial but based on a single paper's evaluation without independent replication
- Low confidence: The paper lacks detailed ablation studies showing the individual contribution of each component

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study**: Remove each component (Prior Knowledge Learning, Context Message Passing, Relational Path Aggregation) individually and measure performance degradation on all four datasets to quantify each mechanism's contribution

2. **Computational overhead analysis**: Measure training and inference time compared to baseline KGC methods to quantify the computational cost of the three-component architecture

3. **Zero-shot entity performance**: Test MUSE on entities with missing or poor-quality descriptions to evaluate robustness and generalization beyond well-described entities
