# StarCraftImage: A Dataset For Prototyping Spatial Reasoning Methods For Multi-Agent Environments

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.04290
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04290
- Authors: Sean Kulinski; Nicholas R. Waytowich; James Z. Hare; David I. Inouye
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Provides 3.6 million simplified spatial reasoning images from StarCraft II replays for multi-agent environment research

## Executive Summary
StarCraftImage is a benchmark dataset designed to facilitate rapid prototyping of spatial reasoning methods for multi-agent environments. Derived from 60,000 StarCraft II replays, the dataset provides 3.6 million static images that summarize 255 consecutive game states in three formats: hyperspectral, RGB, and grayscale. By abstracting complex game dynamics into simplified image representations while preserving strategic spatial relationships, the dataset aims to bridge the gap between simple benchmark datasets like MNIST and CIFAR10 and real-world multi-agent environments.

## Method Summary
The dataset was created by processing StarCraft II replays using PySC2 to extract 255 consecutive game states, which were then summarized into static images. Three image formats were generated: hyperspectral (preserving unit type and position information), RGB (converted from hyperspectral), and grayscale (for compatibility with existing computer vision models). Each image is accompanied by comprehensive metadata including game outcome, player races, map names, MMR ratings, and APM statistics. The dataset supports multiple task types including unit identification, outcome prediction, movement prediction, and missing data imputation.

## Key Results
- Dataset contains 3.6 million images from 60,000 replays with comprehensive metadata
- Three image formats provided (hyperspectral, RGB, grayscale) for varying complexity levels
- Preliminary experiments show 57-59% accuracy for outcome prediction tasks
- Performance on StarCraftImage correlates with performance on real-world datasets like DOTA-UnitID

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** The dataset enables rapid prototyping of spatial reasoning methods by abstracting StarCraft II's complex multi-agent dynamics into simplified image formats.
- **Mechanism:** By summarizing 255 consecutive game states into static images and providing three decreasing complexity formats (Hyperspectral, RGB, Grayscale), the dataset reduces implementation overhead while preserving spatial reasoning challenges.
- **Core assumption:** The simplified image representations retain sufficient spatial information for training and evaluating spatial reasoning models without requiring full game engine simulation.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "StarCraftImage provides a simplified spatial reasoning dataset derived from StarCraft II replays, offering three formats... to facilitate rapid prototyping"
  - [section]: "we construct a benchmark spatial reasoning dataset based on StarCraft II replays that exhibit complex multi-agent behaviors, while still being as easy to use as MNIST and CIFAR10"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence for this specific mechanism
- **Break condition:** If the simplified representations lose critical spatial relationships or if the metadata becomes insufficient for complex task variations.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** The dataset's metadata enables flexible task design and domain generalization experiments.
- **Mechanism:** Comprehensive metadata (game outcome, player races, map names, MMR, APM) allows filtering and splitting the dataset for various tasks and testing robustness to distribution shifts.
- **Core assumption:** Metadata attributes can meaningfully segment the dataset into distinct domains or conditions that reflect real-world distribution shifts.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "The dataset contains 3.6 million images from 60,000 replays, with metadata for tasks like unit identification, outcome prediction, and missing data imputation"
  - [section]: "we also aggregated relevant metadata for each window, such as the temporal location of the window in the overall match, which player won the match, the races of the players, the name of match's map"
  - [corpus]: Weak - no direct corpus evidence for this specific mechanism
- **Break condition:** If metadata attributes don't capture meaningful variations or if the dataset size becomes insufficient for certain splits.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** The dataset bridges the gap between simple benchmark datasets and complex real-world multi-agent environments.
- **Mechanism:** By providing a dataset that's easy to use like MNIST/CIFAR10 but contains complex strategic agent positioning from human gameplay, it enables systematic method development before real-world deployment.
- **Core assumption:** Performance improvements on this dataset correlate with performance on real-world spatial reasoning datasets.
- **Evidence anchors:**
  - [abstract]: "Following the simplicity of these datasets, we construct a benchmark spatial reasoning dataset based on StarCraft II replays that exhibit complex multi-agent behaviors, while still being as easy to use as MNIST and CIFAR10"
  - [section]: "we hope our dataset provides the ML community with an easy-to-use multi-agent spatial reasoning dataset that will significantly reduce the barrier of entry for these important tasks"
  - [corpus]: Weak - only preliminary evidence from DOTA-UnitID experiment
- **Break condition:** If the correlation between StarCraftImage performance and real-world dataset performance breaks down or if the strategic complexity doesn't transfer.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept: Spatial reasoning in multi-agent environments**
  - Why needed here: Understanding how to represent and reason about multiple agents' positions and environmental context is fundamental to using this dataset effectively
  - Quick check question: Can you explain the difference between spatial reasoning for single-agent vs multi-agent environments?

- **Concept: Image representation formats (Hyperspectral, RGB, Grayscale)**
  - Why needed here: The dataset provides three different image formats, and understanding their trade-offs is crucial for task selection and model design
  - Quick check question: What spatial information is preserved or lost when converting from Hyperspectral to RGB to Grayscale representations?

- **Concept: Data preprocessing and augmentation for spatial tasks**
  - Why needed here: The dataset includes simulated corruption models, and understanding how to apply and interpret these is important for robust method development
  - Quick check question: How would you implement and evaluate the impact of random additive noise on spatial reasoning performance?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Data extraction layer -> Image transformation layer -> Metadata management layer -> Task specification layer -> Evaluation layer

- **Critical path:**
  1. Load dataset using provided PyTorch classes
  2. Select appropriate image format and task
  3. Apply preprocessing (corruption models if needed)
  4. Train model using provided benchmarks as reference
  5. Evaluate using appropriate metrics

- **Design tradeoffs:**
  - Complexity vs. ease of use: Hyperspectral provides most information but is harder to work with than RGB/Grayscale
  - Dataset size vs. training time: Full 3.6M images vs. smaller subsets for rapid prototyping
  - Task specificity vs. generality: Specialized tasks vs. general spatial reasoning capabilities

- **Failure signatures:**
  - Poor performance on unit identification despite good performance on outcome prediction suggests model struggles with fine-grained spatial details
  - High variance across different map splits indicates poor domain generalization
  - Performance degradation with simulated noise suggests lack of robustness

- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Reproduce outcome prediction benchmark on StarCraftMNIST format
  2. Test unit identification on StarCraftCIFAR10 format with and without simulated sensor network noise
  3. Evaluate movement prediction (next hyperspectral window) on clean data using U-Net architecture

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Simplified representations may lose critical temporal dynamics and strategic information from actual gameplay
- Correlation between StarCraftImage performance and real-world spatial reasoning datasets needs broader validation
- Dataset's effectiveness for complex multi-agent reasoning may be artificially inflated due to controlled nature of summarized representations

## Confidence

- **High confidence:** The dataset creation methodology and basic task implementations are well-documented and reproducible. The claim that the dataset provides three image formats with varying complexity levels is strongly supported.
- **Medium confidence:** The claim that performance on StarCraftImage correlates with real-world datasets is based on preliminary evidence only. The dataset's effectiveness for prototyping spatial reasoning methods is theoretically sound but requires broader validation.
- **Low confidence:** The assertion that the dataset significantly reduces the barrier to entry for multi-agent spatial reasoning tasks is difficult to quantify and may depend heavily on the specific research context and prior expertise.

## Next Checks

1. **Cross-dataset validation:** Systematically evaluate StarCraftImage-trained models on multiple real-world spatial reasoning datasets (beyond just DOTA-UnitID) to quantify the claimed correlation and identify any limitations in generalizability.

2. **Temporal dynamics assessment:** Compare model performance using different summarization window sizes (e.g., 127 vs 255 frames) to quantify the information loss from temporal summarization and determine the minimum window size that preserves task performance.

3. **Robustness evaluation:** Conduct controlled experiments varying the severity of simulated data corruption (noise, missing data, sensor network effects) to establish performance baselines and identify the dataset's limits for robust method development.
