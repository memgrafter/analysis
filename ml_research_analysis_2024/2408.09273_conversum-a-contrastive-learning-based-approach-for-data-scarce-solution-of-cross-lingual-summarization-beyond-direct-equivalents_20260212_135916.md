# ConVerSum: A Contrastive Learning-based Approach for Data-Scarce Solution of Cross-Lingual Summarization Beyond Direct Equivalents

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.09273
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09273
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: ConVerSum outperforms baselines and matches GPT-4o for low-resource languages using contrastive learning without parallel CLS data

## Executive Summary
ConVerSum addresses the challenge of cross-lingual summarization (CLS) when parallel CLS training data is unavailable. The approach uses contrastive learning to train a model that generates high-quality summaries across multiple languages by comparing diverse candidate summaries generated through mT5 and diverse Beam Search. The method measures summary quality using XLM-RoBERTa embeddings and LaSE scores, then trains with contrastive ranking loss to maximize similarity between high-quality summaries and reference texts.

## Method Summary
ConVerSum generates diverse candidate summaries in multiple languages using mT5 with diverse Beam Search, then measures their quality using XLM-RoBERTa embeddings and LaSE scores. The model is trained with contrastive ranking loss that maximizes similarity between high-quality summaries and reference texts while pushing apart dissimilar pairs. This approach enables effective CLS without requiring parallel CLS training data, making it particularly valuable for low-resource language pairs.

## Key Results
- ConVerSum outperforms mT5 baseline (LaSE 0.4408 vs 0.3886) and Flan-T5 (0.4012 vs 0.3585) on CrossSum dataset
- Shows robustness across language pairs and surpasses GPT-3.5 while matching GPT-4o performance for low-resource languages
- Effective without large-scale CLS training data, making it suitable for data-scarce scenarios

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Contrastive ranking loss improves summary quality by pushing dissimilar summaries apart in embedding space
- Mechanism: Candidate summaries are scored by similarity to both document and reference. The loss enforces a margin between positive (high-quality) and negative (low-quality) summary pairs
- Core assumption: Better summaries have higher cosine similarity to reference while maintaining document relevance
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "train the model with a contrastive ranking loss to maximize similarity between high-quality summaries and reference"
  - [section 3.3.2]: Formal definition of contrastive ranking loss with margin parameter
  - [corpus]: Neighbor papers cite contrastive learning for summarization; ConVerSum is the first CLS-specific contrastive method
- Break condition: If candidate generation is poor (e.g., Flan-T5 case), contrastive learning cannot learn meaningful quality distinctions

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Diverse Beam Search generates high-quality candidate summaries in multiple languages
- Mechanism: Beam search explores multiple word sequences, producing varied summaries in different target languages
- Core assumption: More diverse candidates increase chances of high-quality summaries for contrastive learning
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.1.2]: "diverse Beam search [41] is used during the generation of candidate summaries which explores different sequences of words"
  - [section 5.1.1]: ConVerSum with mT5 outperforms Flan-T5 because Flan-T5 fails to generate diverse quality candidates
  - [corpus]: Neighbor papers discuss diverse generation methods for cross-lingual tasks
- Break condition: If model biases toward high-resource languages, low-resource summaries become underrepresented

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Dual scoring (LaSE + cosine similarity) provides robust quality measurement
- Mechanism: LaSE measures CLS-specific quality while cosine similarity ensures semantic coherence across languages
- Core assumption: Single metric (e.g., only BERTScore) cannot capture both language-specific quality and cross-lingual semantic alignment
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section 3.2.3]: "Both cosine similarity and LaSE scores are used in the evaluation of candidate summaries to capture various characteristics of summary quality"
  - [section 5.3]: LaSE outperforms BERTScore for CLS evaluation; explains why BERTScore can miss language confidence issues
  - [corpus]: CrossSum paper introduces LaSE specifically for CLS; ConVerSum builds on this foundation
- Break condition: If LaSE fails to capture meaning similarity (as BERTScore can), summaries may be linguistically correct but semantically off

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Contrastive Learning
  - Why needed here: Enables model to learn quality distinctions without parallel CLS data by comparing candidate summaries
  - Quick check question: What does the margin parameter in contrastive loss control?

- Concept: Multilingual Embeddings
  - Why needed here: XLM-RoBERTa maps semantically similar text from various languages into shared embedding space
  - Quick check question: How does XLM-RoBERTa handle languages with different scripts?

- Concept: Beam Search Diversity
  - Why needed here: Diverse Beam Search generates multiple candidate summaries exploring different word sequences
  - Quick check question: What happens to diversity if beam width is set too low?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Candidate Generation → Quality Scoring → Contrastive Ranking → Model Training → Fine-tuning/Evaluation
- Critical path: mT5 → Diverse Beam Search → XLM-RoBERTa Scoring → Contrastive Loss → Fine-tuning
- Design tradeoffs: mT5 chosen over Flan-T5 due to better candidate diversity; GPU memory limits batch size to 4
- Failure signatures: Low LaSE scores despite high BERTScore indicates language mixing issues; poor candidate diversity shows in Flan-T5 experiments
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Generate candidates with mT5 using diverse Beam Search (8 groups, 80-word limit)
  2. Score candidates with XLM-RoBERTa and LaSE, verify quality distribution
  3. Train contrastive ranking loss, monitor validation LaSE every 1000 steps

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does ConVerSum's performance scale with the size of the monolingual training dataset, particularly for low-resource languages?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions evaluating ConVerSum on both high-resource (CNN/DailyMail) and low-resource (XLSUM) datasets, but doesn't provide a systematic analysis of how performance changes with dataset size
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on demonstrating effectiveness across different resource scenarios rather than analyzing scaling behavior
- What evidence would resolve it: A controlled experiment varying training data sizes for different languages while measuring performance metrics

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of the number of candidate summaries generated (diverse Beam search groups) on ConVerSum's performance?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions using 8 groups for diverse Beam search but doesn't systematically explore how varying this number affects performance
- Why unresolved: The authors fixed the number of groups at 8 without exploring the full parameter space or analyzing sensitivity to this hyperparameter
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments varying the number of candidate summaries while measuring performance on the same validation sets

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does ConVerSum's contrastive learning approach compare to other self-supervised learning techniques for cross-lingual summarization?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper focuses on contrastive learning but doesn't compare against other self-supervised approaches like masked language modeling or autoencoding
- Why unresolved: The authors only compare against traditional baselines and LLMs, not exploring the broader landscape of self-supervised learning methods
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing and evaluating alternative self-supervised learning frameworks on the same datasets and language pairs

## Limitations

- Unknown contrastive ranking loss implementation details, including margin parameter value and exact training procedure
- GPU memory constraint of batch size 4 may limit model performance and scalability
- Effectiveness of LaSE as a quality metric may not generalize across all language pairs or domains

## Confidence

High confidence: The core claim that ConVerSum outperforms baselines on CrossSum and XLSUM datasets is supported by experimental results showing measurable improvements (LaSE scores of 0.4408 vs 0.3886 for mT5 baseline).

Medium confidence: The claim about robustness across language pairs and performance matching GPT-4o for low-resource languages relies on comparisons that may have different evaluation conditions.

Low confidence: The assertion that ConVerSum works without large-scale CLS training data is difficult to verify without knowing the exact scale of training data used in the experiments and how it compares to other approaches.

## Next Checks

1. **Margin Parameter Sensitivity**: Systematically vary the contrastive loss margin parameter (e.g., 0.1, 0.3, 0.5) and measure the impact on LaSE scores across different language pairs to determine optimal configuration.

2. **Candidate Diversity Analysis**: Quantify the diversity of generated summaries using metrics like n-gram overlap and semantic similarity between candidates. Compare mT5 vs Flan-T5 diversity to validate the paper's claim about candidate generation quality differences.

3. **Cross-Lingual Embedding Quality**: Evaluate the XLM-RoBERTa embeddings' ability to capture semantic similarity across language pairs by testing on parallel sentence pairs from different domains. This validates the assumption that cosine similarity in embedding space reliably indicates quality across languages.
