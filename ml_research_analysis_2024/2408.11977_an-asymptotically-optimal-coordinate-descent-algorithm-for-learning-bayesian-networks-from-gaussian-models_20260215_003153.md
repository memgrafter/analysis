# An Asymptotically Optimal Coordinate Descent Algorithm for Learning Bayesian Networks from Gaussian Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2408.11977
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11977
- Reference count: 31
- Key outcome: Proposed coordinate descent algorithm converges to coordinate-wise minimum and achieves optimal objective value asymptotically as sample size grows

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a coordinate descent algorithm to solve the ℓ0-penalized maximum likelihood estimation problem for learning Bayesian networks from continuous observational data generated by linear Gaussian structural equation models. The algorithm provides a computationally tractable approximation to an otherwise intractable problem, with theoretical guarantees showing convergence to a coordinate-wise minimum and asymptotic optimality as sample size increases. The method also establishes finite-sample statistical consistency guarantees, demonstrating that the estimated DAG converges to the true or minimal-edge I-MAP DAG in Frobenius norm.

## Method Summary
The method implements a coordinate descent algorithm (Algorithm 1) that iteratively updates a single parameter Γ_uv while keeping other coordinates fixed, checking DAG validity at each update. The input includes sample covariance ˆΣ, regularization parameter λ, super-structure graph Esuper, and positive integer C. The algorithm uses spacer steps to stabilize convergence by forcing updates on all currently active coordinates. The super-structure Esuper is estimated using graphical lasso, and λ is chosen via Bayesian information criterion. The method is implemented in the python package micodag and demonstrated on synthetic and real data.

## Key Results
- Algorithm converges to coordinate-wise minimum despite non-convex overall loss
- Objective value of coordinate descent solution converges in probability to optimal value as sample size tends to infinity
- Finite-sample statistical consistency established: estimated DAG is close in Frobenius norm to true or minimal-edge I-MAP DAG
- Numerical experiments show near-optimal solutions while being scalable to larger problems

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Coordinate descent updates converge to coordinate-wise minimum even though overall loss is non-convex
- Mechanism: Each iteration updates one parameter to exact minimizer under fixed other coordinates. Proposition 1 shows this update is exact and respects sparsity penalty. Strong convexity in each coordinate when others are fixed prevents objective increase. Spacer steps stabilize convergence by forcing updates on all active coordinates.
- Core assumption: Sample covariance matrix is positive definite, ensuring strong convexity in each coordinate update
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states convergence to coordinate-wise minimum; section proves strong convexity and boundedness below; corpus lacks relevant neighbors

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: As sample size grows, coordinate descent solution's objective value converges in probability to optimal value of ℓ0-penalized MLE
- Mechanism: Theorem 7 shows off-diagonal entries of ˆΓˆΓTˆΣ converge to zero except where true DAG has edges. Diagonal stays at one, so log det(ˆΓˆΓTˆΣ)→0, making objective approach optimal solution. Proof uses bounds on ˆΣ−Σ⋆ and structure of ˆE.
- Core assumption: True DAG satisfies faithfulness and beta-min condition so edge presence is detectable
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states asymptotic convergence; Theorem 7 and Lemma 10 provide concentration bounds; corpus lacks relevant neighbors

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Finite-sample statistical consistency holds: estimated DAG is close in Frobenius norm to true or minimal-edge I-MAP DAG
- Mechanism: Theorem 11 combines optimality gap bound from Theorem 7 with statistical error bound from Proposition 12 on optimal solution. Yields ∥ˆΓ−Γ⋆∥F=O(√(d²max m⁴ log m/n)). Sparsity penalty λ²=O(log m/n) balances bias and variance.
- Core assumption: Super-structure Esuper contains true edges and is not too dense
- Evidence anchors: Abstract states finite-sample consistency guarantees; Theorem 11 and Proposition 12 provide bounds; corpus lacks relevant neighbors

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Positive definite sample covariance
  - Why needed here: Ensures strong convexity of log-likelihood in each coordinate update, enabling exact minimization and convergence proofs
  - Quick check question: If ˆΣ has a zero eigenvalue, what happens to coordinate descent updates?

- Concept: Markov equivalence class (MEC)
  - Why needed here: True DAG only identifiable up to its MEC; consistency must be measured against correct equivalence class, not single DAG
  - Quick check question: How does ℓ0 regularization preserve equivalence class invariance compared to ℓ1?

- Concept: Beta-min condition
  - Why needed here: Guarantees true edges have signal strength above noise, ensuring they are not missed by sparse estimator
  - Quick check question: What is scaling of minimum absolute edge weight required for consistent recovery?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data -> (sample covariance ˆΣ, λ, Esuper, C) -> Coordinate Descent Loop -> Spacer Step -> Output (ˆΓ, MEC estimate)
- Critical path: Data preprocessing -> Covariance estimation -> CD initialization -> Iterative coordinate updates -> Spacer steps -> Convergence check -> Output
- Design tradeoffs: Exact coordinate minimization vs. speed (spacer steps add overhead but stabilize convergence); using superstructure vs. complete graph (restricts search but may miss true edges if chosen poorly)
- Failure signatures: Non-convergence (diverging objective values), support oscillation, or slow convergence; poor accuracy if Esuper too sparse or too dense
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Run CD-ℓ0 on small synthetic DAG (m=10) with known structure, verify convergence and compare to ground truth
  2. Test with sparse vs. dense super-structure to observe impact on runtime and accuracy
  3. Vary λ over {0.1, 1, 10}·√(log m/n) and plot dcpdag vs. λ to see bias-variance tradeoff

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What is the precise convergence rate of the coordinate descent algorithm?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper proves convergence but does not characterize speed of convergence
- Why unresolved: Theoretical analysis focuses on establishing convergence and asymptotic optimality but does not provide quantitative bounds on iterations required for given accuracy
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies measuring convergence speed across different problem sizes and parameter settings, or theoretical analysis deriving iteration complexity bounds

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can sample size requirement in Theorem 7 be relaxed while maintaining asymptotic optimality guarantee?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] Paper states "An open question is whether, in context of our statistical guarantees in Theorem 7, the sample size requirement can be relaxed"
- Why unresolved: Current theoretical analysis requires specific relationship between sample size n and number of nodes m (n/log(n) ≥ O(m² log m)) to establish finite-sample statistical consistency
- What evidence would resolve it: Either theoretical work proving asymptotic optimality under weaker sample size conditions, or empirical demonstrations that algorithm maintains good performance with smaller sample sizes

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does algorithm perform when super-structure Esuper is not strict superset of true edge set E⋆?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] Theoretical analysis assumes E⋆ ⊆ Esuper, but practical implementation uses graphical lasso to estimate moral graph as super-structure
- Why unresolved: Paper does not investigate algorithm's behavior when super-structure assumption is violated, which could happen in practice if graphical lasso fails to capture all true edges
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies comparing performance with different super-structure estimation methods, or theoretical analysis characterizing algorithm's behavior under relaxed super-structure assumptions

## Limitations

- Theoretical guarantees depend on multiple assumptions (positive definite covariance, sparsity, faithfulness, beta-min condition) that may not hold in practice
- Method requires estimated super-structure as input, introducing additional approximation layer not fully characterized
- Convergence to coordinate-wise rather than global minimum is expected but gap to true global optimum not quantified in finite samples

## Confidence

- **Coordinate descent convergence mechanism**: High - follows standard arguments for coordinate descent on strongly convex functions when other coordinates are fixed
- **Asymptotic objective value convergence**: Medium - rigorous proof under specific assumptions, but practical relevance depends on assumption validity
- **Finite-sample statistical consistency**: Medium - establishes consistency bounds, but rate depends on super-structure size and may degrade significantly if poorly estimated

## Next Checks

1. Test algorithm's behavior when sample covariance matrix has near-zero eigenvalues (by adding small noise or reducing sample size) to verify positive definiteness assumption's practical importance

2. Evaluate impact of super-structure estimation quality by comparing performance when using true moral graph versus various estimated versions from graphical lasso with different regularization strengths

3. Assess beta-min condition empirically by generating DAGs with varying minimum edge weights and measuring probability of correct edge recovery across different sample sizes
