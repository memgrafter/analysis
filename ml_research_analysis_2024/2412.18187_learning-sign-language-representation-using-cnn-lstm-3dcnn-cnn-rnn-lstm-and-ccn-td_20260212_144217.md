# Learning Sign Language Representation using CNN LSTM, 3DCNN, CNN RNN LSTM and CCN TD

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.18187
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18187
- Authors: Nikita Louison; Wayne Goodridge; Koffka Khan
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: 3DCNN achieved 91% accuracy on TTSL and 83% on ASL

## Executive Summary
This paper compares four deep learning architectures for sign language recognition from video data: CNN-LSTM, 3DCNN, CNN-RNN-LSTM, and CNN-TD. The study evaluates these models on Trinidad and Tobago Sign Language (TTSL) and American Sign Language (ASL) datasets, finding that 3DCNN outperforms other architectures with 91% accuracy on TTSL and 83% on ASL. Experiments were conducted on Google Colab using limited video datasets, focusing on model accuracy, loss, and resource usage for real-time sign language translation applications.

## Method Summary
The study implemented four neural network architectures using Keras and TensorFlow on Google Colab. Video preprocessing involved extracting 35 frames per sequence, converting to grayscale/color, and organizing into labeled folders with 80/20 training/validation splits. Models were trained with categorical cross-entropy loss, Adam optimizer, and 15-20 epochs with early stopping. Performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and resource usage metrics. The 3DCNN model was further tested on real-time sign translation to assess practical applicability.

## Key Results
- 3DCNN achieved highest accuracy: 91% on TTSL and 83% on ASL datasets
- CNN-TD showed surprising performance despite simpler architecture
- CNN-RNN-LSTM performed poorly due to excessive complexity for dataset size
- 3DCNN demonstrated superior speed and efficiency in real-time translation tests

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: 3DCNN outperforms CNN-LSTM and CNN-RNN-LSTM on spatio-temporal sign language datasets because it learns both spatial and temporal features simultaneously in a single network pass.
- Mechanism: 3DCNN applies 3D convolution kernels that convolve across both spatial dimensions (height, width) and temporal dimension (frames) in each layer, creating spatiotemporal feature maps that directly encode movement patterns without requiring explicit sequence modeling.
- Core assumption: The temporal patterns in sign language are sufficiently captured by local spatiotemporal convolution kernels without needing recurrent state.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "3DCNN algorithm was found to be the best performing neural network algorithm from these systems with 91% accuracy in the TTSL dataset and 83% accuracy in the ASL dataset."
  - [section] "The 3DCNN will be tested with feature learning, by extracting the local spatiotemporal features of sign sequences."
  - [corpus] Weak match - corpus neighbors discuss CNNs for NLP and gesture recognition but don't provide direct evidence for 3DCNN superiority in sign language translation.
- Break condition: If sign language patterns require long-range temporal dependencies that exceed the receptive field of 3D convolution kernels, or if the dataset contains signs with similar spatial patterns but different temporal execution.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: CNN-LSTM architecture achieves strong performance because it first extracts spatial features with CNN then models temporal dependencies with LSTM on frame sequences.
- Mechanism: CNN layers process individual frames to extract spatial features, then LSTM layers process the sequence of CNN feature maps to learn temporal dependencies between frames.
- Core assumption: Temporal dependencies in sign language can be effectively captured by processing frame sequences after spatial feature extraction.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The CNN-LSTM model used in this paper is the Convnet LSTM Model... This layer of the network is followed by the decision network which facilitates the classification and output."
  - [section] "Consider a model with a CNN on the input, LSTM in the middle, and MLP at the output that employs a stack of layers [46]."
  - [corpus] Weak match - corpus neighbors discuss CNN-LSTM for activity recognition but not specifically for sign language translation accuracy.
- Break condition: If the CNN feature extraction loses temporal information critical for sign discrimination, or if the LSTM cannot effectively learn dependencies from CNN-extracted features.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Time Distributed (CNN-TD) approach performs surprisingly well because it applies the same CNN to each frame independently while preserving temporal ordering.
- Mechanism: Time Distributed wrapper applies identical CNN operations to each timestep independently, then passes the sequence of CNN outputs to a dense layer for classification, maintaining temporal structure without recurrent connections.
- Core assumption: Sign language recognition can be achieved by processing each frame with the same spatial feature extractor while preserving temporal sequence.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Time-Distributed layer applies the same layer to several batch inputs, and it produces one output per input to get the result 'in time'."
  - [section] "Time distribution wrapping makes a CNN more suited for temporal datasets, however, it was unexpected for it out-performs the other models such as CNN-RNN-LSTM."
  - [corpus] Weak match - corpus neighbors discuss time-distributed approaches for temperature modeling but not sign language translation.
- Break condition: If sign language requires learning complex temporal transitions between frames that cannot be captured by independent frame processing with shared weights.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Spatio-temporal feature extraction
  - Why needed here: Sign language combines hand shapes (spatial) with movement over time (temporal), requiring models that can process both dimensions simultaneously.
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between 2D CNN and 3D CNN in terms of input processing?

- Concept: Sequence modeling with recurrent networks
  - Why needed here: Signs are dynamic gestures where meaning depends on the sequence and timing of movements, not just individual frames.
  - Quick check question: How does an LSTM cell maintain information across time steps differently than a standard RNN?

- Concept: Transfer learning and pre-trained models
  - Why needed here: The paper mentions using pre-trained Inception network and pre-built Keras models to reduce training time and improve performance on limited datasets.
  - Quick check question: What is the main advantage of using transfer learning when working with small datasets?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input preprocessing: Video capture → frame extraction → grayscale/color conversion → resizing → normalization
  Model variants: 3DCNN (single-pass spatiotemporal), CNN-LSTM (spatial→temporal pipeline), CNN-TD (frame-wise CNN with sequence preservation)
  Training pipeline: Dataset split → model compilation → epoch training → validation → confusion matrix generation
  Evaluation: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, resource usage monitoring

- Critical path:
  1. Video preprocessing (frame extraction and formatting)
  2. Model training with appropriate optimizer and loss function
  3. Validation and early stopping based on performance
  4. Testing with confusion matrix and classification reports

- Design tradeoffs:
  - 3DCNN: Highest accuracy but most parameters, better for small datasets with strong spatiotemporal patterns
  - CNN-LSTM: Good balance, requires more sequential processing but captures temporal dependencies well
  - CNN-TD: Simpler architecture, may overfit on small datasets, surprisingly competitive
  - Dataset size vs model complexity: Smaller datasets favor simpler models to avoid overfitting

- Failure signatures:
  - Overfitting: High training accuracy but low validation accuracy, especially with CNN-TD
  - Underfitting: Consistently low accuracy across all metrics, suggests model capacity issues
  - Data imbalance: Poor recall for signs with fewer training samples (e.g., "Punch-a-creme" in TTSL)
  - Resource exhaustion: 3DCNN using excessive GPU memory on limited hardware

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement CNN-TD baseline: Apply TimeDistributed(Conv2D) to 35-frame sequences, train with categorical cross-entropy
  2. Implement 3DCNN: Use Conv3D + MaxPooling3D layers, compare accuracy and resource usage to CNN-TD
  3. Implement CNN-LSTM: Use ConvLSTM2D layer followed by dense classification, evaluate on both ASL and TTSL datasets

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the 3DCNN model's performance change when trained on a significantly larger and more diverse dataset, including videos from multiple signers and varied environments?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors note that the 3DCNN model's performance was impacted by the limited and homogeneous dataset, suggesting that a larger and more varied dataset could improve results.
- Why unresolved: The study used a small dataset with limited variability, and the authors explicitly suggest that more diverse data could enhance model performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Training the 3DCNN model on a large, diverse dataset and comparing its performance metrics (accuracy, recall, F1-score) to those obtained in the current study.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of incorporating non-manual cues (e.g., facial expressions, upper body motion) into the neural network models on sign language recognition accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that sign languages use manual and non-manual cues, but the models primarily focus on manual gestures.
- Why unresolved: The current models do not explicitly incorporate non-manual cues, which are integral to sign language meaning and could enhance recognition accuracy.
- What evidence would resolve it: Developing and testing models that include non-manual cues as input features and comparing their performance to models that only use manual gestures.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the CNN-TD model's performance compare to other models when applied to real-time sign language translation with live video input?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors tested CNN-TD on a simulated real-time translation task and found it performed poorly compared to 3DCNN, but this was with pre-recorded video data.
- Why unresolved: The study's real-time simulation used pre-recorded video, not live input, which could introduce additional challenges and affect model performance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing CNN-TD in a real-time system with live video input and evaluating its translation accuracy and latency compared to other models.

### Open Question 4
- Question: What are the specific hyperparameters and architectural adjustments that could improve the performance of the CNN-RNN-LSTM model for sign language recognition?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors note that the CNN-RNN-LSTM model's setup was too complex for the dataset, leading to poor performance and high resource usage.
- Why unresolved: The study identifies the model's complexity as a limitation but does not explore specific adjustments or hyperparameter tuning to address this issue.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimenting with different hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size, number of layers) and architectural changes (e.g., reducing model complexity) to optimize the CNN-RNN-LSTM model's performance.

## Limitations
- Limited dataset size (162 videos total) constrains generalizability and prevents robust validation
- Only two sign languages tested reduces confidence in universal model superiority claims
- Google Colab resource constraints may have prevented optimal hyperparameter tuning
- Surprising CNN-TD performance lacks theoretical justification

## Confidence
- High confidence: 3DCNN achieving highest accuracy on both datasets (91% TTSL, 83% ASL)
- Medium confidence: Claims about real-time translation performance due to Colab hardware limitations
- Medium confidence: Resource usage comparisons given the variability in Colab GPU availability

## Next Checks
1. Test models on a larger, more diverse sign language dataset to verify 3DCNN superiority holds across different sign languages and vocabulary sizes
2. Conduct ablation studies removing temporal components from 3DCNN to determine if spatial features alone drive performance
3. Evaluate model performance on continuous sign language sequences rather than isolated signs to test real-world applicability
