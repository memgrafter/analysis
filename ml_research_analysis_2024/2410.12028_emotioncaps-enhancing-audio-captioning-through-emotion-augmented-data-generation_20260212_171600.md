# EmotionCaps: Enhancing Audio Captioning Through Emotion-Augmented Data Generation

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.12028
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12028
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: Emotion-enriched audio captioning models generate captions that better match emotional tone and achieve slightly better performance on standard metrics, though not generally preferred in subjective tests.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces EmotionCaps, a synthetic dataset of approximately 120,000 audio clips with captions that incorporate soundscape emotion recognition information. The authors develop a pipeline that estimates soundscape emotion using a trained model and instructs ChatGPT to generate captions augmented with predicted emotion information. They train audio captioning models using EmotionCaps alongside existing datasets and evaluate performance both objectively and subjectively. Results show emotion-enriched models better capture emotional tone and slightly improve standard metrics, but are not consistently preferred in subjective listening tests, suggesting users have varied preferences for captions.

## Method Summary
The authors train SVR models to predict valence and arousal from audio, discretizing these into eight emotion categories (eventful, un-eventful, pleasant, unpleasant, exciting, boring, quiet, chaotic). Using AudioSet SL ground truth event tags and predicted emotions, they instruct ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo with four prompt variations to generate emotion-augmented captions. Five audio captioning models are trained with HTSAT audio encoder and BART decoder: one baseline and four with different EmotionCaps subsets. Models undergo two-stage training (pretraining on combined datasets, then fine-tuning on target datasets) and are evaluated on AudioCaps and Clotho using standard metrics and subjective listening tests.

## Key Results
- Emotion-enriched models generate captions that better match the emotional tone of input audio
- Emotion-enriched models achieve slightly better performance on standard audio captioning metrics (METEOR, CIDEr, SPICE, SPIDEr, FENSE)
- Despite overall preference for ground-truth captions, 53% of the time an AAC model was preferred, with 12% preference for emotion-enriched models specifically

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Adding emotion qualifiers to audio event tags enables ChatGPT to generate captions that better reflect the emotional tone of the audio
- Mechanism: The emotion-augmented prompt provides additional semantic context that guides the language model to incorporate affective descriptors in the generated captions
- Core assumption: ChatGPT can effectively utilize discrete emotion labels when generating captions, and these labels meaningfully capture the emotional content of the audio
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "we explore the benefit of generating emotion-augmented synthetic audio caption data by instructing ChatGPT with additional acoustic information in the form of estimated soundscape emotion"
  - [section II]: "To express the emotion with language, we discretized each of the two-dimensional output vectors into one of 8 emotions... We discretized these intensities into emotion qualifiers based on percentile scores"
- Break condition: If ChatGPT cannot effectively incorporate the emotion labels into coherent captions, or if the emotion estimation model produces inaccurate or irrelevant emotion labels

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Emotion-enriched training data improves model performance on standard captioning metrics
- Mechanism: Training on emotion-augmented captions exposes the model to a richer semantic space, improving its ability to generate diverse and contextually appropriate captions
- Core assumption: The emotion information in the training data transfers to the model's understanding and generation capabilities, leading to better generalization
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The results show that emotion-enriched models generate captions that better match the emotional tone of the input audio compared to baseline models, and they also achieve slightly better performance on standard audio captioning metrics"
  - [section IV.B]: "the emotion-enriched models actually performed the best on average in stage 2, with the Emotion Addon model performing best on AudioCaps, and the Emotion Rewrite performing best on Clotho"
- Break condition: If the emotion information is too noisy or the models overfit to the synthetic emotion labels without improving genuine understanding

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Subjective preference for captions varies among users, and emotion-enriched captions satisfy some user preferences
- Mechanism: Different users have different preferences for how audio should be described, and some users prefer captions that convey emotional tone alongside factual descriptions
- Core assumption: Users have heterogeneous preferences for audio captioning style, and these preferences can be captured through subjective evaluation
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "the emotion-enriched models were not generally preferred in subjective listening tests, suggesting that users have varied preferences for captions"
  - [section IV.A]: "if we look at the distribution of rankings, we see that despite their overall preference, the ground-truth labels were not consistently ranked the best—53% of the time an AAC model was preferred, and more specifically 12% of the time an emotion-enriched model was preferred"
- Break condition: If all users consistently prefer either ground-truth captions or emotion-enriched captions, the hypothesis of varied preferences would be invalidated

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Soundscape emotion recognition and circumplex model of affect
  - Why needed here: Understanding how valence (pleasantness) and arousal (eventfulness) are measured and discretized into qualitative emotion labels is crucial for implementing the EmotionCaps pipeline
  - Quick check question: How are the continuous valence/arousal values mapped to discrete emotion categories like "chaotic" or "pleasant"?

- Concept: Automated audio captioning task and evaluation metrics
  - Why needed here: Knowing the AAC task definition, standard datasets (AudioCaps, Clotho), and evaluation metrics (METEOR, CIDEr, SPICE, SPIDEr, FENSE) is essential for implementing and evaluating the proposed approach
  - Quick check question: What are the key differences between AudioCaps and Clotho datasets in terms of audio duration and caption style?

- Concept: Large language model prompting strategies
  - Why needed here: Understanding how different prompt formulations (Scene-focused, Emotion Addon, Emotion Rewrite) affect ChatGPT's output is critical for the emotion-augmented data generation pipeline
- Quick check question: How does the Emotion Rewrite prompting strategy differ from the Emotion Addon approach in terms of instruction flow?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Audio → Emotion estimation → Caption generation (ChatGPT) → Training data creation → Model training → Evaluation

- Critical path: Audio → Emotion estimation → Caption generation (ChatGPT) → Training data creation → Model training → Evaluation

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using ground truth event tags from AudioSet SL vs. estimated tags from a sound event detection model (tradeoff between accuracy and generalizability)
  - Three different prompting strategies (tradeoff between simplicity and effectiveness)
  - Using synthetic data in combination with human-labeled data (tradeoff between data quantity and quality)

- Failure signatures:
  - Poor correlation between predicted emotion and actual audio content
  - ChatGPT generates irrelevant or incoherent captions despite emotion information
  - Models trained on emotion-enriched data perform worse on standard metrics than baseline models
  - Subjective evaluation shows no preference diversity among users

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Implement the emotion recognition model using the Emo-Soundscapes dataset and verify it produces reasonable valence/arousal predictions
  2. Test ChatGPT caption generation with emotion augmentation using a small subset of AudioSet SL clips and evaluate caption quality
  3. Train a simple audio captioning model on emotion-enriched data and compare performance to a baseline model on a validation set

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of EmotionCaps compare to other synthetic audio captioning datasets like WavCaps when evaluated on emotion-related metrics?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors compare models trained on EmotionCaps to WavCaps-like models but note that the emotion-enriched models were not generally preferred in subjective tests
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't provide a direct comparison of emotion-related performance between datasets
- What evidence would resolve it: Head-to-head comparison of emotion-enriched models trained on different synthetic datasets using both objective metrics (e.g., affect-focused evaluation) and subjective listening tests

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal balance between emotional content and descriptive accuracy in audio captions for different user groups?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors note that emotion-enriched captions were not generally preferred in subjective tests, and that users have varied preferences for captions
- Why unresolved: The study only used native English speakers from the United States, and the paper suggests that users may have different preferences
- What evidence would resolve it: Larger-scale subjective studies across different demographics, cultures, and accessibility needs to determine preferences for emotional vs. descriptive content

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can the EmotionCaps approach be extended to other modalities like video or music captioning while maintaining the benefits of emotional information?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors discuss the importance of emotional information in soundscape perception and its potential benefits for captioning
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses specifically on environmental sound captioning and doesn't explore other modalities
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments applying the EmotionCaps methodology to video or music captioning tasks, with evaluations of emotional content preservation and user preference

## Limitations
- The study relies on synthetic data generation through ChatGPT, introducing uncertainty about caption quality and diversity
- Subjective evaluation showed emotion-enriched models were not generally preferred, suggesting synthetic emotion labels may not align with human perception
- The evaluation protocol compared models to each other rather than to human-annotated emotion-enriched captions
- Ground truth event tags were used rather than estimated tags, not reflecting real-world deployment scenarios

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: The finding that emotion-enriched models perform better on standard captioning metrics (METEOR, CIDEr, SPICE, SPIDEr, FENSE) is supported by objective measurements and consistent across datasets.

**Medium Confidence**: The observation that user preferences vary and that emotion-enriched models are sometimes preferred is supported by subjective evaluation, but the synthetic nature of the emotion-enriched data and lack of comparison to human-annotated emotion captions limits the strength of this conclusion.

**Low Confidence**: The claim that adding emotion qualifiers to audio event tags enables ChatGPT to generate captions that better reflect emotional tone is questionable given that subjective evaluations did not show clear preference for emotion-enriched models.

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a controlled study comparing emotion-enriched captions generated by ChatGPT to human-annotated emotion-enriched captions to establish ground truth performance.

2. Implement the full pipeline using estimated rather than ground truth sound event tags to evaluate robustness to detection errors.

3. Design a larger-scale subjective evaluation with more diverse user populations and clearer preference elicitation methods to better understand user needs for emotional content in audio captions.
