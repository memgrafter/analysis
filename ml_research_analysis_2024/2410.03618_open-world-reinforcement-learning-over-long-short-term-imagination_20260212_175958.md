# Open-World Reinforcement Learning over Long Short-Term Imagination

## Quick Facts
- **arXiv ID**: 2410.03618
- **Source URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03618
- **Reference count**: 40
- **Primary result**: LS-Imagine achieves 80.63% success rate on harvest log in plains task vs DreamerV3's 53.33%, while requiring fewer steps per episode

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the fundamental limitation of existing visual RL methods that are "short-sighted" due to limited imagination horizons in high-dimensional open-world environments. The authors propose LS-Imagine, a model-based RL method that extends imagination horizons by combining short-term and jumpy long-term state transitions. The method uses affordance maps generated through image zoom-in and multimodal U-Net to identify task-relevant regions and simulate goal-conditioned jumpy transitions. Evaluated on MineDojo tasks, LS-Imagine significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods including DreamerV3, VPT, STEVE-1, Director, and PTGM, achieving up to 80.63% success rate on harvest log in plains task.

## Method Summary
LS-Imagine builds upon DreamerV3's world model approach but extends it with long-term imagination capabilities. The method generates affordance maps by zooming into specific areas of visual observations and using MineCLIP to score task relevance, then trains a multimodal U-Net for rapid affordance map generation. The world model learns both short-term and long-term transitions, with a dynamic jumping flag system that uses kurtosis of affordance maps to decide when to execute jumpy transitions. These long-term values are integrated into behavior learning using a modified bootstrapped λ-returns approach, allowing the agent to plan over extended horizons while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Key Results
- Achieves 80.63% success rate on harvest log in plains task vs DreamerV3's 53.33%
- Requires fewer steps per episode across all evaluated tasks
- Outperforms baselines (DreamerV3, VPT, STEVE-1, Director, PTGM) on all five MineDojo tasks
- Demonstrates consistent improvement across diverse tasks including resource gathering and tool use

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim**: The long short-term world model extends imagination horizon by combining short-term and jumpy long-term state transitions
- **Mechanism**: The world model learns to identify task-relevant regions through affordance maps and uses them to trigger jumpy transitions that bypass intermediate states and directly simulate future goal-oriented states
- **Core assumption**: Affordance maps can effectively identify task-relevant regions and that jumpy transitions preserve sufficient information to guide behavior
- **Evidence anchors**: [abstract] "LS-Imagine, which extends the imagination horizon within a limited number of state transition steps, enabling the agent to explore behaviors that potentially lead to promising long-term feedback"
- **Break condition**: If affordance maps fail to identify relevant regions or if jumpy transitions lose critical intermediate information needed for successful task completion

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim**: Affordance-driven intrinsic rewards provide effective long-term guidance beyond immediate environmental feedback
- **Mechanism**: The intrinsic reward function encourages the agent to move toward targets by rewarding positions where task-relevant objects are centrally located in the visual observation
- **Core assumption**: The affordance map accurately represents task relevance and that positioning targets centrally correlates with successful task completion
- **Evidence anchors**: [section] "We introduce the following intrinsic reward function: rintr t = 1/WH Σw,h Mot,I(w,h) · G(w,h)"
- **Break condition**: If the Gaussian positioning reward doesn't correlate with actual task success or if the affordance map provides misleading guidance

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim**: The dynamic jumping flag system adaptively switches between short-term and long-term imagination based on task progress
- **Mechanism**: The system calculates relative and absolute kurtosis of affordance maps to determine jumping probability, using a dynamic threshold to decide when to execute jumpy transitions
- **Core assumption**: Kurtosis of affordance maps is a reliable indicator of task-relevant target presence and that dynamic thresholds can adapt to task-specific characteristics
- **Evidence anchors**: [section] "To determine whether to employ long-term state transition, we use a dynamic threshold, which is the mean of the collected jumping probabilities at each time step, plus one standard deviation"
- **Break condition**: If kurtosis fails to accurately indicate target presence or if dynamic thresholds become unstable during training

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Model-based reinforcement learning with world models
  - **Why needed here**: The method builds upon DreamerV3's world model approach but extends it with long-term imagination capabilities
  - **Quick check question**: How does the world model predict future states and rewards without direct environmental interaction?

- **Concept**: Affordance maps for task-relevant region identification
  - **Why needed here**: The method uses affordance maps to guide exploration toward task-relevant areas and trigger jumpy transitions
  - **Quick check question**: How are affordance maps generated from visual observations and task instructions?

- **Concept**: Bootstrapped λ-returns for value estimation
  - **Why needed here**: The method uses a modified bootstrapped λ-returns approach to integrate long-term values from jumpy transitions into behavior learning
  - **Quick check question**: How does the modified λ-return formulation account for variable-length jumps in the imagination sequence?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: World model (short-term and long-term branches) → Behavior learning module → Environment interaction → Data collection → Affordance map generation
- **Critical path**: Affordance map generation → Jump flag determination → World model transition selection → Value estimation → Policy update
- **Design tradeoffs**: Sequential vs. parallel imagination pathways (Section C.3 shows sequential performs better)
- **Failure signatures**: Poor affordance map quality, unstable jump flag decisions, ineffective long-term value integration
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Test affordance map generation quality on sample observations with known targets
  2. Verify jump flag calculation produces reasonable probabilities for different affordance map configurations
  3. Validate world model can perform both short-term and long-term transitions correctly in isolation

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
The paper doesn't explicitly call out open questions, but several important limitations are noted:
- The method's performance may degrade in scenarios where MineCLIP has not encountered similar visual features
- Computational overhead of affordance map generation and multimodal U-Net inference is not fully characterized
- Generalization to domains outside MineDojo requires further investigation

## Limitations
- **Evaluation scope**: Limited to five specific MineDojo tasks without testing more complex, multi-stage scenarios
- **Computational overhead**: Requires additional computation for affordance map generation and multimodal U-Net inference
- **Generalization**: Performance in domains outside Minecraft or with different visual characteristics is untested

## Confidence
- **Performance claims**: Medium - substantial improvements shown but limited task diversity and comparison to other state-of-the-art methods
- **Core mechanisms**: Medium - theoretical framework is well-developed but empirical validation of individual components is limited
- **Implementation details**: Medium - key hyperparameters and architecture specifications provided but some environment-specific details unclear

## Next Checks
1. **Ablation study on intrinsic rewards**: Run LS-Imagine with and without the affordance-driven intrinsic reward component (setting α=0) to quantify its contribution beyond the existing MineCLIP reward.

2. **Kurtosis threshold sensitivity**: Test LS-Imagine with fixed vs. dynamic thresholds for jump flag decisions across all five MineDojo tasks to validate whether the dynamic threshold approach provides consistent benefits.

3. **Generalization test**: Evaluate LS-Imagine on at least two additional MineDojo tasks not included in the original evaluation to assess whether the method generalizes beyond the specific tasks presented.
