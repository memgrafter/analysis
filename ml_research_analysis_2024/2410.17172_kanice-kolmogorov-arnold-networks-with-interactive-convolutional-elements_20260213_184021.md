# KANICE: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with Interactive Convolutional Elements

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.17172
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17172
- Authors: Md Meftahul Ferdaus; Mahdi Abdelguerfi; Elias Ioup; David Dobson; Kendall N. Niles; Ken Pathak; Steven Sloan
- Reference count: 24
- Primary result: KANICE achieves 99.35% accuracy on MNIST and 90.05% on SVHN, outperforming baseline models

## Executive Summary
KANICE introduces a novel neural network architecture that combines Interactive Convolutional Blocks (ICBs) with KANLinear layers based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem. The model integrates adaptive multi-scale feature extraction with advanced function approximation capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple image classification benchmarks. The architecture demonstrates significant improvements in both accuracy and robustness to adversarial attacks compared to standard convolutional neural networks.

## Method Summary
KANICE integrates Interactive Convolutional Blocks (ICBs) and KANLinear layers into a CNN framework. ICBs perform parallel 3×3 and 5×5 convolutions with GELU activations combined via element-wise multiplication, creating an adaptive feature extraction mechanism. KANLinear layers replace standard linear layers by implementing learnable univariate functions based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. The model was trained for 25 epochs on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, EMNIST, and SVHN datasets with identical hyperparameters across all compared models.

## Key Results
- Achieved 99.35% accuracy on MNIST, outperforming CNN (97.45%), CNN_KAN (98.55%), ICB (98.25%), ICB_KAN (98.75%), and ICB_CNN (98.95%)
- Reached 90.05% accuracy on SVHN, surpassing CNN (87.85%), CNN_KAN (89.50%), ICB (89.20%), ICB_KAN (89.75%), and ICB_CNN (89.90%)
- KANICE-mini variant with 2,337,828 parameters achieved 90.00% accuracy on SVHN (nearly matching full KANICE's 90.05%) while using 10× fewer parameters
- Demonstrated enhanced adversarial robustness, maintaining 24.32% accuracy under FGSM attacks compared to 14.05% for standard CNNs

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: KANLinear layers enhance function approximation by replacing fixed linear weights with learnable univariate functions based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem
- Mechanism: Instead of learning a weight matrix W in standard linear layers, KANLinear layers learn a set of univariate functions φ that approximate any continuous multivariate function through composition
- Core assumption: The Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem is practically applicable to neural network layers for image classification
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "KANICE integrates Interactive Convolutional Blocks (ICBs) and KAN linear layers into a CNN framework. This leverages KANs' universal approximation capabilities"
  - [section] "KANLinear layers offer improved function approximation capabilities compared to standard linear layers. Based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, these layers can approximate any continuous multivariate function using combinations of single-variable functions"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus lacks direct studies on KANLinear layer performance in image classification
- Break condition: When the underlying data relationships cannot be approximated by univariate functions, or when the computational overhead of learning univariate functions outweighs the approximation benefits

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: ICBs provide adaptive feature extraction through multi-scale convolution and element-wise multiplication
- Mechanism: The parallel 3×3 and 5×5 convolutions with GELU activations are combined via element-wise multiplication, creating a feature-wise attention mechanism that emphasizes relevant features
- Core assumption: Element-wise multiplication of features from different scales captures meaningful interactions in image data
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "ICBs differ from standard convolutional layers by incorporating an interaction mechanism between various convolutional operations. This approach enables more flexible and context-sensitive feature extraction"
  - [section] "The interaction step combines their outputs through element-wise multiplication" and "acts as a feature-wise attention mechanism"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus lacks studies specifically validating ICB architecture effectiveness
- Break condition: When element-wise multiplication suppresses important features or when the additional computational cost of dual-path processing isn't justified by performance gains

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: KANICE's architecture balances local and global feature processing, enhancing robustness to adversarial attacks
- Mechanism: The combination of ICBs (local adaptive processing) with KANLinear layers (global function approximation) creates representations that are less susceptible to small, adversarial perturbations
- Core assumption: The interplay between local adaptive processing and global approximation creates more robust feature representations
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "KANICE demonstrated enhanced robustness to adversarial attacks... This robustness appears to stem from the interplay between ICBs' adaptive feature extraction and KANs' global function approximation"
  - [section] "FGSM perturbs the input in the direction of the loss gradient with respect to the input... KANICE maintained 24.32% accuracy, compared to 14.05% for standard CNN"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - corpus lacks comparative studies on adversarial robustness between KANICE and other architectures
- Break condition: When adversarial attacks exploit the specific weaknesses in either the local adaptive processing or global approximation components

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem
  - Why needed here: Provides the theoretical foundation for replacing linear weights with learnable univariate functions in KANLinear layers
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why the theorem guarantees that any continuous multivariate function can be represented as a composition of univariate functions and additions?

- Concept: B-spline basis functions
  - Why needed here: Used to implement the learnable univariate functions in KANLinear layers, providing a flexible yet computationally efficient representation
  - Quick check question: How do B-spline basis functions allow the network to learn complex function shapes through optimization of coefficients?

- Concept: Element-wise multiplication in neural networks
  - Why needed here: Forms the core interaction mechanism in ICBs, creating multiplicative feature attention
  - Quick check question: What is the mathematical difference between adding features from parallel convolutions versus multiplying them, and how does this affect the learned representations?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Input → ICB2D (3×3 and 5×5 parallel paths with GELU + element-wise multiplication) → Conv2D → BatchNorm2D → MaxPool2D → (repeat) → Flatten → KANLinear layers → Output

- Critical path:
  Feature extraction: ICB2D → Conv2D → BatchNorm2D → MaxPool2D (repeated twice)
  Classification: Flatten → KANLinear layers → Output
  The ICB2D layers are critical for capturing multi-scale spatial relationships early in the network

- Design tradeoffs:
  Parameter efficiency vs. function approximation power: KANLinear layers use fewer parameters than full KAN implementations but may sacrifice some expressiveness
  Computational overhead vs. adaptive processing: ICBs add computation but provide multi-scale feature extraction
  Model complexity vs. adversarial robustness: The combined architecture shows improved robustness but at the cost of increased architectural complexity

- Failure signatures:
  If KANLinear layers underperform: Training loss decreases slowly or plateaus, indicating insufficient function approximation capacity
  If ICBs fail to provide benefit: Accuracy doesn't improve over standard convolutions, or the model shows sensitivity to adversarial attacks
  If the architecture overfits: Training accuracy is high but validation/test accuracy is significantly lower

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Ablation test: Remove KANLinear layers and replace with standard linear layers to measure performance degradation
  2. Scalability test: Train on progressively larger datasets (MNIST → CIFAR-10 → ImageNet) to evaluate architecture limits
  3. Adversarial robustness test: Apply FGSM and PGD attacks at varying strengths to measure robustness compared to baseline CNN

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does KANICE's robustness to adversarial attacks compare to state-of-the-art defense methods like adversarial training or defensive distillation when evaluated on larger and more diverse datasets?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper demonstrates KANICE's improved resilience to FGSM attacks on CIFAR-10, showing better performance than standard CNNs and ICB-CNNs under various perturbation magnitudes.
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests on CIFAR-10 with FGSM attacks. There's no comparison to established defense mechanisms or evaluation on other attack types (e.g., PGD, Carlini-Wagner) or datasets.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comprehensive adversarial robustness testing of KANICE against multiple attack types and datasets, with direct comparison to state-of-the-art defense methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the exact mechanism by which the combination of ICBs and KANLinear layers improves adversarial robustness, and can this be mathematically characterized?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper hypothesizes that the adaptive feature extraction of ICBs and global function approximation of KANLinear layers contribute to robustness, but doesn't provide a rigorous mathematical explanation.
- Why unresolved: The paper suggests a theoretical framework but doesn't provide formal proofs or empirical analysis to validate the mechanism.
- What evidence would resolve it: Mathematical characterization of the decision boundary properties, formal analysis of gradient flow properties, and ablation studies isolating the contributions of ICBs and KANLinear layers to robustness.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does KANICE-mini's parameter efficiency scale with increasing dataset complexity and model depth compared to standard CNNs and the full KANICE architecture?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper demonstrates KANICE-mini achieves comparable performance to KANICE with 10x fewer parameters on SVHN, but doesn't explore scaling behavior on larger datasets or deeper architectures.
- Why unresolved: The ablation study only compares three model variants on four relatively small datasets, without exploring the limits of KANICE-mini's efficiency or its behavior in deeper networks.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic scaling experiments testing KANICE-mini on progressively larger datasets and deeper architectures, comparing parameter efficiency and performance against standard CNNs and full KANICE.

## Limitations

- The core mechanisms rely on theoretical foundations (Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem) that have limited empirical validation in image classification contexts
- The paper provides limited hyperparameter details necessary for faithful reproduction
- The claimed robustness to adversarial attacks needs verification across multiple attack types beyond FGSM

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: MNIST and SVHN accuracy improvements over baseline CNN

- **Low Confidence**: Theoretical claims about KANLinear layer function approximation, adversarial robustness mechanism explanations

## Next Checks

1. **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically vary learning rate, batch size, and KANLinear layer configurations to determine optimal hyperparameters and verify results aren't dependent on specific tuning
2. **Cross-Dataset Generalization**: Evaluate KANICE on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 to test scalability beyond the relatively simple MNIST/SVHN datasets
3. **Adversarial Attack Benchmarking**: Test against PGD, DeepFool, and Carlini-Wagner attacks to validate robustness claims across multiple attack methodologies and strengths
