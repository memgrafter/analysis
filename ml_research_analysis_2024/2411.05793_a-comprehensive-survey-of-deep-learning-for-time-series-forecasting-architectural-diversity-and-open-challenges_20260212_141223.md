- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05793
- Reference count: 38
- Primary result: Comprehensive survey categorizing deep learning TSF architectures and addressing key open challenges including channel dependency, distribution shift, causality, and feature extraction

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive overview of deep learning approaches for time series forecasting, examining the evolution from traditional statistical methods to advanced architectures including Transformers, MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, diffusion models, foundation models, and Mamba models. The authors systematically analyze the diversification of TSF architectures and identify persistent open challenges that continue to affect model performance across different approaches. By focusing on the inherent characteristics of time series data and mapping recent methodologies to specific challenges, the survey aims to lower entry barriers for newcomers while providing seasoned researchers with broader perspectives and new research opportunities.

## Method Summary
The survey conducts a systematic literature review of deep learning for time series forecasting, categorizing models by architectural type and analyzing their evolution from statistical methods through machine learning to modern deep learning approaches. The methodology involves collecting relevant papers from major conferences and journals, categorizing them based on their architectural principles, and synthesizing findings to identify key trends and open challenges. The authors focus on inherent characteristics of time series data and how different architectures address these characteristics, while also examining recent methodologies aimed at solving persistent challenges in the field.

## Key Results
- Comprehensive categorization of TSF models by architecture type (MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, Transformers, Diffusion, Foundation, Mamba)
- Systematic identification of open challenges including channel dependency, distribution shift, causality, and feature extraction
- Historical context tracing TSF evolution from statistical methods through ML to deep learning architectures

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The survey's comprehensive categorization of TSF models by architecture type provides a unified taxonomy that clarifies relationships and evolution among diverse models. By mapping each model to its core architectural principles and inductive biases, readers can understand why certain models excel in specific scenarios (CNNs for local patterns, Transformers for long-range dependencies, Mamba for efficient sequence modeling). This systematic categorization enables researchers to select appropriate architectures based on problem characteristics rather than trial-and-error experimentation.

### Mechanism 2
The focus on open challenges provides actionable insights for addressing real-world TSF problems. By identifying specific, recurring challenges and mapping recent methodologies to address them, the survey gives researchers concrete starting points for solving practical problems. This approach moves beyond simple model comparison to address fundamental issues that persist across different architectures, making the survey valuable for both newcomers and experienced researchers seeking to tackle persistent problems in TSF.

### Mechanism 3
The historical context tracing TSF from statistical methods through ML to deep learning helps readers understand the evolution of approaches and why certain limitations persist. By showing the progression of TSF methods over time, the survey helps readers understand why certain architectural choices were made and what limitations they were designed to address. This historical perspective prevents redundant research and helps researchers understand the rationale behind current architectural decisions.

## Foundational Learning

- **Time series data characteristics** (trend, seasonality, periodicity, non-stationarity, outliers)
  - Why needed here: Understanding these characteristics is essential for selecting appropriate models and preprocessing techniques in TSF
  - Quick check question: What are the three main components typically decomposed in time series data, and why is non-stationarity a challenge for forecasting models?

- **Model architecture strengths and weaknesses** (CNNs for local patterns, RNNs for sequential dependencies, Transformers for long-range dependencies)
  - Why needed here: Each architecture has specific inductive biases that make it more suitable for certain types of time series patterns
  - Quick check question: Which architecture would you choose for capturing long-term dependencies in a time series with clear seasonality, and why?

- **Evaluation metrics for time series forecasting** (MAE, MSE, CRPS, explained variance)
  - Why needed here: Different metrics capture different aspects of model performance, and choosing the right metric is crucial for model selection and comparison
  - Quick check question: When would you prefer CRPS over MAE for evaluating a probabilistic forecasting model?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Data preprocessing → Feature extraction → Model architecture → Training pipeline → Evaluation → Post-processing
- **Critical path**: 1) Understand time series data characteristics, 2) Select appropriate preprocessing, 3) Choose model architecture based on problem characteristics, 4) Implement training with appropriate loss functions and regularization, 5) Evaluate using relevant metrics, 6) Handle distribution shifts and channel dependencies
- **Design tradeoffs**: Model complexity vs interpretability, training time vs prediction accuracy, generalization vs overfitting, computational resources vs model size
- **Failure signatures**: Poor performance on out-of-distribution data (distribution shift problem), model doesn't improve with more data (overfitting or architectural limitation), high variance in predictions (uncertainty quantification issue), slow training/inference (computational efficiency problem)
- **First 3 experiments**: 1) Implement a simple moving average baseline to establish performance floor, 2) Test channel-independent vs channel-dependent strategies on a multivariate dataset, 3) Apply decomposition techniques (trend/seasonality separation) and compare model performance

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
Which architectural approach (Transformer-based, Mamba, or fundamental deep learning) will ultimately prove most effective for long-term time series forecasting across diverse domains? The paper acknowledges the diversification of architectures but does not definitively conclude which approach is superior. Systematic benchmarking studies across diverse time series datasets and forecasting tasks would help resolve this question.

### Open Question 2
How can time series foundation models be effectively developed given the unique challenges of time series data compared to other domains? The paper highlights challenges such as domain-specific characteristics of time series data, difficulties in collecting large-scale datasets, and lack of well-defined vocabulary compared to NLP. Successful development and evaluation of time series foundation models would provide answers.

### Open Question 3
What are the most effective methods for addressing distribution shift in time series forecasting, and how can they be integrated into different model architectures? While the paper presents various approaches (normalization-denormalization frameworks, domain adaptation, transfer learning, robustness techniques), it does not definitively conclude which approach is most effective. Comprehensive comparative studies would help resolve this question.

## Limitations
- May not fully capture recent preprints and emerging architectures that have not yet been peer-reviewed
- Relative importance of identified challenges may be domain-dependent and not universally applicable
- Claims about historical progression rely on selective citation patterns and may not capture all relevant developments

## Confidence
- **High**: The categorization of TSF architectures is well-established in the literature and represents a comprehensive taxonomy
- **Medium**: The identification of open challenges is supported by multiple papers, though relative importance may vary by application domain
- **Low**: Claims about historical progression and evolution of TSF methods rely on selective citation patterns

## Next Checks
1. Verify completeness of the architectural taxonomy by checking for missing model families in recent conference proceedings
2. Test generalizability of identified challenges by applying the survey's framework to diverse TSF applications (finance, healthcare, energy)
3. Validate proposed solutions for open challenges by implementing and benchmarking them on standardized TSF datasets
