# AI4EF: Artificial Intelligence for Energy Efficiency in the Building Sector

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2412.04045
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04045
- Reference count: 40
- One-line primary result: AI4EF is an AI-powered decision support tool for building energy efficiency, enabling stakeholders to model energy consumption, retrofit costs, and environmental impacts.

## Executive Summary
AI4EF is a modular AI-powered decision support platform designed to enhance building energy efficiency through predictive modeling and data-driven recommendations. The system integrates machine learning models with the European Energy Data Space to provide tailored insights for building retrofitting and photovoltaic installation assessment. Built on a microservices architecture, AI4EF leverages established open-source tools including Docker, PyTorch Lightning, Optuna, and Dagster to deliver scalable and maintainable workflows. The platform supports minimal data input requirements while maintaining compliance with European energy standards, making it accessible to stakeholders with limited building information.

## Method Summary
AI4EF employs a modular ML pipeline architecture where each component is independently deployable as a microservice. The system uses PyTorch Lightning for deep learning model training, Optuna for hyperparameter optimization, and Dagster for workflow orchestration. Data flows through an Ingestion → Training → Evaluation pipeline, with preprocessing handled by scikit-learn and Scipy. The platform integrates with the Enershare Data Space via verified IDS connectors to access real-time and large-scale datasets. FastAPI serves as the deployment framework, while Keycloak provides identity and access management. The system was tested using real-world data from the Latvian Environmental Investment Fund.

## Key Results
- AI4EF provides energy efficiency recommendations using minimal building data inputs, improving accessibility for non-expert users
- The platform integrates with the European Energy Data Space to access real-time data streams and ensure regulatory compliance
- Modular microservices architecture enables scalable deployment and adaptation to different regulatory contexts

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: AI4EF enables stakeholders to model energy consumption and retrofit costs with minimal data inputs, making it accessible for users lacking extensive building information.
- Mechanism: The platform uses machine learning models that are trained on historical data and can extrapolate from limited input features to predict energy savings and costs. By reducing the data requirements, AI4EF lowers the barrier to entry for non-expert users.
- Core assumption: Historical datasets used to train the models are representative of the diversity of building types and retrofit scenarios that users will encounter.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "AI4EF provides quick retrofit and PV recommendations using minimal building data, making it accessible to users with limited information."
  - [section 2.3.1] "Unlike other retrofitting tools [40, 36, 37, 41, 38], which require extensive input on building geometry, Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC), and other details, AI4EF offers initial insights with only a few key features."
- Break condition: If the training data lacks diversity or is biased toward certain building types, the model predictions may be inaccurate or misleading for underrepresented scenarios.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: AI4EF integrates with the European Energy Data Space to access real-time and large-scale datasets, improving model accuracy and compliance with EU standards.
- Mechanism: By connecting to the Enershare Data Space via a verified IDS connector, AI4EF can ingest real-time data (e.g., smart meter readings, building system outputs) to continuously update and refine its predictive models. This ensures the models reflect current energy usage patterns and comply with European data-sharing standards.
- Core assumption: The European Energy Data Space provides reliable, high-quality data streams that are relevant to building energy efficiency modeling.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "AI4EF is built on the Enershare Data Space [44], a core element of the European energy data ecosystem."
  - [section 2.1.2] "The link to Enershare Data Space also aligns AI4EF with European data-sharing standards, supporting secure, compliant data access for stakeholders in energy efficiency projects."
- Break condition: If data sharing agreements or privacy regulations restrict access to necessary data streams, the model updates may become incomplete or delayed, reducing accuracy.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The modular microservices architecture allows AI4EF to scale and adapt to different user roles and regulatory contexts.
- Mechanism: Each component (e.g., Building Retrofitting, Photovoltaic Installation, Training Playground) is independently deployable and can be updated or replaced without affecting the entire system. Role-based access via Keycloak ensures that users only see relevant functionalities, enhancing usability and compliance.
- Core assumption: The microservices are loosely coupled and communicate via well-defined APIs, preventing cascading failures when one service is updated or fails.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Its compatibility with open-source identity management (Keycloak) enhances security and accessibility, making it adaptable for various regulatory and organizational contexts."
  - [section 2.1] "The AI4EF platform is designed using Docker [47], with a modular microservices architecture to enhance scalability, maintainability, and functionality."
- Break condition: If the API contracts between services are not rigorously maintained, updates to one service could break dependent services, leading to system instability.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Docker and containerization
  - Why needed here: AI4EF uses Docker to package each microservice, ensuring consistent deployment across different environments and simplifying dependency management.
  - Quick check question: What is the benefit of using Docker Compose to orchestrate the multiple services in AI4EF?

- Concept: Machine learning model training and hyperparameter optimization
  - Why needed here: The Training Playground uses Optuna for hyperparameter optimization to find the best model configurations for predicting energy efficiency outcomes.
  - Quick check question: How does Optuna's pruning feature improve the efficiency of hyperparameter tuning?

- Concept: Data preprocessing and feature scaling
  - Why needed here: Scikit-learn and Scipy are used to clean, scale, and transform raw building data so that it is compatible with the ML models, ensuring accurate predictions.
  - Quick check question: Why is it important to fit scalers on the training data only and not the test data?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  Frontend -> Keycloak -> Backend Services -> Enershare Data Space
  React SPA dashboard -> SSO/RBAC -> Building Retrofitting, Photovoltaic Installation, Training Playground -> Data ingestion and storage

- Critical path:
  1. User submits building data via frontend
  2. Backend service preprocesses data and runs ML model
  3. Results returned to frontend and displayed to user

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Microservices provide scalability but increase operational complexity
  - Open-source tools reduce cost but may require more maintenance
  - Minimal data input improves accessibility but may reduce prediction accuracy

- Failure signatures:
  - Slow response times → Check backend service health and data preprocessing bottlenecks
  - Incorrect predictions → Validate data quality and model retraining schedules
  - Authentication errors → Verify Keycloak configuration and token validity

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Deploy all services locally using Docker Compose and verify frontend-backend communication
  2. Input a sample building dataset and confirm that predictions are returned within expected time
  3. Simulate a Keycloak outage and observe how the system handles unauthenticated access

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does AI4EF's modular microservices architecture handle scaling when multiple users simultaneously request complex ML model training workflows?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper describes a modular microservices architecture using Docker, Dagster for workflow orchestration, and mentions scalability as a design goal, but does not provide performance metrics or load testing results.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on architectural design rather than empirical performance evaluation under concurrent usage scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Load testing results showing response times, resource utilization, and throughput metrics when multiple users access the Training Playground service simultaneously.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the comparative accuracy and prediction reliability of AI4EF's energy consumption models versus traditional building energy simulation tools like EnergyPlus or OpenStudio?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions AI4EF's capabilities but does not provide comparative validation studies against established building energy simulation tools.
- Why unresolved: While the paper describes the tool's architecture and presents example inputs/outputs, it lacks empirical validation studies comparing its predictions to industry-standard tools.
- What evidence would resolve it: Validation studies comparing AI4EF's predictions against EnergyPlus or OpenStudio simulations using the same building parameters and energy consumption data.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does AI4EF ensure data quality and consistency when integrating heterogeneous data sources from the European Energy Data Space?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper describes integration with the Enershare Data Space and mentions data preprocessing steps, but does not detail data validation, cleaning, or harmonization procedures for diverse data sources.
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions data integration capabilities but lacks details on data quality assurance mechanisms for heterogeneous data sources.
- What evidence would resolve it: Documentation of data validation, cleaning, and harmonization procedures, along with examples of how the system handles conflicting or incomplete data from multiple sources.

## Limitations

- Model predictions may be inaccurate for building types or retrofit scenarios not represented in the training data
- Real-time data integration effectiveness depends on data-sharing agreements and privacy regulations
- Minimal input requirements may compromise prediction accuracy compared to tools requiring detailed building specifications

## Confidence

- High Confidence: The platform's ability to integrate with the Enershare Data Space and its use of established tools (Docker, PyTorch Lightning, Optuna, Dagster) are well-supported by the abstract and implementation details.
- Medium Confidence: The claim that minimal input data yields actionable recommendations is plausible given the modular ML pipeline but requires validation across diverse building types and retrofit scenarios.
- Low Confidence: The assertion that the system is "fully compatible with European Energy Data Space" is not independently verified in the provided evidence and may depend on external factors like regulatory compliance and data-sharing agreements.

## Next Checks

1. **Data Diversity Validation**: Test the platform's predictions on a dataset with diverse building types and retrofit scenarios not represented in the training data to assess generalization performance.
2. **Real-Time Data Integration**: Simulate a scenario where real-time data streams are incomplete or delayed and measure the impact on model accuracy and user recommendations.
3. **API Contract Testing**: Conduct stress tests on the microservices architecture by updating one service and verifying that dependent services continue to function without errors.
