# Toward end-to-end interpretable convolutional neural networks for waveform signals

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.01815
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01815
- Authors: Linh Vu; Thu Tran; Wern-Han Lim; Raphael Phan
- Reference count: 23
- Key outcome: IConNet achieves up to 7% higher accuracy than Mel spectrogram features on speech emotion recognition and 92.05% F1 on heart sound detection

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces IConNet, a novel CNN framework for end-to-end audio deep learning that processes raw waveform signals directly. The method uses FIR-based kernels with learnable window functions inspired by signal processing principles to extract meaningful features while maintaining interpretability. Experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements over traditional handcrafted feature approaches on both speech emotion recognition and biomedical signal classification tasks.

## Method Summary
IConNet employs a front-end architecture with FIR convolution kernels and learnable window functions to process raw audio waveforms. The network applies early band-pass filtering to reduce aliasing effects during downsampling, followed by NLReLU activation that mimics human auditory perception. The framework supports multiple front-end blocks that can be stacked or concatenated, with a classifier consisting of pooling layers and fully connected networks. The learnable windows adaptively adjust to signal profiles, enabling transparent frequency band selection and noise reduction.

## Key Results
- Outperforms Mel spectrogram features by up to 7% in accuracy and F1 scores on RAVDESS, CREMA-D, and IEMOCAP datasets
- Achieves 92.05% F1 score for abnormal heart sound detection on PhysioNet database, surpassing baseline CRNN by 2%
- Model sizes are approximately 30% smaller than traditional handcrafted feature approaches
- Visualization of learned frequency responses demonstrates interpretability and noise suppression capabilities

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: FIR-based kernels with learnable window functions outperform fixed filterbank designs in raw waveform audio classification.
- Mechanism: Adaptive window shapes allow the network to learn task-specific frequency responses, whereas traditional Mel/MFCC filterbanks are hand-crafted and fixed. The FIR structure ensures linear-phase filtering, preserving waveform timing while the learnable window provides flexible sidelobe control.
- Core assumption: The most informative spectral content for a task is not captured optimally by static filterbanks and can be improved by data-driven window adaptation.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The window functions adaptively adjust to varying signal profiles, enabling transparent frequency band selection and noise reduction."
  - [section] "The primary benefit of this approach is the transparency in the way the model learns – which frequency bands it focuses on and which will be cut off."
  - [corpus] Weak anchor: Similar papers discuss adaptive spectral filtering but none directly validate FIR with learnable windows against fixed filterbanks in the same dataset.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Early-stage band-pass filtering reduces aliasing effects during subsequent downsampling, improving classification accuracy.
- Mechanism: The FIR convolution kernels act as anti-aliasing filters before the downsampling layer. This prevents high-frequency artifacts from folding into the baseband during resampling, preserving meaningful signal features.
- Core assumption: Aliasing from high-frequency noise or resampling can corrupt lower-frequency information critical for classification, and can be mitigated by learned pre-downsampling filtering.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "It's worth noting that the convolution filters from the previous step also serve as anti-aliasing filters like traditional signal downsampling."
  - [corpus] Weak anchor: Related work on neural anti-aliasing is sparse; the claim is largely inferred from signal processing theory.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Log-scale activation (NLReLU) after filtering aligns the network's internal representation with human auditory perception, improving feature extraction for speech and bioacoustic signals.
- Mechanism: NLReLU mimics amplitude-to-decibel conversion, compressing dynamic range and emphasizing perceptually relevant differences in signal intensity, which traditional ReLU activations do not capture.
- Core assumption: Human perception of loudness and pitch is logarithmic, so aligning the network's activations with this scale improves learning efficiency for audio tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "In the second-to-last step, we use an NLRelu activation function recommended in [6] to mimic the amplitude-to-decibel conversion since human hearing functions on a logarithmic scale."
  - [corpus] Weak anchor: No corpus evidence of NLReLU performance; referenced from external paper [6].

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter design and window functions.
  - Why needed here: IConNet's front-end uses FIR kernels with learnable window shapes; understanding FIR properties (linear phase, stability) is essential to grasp how the model processes raw waveforms.
  - Quick check question: Why are FIR filters preferred over IIR filters in this architecture? (Answer: FIR filters have linear phase and are inherently stable, making them safer for interpretable, end-to-end learning.)

- Concept: Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and spectral leakage.
  - Why needed here: The paper contrasts IConNet with spectrogram-based methods; understanding how windowing reduces spectral leakage helps explain why adaptive windows improve performance.
  - Quick check question: What happens to frequency resolution if the window length is too short? (Answer: Frequency resolution degrades, causing spectral leakage and loss of discriminative features.)

- Concept: Anti-aliasing and downsampling in digital signal processing.
  - Why needed here: The IConNet uses convolution filters as anti-aliasing before downsampling; knowing how aliasing corrupts signals explains the design choice.
  - Quick check question: What is the minimum sampling rate required to avoid aliasing for a signal with maximum frequency f_max? (Answer: fs > 2 * f_max, per the Nyquist theorem.)

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Raw waveform -> FIR convolution with learnable window -> Downsampling -> NLReLU -> Local Response Normalization -> Classifier (Pooling -> FFN layers -> Output)
- Critical path: FIR conv -> downsampling -> NLReLU -> LRN -> classifier
- Design tradeoffs:
  - More kernels -> higher accuracy but larger model and training cost
  - Learnable vs. fixed bands: learnable improves adaptability but increases training instability
  - Early downsampling: reduces computation but risks losing high-frequency cues
- Failure signatures:
  - Low validation accuracy but high training accuracy -> overfitting; reduce kernel count or add regularization
  - High validation accuracy but poor interpretability -> window functions may be too flexible; constrain their parameter space
  - Model not converging -> check learning rate schedule and ensure input normalization
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare IConNet-W (learnable windows) vs IConNet-B (learnable bands) on a small subset of RAVDESS with fixed hyperparameters to verify window adaptation benefit
  2. Test anti-aliasing effect by disabling the FIR conv in the front-end and measuring accuracy drop after downsampling
  3. Evaluate NLReLU vs ReLU activation on the same model to quantify perceptual alignment gains

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

- Question: How does the interpretability of IConNet's frequency response visualizations translate to clinical decision-making in healthcare settings, and can this visualization capability be quantified in terms of improved diagnostic confidence?
- Question: What is the optimal balance between learnable window parameters and fixed frequency bands for different audio classification tasks, and how does this trade-off affect model performance across diverse domains?
- Question: How does IConNet's performance scale with larger datasets and more complex audio classification tasks beyond the emotion recognition and heart sound detection problems explored in the paper?

## Limitations

- Limited empirical validation of FIR learnable window mechanism's superiority over fixed filterbanks
- Anti-aliasing benefits inferred from signal processing theory rather than direct ablation studies
- NLReLU activation effectiveness cited from external reference rather than demonstrated within study

## Confidence

- FIR learnable window mechanism: Medium confidence
- Anti-aliasing benefit: Low confidence
- NLReLU perceptual alignment: Low confidence

## Next Checks

1. Implement ablation study comparing IConNet-W with fixed filterbanks (non-learnable windows) on RAVDESS to quantify the exact performance gain from adaptive windows
2. Create variant without the FIR front-end anti-aliasing convolution and measure classification accuracy degradation after downsampling
3. Compare NLReLU vs standard ReLU activations using identical model architectures and datasets to isolate perceptual alignment benefits
