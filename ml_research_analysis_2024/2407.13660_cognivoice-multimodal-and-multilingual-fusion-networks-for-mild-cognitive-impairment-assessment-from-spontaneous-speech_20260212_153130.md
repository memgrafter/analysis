# CogniVoice: Multimodal and Multilingual Fusion Networks for Mild Cognitive Impairment Assessment from Spontaneous Speech

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.13660
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13660
- Authors: Jiali Cheng; Mohamed Elgaar; Nidhi Vakil; Hadi Amiri
- Reference count: 0
- One-line primary result: CogniVoice achieves 2.8-point F1 improvement and 4.1-point RMSE reduction over baseline models for MCI detection and MMSE estimation

## Executive Summary
CogniVoice introduces a novel framework for detecting mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and estimating Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores from spontaneous speech using an ensemble multimodal and multilingual network. The approach extracts acoustic, linguistic, and speech features from both English and Chinese speech data, combining them through a Product of Experts (PoE) ensemble that mitigates reliance on spurious correlations. The model outperforms baseline approaches by 2.8 points in F1 score for MCI classification and 4.1 points in RMSE for MMSE regression, while effectively reducing performance gaps across different language groups by 0.7 points in F1 score.

## Method Summary
CogniVoice employs a multimodal and multilingual approach to MCI detection, extracting five categories of acoustic features via DisVoice (phonation, phonology, articulation, prosody, representation learning), speech features through Whisper encoder, and text features through language-specific BERT models. These features are fused through feed-forward networks and combined using a Product of Experts ensemble that dynamically adjusts training sample contributions based on uni-feature model confidence. The framework is trained on spontaneous speech data from elderly English and Chinese speakers describing pictures, using 10-fold stratified cross-validation with learning rate 1e-5 and L2 regularization λ=0.01 for 10 epochs.

## Key Results
- Achieves 2.8-point improvement in F1 score for MCI classification compared to baseline models
- Reduces RMSE by 4.1 points for MMSE regression tasks
- Effectively reduces performance gaps across different language groups by 0.7 points in F1 score

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Product of Experts (PoE) ensemble reduces reliance on spurious correlations by dynamically adjusting training sample contributions based on uni-feature model confidence
- Mechanism: When a uni-feature model is confident about a correct prediction, PoE increases the multi-feature model's confidence (reducing loss), while when a uni-feature model is confident about a wrong prediction, PoE creates a larger loss to increase sample weight in training updates
- Core assumption: Spurious features create confident but incorrect predictions in uni-feature models that can be identified and mitigated through PoE ensemble
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "ensemble multimodal and multilingual network based on 'Product of Experts' that mitigates reliance on shortcut solutions"

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Multilingual and multimodal feature fusion captures complementary diagnostic signals that monolingual models miss
- Mechanism: The framework extracts acoustic features (phonation, phonology, articulation, prosody, representation learning), speech features via Whisper encoder, and text features via language-specific BERT, then fuses them through feed-forward networks to capture interactions
- Core assumption: Different languages and modalities contain unique MCI indicators that are not captured by single-language or single-modality approaches
- Evidence anchors: [abstract] "extracts acoustic, linguistic, and speech features from both English and Chinese speech data"

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: PoE dynamically creates a curriculum that adaptively re-weights training examples based on model uncertainty
- Mechanism: Samples that cannot be accurately predicted using one modality receive larger loss contributions, forcing the model to focus on samples where spurious correlations are most problematic
- Core assumption: Dynamic re-weighting based on modality-specific performance gaps identifies the most informative training samples
- Evidence anchors: [section] "PoE dynamically adjusts the weight of training samples, which can be viewed as a dynamic curriculum that adaptively re-weights the contribution of each training example at every training iteration"

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Product of Experts ensemble
  - Why needed here: To mitigate overfitting to spurious correlations in small MCI datasets by combining predictions from models with different feature sets
  - Quick check question: How does PoE differ from simple averaging in ensemble methods, and why is this difference important for MCI detection?

- Concept: Multimodal feature extraction and fusion
  - Why needed here: MCI manifests through acoustic, linguistic, and speech patterns that are not fully captured by any single modality
  - Quick check question: What are the five categories of acoustic features extracted via DisVoice, and how might each relate to cognitive impairment?

- Concept: Multilingual model architecture
  - Why needed here: MCI assessment must work across language barriers, and language-specific encoders capture culturally-dependent speech patterns
  - Quick check question: Why use language-specific BERT encoders rather than a single multilingual BERT for both English and Chinese MCI detection?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Whisper speech encoder → BERT text encoder (language-specific) → DisVoice acoustic feature extractor → Feed-forward fusion network → Product of Experts ensemble with uni-feature models → Final prediction
- Critical path: Speech input → feature extraction → fusion → PoE ensemble → loss computation → backpropagation (gradient only through multi-feature model)
- Design tradeoffs: 
  - Pros: Captures complementary signals across modalities and languages, reduces overfitting through PoE
  - Cons: Increased computational complexity, requires careful synchronization of multiple feature streams
- Failure signatures:
  - Poor performance across all subgroups: Feature extraction or fusion failing
  - Disparate performance across language groups: Language-specific encoders not capturing language-dependent patterns
  - Degradation when PoE is added: Uni-feature models capturing similar spurious correlations
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test each feature type independently (acoustic only, speech only, text only) to establish baseline performance
  2. Test multimodal fusion without PoE to measure complementarity gain
  3. Test PoE ensemble with different combinations of feature types to identify most effective configurations

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the CogniVoice model perform on languages other than English and Chinese?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions that existing methods have significant performance disparity between patient groups of different languages, and CogniVoice can effectively reduce such performance gap by 0.7 point in F1. However, the paper only tests the model on English and Chinese languages.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide any results or analysis on the model's performance on other languages, making it unclear if the model's effectiveness generalizes to a wider range of languages.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments on additional languages and comparing the results with those of English and Chinese would provide insights into the model's generalizability across different languages.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the CogniVoice model handle code-switching or mixed-language speech?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions that the model uses multilingual features, but it does not explicitly address how the model handles situations where speakers switch between languages or use a mix of languages during speech.
- Why unresolved: Code-switching is a common phenomenon in multilingual communities, and it is essential to understand how the model performs in such scenarios.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the model on datasets containing code-switched speech and analyzing its performance would provide insights into the model's ability to handle mixed-language speech.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of incorporating additional linguistic features, such as syntax or semantics, on the model's performance?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions that the model extracts linguistic features from transcribed text, but it does not explore the potential benefits of incorporating more advanced linguistic features.
- Why unresolved: Incorporating additional linguistic features could potentially improve the model's performance, but it is unclear if the benefits outweigh the added complexity and computational cost.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments with different sets of linguistic features and comparing their impact on the model's performance would provide insights into the potential benefits and trade-offs of incorporating additional linguistic features.

## Limitations
- Small dataset size (387 samples across two languages) may limit generalizability
- Product of Experts ensemble mechanism lacks extensive empirical validation in the MCI detection context
- Multilingual aspect tested on only two languages, raising questions about scalability to other language families

## Confidence

- **High confidence**: The core methodology of multimodal feature extraction (acoustic, linguistic, speech) and the general framework of PoE ensemble for combining predictions
- **Medium confidence**: The specific implementation details of PoE and its effectiveness in reducing spurious correlations in this particular domain
- **Low confidence**: The generalizability of results to other languages beyond English and Chinese, and the real-world clinical applicability given the controlled experimental conditions

## Next Checks

1. **Ablation study on PoE effectiveness**: Conduct controlled experiments removing PoE to quantify its specific contribution to performance gains, and test whether the claimed spurious correlation mitigation actually occurs in practice.

2. **Cross-language generalization test**: Evaluate the model on a third language (e.g., Spanish or French) to verify that multilingual benefits extend beyond the two languages used in training, and assess whether language-specific encoders truly capture language-dependent MCI indicators.

3. **Clinical validation in real-world settings**: Test the model on spontaneous speech samples collected in typical clinical environments rather than controlled picture description tasks to assess practical utility and robustness to environmental noise and recording quality variations.
