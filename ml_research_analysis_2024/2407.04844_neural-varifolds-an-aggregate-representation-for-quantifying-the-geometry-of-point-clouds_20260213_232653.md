# Neural varifolds: an aggregate representation for quantifying the geometry of point clouds

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.04844
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04844
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Neural varifold representations achieve state-of-the-art few-shot shape classification on ModelNet40-FS and competitive performance on shape matching and reconstruction tasks

## Executive Summary
This paper proposes neural varifold representations for point clouds, extending the concept of varifolds from geometric measure theory to 3D surface analysis. The key idea is to represent surfaces as measures over both point positions and tangent spaces, capturing both macro-geometry and subtle geometric details. The authors develop two neural tangent kernel-based algorithms (NTK1 and NTK2) to compute varifold norms between point clouds. They evaluate their approach on three tasks: shape matching, few-shot shape classification, and shape reconstruction, demonstrating superior or competitive performance compared to existing methods.

## Method Summary
The method represents surfaces as measures over a product space of point positions and oriented tangent planes (Grassmannian), forming a varifold structure. Neural tangent kernels are computed in closed form for both position and Grassmannian components separately (NTK1) or jointly (NTK2). The varifold norm between point clouds is then computed using these kernels. For shape matching, MLP networks are trained to deform source shapes into targets using varifold-based losses. For few-shot classification, kernel ridge regression with neural varifold kernels is applied. For shape reconstruction, kernel regression reconstructs surfaces from point clouds. The approach leverages the theoretical guarantees of varifolds while using neural networks for expressive power.

## Key Results
- State-of-the-art few-shot shape classification on ModelNet40-FS benchmark, outperforming Prototypical Net, Relation Net, PointBERT, and PCIA
- Superior shape matching performance compared to Chamfer distance, Earth Mover's distance, and Charon-Trouvé varifold norm
- Competitive shape reconstruction quality with methods like SIREN and neural splines
- Neural varifold representation effectively combines positional and tangent plane information to capture both macro-geometry and subtle geometric details

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- **Claim:** Neural varifolds improve shape matching by combining positional and tangent plane information into a single measure over a product space.
- **Mechanism:** Varifolds represent surfaces as measures over both point positions and oriented tangent planes. This captures macro-geometry through manifold discrimination and subtle geometric details due to the combined product space. The neural tangent kernel computes similarity by aggregating information from both components, either separately (NTK1) or jointly (NTK2).
- **Core assumption:** The product space representation preserves geometric fidelity better than treating position and normal separately or ignoring normals entirely.
- **Evidence anchors:** [abstract] "varifold representation quantifies not only the surface geometry of point clouds through the manifold-based discrimination, but also subtle geometric consistencies on the surface due to the combined product space"
- **Break condition:** If the tangent plane estimation is noisy or incorrect, the product space representation could introduce errors that degrade performance rather than improve it.

### Mechanism 2
- **Claim:** Neural tangent kernels provide a closed-form similarity metric that scales to infinite-width networks without overfitting on small datasets.
- **Mechanism:** When network width approaches infinity, the neural tangent kernel converges to a deterministic kernel that captures the function space of the network. This kernel can be computed recursively layer-by-layer without training. For shape classification with few samples, this kernel-based approach avoids the overfitting that would occur with finite-width networks.
- **Core assumption:** The neural tangent kernel converges to the expected kernel and provides a good approximation of the function space for the task.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section] "Under random initialisation of the parameters θ, H(0) converges in probability to a deterministic kernel H ∗ – the 'neural tangent kernel' (i.e., NTK)"
- **Break condition:** If the network architecture deviates significantly from fully connected networks with ReLU activations, the closed-form NTK computation may not apply.

### Mechanism 3
- **Claim:** The varifold norm computation using neural tangent kernels is computationally efficient compared to other geometric similarity metrics for shape matching.
- **Mechanism:** By computing positional and Grassmannian kernels separately (NTK1) or jointly (NTK2) using closed-form expressions, varifold norms avoid expensive optimization steps required by EMD or CT with RBF kernels. The aggregation by summation/average reduces the Gram matrix size from n×n×m×m to n×n.
- **Core assumption:** The closed-form NTK computation is significantly faster than iterative optimization methods for computing other similarity metrics.
- **Evidence anchors:** [section] "Kernel-based learning is known for its quadratic computational complexity. However, NTK1 and NTK2 are computationally competitive"
- **Break condition:** If the point cloud size grows very large, the quadratic complexity of kernel methods may still become prohibitive despite being more efficient than alternatives.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept:** Rectifiable varifolds and their measure-theoretic foundation
  - Why needed here: Understanding how varifolds generalize differentiable manifolds to non-smooth surfaces is essential for grasping why combining position and tangent planes provides better geometric representation
  - Quick check question: What distinguishes a rectifiable varifold from a general varifold in terms of its support and multiplicity function?

- **Concept:** Neural tangent kernel theory and its closed-form computation
  - Why needed here: The entire method relies on computing varifold norms using NTKs rather than training networks, so understanding the recursive computation of covariance and derivative covariance matrices is crucial
  - Quick check question: How does the derivative covariance matrix ˙Σ(h) relate to the neural tangent kernel computation at each layer?

- **Concept:** Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and positive definite kernels
  - Why needed here: The varifold norm is defined in the RKHS associated with the product kernel, and understanding positive definiteness ensures the mathematical validity of the similarity metric
  - Quick check question: What property must a kernel satisfy to guarantee that the associated RKHS is continuously embedded in the space of continuous functions?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map:** Input point clouds → NTK1/NTK2 computation → Varifold norm aggregation → Output similarity score or classification prediction
- **Critical path:** Point cloud preprocessing (sampling points and normals) → NTK kernel computation → Varifold norm calculation → Task-specific application (matching, classification, or reconstruction)
- **Design tradeoffs:** NTK1 computes kernels separately for position and normals then multiplies (theoretically grounded but more computationally expensive) vs NTK2 computes a single kernel on concatenated features (computationally cheaper but loses explicit separation)
- **Failure signatures:** Poor shape matching results when tangent plane estimation is inaccurate; classification performance degradation when using NTK without pre-trained features; shape reconstruction artifacts when normals are incorrectly assigned on voxel grids
- **First 3 experiments:**
  1. Implement NTK1 computation for a simple point cloud pair and verify varifold norm matches expected values
  2. Compare shape matching results using NTK1 vs Chamfer distance on synthetic point clouds with known transformations
  3. Evaluate few-shot classification performance using NTK1 on a small subset of ModelNet40 to verify the kernel-based approach works before scaling up

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the performance of neural varifold methods scale with increasing point cloud resolution and size?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that kernel-based approaches have quadratic computational complexity and that the authors used fixed numbers of points (512, 1024, 2048) in their experiments.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't explore how the methods perform with varying point cloud densities or sizes beyond the fixed values tested. The computational complexity mentioned suggests potential scaling challenges.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic experiments varying point cloud resolution and size, measuring both accuracy and computational time, would reveal the scaling behavior of neural varifold methods.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How would more advanced point cloud architectures (beyond PointNet) affect the performance of neural varifold representations?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors explicitly state "it is based on the simpler PointNet architecture. Future research should explore its performance with more advanced architectures like graph convolutions or voxelised point clouds."
- Why unresolved: The current implementation is limited to PointNet, and the paper acknowledges this as a limitation without exploring alternatives.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing neural varifold methods using architectures like DGCNN, PointCNN, or graph-based networks, then comparing their performance to the PointNet-based approach.

### Open Question 3
- Question: Can kernel approximation methods like Nystrom approximation effectively reduce the computational complexity of neural varifold methods while maintaining accuracy?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention "Kernel approximation methods, such as Nystrom approximation, could reduce this complexity, and their performance compared to exact kernels should be evaluated."
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies this as a potential solution to the computational complexity problem but doesn't implement or evaluate such methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementing Nystrom approximation or other kernel approximation techniques for neural varifold methods and comparing their accuracy and computational efficiency against the exact kernel approach.

## Limitations
- The method relies on accurate tangent plane estimation, which can be challenging in noisy real-world data
- Current implementation is limited to PointNet architecture, with potential for improvement using more advanced point cloud networks
- Computational complexity is quadratic in the number of points, which may limit scalability to very large point clouds

## Confidence
- High confidence in theoretical framework connecting varifolds to neural tangent kernels
- Medium confidence in empirical performance claims for few-shot classification
- Low confidence in computational efficiency claims compared to alternatives

## Next Checks
1. Implement ablation studies varying point cloud sampling density and tangent plane estimation quality to quantify robustness
2. Conduct runtime benchmarking comparing neural varifold computation against Chamfer distance, EMD, and CT across varying point cloud sizes
3. Test performance on noisy real-world datasets (e.g., ScanNet) where normal estimation is challenging and compare against baseline methods
