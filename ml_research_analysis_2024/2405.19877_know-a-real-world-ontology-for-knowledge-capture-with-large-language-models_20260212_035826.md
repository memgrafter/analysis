# KNOW: A Real-World Ontology for Knowledge Capture with Large Language Models

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2405.19877
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19877
- Reference count: 1
- Authors: Arto Bendiken
- Primary result: Presents first ontology designed to capture everyday human knowledge for augmenting LLMs in real-world AI applications

## Executive Summary
KNOW presents a novel ontology specifically designed to capture everyday human knowledge for augmenting large language models in real-world AI applications. The ontology focuses on established human universals—primarily spacetime concepts (places, events) and social concepts (people, groups, organizations)—with pragmatic inclusion criteria based on universality and utility. The authors position KNOW as a bridge between large language models and knowledge graphs in the emerging neuro-symbolic AI synthesis.

The paper contrasts KNOW with previous ontologies like Schema.org and Cyc, noting that LLMs have already encoded much commonsense knowledge that previously required decades to capture manually. To promote adoption and ease of use, the authors provide code-generated software libraries for 12 popular programming languages, emphasizing simplicity and developer experience to enable direct use of ontology concepts in software engineering.

## Method Summary
The methodology centers on developing a practical ontology through pragmatic selection criteria rather than exhaustive knowledge representation. The authors focus on universally recognized human concepts—spacetime and social domains—while deliberately excluding niche or domain-specific knowledge. They provide implementation through generated software libraries across multiple programming languages to facilitate real-world adoption. The approach emphasizes developer experience and AI interoperability over comprehensive theoretical coverage.

## Key Results
- KNOW is positioned as the first ontology designed specifically for LLM augmentation with everyday human knowledge
- Focuses on established human universals: spacetime (places, events) and social concepts (people, groups, organizations)
- Provides generated software libraries for 12 popular programming languages to enable direct integration in software engineering

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
The ontology's effectiveness stems from its focus on universally recognized human concepts that align with both human cognition and the knowledge already encoded in large language models. By concentrating on spacetime and social domains, KNOW captures the foundational knowledge that humans use to navigate the world and interact with each other. The pragmatic inclusion criteria ensure that only universally applicable and practically useful concepts are included, avoiding the complexity and ambiguity that plagued earlier ontologies like Cyc.

The approach works because it recognizes that LLMs have already internalized much of the commonsense knowledge that previously required manual encoding. KNOW serves as a structured framework that complements this implicit knowledge with explicit, interoperable representations. The emphasis on simplicity and developer experience addresses key barriers to adoption that have limited previous ontology projects.

## Foundational Learning
1. Neuro-symbolic AI synthesis - Understanding how neural networks (LLMs) and symbolic systems (ontologies) can complement each other; needed to grasp KNOW's positioning in the AI landscape; quick check: can explain how KNOW bridges these paradigms
2. Knowledge graph interoperability - How different knowledge representation systems can work together; needed to understand KNOW's practical applications; quick check: can identify integration patterns between KNOW and existing knowledge bases
3. Commonsense knowledge encoding - The distinction between explicit and implicit knowledge representation; needed to appreciate why LLMs have changed the ontology landscape; quick check: can explain what knowledge LLMs have already captured
4. Pragmatic ontology design - Selection criteria based on utility rather than completeness; needed to understand KNOW's inclusion philosophy; quick check: can articulate the difference between KNOW and exhaustive ontologies
5. Developer experience in ontology adoption - How ease of use affects real-world implementation; needed to understand KNOW's approach to software libraries; quick check: can describe the 12 programming language support
6. Human universals in knowledge representation - Identifying concepts that transcend cultural boundaries; needed to grasp KNOW's scope limitations; quick check: can list the core domains KNOW covers

## Architecture Onboarding

Component map: User applications -> KNOW ontology -> LLM integration -> Knowledge graph storage

Critical path: Application developers define knowledge structures using KNOW concepts → These structures are populated with data → The structured knowledge augments LLM prompts or responses → Results are stored in interoperable knowledge graphs

Design tradeoffs:
- Simplicity vs. completeness: KNOW prioritizes practical utility over exhaustive coverage
- Universality vs. specificity: Focuses on human universals while potentially missing domain-specific needs
- Developer experience vs. theoretical rigor: Emphasizes ease of use over academic comprehensiveness

Failure signatures:
- Knowledge gaps when dealing with culturally specific concepts outside human universals
- Performance limitations when handling complex domain-specific reasoning
- Integration challenges when mapping between KNOW and existing specialized ontologies

First experiments:
1. Implement a simple knowledge capture application using KNOW concepts for a common social scenario
2. Compare LLM response quality with and without KNOW-based knowledge augmentation
3. Test interoperability by mapping KNOW concepts to an existing knowledge graph system

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out
None

## Limitations
- Narrow focus on spatiotemporal and social concepts may exclude important knowledge domains
- Pragmatic inclusion criteria may introduce Western-centric bias in defining human universals
- Limited empirical validation of real-world adoption rates and performance improvements

## Confidence
- Universality and utility claims: Medium - supported by comparisons but lacking systematic quantification
- LLM knowledge encoding assertion: Medium - observable trends but no systematic measurement
- Neuro-symbolic bridge positioning: Medium - conceptually sound but forward-looking vision
- Software library effectiveness: Medium - provided but lacking real-world integration metrics

## Next Checks
1. Conduct a longitudinal study tracking actual adoption rates of KNOW in real-world AI applications over 12-18 months, measuring both integration success and developer satisfaction metrics
2. Perform systematic benchmarking comparing LLM performance with and without KNOW-based knowledge graph augmentation across diverse application domains
3. Execute cross-cultural validation studies to assess whether KNOW's universality criteria hold across non-Western contexts and whether the ontology adequately captures knowledge important to diverse populations
