- Automated dataset augmentation reduces bias in LLMs by replacing biased terms with alternatives and expanding context

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of reducing bias in large language models (LLMs), particularly in restricted industries with limited data. The authors propose an automated dataset augmentation method that uses bias producers (broad categories like ethnicity) and biasers (specific examples like race categories) to generate new, less biased training data. They introduce two novel metrics: the db-index for quantifying dataset bias and the mb-index for quantifying model bias. The approach involves replacing biasers with alternatives, upsampling and downsampling text entries, and fine-tuning LLMs on the augmented datasets. Results demonstrate that the method effectively reduces dataset bias and improves LLM performance as measured by lower perplexity and stereotype scores.

## Method Summary
The method uses automated dataset augmentation to mitigate bias by employing bias producers (broad categories of bias) and biasers (specific examples within those categories). For each dataset entry containing a biaser, the system creates copies with the biaser replaced by other members of the biaser set. The augmented entries undergo content morphism through upsampling (contextual word embedding sentence augmentation) and downsampling (short summary generation) to capture diverse linguistic patterns. Two new metrics are introduced: db-index measures dataset bias using cosine similarity with a comparison dataset, and mb-index quantifies model bias using perplexity × stereotype score / dataset size. LLaMa 13b Chat models are fine-tuned using QLoRA on original and augmented datasets, with performance evaluated using perplexity, stereotype scores, and the proposed bias metrics.

## Key Results
- Augmented datasets showed lower db-indices, indicating reduced dataset bias
- LLMs fine-tuned on augmented data exhibited lower perplexity and stereotype scores compared to those trained on original data
- The mb-index successfully captured both model perplexity and stereotype propensity in a single metric

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Dataset augmentation using bias producers reduces db-index.
- Mechanism: For each biaser term, create a copy of the original text entry with the biaser replaced by another member of the biaser set, then expand the dataset. This creates synthetic examples that break the direct association between the original biaser and the context.
- Core assumption: The biaser set is large enough to provide meaningful semantic variation without introducing new biases.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We explore automated dataset augmentation to mitigate bias, using the concept of a bias producer to describe broad creators of bias, such as ethnicity or sexuality and biasers that serve as specific examples."
  - [section] "Each entry in the dataset is then swept for members of a bias producer. When the first biaser is met, the entry is recopied, and the biaser is changed with another member of the set."
  - [corpus] Weak; no direct corpus citations, but conceptually consistent with known augmentation literature.
- Break condition: If the biaser set is too small, or if biasers are too semantically distant, the synthetic examples may not be realistic, causing model degradation.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Upshifting and downshifting augment dataset quality.
- Mechanism: Upshifting adds context via sentence augmentation; downshifting creates short summaries. Both capture different linguistic aspects of human language and improve model generalization.
- Core assumption: Contextual embeddings preserve the semantic meaning while altering surface form.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "After this, each entry undergoes content morphism, where each entry is upshifted through contextual word embedding sentence augmentation and downshifted to a short summary to better capture human language."
  - [section] "Both are then added to the dataset."
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence; assumption drawn from embedding literature.
- Break condition: If augmentation alters core meaning, downstream model performance will degrade.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: mb-index captures both perplexity and stereotype propensity.
- Mechanism: mb-index = perplexity × stereotype score / |dataset|. Lower values indicate less bias and better performance.
- Core assumption: Perplexity correlates with model generalization; stereotype score captures bias in generated continuations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We additionally create two new additional metrics, the mb-index and db-index, to quantify bias, considering the idea that bias occurs due to both intrinsic model architecture and dataset."
  - [section] "Formally, given a dataset d, perplexity p(d), stereotype score s(d), mb-index is defined as: p(d) ∗ s(d) / |d|"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus support; metric is novel in this paper.
- Break condition: If perplexity and stereotype score are not independent, the product metric may misrepresent bias.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cosine similarity for bias quantification.
  - Why needed here: db-index uses cosine similarity between dataset entries and comparison dataset entries to measure bias.
  - Quick check question: What range of values can cosine similarity take, and what do extreme values represent?

- Concept: K-means clustering for dataset segmentation.
  - Why needed here: db-index calculation clusters dataset entries to compute bias per cluster before averaging.
  - Quick check question: What effect does the choice of k have on bias measurement accuracy?

- Concept: Perplexity as a performance metric.
  - Why needed here: mb-index incorporates perplexity to measure model generalization.
  - Quick check question: How does perplexity relate to model fluency and bias?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Dataset augmentation → db-index calculation → LLM fine-tuning → mb-index evaluation
- Critical path: Dataset augmentation (biaser replacement) → db-index calculation → LLM fine-tuning on augmented dataset → mb-index evaluation
- Design tradeoffs: Using biasers to augment increases dataset size but may introduce noise if biasers are too far from original context. Upshifting/downshifting adds diversity but risks semantic drift.
- Failure signatures: High db-index after augmentation (augmentation ineffective); high mb-index (model still biased); low perplexity but high stereotype score (model fluent but biased)
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Validate biaser replacement preserves semantics by human evaluation on a subset.
  2. Measure db-index change after augmentation on a small, biased dataset.
  3. Fine-tune a small LLM on augmented vs original dataset and compare mb-index.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How effective is the db-index metric in capturing bias for datasets of vastly different sizes and structures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions limitations due to the datasets used having tens of thousands of records and suggests it would be beneficial to assess the db-index for larger datasets with millions of records.
- Why unresolved: The db-index was only tested on datasets with tens of thousands of records. Its performance on significantly larger or differently structured datasets remains unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Testing the db-index on datasets of various sizes and structures, particularly those with millions of records, and comparing the results to smaller datasets.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Does the effectiveness of the automated dataset augmentation method scale with the size of the LLM being fine-tuned?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that the LLMs fine-tuned were medium-sized (13 billion parameters) and suggests it would be beneficial to see larger LLMs (70 billion parameters or more) being fine-tuned on augmented datasets.
- Why unresolved: The augmentation method was only tested on medium-sized LLMs. Its effectiveness on larger LLMs is unknown.
- What evidence would resolve it: Fine-tuning larger LLMs (70 billion parameters or more) on datasets augmented using the proposed method and comparing the results to medium-sized LLMs.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the proposed automated dataset augmentation method compare to other debiasing techniques, such as those using human annotators or external unbiased text?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that most approaches in the literature rely on human annotators, which can introduce bias, and suggests the proposed method eliminates the need for annotation.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not provide a direct comparison between the proposed method and other debiasing techniques.
- What evidence would resolve it: Conducting experiments comparing the proposed automated dataset augmentation method to other debiasing techniques, such as those using human annotators or external unbiased text, and evaluating their effectiveness in reducing bias.

## Limitations

- The specific comparison dataset used for db-index calculation is not specified, making it difficult to assess bias quantification validity
- The evaluation relies on novel internal metrics (db-index, mb-index) without external validation against established bias benchmarks
- The augmentation method was only tested on two small datasets (10 and 50 elements) and medium-sized LLMs (13 billion parameters)

## Confidence

**High Confidence Claims:**
- Dataset augmentation using biaser replacement is technically feasible and can increase dataset size
- The db-index and mb-index are mathematically well-defined metrics
- Fine-tuning LLaMa 13b with QLoRA on augmented datasets is a valid experimental approach

**Medium Confidence Claims:**
- The proposed augmentation method reduces dataset bias as measured by db-index
- Fine-tuning on augmented datasets improves model performance (lower perplexity, stereotype scores)
- The mb-index effectively captures both perplexity and stereotype propensity

**Low Confidence Claims:**
- The specific implementation details of biaser replacement and content morphism
- The effectiveness of the augmentation method on larger, more diverse datasets
- The generalizability of results beyond the specific government/military domain

## Next Checks

1. **Implement and validate biaser replacement semantics**: Create a controlled experiment where human evaluators assess whether augmented text entries preserve semantic meaning after biaser substitution. Test with different biaser sets (small vs. large, semantically close vs. distant) to identify conditions under which augmentation succeeds or fails.

2. **External benchmark validation**: Apply the augmentation method to a publicly available dataset (e.g., Wikipedia, news articles) and evaluate model bias using established external benchmarks like StereoSet or CrowS-Pairs. Compare mb-index results with these external measures to validate the internal metrics.

3. **Scaling study**: Systematically increase dataset size and diversity (starting from the 10-50 element samples to 100-1000 elements) while monitoring db-index reduction and mb-index improvement. This will reveal whether the method scales effectively and identify any saturation points or diminishing returns.
