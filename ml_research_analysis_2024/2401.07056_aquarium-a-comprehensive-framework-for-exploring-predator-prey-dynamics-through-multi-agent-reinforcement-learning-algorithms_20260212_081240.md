# Aquarium: A Comprehensive Framework for Exploring Predator-Prey Dynamics through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2401.07056
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07056
- Reference count: 11
- Primary Result: Aquarium enables studying emergent behaviors in predator-prey scenarios using multi-agent RL

## Executive Summary
Aquarium is a customizable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning environment designed specifically for predator-prey scenarios. The framework features physics-based agent movement, collision detection, field-of-view perception, and seamless integration with the PettingZoo framework. It provides researchers with a flexible platform to study emergent behaviors such as swarming and group hunting dynamics in artificial ecosystems.

The framework demonstrates practical utility through experiments using PPO algorithms, where Parameter Sharing significantly outperforms Individual Learning in coordination and sample-efficiency. These results show agents learning collective movement strategies to evade predators, establishing Aquarium as a valuable tool for exploring multi-agent dynamics and population modeling.

## Method Summary
Aquarium implements a customizable multi-agent environment built around predator-prey dynamics with physics-based agent movement and collision detection. The framework incorporates field-of-view perception systems and integrates with the PettingZoo multi-agent RL library. Agents can be trained using various algorithms, with experiments demonstrating PPO-based training comparing Parameter Sharing against Individual Learning approaches.

The environment captures key metrics including rewards and captures to evaluate performance across different training strategies. The system allows for studying collective phenomena and emergent behaviors through adjustable parameters and scenario configurations, making it suitable for research into population dynamics and coordinated multi-agent systems.

## Key Results
- Parameter Sharing significantly improves coordination and sample-efficiency compared to Individual Learning
- Agents learn to move collectively in the same direction to evade predators
- Parameter Sharing outperforms Individual Learning and random behavior, though still below heuristic baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)
Aquarium's effectiveness stems from its physics-based simulation combined with multi-agent reinforcement learning. The physics engine provides realistic movement constraints and collision dynamics that create meaningful challenges for agents to overcome. Field-of-view perception systems enable agents to make spatially-aware decisions based on local observations of their environment.

The Parameter Sharing approach works by allowing agents to share policy parameters, which enables rapid coordination learning as all agents benefit from collective experience. This contrasts with Individual Learning where each agent must independently discover optimal strategies. The shared parameters create a natural mechanism for emergent collective behaviors like coordinated movement and group hunting strategies to develop through training.

## Foundational Learning
- Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Essential for training multiple agents that can interact and learn from each other in shared environments
- Physics-based Simulation: Provides realistic constraints and dynamics that create meaningful learning challenges
- Field-of-View Perception: Enables agents to make decisions based on local spatial information, critical for predator-prey interactions
- Parameter Sharing: Allows agents to coordinate more effectively by sharing learned strategies across the population
- Emergent Behavior: Understanding how complex group behaviors can arise from simple individual rules and interactions
- Collective Intelligence: How groups of agents can solve problems more effectively than individuals through coordination

## Architecture Onboarding

Component Map:
Physics Engine -> Collision Detection -> Field-of-View Perception -> Agent Policy -> Reward System -> PPO Trainer

Critical Path:
Environment Setup -> Agent Initialization -> Physics Step -> Perception Update -> Policy Action Selection -> Reward Calculation -> Training Update

Design Tradeoffs:
- Physics realism vs. computational efficiency: More realistic physics provides better learning signals but increases computational cost
- Field-of-view complexity vs. learning speed: Detailed perception enables better decisions but requires more training data
- Parameter Sharing vs. Individual Learning: Sharing enables faster coordination but may limit individual specialization
- Environment complexity vs. experimental reproducibility: More complex scenarios enable richer behaviors but are harder to reproduce

Failure Signatures:
- Agents failing to coordinate: Often indicates insufficient parameter sharing or poor reward shaping
- Simulation instability: Usually caused by physics parameter misconfiguration or numerical instability
- Poor learning progress: May result from inadequate exploration strategies or suboptimal hyperparameters
- Memory issues: Can occur with large agent populations or complex environment states

First 3 Experiments:
1. Basic predator-prey scenario with fixed agent counts to validate core physics and collision systems
2. Parameter Sharing vs Individual Learning comparison using simple PPO training
3. Field-of-view sensitivity analysis to determine optimal perception range for coordination
