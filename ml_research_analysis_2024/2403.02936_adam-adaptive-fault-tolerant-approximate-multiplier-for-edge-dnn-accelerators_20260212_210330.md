# AdAM: Adaptive Fault-Tolerant Approximate Multiplier for Edge DNN Accelerators

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.02936
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02936
- Reference count: 21
- Key outcome: AdAM provides TMR-level reliability with 63.54% less area and 39.06% lower PDP

## Executive Summary
AdAM introduces an adaptive fault-tolerant approximate multiplier for edge DNN accelerators, combining Mitchell-based approximation with LOD-driven fault detection and mitigation. By selectively duplicating and comparing bits in the adder based on input leading one positions, AdAM achieves high reliability without full TMR overhead. The design is implemented in 45 nm technology and tested on LeNet-5, AlexNet, and VGG-16, showing negligible accuracy loss while providing near-TMR reliability.

## Method Summary
AdAM is a fault-tolerant approximate multiplier that uses a Mitchell logarithm-based approach with an adaptive adder. The adaptive adder selectively duplicates and compares the most significant bits (MSBs) of the truncated mantissa based on the leading one detector (LOD) value of the inputs. When a mismatch is detected, faulty bits are forced to zero. The design is synthesized in 45 nm technology and integrated into DNN accelerators, with reliability assessed through fault injection experiments.

## Key Results
- Provides reliability close to TMR with 63.54% less area and 39.06% lower PDP
- Negligible accuracy impact on LeNet-5, AlexNet, and VGG-16 DNNs
- Single-bit fault coverage of 98.4% in systolic array implementations

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: LOD-based bit duplication enables fault detection without doubling adder area.
- Mechanism: The LOD determines which MSBs to duplicate and compare; faulty bits are zeroed upon mismatch.
- Core assumption: Faults are detectable through bit-level mismatch in duplicated MSBs; zeroing faulty bits has negligible DNN impact.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract], [section III], [corpus] Weak.
- Break condition: If LOD truncation discards essential bits or zeroing causes significant accuracy loss.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Combined approximation and fault tolerance yield negligible accuracy loss.
- Mechanism: Mitchell approximation error and selective fault protection are jointly tuned to remain within DNN error resilience.
- Core assumption: DNNs are robust to both approximation and transient errors.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract], [section IV-C], [corpus] Weak.
- Break condition: If combined errors exceed DNN tolerance, causing accuracy drop.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: AdAM achieves TMR-level reliability with much less area and PDP.
- Mechanism: Selective duplication of critical bits plus majority voting provides high fault coverage without full TMR.
- Core assumption: Protecting only MSBs is sufficient for high fault coverage; majority voter corrects single-bit faults.
- Evidence anchors: [abstract], [section IV-D], [corpus] Weak.
- Break condition: If faults occur outside protected range or majority voter cannot resolve multiple faults.

## Foundational Learning

- **Concept**: Leading One Detector (LOD) and its role in logarithm-based multiplication.
  - Why needed here: LOD determines characteristic and guides truncation and fault protection.
  - Quick check question: What is the LOD value of binary 00101101, and how many mantissa bits remain after truncation?

- **Concept**: Mitchell multiplier and approximate logarithm-based multiplication.
  - Why needed here: AdAM is a variant; understanding its error is key to tuning the adaptive adder.
  - Quick check question: In a Mitchell multiplier with n=8 bits, if both operands have LOD=6, how many mantissa bits are truncated?

- **Concept**: Systolic array architecture and MAC unit faults.
  - Why needed here: Reliability is assessed via fault injection in systolic array MAC units.
  - Quick check question: In a systolic array, what is the difference between single-bit and multi-bit fault models in terms of fault coverage?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: LOD circuit → Truncation unit → Adaptive adder (with duplication and comparison) → Majority voter → Antilogarithm unit
- **Critical path**: LOD → Truncation → Adaptive adder (with duplication and comparison) → Majority voter → Antilogarithm. The adaptive adder's fault detection adds minimal delay due to selective duplication.
- **Design tradeoffs**:
  - Accuracy vs. fault coverage: Higher LOD allows more bits to be protected but increases truncation error.
  - Area vs. reliability: Selective duplication saves area compared to full TMR but may miss some faults.
  - Truncation level vs. multiplier efficiency: More truncation reduces hardware cost but increases approximation error.
- **Failure signatures**:
  - If fault coverage is low, check LOD-based protection logic and duplication range.
  - If accuracy drops significantly, verify truncation and mantissa protection alignment.
  - If area or power is higher than expected, review duplication logic and majority voter overhead.
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Synthesize and simulate AdAM with random single-bit faults; verify fault detection and mitigation rates.
  2. Compare AdAM accuracy against exact and approximate multipliers on LeNet-5 with MNIST.
  3. Perform PDP and area analysis vs. TMR-protected exact multiplier on 45 nm technology.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the fault tolerance performance of AdAM scale when applied to DNNs with larger and more complex architectures beyond VGG-16 and AlexNet?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper tests AdAM on LeNet-5, AlexNet, and VGG-16, but does not explore larger or more complex DNN architectures.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on demonstrating AdAM's effectiveness on common benchmark networks. Scaling to larger networks may introduce new challenges in fault detection and mitigation.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing AdAM's fault tolerance performance on larger DNNs like ResNet, DenseNet, or networks with more layers and parameters.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of AdAM on the inference latency and throughput of DNN accelerators, especially in real-time applications?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses power-delay product (PDP) but does not provide specific latency or throughput measurements for AdAM.
- Why unresolved: While AdAM improves reliability, its effect on inference speed is crucial for real-time applications. The adaptive adder and fault detection mechanisms may introduce additional latency.
- What evidence would resolve it: Detailed latency and throughput measurements of AdAM compared to exact multipliers in various DNN accelerators under different workloads.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does AdAM perform under different types of soft errors, such as those caused by radiation-induced single-event upsets (SEUs) or multiple-bit upsets (MBUs)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper uses a single-bit fault injection model for reliability testing but does not explore other types of soft errors.
- Why unresolved: The single-bit fault model may not fully capture the range of soft errors encountered in real-world scenarios. Different error types may have varying impacts on AdAM's fault tolerance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Reliability analysis of AdAM under different soft error models, including SEUs, MBUs, and transient faults, with corresponding fault coverage and accuracy metrics.

## Limitations

- Exact implementation details of the ADAPT fault injection framework are not provided, making faithful reproduction difficult.
- The adaptive adder's selective duplication logic is not fully specified, requiring assumptions for implementation.
- The relationship between LOD-based truncation and DNN accuracy impact is not validated across diverse network architectures.

## Confidence

- **High**: Area and power-delay product improvements vs. TMR (empirically measured)
- **Medium**: Reliability improvement claims (based on simulation framework)
- **Medium**: Negligible accuracy impact (dependent on specific DNN configurations)

## Next Checks

1. Implement a testbench to verify the adaptive adder's fault detection and mitigation logic across all possible LOD values and input combinations.
2. Perform cross-validation of DNN accuracy using the proposed multiplier on a held-out network architecture not mentioned in the paper (e.g., ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10).
3. Conduct a sensitivity analysis on the mantissa truncation length (t) to determine its impact on both accuracy and fault coverage.
