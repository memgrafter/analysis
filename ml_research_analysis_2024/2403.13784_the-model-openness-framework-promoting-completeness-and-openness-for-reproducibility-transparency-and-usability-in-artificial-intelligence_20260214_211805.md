# The Model Openness Framework: Promoting Completeness and Openness for Reproducibility, Transparency, and Usability in Artificial Intelligence

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.13784
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13784
- Reference count: 40
- Primary result: Introduces a three-tier classification system for ML models based on completeness and openness requirements

## Executive Summary
The Model Openness Framework (MOF) establishes a structured approach to evaluating machine learning models based on their completeness and openness. The framework defines 16 specific components across code, data, and documentation that must be released under appropriate open licenses to achieve classification. By providing clear requirements and a user-friendly evaluation tool, the MOF aims to prevent "openwashing" while promoting reproducibility and transparency in AI research.

## Method Summary
The MOF introduces a three-tiered ranked classification system (Class III-OpenModel, Class II-OpenTooling, Class I-OpenScience) that evaluates ML models based on completeness and openness. The framework identifies 16 components spanning the model development lifecycle, each mapped to specific open license requirements. A Model Openness Tool (MOT) automates classification by checking for required components and license compliance. Models are classified based on which tiers of components they fulfill, with higher tiers requiring more comprehensive artifact sharing.

## Key Results
- Provides a systematic framework for classifying model openness and completeness through 16 defined components
- Introduces MOT tool for automated model evaluation against MOF criteria
- Establishes clear licensing requirements to prevent misleading "open" claims while promoting reproducibility

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The MOF enables objective classification of model openness and completeness through a three-tier system with 16 explicitly defined components.
- Mechanism: The framework maps each component of the ML model development lifecycle (data, code, documentation) to specific openness requirements, ensuring systematic evaluation rather than subjective judgment.
- Core assumption: All relevant components of model development can be identified and categorized into discrete, evaluable elements.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "a three-tiered ranked classification system that rates machine learning models based on their completeness and openness"
  - [section]: "The framework has 16 components to fulfill completeness of model artifacts, which cover the code, data, and documentation that are part of a typical model development lifecycle"
- Break condition: If a critical component is missing from the framework's enumeration or if the component boundaries are ambiguous, the classification system would become inconsistent.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The MOF prevents "openwashing" by requiring actual open licenses rather than just claiming openness.
- Mechanism: By specifying acceptable open licenses for each component type (open-source licenses for code, open-data licenses for datasets, etc.) and requiring their use for classification, the framework creates enforceable standards.
- Core assumption: License compliance can be verified and that license types map cleanly to content types.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "guide researchers and developers in providing all model components under permissive licenses"
  - [section]: "Each component is categorized into a domain of either Data, Model, or both. The content type of each component is also classified as data, code, or documentation. Finally, we specify standard open licenses that should be used for releasing that component"
- Break condition: If license verification mechanisms are inadequate or if license categories overlap in ways that create ambiguity, the framework cannot effectively prevent misleading claims.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The MOF promotes reproducibility by requiring the release of complete development artifacts.
- Mechanism: By mandating the release of training code, evaluation code, datasets, model parameters, and intermediate checkpoints, the framework ensures others can recreate and validate model results.
- Core assumption: Complete artifact release enables full reproducibility without requiring proprietary knowledge or infrastructure.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract]: "The MOF requires specific components of the model development lifecycle to be released under open licenses"
  - [section]: "Completeness is the principle of releasing all key artifacts produced during the full lifecycle of conducting research or engineering a technical product to enable comprehensive transparency, inspection, evaluation, and reproducibility"
- Break condition: If some components are technically infeasible to share (e.g., privacy-sensitive data) or if the framework doesn't account for proprietary dependencies, reproducibility claims would be invalid.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Open source licensing vs. open data licensing
  - Why needed here: The MOF distinguishes between code artifacts (requiring OSI-approved licenses) and data artifacts (requiring open-data licenses like CC-BY or CDLA), which is critical for proper component classification
  - Quick check question: Can you explain why model parameters require an open-data license rather than an open-source license?

- Concept: Reproducibility in ML research
  - Why needed here: The framework's completeness requirements are built on the principle that releasing all development artifacts enables independent verification and replication of results
  - Quick check question: What specific artifacts would you need to release to enable someone to reproduce your model training process?

- Concept: Model development lifecycle components
  - Why needed here: Understanding the 16 components (datasets, preprocessing code, model architecture, etc.) is essential for correctly applying the MOF classification system
  - Quick check question: Can you list all 16 components that the MOF requires for classification?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - Core framework: Three-tier classification system (Class I, II, III) with ascending completeness requirements
  - Component registry: 16 defined artifacts spanning code, data, and documentation
  - License mapping: Table linking each component to acceptable open licenses
  - Implementation tool: Model Openness Tool (MOT) for automated classification
  - Badge system: Visual indicators of classification level for community recognition

- Critical path:
  1. Inventory all model development artifacts
  2. Map artifacts to MOF components
  3. Verify licenses meet MOF requirements
  4. Generate MOF.JSON configuration file
  5. Self-assert classification level
  6. Obtain badge through MOT verification

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Binary vs. gradient openness: The framework uses a tiered system but treats openness as binary (either meets license requirements or doesn't)
  - Standardization vs. flexibility: Prescribes specific components but allows some variation in implementation details
  - Community trust vs. verification: Relies on self-reporting with community dispute mechanisms rather than centralized authority

- Failure signatures:
  - Inconsistent component mapping leading to incorrect classification
  - License verification failures due to SPDX identifier mismatches
  - Missing critical artifacts that prevent reproducibility claims
  - Community disputes over classification accuracy

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Take a simple model (e.g., MNIST classifier) and manually classify it using the MOF criteria, documenting each step and any challenges encountered
  2. Use the MOT tool to classify the same model and compare results with manual classification
  3. Create a modified version of the model that removes one critical component and verify it drops to a lower MOF class

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How can the Model Openness Framework be adapted to evaluate models that use reinforcement learning, given the paper's acknowledgment that it doesn't translate well to all aspects of reinforcement learning?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "The framework is applicable to classical ML but does not entirely translate well to all aspects of reinforcement learning."
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges this limitation but does not provide specific guidance on how to adapt the MOF for reinforcement learning models.
- What evidence would resolve it: A detailed proposal or guidelines on how to extend the MOF to cover reinforcement learning models, including any necessary modifications to the 16 components or the classification system.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What specific mechanisms or incentives could be implemented to encourage model producers who are reluctant to share their work publicly without restrictions to adopt the Model Openness Framework?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper mentions that "Requires convincing model producers who may be reluctant to share their work publicly without restrictions initially," indicating this as a known limitation.
- Why unresolved: The paper identifies this as a challenge but does not provide concrete solutions or incentives to address this reluctance.
- What evidence would resolve it: Case studies or pilot programs demonstrating successful adoption of the MOF by initially reluctant model producers, along with identified incentives or mechanisms that facilitated this adoption.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the Model Openness Framework balance the goals of openness with the need to protect privacy, intellectual property, institutional policies, and commercialization pressures?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper states that "Openness goals must be balanced with privacy, IP, institutional policies, and commercialization pressures."
- Why unresolved: While the paper acknowledges this as a challenge, it does not provide specific strategies or guidelines for balancing these competing interests.
- What evidence would resolve it: A set of best practices or guidelines that demonstrate how model producers can implement the MOF while addressing privacy concerns, protecting intellectual property, complying with institutional policies, and managing commercialization pressures.

## Limitations

- Relies on self-reporting and community enforcement rather than centralized verification mechanisms
- Does not fully address challenges of applying framework to reinforcement learning models
- May conflict with privacy regulations, IP constraints, and commercialization requirements

## Confidence

- High confidence: The framework's basic structure (three-tier system, 16 components, license mapping) is well-defined and technically sound
- Medium confidence: The framework's ability to prevent "openwashing" through license requirements, assuming proper verification mechanisms exist
- Low confidence: The framework's scalability and effectiveness in diverse real-world scenarios, particularly regarding privacy-sensitive data and proprietary dependencies

## Next Checks

1. Conduct a systematic audit of 10-15 publicly available ML models using the MOF criteria to identify common gaps and compliance challenges
2. Test the MOT tool's classification accuracy by having multiple independent reviewers evaluate the same models and comparing results for consistency
3. Interview ML researchers and practitioners to assess practical barriers to achieving higher MOF classifications and gather suggestions for framework improvements
