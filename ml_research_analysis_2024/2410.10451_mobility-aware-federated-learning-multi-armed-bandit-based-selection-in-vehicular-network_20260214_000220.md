# Mobility-Aware Federated Learning: Multi-Armed Bandit Based Selection in Vehicular Network

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.10451
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10451
- Reference count: 13
- Primary result: Achieves approximately 28% faster convergence compared to baseline methods in vehicular federated learning

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the vehicle selection problem in federated learning for vehicular networks where vehicles drive through road segments. The authors propose a mobility-aware federated learning scheme that uses a multi-armed bandit algorithm to select vehicles for model training based on both training loss and delay considerations. The key innovation is utilizing a real-time successful training participation ratio to guide vehicle selection decisions, which accounts for vehicle mobility patterns and their impact on convergence speed.

## Method Summary
The method involves simulating vehicle mobility through road segments where vehicles participate in federated learning rounds. A multi-armed bandit-based selection algorithm using upper confidence bound (UCB) policy selects vehicles based on their expected utility, balancing training loss reduction and communication delay. The successful training participation ratio, calculated as the proportion of vehicles that remain within base station coverage during training, directly influences the convergence speed. The scheme implements OFDMA for uplink transmission and uses weighted parameter aggregation for global model updates.

## Key Results
- Achieves approximately 28% faster convergence compared to baseline methods
- Shows 23-50% faster training delays for CIFAR-10 dataset compared to communication-based and remain-time based selection algorithms
- Demonstrates 32% faster training for GTSRB dataset
- Proves theoretically that vehicle mobility significantly influences convergence through the participation ratio metric

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
The successful training participation ratio \( p_r \) directly influences convergence speed by controlling the effective number of contributing model updates per round. Vehicles that remain within BS coverage during the local training epoch successfully upload their model updates, contributing to global aggregation. The ratio \( p_r = |N_r| / |S_r| \) scales the aggregated gradient, reducing variance when \( p_r \) is high and causing stagnation when \( p_r \) is low.

### Mechanism 2
The multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithm balances exploitation of high-performing vehicles with exploration of new vehicles to optimize the utility function. UCB scores combine the discounted empirical average utility \( \bar{\Phi}_r(\lambda, a_r^k) \) and an exploration bonus \( c_k(\lambda, a_r^k) \) to select vehicles that maximize the trade-off between training loss reduction and delay minimization.

### Mechanism 3
Orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) uplink transmission rate adaptation ensures fair bandwidth allocation and minimizes communication delay. The uplink rate \( q_r^k \) is computed based on allocated bandwidth \( B_k \), transmission power \( P_k \), channel gain \( h_k \), and path loss, with bandwidth per vehicle adapting to the number of selected vehicles.

## Foundational Learning

- **Federated Learning (FL) in vehicular networks**: Understanding distributed model training without centralizing data is crucial for grasping the vehicle selection problem and its impact on convergence.
  - Quick check question: What is the main advantage of FL over traditional centralized training in vehicular networks?

- **Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms**: The vehicle selection strategy relies on MAB to balance exploitation and exploration, directly affecting the utility function optimization.
  - Quick check question: How does the UCB policy in MAB differ from a purely greedy selection strategy?

- **Convergence analysis of FL algorithms**: The paper's theoretical contribution hinges on proving how vehicle mobility affects convergence through the participation ratio.
  - Quick check question: What role does the Lipschitz smoothness assumption play in FL convergence proofs?

## Architecture Onboarding

- **Component map**: Base Station (BS) with server -> vehicular clients -> uplink/downlink channels -> MAB-based selection module -> model aggregation module
- **Critical path**: Vehicle selection → Model distribution → Local training → Model uploading → Aggregation → Next round
- **Design tradeoffs**: Exploitation vs. exploration in MAB selection, communication delay vs. training accuracy, vehicle coverage vs. model contribution
- **Failure signatures**: Low participation ratio \( p_r \), high variance in aggregated gradients, suboptimal bandwidth allocation leading to communication bottlenecks
- **First 3 experiments**:
  1. Baseline comparison: Run the proposed algorithm against CBS, RBS, and Random selection on CIFAR-10 dataset with 60 km/h velocity to verify the 28% faster convergence claim.
  2. Sensitivity analysis: Vary the discount factor \( \lambda \) in the MAB algorithm to observe its impact on exploitation vs. exploration balance.
  3. Mobility impact: Test the algorithm with different vehicle velocities (e.g., 40 km/h, 80 km/h) to quantify the effect of mobility on participation ratio and convergence speed.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
How does the discount factor λ in the UCB index affect the trade-off between exploitation and exploration in vehicle selection over time?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions using a discount factor λ to measure the importance of recent choices in the MAB-based vehicle selection algorithm
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't provide empirical results showing how different values of λ impact the convergence speed and training performance
- What evidence would resolve it: Simulation results comparing performance with different λ values (e.g., 0.1, 0.5, 0.9) across various traffic scenarios

### Open Question 2
What is the impact of varying vehicle density and velocity distributions on the proposed mobility-aware federated learning scheme's performance?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions vehicle mobility affects the successful training participation ratio but doesn't extensively analyze different traffic patterns
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on a single road segment with specific velocity parameters but doesn't explore how different traffic densities or distributions affect performance
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative simulations across different vehicle density scenarios and heterogeneous velocity distributions

### Open Question 3
How does the proposed scheme perform when vehicles have heterogeneous computing capabilities and non-IID data distributions?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions this as future work: "we will explore the proposed scheme for vehicles with computing and data heterogeneity"
- Why unresolved: The paper assumes homogeneous vehicles with identical data distributions for simplicity
- What evidence would resolve it: Extended simulations incorporating varying GPU frequencies and non-IID data distributions across vehicles

## Limitations
- The successful training participation ratio calculation assumes predictable vehicle movement within a single round, but sudden traffic events could invalidate this assumption
- Performance claims rely heavily on simulated mobility patterns that may not fully capture real-world vehicular dynamics
- Theoretical convergence analysis provides bounds but does not account for practical factors like packet loss or device heterogeneity

## Confidence

- **High Confidence**: The mechanism linking successful training participation ratio to convergence speed is theoretically sound and supported by the convergence analysis.
- **Medium Confidence**: The specific performance improvement metrics are based on simulation results that depend on chosen parameter values and mobility patterns.
- **Low Confidence**: The generalizability of results to different vehicular environments and real-world deployment scenarios remains unverified.

## Next Checks
1. **Sensitivity Analysis on Mobility Patterns**: Test the algorithm with varying vehicle density distributions, random mobility disruptions, and different road segment lengths to assess robustness beyond the controlled simulations.
2. **Real-World Dataset Validation**: Implement the scheme using actual vehicular mobility traces from real-world datasets (e.g., SUMO simulations or GPS trajectory data) to validate performance claims under realistic conditions.
3. **Cross-Platform Performance Verification**: Deploy the algorithm across heterogeneous vehicular devices with varying computational capabilities to verify that the performance improvements hold when accounting for device heterogeneity and energy constraints.
