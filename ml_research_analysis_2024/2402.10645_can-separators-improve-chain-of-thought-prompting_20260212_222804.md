# Can Separators Improve Chain-of-Thought Prompting?

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2402.10645
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10645
- Reference count: 38
- One-line primary result: COT-SEP significantly improves LLM performance on reasoning benchmarks by adding strategic separators to Chain-of-Thought prompting.

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces COT-SEP, a method that strategically employs separators (e.g., triple newlines, ###, or <br>) at the end of each exemplar in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. The motivation is to reduce cognitive overload in large language models (LLMs) caused by densely structured few-shot exemplars. COT-SEP aims to improve LLM comprehension and reasoning by segmenting information into manageable portions, similar to how humans use visual breaks for better readability. Experiments on arithmetic reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K, AQuA) and a commonsense reasoning benchmark (CSQA) show that COT-SEP significantly improves LLM performance compared to vanilla CoT.

## Method Summary
COT-SEP strategically places separators (e.g., triple newlines \n\n\n, ###, <br>) at the end of each exemplar in Chain-of-Thought prompting to reduce cognitive overload and improve LLM comprehension. The method involves preparing benchmark datasets (GSM8K, AQuA, CSQA), implementing separator insertion after each exemplar using triple newlines as the primary separator, and running experiments with LLMs like GPT-3.5-Turbo to compare accuracy results with vanilla CoT.

## Key Results
- COT-SEP significantly improves LLM performance on reasoning benchmarks compared to vanilla CoT.
- Adding separators increased accuracy by 2.8% on AQuA and 1.3% on GSM8K for GPT-3.5-Turbo.
- The type and location of separators impact performance, with triple newlines (\n\n\n) being the most effective.

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Separators reduce cognitive overload by breaking densely structured exemplars into manageable chunks.
- Mechanism: Visual breaks provided by separators (e.g., triple newlines) allow the model to process each exemplar as a distinct unit, reducing interference between exemplars and improving comprehension.
- Core assumption: Large language models experience "cognitive overload" when presented with densely packed exemplars without visual segmentation, similar to human memory span limitations.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "the densely structured prompt exemplars of CoT may cause the cognitive overload of LLMs"
  - [section] "Inspired by human cognition, the memory span is a fixed number of chunks, and therefore is important to organize the input sequence into chunks"
  - [corpus] Weak evidence - no direct corpus citations confirming cognitive overload in LLMs
- Break condition: If the model architecture changes such that it processes entire prompts as a single continuous stream without sequential token processing, the separator benefit would disappear.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Proper separator placement (after each exemplar vs. between sentences) significantly impacts reasoning performance.
- Mechanism: Placing separators at exemplar boundaries creates clear delineation between reasoning problems, while placing them within exemplars disrupts the logical flow of reasoning steps.
- Core assumption: LLMs parse prompts sequentially and benefit from clear boundaries between distinct reasoning tasks.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "COT-SEP (Unit: Exemplar) outperforms COT-SEP (Unit: Sentence)" and "in the prompt of COT-SEP (Unit: Sentence), the next question and the answer of the previous question appear as a set, making it difficult for not only LLMs but also humans to understand"
  - [section] "The placement of separators is crucial"
  - [corpus] Moderate evidence - the experiment directly compares these placements with measurable performance differences
- Break condition: If the model uses non-sequential attention patterns that can simultaneously attend to all parts of the prompt, the benefit of exemplar-level separation would diminish.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The type of separator matters, with triple newlines being most effective for improving reasoning.
- Mechanism: Different separator types create varying levels of visual and structural distinction, with triple newlines providing optimal separation without introducing noise or confusion.
- Core assumption: LLMs interpret different separator types differently, with some creating better structural boundaries than others.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "Table I shows that although the use of various separators in COT-SEP improves LLM reasoning compared to the vanilla CoT, TripleSkip is the most effective separator for enhancing LLM reasoning for the tested datasets"
  - [section] "Some separators are hurting the accuracy (e.g., inserting <br/> separator after exemplars is not desirable for GSM8K and AQuA datasets)"
  - [corpus] Limited evidence - the paper tests only 5 separator types, suggesting this is an area for further exploration
- Break condition: If the model is trained on data where certain separator types are more common, those separators might perform better regardless of their structural properties.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Chain-of-Thought prompting
  - Why needed here: COT-SEP builds directly on CoT by adding separators to the exemplar structure, so understanding CoT is essential
  - Quick check question: What is the fundamental difference between standard prompting and Chain-of-Thought prompting?

- Concept: In-context learning
  - Why needed here: COT-SEP relies on in-context learning through exemplars, so understanding how LLMs learn from examples without fine-tuning is crucial
  - Quick check question: How does in-context learning differ from traditional fine-tuning approaches?

- Concept: Memory span and chunking in cognitive processing
  - Why needed here: The paper explicitly draws inspiration from human cognition, specifically how chunking improves comprehension by managing cognitive load
  - Quick check question: What is the approximate "magical number" for human working memory capacity that inspired this work?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Input prompt construction with exemplars -> Separator insertion logic -> LLM inference engine -> Output parsing
- Critical path: Prompt construction → Separator insertion → LLM inference → Result evaluation. The separator insertion step is the critical differentiator from vanilla CoT.
- Design tradeoffs: Choosing between different separator types (triple newlines vs. ### vs. HTML tags) involves tradeoffs between visual clarity, compatibility with different LLM architectures, and potential interference with tokenization.
- Failure signatures: Performance degradation when using inappropriate separators (like <br/> in the paper's experiments), or when separators are placed within exemplars rather than between them. Also, no improvement over vanilla CoT when the model architecture doesn't benefit from visual segmentation.
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Compare vanilla CoT vs. COT-SEP with triple newlines on GSM8K to verify the core claim
  2. Test different separator types (TripleSkip, TripleHash, TripleStar, <br>, <br/>) on the same dataset to identify optimal separator
  3. Test separator placement at exemplar vs. sentence level to confirm the importance of boundary placement

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do different separator types (e.g., newline vs. hash vs. star) interact with varying model architectures and training regimes beyond the tested LLMs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper tests multiple separator types (TripleSkip, TripleHash, TripleStar, <br>, <br/>) on GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, and LLaMA-2 7B, showing varying effectiveness.
- Why unresolved: The study focuses on a limited set of models and does not explore interactions with other architectures or training methods.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative experiments across diverse LLM architectures and training regimes, analyzing separator effectiveness and potential interactions.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the underlying mechanism by which separators improve LLM reasoning performance, and can this be quantified or modeled?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper attributes performance gains to reduced cognitive overload and improved comprehension, but does not provide a mechanistic explanation.
- Why unresolved: The study observes performance improvements but lacks a detailed analysis of the cognitive or computational processes involved.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical studies using attention visualization, intermediate token analysis, or cognitive load metrics to quantify the impact of separators on LLM reasoning.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does the effectiveness of COT-SEP scale with increasing prompt complexity, exemplar diversity, or task difficulty?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper tests COT-SEP on arithmetic and commonsense reasoning tasks but does not explore scalability across varying complexity levels.
- Why unresolved: The study uses fixed benchmarks without systematically varying prompt complexity or task difficulty to assess scalability.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experiments varying the number of exemplars, complexity of reasoning steps, and task difficulty, measuring COT-SEP performance relative to vanilla CoT.

## Limitations
- The paper's findings are based on experiments with a limited set of LLM architectures (primarily GPT-3.5-Turbo) and only three benchmark datasets.
- The paper does not investigate potential interactions between separator types and specific tokenization schemes.
- The effectiveness of COT-SEP across different model sizes, architectures, and task domains remains unexplored.

## Confidence
- **High Confidence**: The claim that strategically placed separators improve CoT prompting performance is well-supported by the experimental results across multiple benchmarks (GSM8K, AQuA, CSQA) showing consistent accuracy improvements.
- **Medium Confidence**: The specific mechanism of cognitive overload reduction through visual segmentation is plausible based on cognitive science principles, but direct evidence of this mechanism operating in LLMs is limited to inference patterns rather than neurophysiological data.
- **Medium Confidence**: The assertion that triple newlines are the optimal separator type is supported by the tested examples, but the small sample of separator types (5) suggests this conclusion may not be definitive.

## Next Checks
1. **Cross-architecture validation**: Test COT-SEP across different LLM families (Claude, LLaMA, PaLM) to determine if separator effectiveness is architecture-dependent rather than universal.

2. **Tokenization analysis**: Examine how different separators interact with various tokenization schemes to understand whether improvements stem from visual separation or tokenization artifacts.

3. **Scalability assessment**: Evaluate COT-SEP performance across different prompt lengths and exemplar counts to determine the limits of separator effectiveness and identify potential saturation points.
