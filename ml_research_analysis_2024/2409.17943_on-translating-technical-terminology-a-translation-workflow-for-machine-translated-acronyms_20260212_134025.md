# On Translating Technical Terminology: A Translation Workflow for Machine-Translated Acronyms

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2409.17943
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17943
- Reference count: 3
- Primary result: Proposed method achieves 9.9% increase in agreement and 17.8% increase in verification compared to OpusMT for translating technical acronyms

## Executive Summary
This paper addresses the significant problem of translating technical acronyms in machine translation systems, where current systems like Google Translate and OpusMT achieve agreement rates as low as 54%. The authors propose a novel fact-checking workflow that decomposes acronym translation into four steps: translating the long form, extracting it, generating short form hypotheses using a fine-tuned SciBERT model, and verifying the LF-SF pair against published English sources. The method demonstrates substantial improvements over baseline approaches, showing 9.9% better agreement and 17.8% better verification compared to OpusMT, with a newly created corpus of 437 LF-SF pairs from 13,500 French academic abstracts.

## Method Summary
The method introduces a four-step workflow for translating acronyms that addresses the limitations of end-to-end machine translation systems. First, the long form (LF) is translated from French to English using standard MT systems. Second, a SciBERT model fine-tuned on 1.8M term-acronym pairs generates multiple short form (SF) hypotheses. Third, a search-based thresholding algorithm verifies the LF-SF pair by checking for its presence in at least two published English papers from arXiv and PubMed. If the combination is found, it is considered verified. The approach leverages domain expertise embedded in published literature rather than relying solely on translation algorithms, with the method's effectiveness demonstrated using a new acronym corpus created specifically for this task.

## Key Results
- 9.9% increase in agreement compared to OpusMT
- 17.8% increase in verification compared to OpusMT  
- 8.3% increase in agreement compared to Google Translate
- 13.6% increase in verification compared to Google Translate

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Adding a fact-checking step using search-based thresholding improves acronym translation accuracy by verifying LF-SF pairs in published English sources.
- Mechanism: After translating the long form (LF) from French to English, the method searches for the combination of the translated LF and its short form (SF) in published English papers. If found in at least two sources, the pair is considered verified.
- Core assumption: Domain experts use consistent terminology and acronyms in published literature, so verifying LF-SF pairs against these sources ensures accuracy.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Then, a search-based thresholding algorithm verifies the combination of the technical term and its acronym (LF and short form/SF) in published English articles."
  - [section] "We implement a Boolean retrieval system that contains acronyms extracted from AB3P output on a crawl of arXiv and Pubmed along with the long forms they map to and source paper ID."
  - [corpus] Corpus evidence is weak; the method relies on external corpora (arXiv, PubMed) rather than the acronym corpus created in the paper.
- Break condition: If domain experts do not use consistent terminology in published sources, or if the search corpus does not contain relevant terminology, verification will fail.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Using a fine-tuned SciBERT model to generate SF hypotheses from the translated LF increases the chances of finding the correct SF.
- Mechanism: When the LF-SF pair is not found in published sources, the method generates multiple SF hypotheses using a SciBERT model fine-tuned on 1.8M term-acronym pairs.
- Core assumption: The SciBERT model can learn patterns in technical terminology and generate plausible SF candidates based on the translated LF.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "For the disambiguation of acronyms, we use a SciBERT model that is fine-tuned on 1.8M term-acronym pairs in the target language (English) with these parameters: Adam as the optimizer, an initial learning rate of 2e-5, 1,000 warmup steps, and a weight decay of 0.01."
  - [section] "Step 3 consists of the use of AB3P, an acronym tool that provides LFs in English created by the United States government and contains acronyms from crawls of PubMed and arXiv."
  - [corpus] The method uses external data (AB3P, SciBERT) rather than the acronym corpus created in the paper, so corpus evidence is limited.
- Break condition: If the SciBERT model is not sufficiently fine-tuned on relevant terminology, or if the LF-SF mapping is too complex for the model to learn, hypothesis generation will fail.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Decomposing the translation process into four steps (translate LF, extract LF, generate SF hypotheses, verify) allows for more accurate acronym translation than end-to-end MT systems.
- Mechanism: The method breaks down the acronym translation task into smaller, more manageable steps, each focusing on a specific aspect of the translation process.
- Core assumption: By focusing on the specific task of acronym translation, the method can address the limitations of general MT systems that do not prioritize technical terminology.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We present two main novelties that are based on the translation of acronyms: (1) the introduction of a new corpus made publicly available for others to use and (2) a fact-checking step that is used to verify the combination of a technical term and its acronym (long form (LF) and short form (SF))."
  - [section] "We propose the following novel method for MT that decomposes translation into four high-level steps by taking into account that Google Translate is more successful on LFs than SFs."
  - [corpus] The method uses the acronym corpus created in the paper, which provides evidence for the effectiveness of the approach.
- Break condition: If the decomposition of the translation process introduces errors or inefficiencies, or if the method does not adequately address the limitations of general MT systems, the approach will fail.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Machine Translation (MT) systems and their limitations

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map:
  - French to English MT system (Google Translate, OpusMT) -> LF extraction module -> SciBERT model for SF hypothesis generation -> Search-based verification module (Boolean retrieval system) -> Acronym corpus (created in the paper)

- Critical path:
  1. Translate LF from French to English using MT system
  2. Extract LF from translated text
  3. Generate SF hypotheses using SciBERT model
  4. Verify LF-SF pairs using search-based thresholding algorithm
  5. Return verified LF-SF pairs to user

- Design tradeoffs:
  - Using external MT systems (Google Translate, OpusMT) allows for leveraging existing translation capabilities but may introduce errors or inconsistencies.
  - Generating SF hypotheses using a fine-tuned SciBERT model increases the chances of finding the correct SF but requires additional computational resources and training data.
  - Verifying LF-SF pairs using a search-based thresholding algorithm ensures accuracy but may be limited by the availability and quality of published sources.

- Failure signatures:
  - Incorrect or incomplete LF translations from the MT system
  - SciBERT model failing to generate plausible SF hypotheses
  - Search-based verification algorithm failing to find relevant sources or misclassifying LF-SF pairs
  - Acronym corpus containing errors or inconsistencies

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the MT system's ability to translate LFs accurately, using a small set of known LFs and their correct translations.
  2. Evaluate the SciBERT model's ability to generate plausible SF hypotheses, using a small set of LFs and their correct SFs.
  3. Test the search-based verification algorithm's ability to find relevant sources and classify LF-SF pairs correctly, using a small set of verified LF-SF pairs and their corresponding sources.

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the proposed method perform on languages with significantly different orthography or morphology from English (e.g., Chinese, Japanese)?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors state "The results of applying our method may not transfer to languages that are very different from English in orthography (e.g., Chinese, Japanese) and/or morphology."
- Why unresolved: The authors explicitly acknowledge this limitation but do not provide experimental results for non-Indo-European languages.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing the method's performance on acronym translation tasks for languages with different orthographic and morphological structures.

### Open Question 2
- Question: Can the method be scaled to handle full-text documents rather than just acronym-LF pairs?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The authors mention "Our solution also may not scale to longer texts; the method is based on working with term-acronym pairs and working on a full text would require a pre-processing step to identify term pairs as well as inference time for each acronym."
- Why unresolved: The paper only tests the method on extracted acronym-LF pairs from abstracts, not on full documents.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results demonstrating the method's effectiveness when applied to complete documents, including the performance of any required pre-processing steps.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the impact of using different search engines or threshold values in the fact-checking step?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The authors use a "search-based thresholding algorithm" and mention "We implement a Boolean retrieval system," but do not explore variations in search engines or threshold values.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not compare the proposed method using different search engines or evaluate the sensitivity of results to threshold value changes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative results using different search engines (e.g., Google Scholar, PubMed) and various threshold values to determine optimal settings for acronym verification.

## Limitations
- The method relies heavily on external resources (arXiv, PubMed) for verification, which may not cover all technical domains comprehensively
- The fine-tuning process for the SciBERT model lacks detailed specification, making exact reproduction challenging
- The corpus size (437 LF-SF pairs) is relatively small for evaluating the robustness of the approach across diverse technical domains
