# TeaserGen: Generating Teasers for Long Documentaries

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2410.05586
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05586
- Reference count: 17
- Primary result: TeaserGen outperforms baselines in generating coherent documentary teasers with better narration-visual alignment using a pretraining-based approach

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces DocumentaryNet, a dataset of 1,269 documentary-teaser pairs, and TeaserGen, a two-stage system for generating teasers from long documentaries. TeaserGen first generates teaser narration using a pretrained large language model from documentary transcripts, then selects relevant visual content using either a pretrained language-vision model or a deep sequential model. The system addresses the challenge of creating engaging, story-like teasers that differ from traditional extractive summarization approaches. Objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that TeaserGen produces more coherent and better-aligned teasers compared to baseline models, with the pretraining-based approach showing particular effectiveness for visual content selection.

## Method Summary
TeaserGen is a two-stage system that generates documentary teasers by first creating narration using GPT-4o with specially designed prompts, then selecting visual content to accompany the narration. The narration generation stage divides the documentary transcript into segments and rewrites them into story-like narration with an ending question. For visual selection, two approaches are proposed: TeaserGen-PT uses a pretrained CLIP model with thresholding to select frames based on text-visual correspondence, while TeaserGen-LR uses a transformer model with beam search decoding and a regularization term to reduce repetitiveness. The system is evaluated on the newly created DocumentaryNet dataset using metrics including F1 score, repetitiveness, scene change rate, CLIPScore, and VTGHLS for text-visual correspondence.

## Key Results
- TeaserGen-PT achieves 45.2% F1 score and 9.3% repetitiveness, outperforming baselines and ground truth
- TeaserGen-LR reduces repetitiveness from 10.3% to 8.3% compared to TeaserGen-PT while maintaining comparable F1 score
- Pretraining-based approach (TeaserGen-PT) is more effective at identifying relevant visual content than learning-based models
- Subjective evaluation shows higher coherence scores for TeaserGen outputs compared to baselines

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The pretraining-based approach is more effective at identifying relevant visual content than directly trained deep autoregressive models.
- Mechanism: TeaserGen-PT uses CLIP-ViT-B/32 to measure text-visual correspondence and applies thresholding to select video clips, leveraging rich cross-modal embeddings from pretraining.
- Core assumption: Pretrained language-vision models capture semantically meaningful representations that generalize well to the teaser generation task.
- Evidence anchors: Abstract shows pretraining-based approach outperforms learning-based models; section describes CLIP-ViT-B/32 generating VTGHLS curves; corpus provides weak evidence focused on general video summarization.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: The smoothing mechanism and diffusion prior model effectively reduce repetitiveness and improve language-vision correspondence.
- Mechanism: TeaserGen-LR uses transformer with beam search and regularization term to encourage diverse frame selection, while diffusion prior bridges CLIP text and image embedding spaces.
- Core assumption: Regularization term can effectively penalize repetitive selections and encourage scene changes.
- Evidence anchors: Section describes adding regularization term to decoding algorithm; section explains diffusion prior reduces modality gap; corpus lacks direct evidence for this specific mechanism.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: The narration-centered approach, which generates teaser narration before selecting visuals, is more effective than extractive methods for creating coherent and engaging teasers.
- Mechanism: TeaserGen generates teaser narration using pretrained LLM with prompts, then selects accompanying video clips, ensuring story-like and thought-provoking content.
- Core assumption: Generative models can create more coherent and engaging narrations than extractive methods.
- Evidence anchors: Section describes using GPT-4o to rewrite summarized sentences into story-like narration; section notes extractive models fail due to frequent interviews; corpus provides weak evidence for this specific challenge.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Cross-modal alignment using contrastive learning
  - Why needed here: To measure correspondence between generated narration and video frames, ensuring selected visuals are relevant to content
  - Quick check question: How does VTGHLS score differ from standard CLIPScore, and why is it more suitable for this task?

- Concept: Sequence-to-sequence learning with transformers
  - Why needed here: To learn mapping between narration and visual content, enabling prediction of which frames should accompany each sentence
  - Quick check question: Why does transformer model tend to generate similar output embeddings within sentence, and how does diffusion prior help address this?

- Concept: Beam search with regularization for diverse decoding
  - Why needed here: To prevent model from selecting repetitive frames and encourage scene changes, improving overall coherence and engagement
  - Quick check question: How does regularization term penalize repetitive selections, and what is effect of λ parameter?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Documentary (video, audio, narration) -> LLM narration generation -> Visual content selection (TeaserGen-PT or TeaserGen-LR) -> Teaser (narration audio + selected video clips)

- Critical path: 1. Transcribe documentary narration 2. Generate teaser narration using LLM with prompts 3. Select video clips using TeaserGen-PT or TeaserGen-LR 4. Synthesize narration audio and combine with selected clips

- Design tradeoffs: TeaserGen-PT (pretraining-based) vs. TeaserGen-LR (learning-based) - pretraining-based more effective but may not generalize as well; learning-based requires more data but can be more adaptable. Use of diffusion prior improves diversity and alignment but adds complexity and computational cost. Thresholding vs. learned mapping - thresholding is simpler and more interpretable but may be less flexible than learned mapping.

- Failure signatures: Low F1 score (selected clips don't align well with ground truth teasers), high repetitiveness (selecting same or similar frames repeatedly), high scene change rate (overly fragmented teaser with too many abrupt transitions), low CLIPScore (selected visuals don't correspond well to generated narration).

- First 3 experiments: 1. Ablation study: Compare TeaserGen-PT and TeaserGen-LR on test set to quantify impact of pretraining-based approach 2. Prompt engineering: Experiment with different LLM prompts to generate more coherent and engaging teaser narrations 3. Threshold tuning: Optimize thresholding mechanism in TeaserGen-PT to improve balance between F1 score and scene change rate

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: What are the precise scene change rate (SCR) and repetitiveness values for the ground truth teasers in the DocumentaryNet dataset?
- Basis in paper: The paper states "The estimated SCR of the ground truth teasers is 27.6% by manual inspections on 10 video samples" and "The repetitiveness score computed on the ground truth is 7.86%."
- Why unresolved: The paper only provides approximate values based on manual inspection of a small sample (10 documentaries). The actual dataset likely contains more precise metrics for all 1,269 documentaries.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive analysis of all 1,269 documentaries in the dataset, providing exact SCR and repetitiveness values for each ground truth teaser.

### Open Question 2
- Question: How does the proposed TeaserGen system perform on other types of long-form video content beyond documentaries, such as movies, vlogs, or educational videos?
- Basis in paper: The paper mentions limitations and future work, stating "we only consider documentary teaser generation in this paper due to the scarcity of public datasets for other media" and "we apply our proposed models to other media in a zero-shot setting, including old movies and educational videos."
- Why unresolved: The paper only provides qualitative examples of applying the system to other media types without quantitative evaluation. There is no systematic testing across different video genres.
- What evidence would resolve it: A comprehensive evaluation of TeaserGen's performance on diverse video types (movies, vlogs, educational content, etc.) with quantitative metrics comparable to those used for documentaries.

### Open Question 3
- Question: What is the optimal value of the regularization parameter λ in Equation (1) for balancing repetitiveness and scene change rate in the TeaserGen-LR model?
- Basis in paper: The paper includes an ablation study on λ, testing values of 1, 10, and 100, but concludes "we find that a higher λ can reduce the repetitiveness and lead to a higher F1 score but the difference is not significant."
- Why unresolved: The paper does not identify a clear optimal value for λ, and the differences between tested values were not significant. The optimal balance between repetitiveness and scene change rate may depend on specific documentary characteristics.
- What evidence would resolve it: A more extensive grid search or optimization procedure to find the λ value that maximizes a weighted combination of F1 score, repetitiveness, and scene change rate, potentially with different optimal values for different types of documentaries.

## Limitations

- Dataset bias concerns: DocumentaryNet contains only 1,269 pairs from YouTube documentaries, raising questions about generalizability to other documentary styles or domains
- Objective metric limitations: Metrics like F1, REP, SCR, CLIPScore, and VTGHLS may not fully capture subjective quality of teaser engagement and storytelling effectiveness
- Prompt sensitivity: LLM-generated narration relies heavily on carefully designed prompts that are not fully specified, creating uncertainty about reproducibility

## Confidence

**High confidence**: The overall two-stage architecture (narration generation followed by visual selection) is effective, supported by both objective metrics showing F1 score improvements and subjective evaluation showing higher coherence scores than baselines.

**Medium confidence**: The pretraining-based approach (TeaserGen-PT) outperforms learning-based approaches for visual content selection. While supported by experimental results, the evidence is limited by the small dataset size and lack of ablation studies isolating the pretraining effect.

**Medium confidence**: The smoothing mechanism and diffusion prior effectively reduce repetitiveness and improve language-vision correspondence. The mechanism is described but lacks detailed ablation analysis of each component's contribution.

## Next Checks

1. **Domain transfer validation**: Test TeaserGen on documentary-style content from different domains (e.g., educational videos, news documentaries) to assess generalization beyond the YouTube documentary corpus.

2. **Ablation of pretraining components**: Systematically remove the CLIP pretraining and diffusion prior components to quantify their individual contributions to performance improvements, particularly for the claimed advantage over learning-based approaches.

3. **Prompt sensitivity analysis**: Systematically vary the LLM prompts and measure the impact on both narration quality and downstream visual selection performance to understand the robustness of the system to prompt engineering.
