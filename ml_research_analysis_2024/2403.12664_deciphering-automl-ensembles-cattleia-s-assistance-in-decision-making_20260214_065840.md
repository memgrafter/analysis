# Deciphering AutoML Ensembles: cattleia's Assistance in Decision-Making

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2403.12664
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12664
- Reference count: 37
- Primary result: Web application for interpretable analysis of AutoML ensemble models using metrics, compatimetrics, weights, and XAI perspectives

## Executive Summary
This paper introduces cattleia, a web application designed to address the interpretability gap in AutoML ensemble models. The tool enables users to analyze ensembles created by popular AutoML frameworks (auto-sklearn, AutoGluon, and FLAML) through multiple complementary perspectives. By providing interactive visualizations and analysis tools, cattleia helps users understand ensemble composition, model relationships, and feature importance without requiring deep technical expertise in AutoML internals.

The application introduces compatimetrics as novel measures of model similarity and complementarity, extending traditional validation approaches. These measures quantify how similarly or differently models predict, revealing hidden patterns in ensemble composition. Combined with weight adjustment capabilities and XAI techniques, cattleia offers a comprehensive framework for making informed decisions about ensemble models while maintaining transparency and trust in automated machine learning systems.

## Method Summary
cattleia is a Dash-based web application that processes pre-trained AutoML ensemble models and provides interactive analysis through four distinct perspectives: performance metrics comparison, compatimetrics for model relationship assessment, weight modification for ensemble tuning, and XAI methods for feature importance analysis. The application accepts ensemble models from auto-sklearn, AutoGluon, and FLAML frameworks, calculates predictions, and offers dynamic visualizations that update based on user interactions. Compatimetrics introduce measures like agreement ratio, strong disagreement ratio, and conjunctive RMSE to quantify model diversity and complementarity beyond traditional performance metrics.

## Key Results
- cattleia successfully analyzes ensemble models from three major AutoML frameworks using a unified interface
- Compatimetrics measures reveal model relationships and complementarity patterns that traditional metrics miss
- Interactive weight modification enables real-time exploration of ensemble configurations without retraining
- The tool demonstrates utility in evaluating component models, examining diversity, ensuring fairness, and optimizing weights through case studies

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: The application improves interpretability by offering multiple complementary analysis perspectives on AutoML ensembles.
- Mechanism: cattleia presents ensemble analysis through four distinct tabs—metrics, compatimetrics, weights, and XAI—each addressing a different interpretability challenge. The metrics tab allows direct performance comparison between ensemble and individual models, compatimetrics quantify model diversity and complementarity, the weights tab enables interactive tuning of model contributions, and the XAI tab exposes feature importance patterns. This multi-faceted approach ensures that users can understand ensembles from multiple angles, satisfying different interpretability needs.
- Core assumption: Different aspects of interpretability (performance, diversity, contribution, and feature importance) are best understood through distinct but complementary analytical lenses rather than a single unified view.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "The application provides analysis from four different angles: metrics evaluating individual models and ensemble, compatimetrics examining relationships between models, weights assigned to particular models in the ensemble, and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods assessing the importance of individual variables."
  - [section] "The tabs available represent distinct scopes of ensemble analysis: Metrics encompass a comparison of evaluation metrics of both component models and ensemble..."
- Break condition: If any tab fails to load or provide meaningful analysis, the multi-perspective interpretability advantage is compromised. Additionally, if the compatimetrics measures don't correlate with actual model performance differences, their utility diminishes.

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Compatimetrics introduce novel measures that reveal hidden patterns in model relationships that traditional metrics miss.
- Mechanism: Compatimetrics calculate agreement ratios, strong disagreement ratios, and conjunctive metrics that quantify how similarly or differently models predict. These measures identify groups of models that work well together and detect models that might undermine ensemble performance. By revealing model compatibility patterns, users can make informed decisions about ensemble composition beyond simple performance metrics.
- Core assumption: Model relationships (diversity, complementarity) are better captured by prediction-level agreement/disagreement metrics than by performance metrics alone.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "We extend the validation perspective by introducing new measures to assess the diversity and complementarity of the model predictions."
  - [section] "The compatimetrics tab evaluates the similarity between model predictions, providing valuable insights into model likeness."
- Break condition: If compatimetrics don't correlate with actual ensemble performance improvements when models are added or removed, their value is questionable. If the measures are too sensitive to noise in predictions, they may provide misleading guidance.

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: Interactive weight modification enables users to discover better-performing ensemble configurations without retraining.
- Mechanism: The weight modification tool provides sliders to adjust individual model contributions to the ensemble, with automatic recalculation of performance metrics. This allows users to experiment with different weight distributions to optimize for specific metrics or discover smaller, more efficient ensembles. Users can identify and potentially remove underperforming or redundant models while maintaining or improving performance.
- Core assumption: The optimal ensemble configuration can be discovered through weight adjustment rather than requiring complete retraining with different hyperparameters or model selection.
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "Summarizing obtained insights, we can investigate and adjust the weights with a modification tool to tune the ensemble in the desired way."
  - [section] "The weight modification tool allows users to analyze and experiment with the weight distribution among models within an ensemble..."
- Break condition: If weight adjustments lead to overfitting on the validation set or if the modified ensembles perform significantly worse on truly unseen data, the approach fails. If the tool becomes too slow with large ensembles, usability suffers.

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Ensemble learning fundamentals (bagging, boosting, stacking)
  - Why needed here: Understanding how different ensemble methods create diversity is crucial for interpreting compatimetrics and weight distributions
  - Quick check question: What is the key difference between bagging and boosting in terms of how they create ensemble diversity?

- Concept: Model interpretability techniques (permutation importance, partial dependence plots)
  - Why needed here: These XAI methods are core to the cattleia's feature importance analysis and must be understood to interpret the results correctly
  - Quick check question: How does permutation importance measure feature importance differently from built-in model coefficients?

- Concept: Performance metrics for classification and regression
  - Why needed here: Users must understand metrics like accuracy, RMSE, F1-score to interpret the metrics tab and make informed decisions
  - Quick check question: When would you prefer to use F1-score over accuracy for model evaluation?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: cattleia consists of a Dash frontend providing interactive visualizations, a backend processing pre-trained AutoML models and datasets, and integration modules for auto-sklearn, AutoGluon, and FLAML model formats. The application uses Plotly for visualizations and calculates metrics, compatimetrics, and XAI measures on-demand without retraining models.

- Critical path: User uploads dataset and pre-trained model → cattleia loads model and calculates predictions → user interacts with tabs (metrics, compatimetrics, weights, XAI) → visualizations update dynamically based on user selections and weight modifications.

- Design tradeoffs: cattleia prioritizes interpretability over real-time model training, requiring pre-trained models rather than building them from scratch. This makes the tool faster but less integrated into the AutoML pipeline. The choice of Plotly enables rich interactivity but may limit customization compared to lower-level visualization libraries.

- Failure signatures: If model files fail to load, check format compatibility with supported AutoML frameworks. If visualizations don't update, verify data consistency between model predictions and uploaded dataset. Slow performance typically indicates large datasets or complex ensembles that may benefit from sampling.

- First 3 experiments:
  1. Load a simple binary classification model (e.g., from auto-sklearn) with a small dataset and verify all four tabs display correctly
  2. Test the weight modification tool by adjusting slider values and confirming metric updates in real-time
  3. Compare compatimetrics outputs between two very similar models and two very different models to verify the measures capture expected patterns

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How do the compatimetrics measures perform on very large ensembles with hundreds of models?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper introduces compatimetrics but only demonstrates them on ensembles with 11 models, without discussing scalability to larger ensembles.
- Why unresolved: The paper lacks empirical results on the computational efficiency and effectiveness of compatimetrics for large-scale ensembles.
- What evidence would resolve it: Experimental results showing computation time and effectiveness of compatimetrics for ensembles with 100+ models.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the impact of using different threshold values for Strong Disagreement Ratio (SDR) and Agreement Ratio (AR) on ensemble analysis?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that SDR and AR thresholds can be varied but only uses standard deviation-based thresholds in examples.
- Why unresolved: The paper does not explore how different threshold choices affect the analysis outcomes or provide guidance on threshold selection.
- What evidence would resolve it: Systematic study showing how different threshold values affect compatimetrics and subsequent ensemble analysis decisions.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How does cattleia handle ensembles containing models with different prediction spaces (e.g., probability outputs vs. class labels)?
- Basis in paper: [inferred] The paper discusses ensemble analysis but doesn't address how it handles heterogeneous model outputs within ensembles.
- Why unresolved: The paper doesn't mention how cattleia normalizes or handles different model output formats within the same ensemble.
- What evidence would resolve it: Documentation or examples showing how cattleia processes and visualizes ensembles with mixed model output types.

## Limitations
- The tool requires pre-trained models rather than integrating with AutoML training pipelines, creating a workflow disconnect
- Performance scaling with large ensembles (>50 models) or high-dimensional datasets (>100k samples) has not been documented
- Compatibility with newer versions of auto-sklearn, AutoGluon, and FLAML frameworks remains untested

## Confidence
- High confidence: The metrics tab provides accurate performance calculations for standard regression and classification metrics
- Medium confidence: Compatimetrics measures provide meaningful insights into model relationships, though their correlation with ensemble performance gains requires empirical validation
- Medium confidence: Interactive weight modification produces expected changes in ensemble performance metrics without retraining

## Next Checks
1. Verify compatimetrics correlation: Test whether models identified as highly complementary by compatimetrics actually improve ensemble performance when combined, versus randomly selected model pairs
2. Stress test scalability: Evaluate cattleia's performance and responsiveness with progressively larger ensembles (10, 50, 100+ models) and datasets (10k, 100k, 1M samples)
3. Compare weight optimization: Benchmark cattleia's interactive weight adjustment against systematic hyperparameter optimization approaches for finding optimal ensemble configurations
