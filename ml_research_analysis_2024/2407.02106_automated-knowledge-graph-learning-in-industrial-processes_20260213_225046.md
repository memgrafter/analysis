# Automated Knowledge Graph Learning in Industrial Processes

## Quick Facts
- arXiv ID: 2407.02106
- Source URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02106
- Reference count: 26
- Key outcome: Framework for automated KG generation from industrial time series data combining correlation analysis with Granger causality testing

## Executive Summary
This paper presents a framework for automated knowledge graph generation from industrial time series data. The framework addresses the challenge of extracting meaningful relationships from sensor data in industrial processes by combining correlation analysis with Granger causality testing to identify both contemporary and lagged dependencies between process parameters. When applied to a real-world electrostatic particle transfer process, the resulting KG successfully captured expected causal and correlation dependencies, demonstrating how transforming raw sensor data into structured KGs improves interpretability of industrial processes and supports decision-making for optimization and predictive modeling.

## Method Summary
The framework combines data preprocessing (missing value imputation, categorical encoding), correlation analysis (Pearson, Spearman, Euclidean similarity), and Granger causality testing using modified VAR models with automated time-lag selection. The methodology outputs results in RDF format for SPARQL querying, enabling flexible exploration and reasoning over the generated knowledge graph. The approach specifically addresses the challenge of identifying both instantaneous correlations and lagged causal influences between process parameters in industrial settings.

## Key Results
- Successfully captured expected causal dependencies in electrostatic particle transfer, including electric field parameters influencing coating quality
- Identified bidirectional correlation between funnel width and quality parameters
- Demonstrated effective transformation of raw sensor data into interpretable knowledge graph format
- Framework flexibility allows customization for various research and industrial applications

## Why This Works (Mechanism)

### Mechanism 1
- Claim: Granger causality identifies directional, time-lagged dependencies between sensor variables that correlation analysis alone cannot reveal
- Mechanism: VAR(p) modeling with F-tests determines whether past values of one time series improve prediction of another, capturing both direction and delay
- Core assumption: Stationarity of the underlying time series processes
- Evidence anchors:
  - [abstract] "it employs Granger causality to identify key attributes that can inform the design of predictive models"
  - [section] "Granger causality, originally developed for economic applications [10], is increasingly used in various fields to identify causal-effect relationships between time series data"
  - [corpus] No direct corpus evidence found for Granger causality in industrial KG learning, but strong academic citations exist
- Break condition: Non-stationarity in time series requires differencing, which may invalidate F-test assumptions if all lags are constrained simultaneously

### Mechanism 2
- Claim: Pearson, Spearman, and Euclidean similarity metrics capture different types of contemporary relationships between process parameters
- Mechanism: Multiple correlation measures are applied to identify both linear and monotonic relationships, as well as geometric similarity patterns in the data
- Core assumption: Pearson correlation requires normality of the time series processes
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "We employ several types of correlation metrics, including the following: Pearson Correlation... Spearman Rank Correlation... Euclidean Similarity"
  - [section] "In the first version of the framework, we have decided to add these measures because in our experience they tend to be some of the most useful"
  - [corpus] Weak corpus evidence; most related papers focus on graph-based anomaly detection rather than correlation analysis
- Break condition: If data is non-normal, Pearson correlation results may be misleading

### Mechanism 3
- Claim: RDF format and SPARQL querying enable flexible exploration and reasoning over the generated knowledge graph
- Mechanism: The framework outputs results in RDF format, allowing users to query for specific patterns, threshold-based subgraphs, and infer new knowledge through semantic reasoning
- Core assumption: The structured format supports both visualization and complex query operations
- Evidence anchors:
  - [section] "The framework's flexibility allows for customization and extension, making it suitable for various research and industrial applications"
  - [section] "Representing multi-dimensional time-series data and their correlations/causations in a Knowledge Graph enables efficient and intuitive visualizations and sub-graph filtering using graph-oriented query languages"
  - [corpus] Limited corpus evidence; related papers focus on KG applications but not specifically RDF/SPARQL for industrial time series
- Break condition: If the KG becomes too large, SPARQL query performance may degrade significantly

## Foundational Learning

- Concept: Stationarity testing (Dickey-Fuller test)
  - Why needed here: Granger causality analysis requires stationary time series; non-stationary data must be differenced before analysis
  - Quick check question: What happens to Granger causality test validity when data contains unit roots?

- Concept: Vector Autoregressive (VAR) modeling
  - Why needed here: VAR(p) models are used to test for Granger non-causality by comparing full and constrained models
  - Quick check question: How does the order p in VAR(p) affect the detection of lagged causal relationships?

- Concept: Knowledge Graph representation (RDF, SPARQL)
  - Why needed here: RDF format enables querying and reasoning over the generated relationships between industrial process parameters
  - Quick check question: What types of queries become possible when industrial sensor data is represented as RDF triples?

## Architecture Onboarding

- Component map: Data preprocessing → Correlation analysis (Pearson, Spearman, Euclidean) → Granger causality analysis (VAR modeling with F-tests) → RDF KG generation → SPARQL querying
- Critical path: The most critical sequence is preprocessing (handling missing values, categorical encoding) → correlation analysis → causality analysis → KG generation
- Design tradeoffs: Multiple correlation metrics provide robustness but increase computation time; automated time-lag selection improves usability but may miss domain-specific optimal lags
- Failure signatures: Poor KG quality often stems from inadequate preprocessing (missing values, categorical encoding issues) or violation of stationarity assumptions
- First 3 experiments:
  1. Test the framework on synthetic data with known correlations but no causal relationships to verify correlation analysis works correctly
  2. Create synthetic data with known time-lagged causal dependencies to validate Granger causality detection
  3. Apply the complete pipeline to a small industrial dataset with expert-verified relationships to check end-to-end functionality

## Open Questions the Paper Calls Out

### Open Question 1
- Question: How does the framework handle non-stationary time series data, and what are the implications for Granger causality analysis when differencing is required?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The paper mentions that stationarity is required for Granger causality testing and that the Dickey-Fuller test can be used to check for unit roots, with differencing as a solution for non-stationarity. However, it notes that F-tests used to compute Granger causality can lose asymptotic properties of the chi-squared distribution in the case of differenced data.
- Why unresolved: The paper acknowledges this as an issue but does not provide a solution or discuss the implications for the validity of Granger causality results when differencing is applied.
- What evidence would resolve it: Empirical results showing the performance of the framework on non-stationary data with and without differencing, or a theoretical analysis of how differencing affects the statistical properties of Granger causality tests.

### Open Question 2
- Question: What is the optimal number of time lags (p) for the VAR model in Granger causality analysis, and how does this choice affect the accuracy of the resulting knowledge graph?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The framework uses a modified VAR model approach with automated time-lag selection, but the paper does not discuss how this selection is performed or how the choice of p affects the results.
- Why unresolved: The paper mentions automated time-lag selection but does not explain the methodology or evaluate its impact on the quality of the generated knowledge graph.
- What evidence would resolve it: Comparative analysis showing knowledge graph accuracy with different lag selection methods (e.g., information criteria, cross-validation) or sensitivity analysis of results to different lag values.

### Open Question 3
- Question: How can the framework be extended to handle multivariate sensor measurements that have complex interdependencies beyond pairwise correlations and Granger causality?
- Basis in paper: [explicit] The framework currently uses pairwise correlation analysis and pairwise Granger causality testing, but the paper does not discuss extensions to capture higher-order multivariate relationships.
- Why unresolved: The paper focuses on pairwise relationships and does not explore how the framework might be adapted to capture more complex multivariate dependencies that could exist in industrial processes.
- What evidence would resolve it: Implementation and evaluation of multivariate extensions (e.g., conditional Granger causality, partial correlation networks) and comparison of their performance to the current pairwise approach.

## Limitations
- Stationarity assumption may not hold for many industrial processes with structural breaks or trends
- Automated time-lag selection algorithm lacks detailed specification, potentially leading to suboptimal lag identification
- Framework does not address non-linear causal relationships common in industrial processes

## Confidence

**High Confidence**: Correlation analysis mechanisms (Pearson, Spearman, Euclidean) are well-established statistical methods with predictable behavior and clear failure conditions. RDF/SPARQL integration for knowledge graph representation is also standard practice with documented query capabilities.

**Medium Confidence**: Granger causality implementation using VAR models is theoretically sound, but the automated time-lag selection process introduces uncertainty about optimal parameter choices. Preprocessing methods for handling missing values and categorical data are described at a high level without specific implementation details.

**Low Confidence**: Framework's ability to capture non-linear dependencies and handle non-stationary industrial time series data is not adequately addressed. Real-world validation on electrostatic particle transfer provides limited evidence for generalizability across different industrial domains.

## Next Checks

1. **Stationarity Validation**: Test the framework on industrial time series data with known structural breaks and trends to evaluate how well the stationarity testing and differencing procedures handle real-world data that violates core assumptions.

2. **Time-Lag Selection Evaluation**: Implement the automated time-lag selection algorithm on synthetic data with varying lag structures (short, medium, and long delays) to quantify detection accuracy across different temporal scales.

3. **Cross-Domain Applicability**: Apply the complete framework to at least two additional industrial process datasets from different domains (e.g., chemical processing and manufacturing) to assess generalizability and identify domain-specific limitations.
